            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE lot of no mortal is more enviable than that of the man who, after having by virtuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry acquired a comfortable ſubſiſtence for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his family, now is ſitting down to a frugal ſupper between a beloved wife and a hopeful boy, cheered by the ſweet conſciouſneſs of having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his duty, while his darlings alternately kiſs

the ſweat from his brow and animate him by their ſmiles to innocent hilarity.</p>
                  <p>Do not ſmile contemptuouſly, you obedient ſlaves of female caprice; I am not ſpeaking to you, ye pitiful beings who have no fixed object in view, and have neither a heart nor a ſoul. Do not ſcold, ye duſty pedants whom the ſun of learning has parched up ſo much as to reſemble the diſmal print that figures on the title-page of your worm-eaten books: I am ſpeaking to thee, venerable man, who art faithful to the golden medium; who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hurrieſt from nothing to nothing, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly waſt buried among ruſty folios: for thee, citizen and father, for thee am I going to deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſubſequent picture.</p>
                  <p>Charles Frederick Ortenberg, head maſter of the grammar-ſchool at W**, was ſitting at nine o'clock in the evening at a table oppoſite to a plate of potatoes. Caroline, a gentle and good-natured creature, ſat on one ſide, and William, a lovely boy, who was ſeven years old, whoſe eyes beſpoke a ſound mind, and whoſe roſy cheeks were graced with the ſweet ſmile of innocence, ſat at the other.</p>
                  <p>No ſpice of the Indies diſgraced the home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown potatoes. Freſh butter and ſalt, and, by way ef deſert, a plate full of golden pippins, pealed by Caroline's hands, and ſweetened by Caroline's ſmiles—theſe were the rural dainties which left no wiſh for the temperate palate of the ſmall ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family.</p>
                  <p>The cloth was removed. Ortenberg undreſſed himſelf, while mother and ſon aſſiſted him with cheerful alacrity. William fetched a lighted can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; Ortenberg flung himſelf into an eaſy chair, and emptied his pipe againſt the corner of the ſtove; Caroline faſtened her needle-work to a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble covered with green oil-cloth; William hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gellert's fables under his arm, ſtrove to get
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037761_0004_100ED50C50BFA0D0"/>
upon a chair that ſtood by her ſide, and an old faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful maid-ſervant, the only domeſtic of this humble family, ſat near the ſtove, behind the ſpinning-wheel—This was the ſweet moment in which Ortenberg was wont to enjoy his domeſtic happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, while he converſed with his wife of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs trials through which they had acquired their preſent contentment, and delineated a plan for the education of their little family, which he hoped to ſee ſoon increaſe. Heavens! how panted the heart of the happy parents, when they looked upon William as the ſupport of their old age; how many a ſweet hour was dreamed away in this manner! Deluded mortals! why did fate not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſe your innocent dreams? Why are the joys of this world like the rays of the moon in a wild, tempeſtuous night, when her ſilver orb is eclipſed every moment by the fleeting clouds; like the ſleep of a ſick perſon, who, after a few minutes of reſt, awakes to be tormented by new agonies; like the warm breath of the ſun in April, which melts the ſnow that ſhrouds the early flower, which is on the point of unfolding itſelf with congenial warmth, and is buried in a few hours under the load of a deſtructive ſhower of hail? The humbleſt happineſs remains not unenvied; the moſt ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded contentment is liable to be diſturbed!</p>
                  <p>That evening was, as uſual, deſigned for a ſweet chat of an happy futurity and peaceful old age; when honeſt Conrad ſuddenly ruſhed into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, with a viſible and uncommon anxiety, and gave Ortenberg a ſealed note.</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter with you, honeſt Conrad?" ſaid Ortenberg, caſting an anxious look at his pregnant wife. Conrad would not ſpeak, nor had he the power:—mute, and with wild looks; he pointed at the note and diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:037761_0005_100F047D0D7A12C0"/>
Caroline turned pale; her ſoul forebode mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; her trembling hand dropt her work on the table: ſhe ſtarted up, ſupporting herſelf by her ſon's chair, and gazed with anxious and ſcrutini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing looks at her huſband, who ſtill held the note unopened in his hand.</p>
                  <p>Ortenberg poſſeſſed a great ſhare of firmneſs and preſence of mind. The mute diſtreſs of old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad; his ſtrange and ſudden diſappearance; the manner in which he had delivered the note—a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of which Conrad, hitherto, never had made uſe—all this made him apprehenſive that ſome portentious thunder-cloud was hanging over his head. Caroline's nerves were weak, and ſhe was, beſides, far advanced in her pregnancy. A moſt perplexing ſituation. A ſudden terror would have been mortal poiſon to her.</p>
                  <p>Ortenberg's reſolution was taken. "Command your muſcles," he ſaid to himſelf: "whatever be the contents of the note, let not your countenance betray its purport."</p>
                  <p>"What is the matter, dear Caroline? ſaid he to his wife, when he beheld the paleneſs of her face, and ſaw her hand tremble.</p>
                  <p>"The note—" replied Caroline, ſtammering, (with a forced ſmile).</p>
                  <p>Has then that note ſuch a terrible appearance? (ſupplicating) Dear Caroline, conſider in what a ſituation you are. Is it fit you ſhould tremble at the ruſtling of a leaf?"</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Caroline.</speaker>
                     <p>But Conrad's anxious haſte—</p>

                     <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>
                     <p>Is nothing new to you. Conrad is old; old people are like children, they miſtake a dog for a lion. Do you recollect how much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror his countenance expreſſed laſt autumn, when he came running into the apartment, to tell us that the pear-tree had been robbed?</p>

                     <p>
                        <stage>(ſomewhat vexed)</stage> Dear Ortenberg, you muſt think yourſelf, that the note contains ſome bad news, elſe you would not ſo long have delayed opening it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>"If this be your opinion," replied Ortenberg, with ſeeming tranquillity, "I will open it inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." He recollected the reſolution he had taken, and broke the ſeal. Caroline's ſcrutinizing and portending eyes watched his countenance; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the brow of the reſolute man diſplayed not even a ſingle furrow. Yet he did not act exactly, in that critical moment, as he, perhaps, ought to have done. My readers ſhall know in proper time, what the miſterious note contained. The lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequences of this note, or rather the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which Ortenberg conducted himſelf on this occaſion, will, perhaps, irritate many of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt him. However, we ought never to judge of an action, which was committed in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation which we have never experienced. Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg's life depended in ſome degree on this note; Caroline's life was as dear to him as his own; the inſtinct of ſelf-preſervation and fervent love came, in colliſion; Ortenberg wanted to ſatisfy both, wanted to ſave himſelf, and to ſpare his wife; two objects, which to attain jointly was very difficult, or, perhaps, impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>"What o'clock is it?" he ſaid, after he had read the note, looking at his watch. "Half an hour paſt nine o'clock. I muſt go out." He pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off his night-gown, and wrapped himſelf in a grey roquelor.</p>
                  <p>"For God's ſake!" exclaimed Caroline; "what means all this?"</p>
                  <p>Ortenberg was ſilent.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037761_0007_100F0481098E4DE8"/>
have I not frequently participated in your ſorrows and diſtreſs? have the misfortunes of your young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er years not enured me to ſufferings? Ortenberg, your heart urges you to ſpeak, I ſee it by the working of your muſcles, but fear to terrify me prevents you.</p>

                     <p>You want to ſpare me, and do not conſider that our imagination heightens the danger the more, the leſs we can gueſs the real object of our misfortune. You torment me! the misfortune which you conceal from me, cannot be half ſo dreadful as my apprehenſion repreſents it.</p>

                     <p>How can you talk of misfortunes? You are very ſingular, dear Caroline; be eaſy! the note concerns old Conrad. He conjures me to keep its contents ſecret, and Caroline has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, always been ſo diſcreet as to wring no ſecrets from me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p>Having ſaid this, he went to his ſtudy, where he threw himſelf down upon his knees, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored God to give him courage and firmneſs, put ſome Frederic-d'ors in his purſe, and went down ſtairs again to fetch his hat and cane. Caroline, who had been intimidated by his last reply, and ſeriouſly began to believe that the whole affair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned only old Conrad, ſurveyed him ſilently. He ſtill maintained the victory, but—when he was going—to quit, perhpas for ever his pregnant wife and a helpleſs child—to leave them without aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and abandon them to the power of a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous villain of rank—nature ſuddenly conqured. He took the bruſh from the harpſichord, bruſhing his hat thrice, to gain time to try whether it would not be poſſible for him to regain his fortitude. But alas! he tried in vain! breathed with difficulty; a ſigh eſcaped his breath, and Caroline's anxiety
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037761_0008_100F0483EEB8D890"/>
returned with aditional force. He croſſed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment ſeveral times; Caroline's perplexed eyes followed his ſteps. He was ſilent; Caroline was ſilent—a dreadful ſtillneſs! He half opened the door; he felt as if he were going from his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the grave; his recollection forſook him. He ruſhed ſuddenly into the arms of his wife; a torrent of tears, which he had in vain endeavoured to reſtrain, broke from his eyes. "Farewel, my Caroline!" was all he was able to utter; but that was ſufficient to deprive his wife of the uſe of her ſenſes; ſhe ſunk fainting upon a chair. "God!" exclaimed Ortenberg, with bitter anguiſh, "God, againſt whom I never knowingly offended? be thou the protector of that generous and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſoul." He called for the ſervant, to aſſiſt Caroline, imprinted a tearful kiſs upon the lips of his ſon, who was juſt going to read Gellert's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting tale of Rhinſolt and Lucia, and ruſhed ſenſeleſs out of the houſe.</p>

houſes, which were half in ruins, were ſcantily inhabited. The ſervant could not leave her miſtreſs alone, to call the phyſician. However, Caroline's dangerous ſituation naturally produced the wiſh to be joined by human beings, no matter who they were. She recollected, that an old captain, who was on half-pay, lived in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond floor and ran inſtantly up ſtairs, to call him down.

                        </gap>o draw the picture of this venerable old man, who was on the verge of his ſeventieth year.</p>
                     <p>The captain was a man who had ſerved from his twelfth year. His whole ſoul was devoted entirely to his profeſſion, and he riſked his life cheerfully for God and his King. A cannon-ball which ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his left leg, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad made him an invalid. He did not, however care much for it, and could have engaged to run for a wager, by the aſſiſtance of his wooden leg, againſt any young gentleman who wore narrow ſhoes. He reluctantly took leave of his grenadiers, who loved him like a father; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a certain petty prince wanted, juſt at that time, to make a proviſion for one of his natural children, and the old brave captain was compelled to conſent to be declared unfit for further ſervice, although he ſhould have received only a ſingle grain of ſmall-ſhot in the calf of his leg. A ſcanty penſion was the only reward of fifty years' hard and faithful ſervices. He was, however, never heard to complain. "Brown bread," he uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to ſay, "ſatisfies the cravings of the ſtomach, and ſmall beer allays thirſt. A man who has more than he wants, and gives not the reſt to his poor neighbours, does not deſerve to have as much as he wants, however little that may be. Has the King a better appetite than myſelf? Is he happier than I am? Does he ſleep better than I do?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037761_0010_100F04872CB2BBD8"/>
"Well then!" he ſometimes exclaimed with a kind of enthuſiaſm: "well then, thou wooden ſupporter, faithful companion of my ſound limb, I am ſatisfied with thee! my lips are maid to command and unaccuſtomed to complaints. A cripple lives unenvied, and a man who is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to envy, lives happy." Theſe few words compriſed the whole philoſophy of the brave veteran.</p>
                     <p>He was content to have only ſo much to ſpare as would enable him to purchaſe the Life of Prince Eugene, or the Theatre of State. He loved to talk of the campaigns which he had made, and this was one of thoſe weakneſſes in which we muſt indulge ourſelves in old age. His fondneſs of familiar chat led him frequently down ſtairs to Ortenberg, in long winter evenings, when he uſed to delineate the poſitions of the two armies on the field of battle, with chalk upon the table, and at laſt, with heartfelt joys, always made a ſtroke through the hoſtile ſquadrons, to ſignify that they had been defeated. Ortenberg was ever willing to liſten patiently to the good old man. Caroline too applauded him ſometimes by a ſmile, and thus both had gained his love in ſuch a high degree, that he, in caſe of neceſſity, would cheerfully have ſacrificed his other leg for them. When no perſon was near to whom he could talk, he uſed to converſe with himſelf, and ſhape theſe diſcourſes regularly, in the form of queſtion and anſwer. For inſtance:</p>
                     <p>"Captain Storm, (this was his name,) were you at the battle of Dettingen?"</p>

                     <p>"Captain Storm," what do you think of the battle of Dettingen?"</p>
                     <p>I think it was a ſcandalous buſineſs: I am, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, not the the laſt, if the enemy face me fairly. However, to ſtand five hours, and to ſuffer tamely to be ſhot at amongſt mangled bodies, groaning friends, bloody and ſhattered corpſes, to read the agony of death in the eyes of the dying, to ſee how one after the other breathes his laſt—no, by God, thus will I not be treated!</p>
                     <p>"Thus will I not be treated" was the favourite expreſſion, which he applied on all occaſions.—We hope, our readers now know him ſufficiently.</p>
                     <p>He was juſt going to aſſiſt Duke Bernhard of Weymar, in beſieging Briſach, and bombarded the town with uncommon violence, when Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline's maid entered his apartment.</p>
                     <p>"Captain! for God's ſake! exclaimed the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant out of breath, "I conjure you to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to her aſſiſtance; elſe ſhe will be loſt!"</p>
                     <p>Zounds! exclaimed the Captain, ſmiling, ſhe ſhall be loſt; Duke Bernhard has made his diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like a brave general.</p>

                        <p>My miſtreſs! my poor miſtreſs has been ſeized with a fainting fit, and there is no perſon to aſſiiſt her.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Having ejaculated theſe words, ſhe ruſhed out of the apartment.</p>
                     <p>The Captain no ſooner underſtood what ſhe meant, than the ſiege of Baiſach was raiſed. He faſtened his green night-gown with his belt, took his medicine-cheſt under his arm, and hobbled down ſtairs as faſt as his wooden leg would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Captain Storm, whither art thou going?" ſaid he to himſelf on the way.</p>
                     <p>I am going to aſſiſt Mrs. Ortenberg, for the wench ſays ſhe has fainted away, and no one is at

hand to give her aſſiſtance. Yes, I am coming, to aſſiſt the poor woman! repeated he on every ſtep, dragging his left leg after him. Freſh troops! forced marches! the ſuccours are at the gate.</p>
                     <p>Caroline juſt opened her eyes, when he entered her apartment.</p>
                     <p>"What the deuce, madam, are you about!" (he ſurveyed the apartment) "you ſeem to have been defeated; however, the field of battle is evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>Oh! Ortenberg! exclaimed Caroline, and was on the point of ſwooning a ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>Dear Madam! for God's ſake don't turu ſo pale!</p>
                     <p>He put his medicine-cheſt upon the table, took a glaſs of tincture of rhubarb out, and held it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her noſe; ran up and down the room with the moſt anxious activity, poured ſpirit of hartſhorn in a ſpoon, and fortunately, ſpilled it before he reached Caroline's chair. He now mixed a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with his little finger, but recollecting that this was improper, threw it indignantly out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. The ſervant had in the mean time, reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caroline, and ſhe raiſed herſelf ſlowly.</p>
                     <p>"Thank God!" exclaimed the old Captain: throwing the ſpoon to the ground: "<hi>Te Deum laudamus</hi> with trumpets and kettle-drums! The ſiege is raiſed, and the fortreſs is ſaved.—But, dear madam, in what war are you engaged! who is friend, and who is foe?"</p>

                           </gap> A man who has ſhewn his teeth to death as often as I have done, knows not what fear is. Be eaſy, madam, I am your ally, body and ſoul; I will not deſert you a moment till Mr. Ortenberg returns, and any perſon who ſhall dare to offend you in the leaſt, ſhall pay for it, with his noſe and ears.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Having finiſhed this elaborate harangue, he took Ortenberg's pipe from the table, whiſtling the march of his regiment, and filled it with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined look of a man who is ready to attack
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037761_0015_100F049262813C98"/>
the very gates of hell, and to challenge all its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Caroline flung herſelf in ſpeechleſs agony in an arm chair. The old ſoldier miſtook this for a mark of returning tranquillity, which he imputed to the force of his conſolatory arguments. He lighted his pipe with an air of ſatisfaction, and marched up and down the apartment, wheeling always regularly round. If he had known a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more of phyſiognomy, he would eaſily have been able to read Caroline's agony in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But knowing of no other danger, but that which the enemy's batteries threatened, and of no other means of defence but ſwords, guns, and piſtols, he had not the leaſt idea, that a perſon can quietly ſit in an arm-chair, and yet be torn by the moſt agonizing apprehenſions. He had, beſides, adopted the maxim, that the devil is not always dreadful, if we have courage enough to look at him. He reflected therefore no longer on what had happened, or might happen, and without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into an uſeleſs examination of the cauſe of Ortenberg's abſence, ſat quietly down, chalked the plan of Breiſach upon the table, and began to cannonade the fortreſs, in the name of Duke Bernhard, in all directions.</p>
                     <p>William had laid both arms upon the table, and his head upon them, and was faſt aſleep. This inactive ſtillneſs tended very little to reſtore peace to Caroline's agitated mind. The melancholy ſilence laſted ſome time, and was interrupted by nothing but Caroline's ſighs; by the noiſe which the old captain made in chalking upon the table: by William's ſnoaring, the chirruping of a cricket in the chimney, and the howling of a dog in the ſtreet.—The clock ſtruck twelve, and ſtill no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of Ortenberg. Caroline's agony in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed viſibly; one tear after the other guſhed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037761_0016_100F04948D0CA708"/>
over her cheeks. But they were not thoſe ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary tears, that kind gift of nature, by which the heart is unburthened and animated with ſtrength to bear new grief. There is a kind of weeping, which is not attended with ſobbing and wringing of hands; but, during which, the tears ſtart ſingly from our eyes, to let us taſte the bitterneſs of every ſolitary drop that ſteals down our cheeks. Thus, Caroline wept.</p>
                     <p>The captain perceived it at laſt; however he had exhauſted his arguments of conſolation. He went to the window, and ſung with cordial devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the hymn "Bleſſed is the man who truſts in God;" and, when he had finiſhed, he acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally caſt his eyes on the conſtellation Orion, and forgot his friend Ortenberg, the ſuffering Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and the whole world, in a moment. When he formerly went out reconnoitering, that conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation always ſerved him as a guide, for which reaſon he could never behold it without ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the moſt heartfelt joy. When he once began to think of reconnoitering, he always thought of the camp; and when his thoughts once were in the camp, no clap of thunder could rouſe him, unleſs he ſhould have miſtaken it for the report of a cannon.</p>
                     <p>"Captain Storm!" uſed he to ſay to himſelf, on theſe occaſions, while he contemplated the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation with cheerful eyes: "Captain Storm! have you frequently been out reconnoitering? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly! at night and in fogs, in ſtorm and rain, hungry and thirſty. All was alike to me. It is, indeed, not like a party of pleaſure. A ſkirmiſh every moment, and I hate ſkirmiſhing. Upon my poor ſoul, I would rather have three battles in the open field, than <hi>one</hi> of thoſe pickerings, in which they mix pell-mell like ants—A ſhot in front, a cut behind, a thruſt in the ſide. The braveſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

is a loſt man, if he have no more than two eyes in his head, and be not protected by the angel of God. God has ſent his angel to guard me!"</p>
                     <p>He uncovered his head, looked up to Orion, and adored his heavenly preſerver in grateful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. He covered his head again after a ſhort pauſe.</p>
                     <p>"Captain Storm, had you not a brave corporal?</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, I had. His name was Reiter. He was as rough as his whiſkers, and as honeſt as a Pomeranian. He ſaved my life twice. Corporal Reiter! uſed I to ſay to him, when I ſhall be old and you too ſhall be an old man, and neither you nor I can fight any longer for our king, you ſhall live with Captain Storm. You ſhall not want for bread while Captain Storm has a morſel to give. Corporal Reiter has run over to the heavenly bands thirteen years ſince. The commanding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel knows nothing of the ſervice, if he has not made him a major." He uncovered his head again and looked up to the conſtellation Orion. "Major Reiter!" exclaimed he with great emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: do you think ſometimes of your old bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoldier, Captain Storm?"</p>
                     <p>The ſervant who in the mean time, had left the apartment, to get the tea ready, came ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the room and reported in fearful accents, that ſhe had heard a noiſe at the garden gate, and confuſed murmurs, as if many people were ſtanding before it. Caroline turned pale; the old ſoldier ſtared a moment at the ſervant, and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſuddenly <hi>where</hi> he was and for <hi>what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> he was there.</p>
                     <p>"To arms! Captain!" exclaimed he: "we ſhall have an action at laſt!" With theſe words he ſtumbled out of the door, aſking himſelf, as uſual, while he limped up ſtairs: "Captain Storm, whither art thou going?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:037761_0018_100ED4CC52780700"/>
"I am going to prepare myſelf for action, the alarm is given, the whole camp is in motion; we are indifferently fortified, and the enemy is at the gate. However I will let them know that I am an old veteran. Call to arms! give the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role: God and the juſt cauſe!"</p>
                     <p>He returned after a few minutes with a brace of piſtols under his right arm, and an enormous ſword in his left hand.</p>
                     <p>"Let them come on!" he exclaimed with a wild laugh.</p>
                     <p>"Make ready! Fire! is a command which I have not yet forgotten. Theſe piſtols, madam, are excellent; I took them from a Swediſh cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſier; they coſt me only a ſound cut acroſs my face.—The ſabre is an inheritance of one of my anceſtors, who took it from a Turkiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

You muſt ſtay with the baggage; for you are an invalid; but you, Hannah, (to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,) muſt take a ſpit, and protect the rear. Wheel to the right! March!"</p>
                     <p>He had already opened the chamber door, when he ſuddenly called halt! and held the following council of war:</p>
                     <p>"Am not I a fool to take the field with my army, without knowing whether an enemy is near?—I ought, at leaſt, to diſpatch ſome light troops, to reconnoitre. Hannah, make your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port once more: who knows what the timid fool has heard?—A noiſe? Why it may have been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by rats. Murmurs?—Dogs and cats make a noiſe which is very much like it—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let us ſee what it is! March! we will fall upon the enemy's flank! No quarter! If they be mice or rats, they will not laugh at me! No, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſoul, they will not! That ſpy there has alarmed the camp."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:037761_0019_100F049A1B0396A0"/>
Caroline was not diſpoſed to laugh; ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled like an aſpen leaf. Her eyes rolled wildly, and her tongue ſeemed ſuſpended to her palate.</p>
                     <p>The old captain had, in the mean time, taken his ſtation in the paſſage: Hannah was ordered to keep herſelf ready for action; and in this warlike array he advanced towards the gate. He was only a few ſteps diſtant from it, when it moved upon its hinges. It now was thrown wide open, and three muffled up fellows with a dark lanthorn were ſtanding before him.</p>
                     <p>"Stop, gentlemen! here is an out-poſt!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the captain; "you will not eaſily get away without a ſkirmiſh." He cocked his piſtol with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fortunately the ſervant ſtood at his back with a lamp, which rendered it uſeleſs for the intruders to ſhut up the light in their lanthorn. They were irreſolute what to do, and all three put their hands upon the hilt of their ſwords.</p>
                     <p>"Either you or I!" continued the captain: "Raſcals! what do you want?" So ſaying he advanced two ſteps, and held his cocked piſtol under the noſe of the foremoſt. "Who is there?" exclaimed he with a martial voice; "anſwer, or I'll blow your brains out."</p>
                     <p>When a parallel line can be drawn between the mouth of a loaded piſtol and our noſe, and we conſider, that only a ſlight pull is wanted, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate its contents with our brains: when we ſee that the finger of a ſtrange hand, is already going to put the ball in motion, and reflect, that the fatal lead may be lodged in a moment, in a place where it ought not to be: then all theſe circumſtances taken together, poſſeſs a magical charm, to open even the moſt obſtinate lips. The

three ſtrangers, who, hitherto, had not been incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to give any other but a palpable explanation of the motives of their nocturnal viſit, changed their reſolution, ſuddenly: "Sir—" ſtammered one of them.</p>
                     <p>"Take yourſelves off, gentlemen!" replied the captain, haſtily! "wheel to the left, ye caitiffs, or, by our Lord, I'll make you caper like a cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball. Captain Storm is not uſed to neglect his poſt. You intend to ſurpriſe our camp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, your ſcouts informed us of the expedition. It is pity you ſhould have made your forced march to no purpoſe. Wheel to the left, I tell you; march! if no ſick were in the hoſpital, I would give every one of you a pill for your pains, which ſhould tranſport you ſoon enough to the devil's great army. Fie! ſhame! to be put to flight by an old invalid."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he ſeized the foremoſt by the cloak, in order to puſh him and his companions out of the gate. However, the fellow thinking the captain wanted to detain him, left his cloak behind, and took to his heels. His comrades fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as faſt as poſſible, and all three diſappeared in a moment.</p>
                     <p>"Thunder and lightning!" exclaimed the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, examining the cloak carefully by the light of the lamp, "the fellow was a ſoldier; I ſaw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was dreſſed in an uniform. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it to the governor. There are a number of volunteers quartered in the town, who are nothing but a ſet of vagabonds.

                     <p>CAROLINE leaned on her knees, the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of deſpair. Her eyes rolled wildly in their ſockets; her hair ſtood on end, and her hands ſeemed convulſive. "My huſband is dead!" This dreadful idea ſhook the inmoſt receſſes of her ſoul, like concealed fire, which makes the earth quake, and returned every minute with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional force. "My huſband is dead!" She now, in fancy, ſaw the dear object of her conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal love in the coffin. "My huſband is dead!" She beheld her William and the infant, which ſhe carried under her heart, a prey to hunger and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>"Rejoice, madam," exclaimed the old captain, while he opened the door: "rejoice, the enemy has retreated, and left his baggage behind. (He meant the cloak, which he had hung upon the ſervant's ſpit, and cauſed to be carried before him in triumph). "But, dear madam," continued he, when he ſaw Caroline ſtruggling with deſpair: "this is not the manner in which I expected to be received. I return with ſpoils from the field of battle, and intended to be merry in my winter quarters, and you receive me like an unfledged enſign, who has loſt the colours, and make me ſob, as if I had a muſket-ball in my throat."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:037761_0022_100F04A06D627FF0"/>
"I thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear captain—"</p>
                     <p>"There is no occaſion for it; I did no more than my duty!"</p>
                     <p>He laid the cloak, the piſtols, and the ſword peeviſhly upon the table, lighted his pipe again, and ſtepped ſilently to the window, to contemplate the conſtellation Orion, to recapitulate his cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, to devote a tear to corporal Reiter, and to forget, in theſe pleaſing reveries, the ſcene of miſery which was before him. The ſervant rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the mean time to Caroline, every particular of the tranſaction. She proteſted, that ſhe had been ſeized with the moſt dreadful apprehenſions, and could not conceive, how the dear old captain could put three daring fellows to flight, without being leagued with old Nick. She concluded with the aſſertion, that ſhe was perfectly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he was proof againſt ſwords and bullets. Neither Caroline nor the captain paid the leaſt attention to what ſhe ſaid; Caroline, becauſe her ſtupifying deſpair, prevented her from perceiving any thing beſides the agonies of her mind, and the captain, becauſe he was juſt occupied in the ſiege of Breiſach.</p>
                     <p>"Merciful God! what can all this mean?" eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated Caroline, at laſt, after a deep hollow groan: "and where may Ortenberg be?</p>
                     <p>"Not where he ought to be!" replied the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain haſtily; "elſe he would have been here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and raiſed a dyke againſt theſe torrents of tears, and not ſuffer that my poor pipe of tobacco ſhould be thus imbittered."</p>
                     <p>Caroline made no reply, folding her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief between her hands, and caſting her eyes to the ground. No tear ſtarted from her eyes! but the quick heavings of her boſom, her anxious and ſhort reſpiration, plainly indicated the dreadful workings of her mind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:037761_0023_100F04A43AD64D38"/>
Thus another leaden hour crept away like a black thunder-cloud, which ſeems to be fettered with heavy chains to the ſky, while the trembling inhabitant of the rural cottage, looks every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the window, to ſee whether it has not yet paſſed by: the cock crowed, the eaſtern horizon aſſumed a livelier hue, and announced the approach of day.</p>
                     <p>"This is no joke!" ſaid the captain; "I don't like it! I will go, madam, and reconnoitre! I will make a <hi>forced</hi> march; and you ſhall ſee him in an hour's time, either dead or alive."</p>
                     <p>He ſtumped up ſtairs, without waiting for an anſwer, dreſſed himſelf with the greateſt impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and whiſtled the march of his regiment. When he had armed himſelf with his cane and ſword, and, in caſe of neceſſity, with a brace of pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-piſtols; he ſtumped again down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtairs, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Caroline's door, leaning in a martial manner upon his cane, and exclaimed;</p>
                     <p>"Well, madam, the detachment is ready! ſhall I march out?"</p>
                     <p>Caroline replied not.</p>
                     <p>"Madam," reſumed the captain, "cannot muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter up a ſingle word, the communication is cut off; the allies muſt ſee what they can do. Wheel to the right!"</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he really made the evolution, ſtamped with his foot upon the floor that the cups upon the table jingled, preſſed the hat with his cane upon his head, gave the word, March, and left the apartment.</p>
                     <p>When he came into the ſtreet, he aſked himſelf as uſual: "Captain Storm, whither art thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?—I am commanded to go in ſearch of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, to carry him to the camp, dead or alive.—God has ſent us a fine morning!" (He took off his hat; which he always uſed to do when he

pronounced the name of God) "a clear, healthy air. Advance, wooden leg! I ſay! Comrade!" (he was juſt near a centinel) "have you not ſeen Mr. Ortenberg?"</p>

My readers will not be aſtoniſhed to learn, that the battle of Prague made the old veteran forget Ortenberg entirely, and that he ſtayed with John Miller, until the latter was relieved.</p>
                     <p>But let us return to Caroline, and her helpleſs ſituation.</p>
                     <p>We are never entirely miſerable, while ſome perſon is with us, by whoſe actions and words we can perceive that he ſhares our ſufferings, although the mind be not in that diſpoſition which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, if we are to be ſenſible of all the marks of ſympathy which compaſſion diſplays, and able to ſhed a grateful tear. This was Caroline's ſituation. While the captain was with her, ſhe ſhared her agony with him, without knowing it, and firſt grew ſenſible of it, when he had left her. Till that moment, the flame of tormenting bodings, burned only internally, but, no ſooner was her venerable protector gone, than ſhe ſtarted wildly from her chair, croſſing the appartment with ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering ſteps, and went to the window, to look into the ſtreet. She miſtook every ſtranger, at ſome diſtance, for Ortenberg. There, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! ſhouted her wiſhful heart. He came nearer, and her heart always had impoſed upon her eyes. Dreadful were the ſenſations which convulſed her boſom.—She went, urged by reſtleſs anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, without knowing why, to her huſband's ſtudy, caſting her wild looks all around, as if ſhe there awaited the developement of ſome myſterious event. Ortenberg's night-cap lay on the ground. Caroline was terrified. Her eyes lighted on his picture; ſhe ſtarted back, left the room, and ſhut the door with as much violence, as if her huſband's ſpirit had appeared to her. She was obliged to ſupport herſelf with both hands by the banniſter, in order to be able to return to her apartment.</p>
                     <p>

William was ſtill immerſed in a ſound and quiet ſleep. Caroline, with folded arms, ſtood ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times oppoſite to him, fixing her eyes on his cheeks, which were tinged with a crimſon hue, by the invigorating balſam of ſleep. "Poor Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam!" groaned ſhe: "this morning you played cheerfully with your father, he rocked you on his knee—alas! if he ſhould be dead, you will ſoon be a fatherleſs and motherleſs orphan."</p>
                     <p>She was long abſorpt in melancholy contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until ſhe ſuddenly awoke, as if from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found dream, and was going to call for the ſervant, to undreſs the boy and carry him to bed. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe was ſo totally deprived, by her agony, of the uſe of all her ſenſes, as to be unable to utter a ſingle word.</p>
                     <p>Some perſon rung the houſe bell, at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with great violence.</p>

re-echoed only by unknown mountains; when then the forlorn wanderer ſuddenly is hailed by the cheerful ſound of an human voice—Oh! how does his heart then beat with hope! Here! ſays he, cheerfully to himſelf; here are men, thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren!—But, whiſpers his guardian angel, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, they are robbers: and circumſpection adds, robbers, of the laſt remaining ray of hope.</p>
                     <p>This picture conveys but a faint idea of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's ſenſations, of the confuſed emotions, which, in that moment, ſeized her perturbed ſenſes. She ſtruggled, in vain, to exert the laſt ſtrength of her exhauſted muſcles, to receive the meſſenger, by whom ſhe apprehended to hear her doom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. Her whole form was a picture of fear blended with deſpair, which was tinged only with a faint ray of diſtant hope.</p>
                     <p>The ſervant, who was ſitting by the fire-ſide, and had fallen aſleep at the ſpinning-wheel, heard the ringing of the bell, ſtarted up, and ſtaggered half-ſleeping out of the room to open the door. She had ſcarcely ſtept into the paſſage, when a draught of air from the garden extinguiſhed her lamp. However, as it already was broad day, ſhe heſitated not to unfaſten the door. When ſhe opened it, ſhe was accoſted by a man whom ſhe knew not, becauſe his hat covered the upper part of his face. He gave her a letter, ſeemed to be inclined to ſpeak, but inſtantly checked himſelf, and diſappeared. Caroline's eyes devoured the letter; ſhe tore it impatiently out of Hannah's hands, while all her limbs trembled, every muſcle quivered, her cheeks glowed, and her breath ſtopped. However, ſhe perceived ſuddenly, that it was the hand-writing of her huſband. This, and the griefleſs direction, <hi>To my dear wife!</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her for a few moments to the uſe of her ſpeech. "God be praiſed!" exclaimed ſhe: "he

"lives!" She dropped on her knees; a ſparkling tear, worthy to be kiſſed away by angels, ſwam in her eye, which was raiſed to heaven; her hands folded themſelves, and—ſhe was ſpeechleſs. If my readers ever have been at Caſſel, and ſeen Cleopatra, Tiſhbein's maſter-piece, they will be able to conceive an idea of Caroline, during the pauſe of ſilence. Her grateful looks were the moſt eloquent and affecting prayers. She collected herſelf at laſt, opened the letter on her knees, and read as follows:</p>

                           <p>I have acted imprudently! and ſtand in need of your forgiveneſs, and hope your good and loving heart will readily grant it. I left you—although, not quite without reaſon, yet, too haſtily and imprudently. Did I not know that my Caroline has an undaunted ſpirit? that ſhe is far ſuperior to the generality of her ſex, who know not what to do, when a dark cloud overcaſt the horizon of their life for a ſhort time? Did I not know, that religion and love can perform mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? that Caroline's heart is the abode of both, and, that virtue, conſcious of its innate greatneſs, never wants reſolution? Is not God above us, whoſe aſſiſtance is neareſt when we are leaſt aware of it?—And, particularly now, when my dear Caroline is on the point of being a mother the ſecond time, ſhe will, undoubtedly, call forth all her firmneſs, to bear a trifling misfortune, which, perhaps, will ſeparate me a few weeks from her. Yes, deareſt love, I am neceſſiated to make a ſhort journey, in which you, in your preſent ſituation, cannot join me. The governor—need I to ſay more? You recollect Breſlau, and the ſcene at the review?—In ſhort, you can gueſs who is my perſecutor.</p>

You will, probably, have ſuſtained many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and gloomy apprehenſions laſt night—ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſequence of my heedleſſneſs. You would have been prepared for the nocturnal intruſion of the ſoldiers, if I had informed you immediately of the contents of old Conrad's letter. I know not what deſigns they had upon me. Perhaps, they only wanted to frighten me, to make room for a baſe villain. How could they be ignorant, that I am proud of poſſeſſing a wife, who wants no male protector, who by one commanding look, can check the moſt unbridled paſſions.</p>
                           <p>I begin, therefore, my journey with tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and confidence in the protection of God. I am on the road to Berlin, to throw myſelf at the feet of our king, to implore his juſtice, and you know our excellent monarch—his name ought to inſpire you with the brighteſt hopes. I expect to cloſe you again in my arms after ſix or eight weeks. Till then farewell, my deareſt love. Do not diſappoint my hopes that you will bear this trifling affliction with firmneſs and piety. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you owe to yourſelf! conſider that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life depends upon yours, the life of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent being, which will atone for all your ſorrows by its firſt infantine ſmile.</p>
                           <p>I am determined to ſee you no more before my departure; receive this letter as my farewell exhortation. I would however not have you think that I am apprehenſive of any danger. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy only ſhrouds itſelf in midnight darkneſs and ſhuns the rays of the ſun. But why ſhould I not ſpare you and myſelf tears which the thought of our good king ought to dry up?</p>

How happy are we when the ſmiling ſun of hope ſhines on the bubble of our wiſhes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; when it charms the eye of our mind by a thouſand variegated colours! However, how much more miſerable do we feel, when ſuddenly a threatening cloud, tinged with the hue of darkeſt midnight, deſtroys the ſweet amuſement of our imagination. The ſun is overclouded, and the bubble burſts.</p>
                     <p>The ſudden tranſit from cordial and grateful joy to agonizing grief was too rapid for Caroline.</p>
                     <p>Although Ortenberg had worded his letter with the greateſt circumſpection, and treated the matter as lightly as poſſible, yet its contents were ſtill too much for a woman who was ſeven months gone in her pregnancy, and already had endured one night replete with torments which were more excruciating than an infernal demon would have inflicted. She ſunk exhauſted into her arm-chair, her eyes were no longer capable of weeping, her breaſt attempted in vain to eaſe its load by ſighs, her head reclined againſt the back of her chair, her arms hung down; her whole poſture was that of a perſon utterly incapable of motion.</p>
                     <p>"Is nobody there?" exclaimed a voice in the ſtreet, while a knobbed ſtick, at the ſame time, knocked pretty rough againſt the door.</p>
                     <p>"Who knocks?" aſked the ſervant in a low voice.</p>
                     <p>"Good friend!" roared the baſs of the old Captain.</p>
                     <p>"Guard, open the gate! let down the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, the detachment is returned.—Cheer up, Madam!" exclaimed the old ſoldier as he ſtept into the room, wiping the ſweat from his brow, "cheer up! it was only a falſe alarm. Mr. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg will ſoon be here again."</p>

When the condemned innocent is arrived at the place of execution, and the dreadful ſword of blind juſtice glitters already in the hand of the ſtern executioner; when the guiltleſs victim has loſt his recollection; does he then not ſtill think he beholds in every white handkerchief that is held up a ſignal for his reprieve?</p>
                     <p>Caroline had the moſt unequivocal proof of her huſband's misfortune, the fatal letter, in her hand, yet a ray of hope darted acroſs her ſoul when the blunt ſoldier called to her in a firm tone of voice: <hi>"Cheer up, Madam!"</hi>

The Captain was confounded, and ſtammered a long, <hi>"So!</hi> I ſee, I muſt confeſs that I have told a lie; I am aſhamed of it. But what could I do, deareſt Madam? Could I tell you that I had gone after him to no purpoſe? That would have been very fine, indeed! I ſhould have deſerved to run the gauntlet. You would have battered my poor old heart with your lamentations, and my little reaſon would have been put totally in diſorder. But this is the natural conſequence of all lies; curſe all falſhoods! I will never again deviate from truth. May the provoſt marſhal order me to be put in irons and dieted with bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if ever I give truth another ſlap in the face. I never ſhall be ſuch a fool again."</p>
                     <p>This was the laſt fatal blow. Caroline fell back in her chair. The roſy hue of her cheeks turned to a dead white, her eyes broke, and her lips were tinged blue.</p>
                     <p>"Holy Virgin, have mercy! wheel to the right! march!" called the Captain to the ſervant: "could not the ſtupid beaſt have gone twenty times for the phyſician? muſt you firſt wait for the word of command in ſuch a caſe?"</p>
                     <p>The ſervant hurried away. The Captain rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged his whole medicine-cheſt, took out hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Hungary water, ſpirit of vinegar, and aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foetida, and held one after the other to Caroline's noſe. But all his pains were fruitleſs. He rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed her temples: but all without effect. He took her in his arms, and ſhook her violently; alas! ſhe awoke not. "God have mercy on us!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he; "what an unfortunate miſerable fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low am I! by what have I deſerved to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus in my old days! that angel of a woman will die in my arms! I cannot bear to ſee it!</p>
                     <p>He replaced Caroline in her arm chair, and limped into the garden, where he put his ſingers
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037761_0034_100F04B93B486FF8"/>
in his ears, running up and down, ſinging and whiſtling, as if he wanted to ſtun his ſenſes and memory.</p>
                     <p>Lettle William awoke at laſt from his quiet ſlumber, and ſeeing the helpleſs ſituation of his mother, thought ſhe was ſleeping. He was, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, aſtoniſhed to perceive by his dreſs, that he had not been put to bed the preceding night; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, not uſed to reflect upon what his parents thought proper to do; he was rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, becauſe he expected he ſhould not be combed, curled, and waſhed that morning. He got cautiouſly from his chair, leſt he ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake his mother, rubbed his eyes, and looked at the wooden clock. It was paſt ſeven. Papa, thought William, muſt already be at ſchool, and it is high time that I alſo ſhould go. I cannot conceive why they ſuffered me to ſleep ſo long. I now muſt go to ſchool, without having had my tea and roll. However, I rather will go without my breakfaſt, than diſturb mamma.</p>
                     <p>During this ſoliloquy, he got his books toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with as little noiſe as poſſible, and was juſt going to ſteal away upon his toes with an empty ſtomach, when the phyſician ſtepped into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment. The latter ordered Caroline to be immediately put to bed, and a midwife to be ſent for.</p>

at me ſome years ſince. My old carcaſs lay ſtretched out upon a ſorry couch! I was deſerted by all the world, deſtitute of friends, and not worth a farthing. Corporal Reiter was dead. I ſhould have died like a crippled horſe, on the field of battle, if that angel, in human ſhape, had not been my nurſe, my phyſician; and my all. You ſee, ſir, ſhe knew me not; I am neither a couſin, nor a brother of hers. Is this too high for your conception, man of ice? <stage>(he raiſed his eyes to heaven, uncovered his head, and folded his hands):</stage> merciful father! if my death can ſave this angel of goodneſs from the grave, oh then, I beſeech thee, have pity, and let me die for her!"</p>

Caroline lay extended upon her couch; her face was pale as a lily, her eyes languid as a drooping flower, her lips, formerly blooming like the full-blown roſe, now were of an aſh-colour, and parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up. However, a calm and ſerene countenance, reſembling a fine autumnal evening at the ſetting of the ſun, proclaimed clearly, that ſhe anticipated her impending union with ſainted ſpirits. She extended her hand, faintly ſmiling, and ſaid, in a weak tone of voice: "dear Captain, I do not think I ſhall recover. God's will be done!—I look upon you as my father—"</p>

                        <p>Yes, madam, I have ſeen many a brave fellow die. Death is on theſe occaſions dreadful, but it affects not. The ſufferings of a gentle and beloved woman, breaks the heart, and forces tears from the eye: I feel it to-day for the firſt time.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>William now was called to her bed-ſide. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline laid her hand upon his head, and ſaid: "God bleſs you, my ſon!—grow an honeſt man, and all the fondeſt wiſhes of your mother will be realized."</p>
                     <p>Her firmneſs had not hitherto forſaken her; ſhe had not ſhed a ſingle tear, but now took her ſon in her arms, and wept aloud:</p>
                     <p>"God bleſs you, my ſon! be happy! I part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly with you.—The heart under which you have lain, will ſoon be cold—but never forget

that you had a mother who loved you—who would have wiſhed to have ſown herſelf the ſeeds of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in your heart, if Providence had permitted it. Once more, God bleſs you! leave me now, William!"</p>
                     <p>The ſervant was going to take him away; but Caroline extended her arms after him:</p>
                     <p>"No, do not leave me!—William! William! grow an honeſt man, like your father!—"</p>
                     <p>The phyſician took the boy, ſmiling, by the hand, and conducted him coldly out of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe he ſaw that his preſence affected Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline too much. Caroline now turned to the Captain: "dear Captain, I have one more ſavour to aſk: burn this letter!"</p>
                     <p>She gave him Ortenberg's letter. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain put it mechanically in his pocket. "Speak comfort to my poor huſband when he returns.—Take care of my interment—You will find ſome money in that cupboard yonder—diſtribute part of it to the poor."</p>
                     <p>The phyſician requeſted her to keep herſelf quiet, and deſired every one to quit the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Captain proſtrated himſelf upon the threſhold, and repeated, while every word was interrupted by groans and ſighs, all the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he had learnt in his infancy.

                     <p>IF two fraternal friends were wrecked upon a deſert iſland; if they for years ſweetened the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of life to each other, and cheerfully aſſiſted one another to eaſe the burdens which fate laid upon their ſhoulders; if ſuddenly a veſſel did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear carrying one of them away to a better land, and leaving the other alone in his dreary ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude—what pen would be capable of portraying the dreadful ſenſations of that hapleſs forſaken wretch?</p>
                     <p>Dreadfully mute—dreadfully grinning and ſtamping the ground in frantic agony, ſat the old Captain upon his chair, gnawing the top of his cane. He ſat five dreadful hours on the ſame ſpot, without being able to ſhed a tear or even to utter a groan. At laſt he ſuddenly recollected the letter which Caroline had given him with the requeſt to commit it to the fire. He put his hand haſtily in his pocket, opened it, and read. When he came to the paſſage in which the Governor is mentioned, his mouth frothed, though it was a riddle to him; he grinded his teeth audibly, clenched his fiſt mechanically, beating his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the firſt word he was capable to utter was: "villain, you ſhall not eſcape me! venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or death? God be my witneſs!"</p>

He then relapſed again into his former reverie; death-like ſtillneſs prevailed around him; no ſound was heard in the whole apartment but the grinding of his teeth.</p>
                     <p>The door was ſuddenly flung open, and the governor entered, decorated with the order <hi>Pour le merite,</hi> which his ſoldiers had acquired and he received, as it frequently happens.</p>
                     <p>He was about 40 years old, ſlim and well made, had a pair of large ſheep's eyes, an aquiline noſe, a ſcoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

His empty ſkull, overgrown with an abundance of black hair, was covered with a hat adorned with a proud plume and gold. His ſtiff tail whipped his thighs; his collar was buckled tight, which gave to his cheeks a martial dark-red hue; the uniform ſeemed to be glued to his body; a cane, four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He bent his ſteps towards the door of the chamber where Caroline's corpſe lay. The old Captain ſuddenly ſtarted up and roared like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</p>
                     <p>"Stop, Sir! not a ſtep farther!" The governor was amazed, and the Captain continued:</p>
                     <p>"No villain ſhall dare to ſtep over this ſacred threſhold while I have as much breath left as a ſiſter wants to blow the <hi>reveille.</hi> Dare not to ſtir from the ſpot where you are now ſtanding? ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance not an hair's breadth, or, by God and all his ſaints, I ſhall ſpit you like a rabbit." The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who never had boen a heroe, and met here with an old, rough veteran, inſtead of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and obliging woman, was ſo much confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to be entirely forſaken by his French im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, and to ſtand motionleſs, as if rooted to the ground. The valet, thinking his preſence was entirely ſuperfluous on this occaſion, went in ſearch of ſome pretty chamber-maid.</p>

The Captain, who was ſenſible of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority which an honeſt man has over a rogue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in his rough accent: "man! if you be an human being, and not detached from Hell by the Devil; look there! and crave pardon of God, the avenger of innocence."</p>
                     <p>With theſe words he flung the chamber-door open. Caroline's corpſe lay extended upon a board, her right hand upon her breaſt, and her dead child in the left arm. The governor was thunder-ſtruck, trembling violently, and averting his face, which was as white as a ſheet.</p>

                        <p>Now, Sir, come with me, I have to whiſper a few words in your ear. But this is no proper place for it; we ſhall not diſturb the peace of murdered virtue.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>He ſeized the ſtunned and ſpeechleſs Governor by the arm, dragging him into the garden behind a hedge, where none of the neighbours could ſee them. There he took Ortenberg's letter from his pocket, contemplated it mournfully, and ſaid with bitterneſs: "go, poor fellow, go! the king cannot reſtore to you what you have loſt. Read, Sir, and if you wiſh to act as an honeſt fellow, go and run the gauntlet voluntarily till you expire."</p>

                        <p>No declamations! I will account to the omnicient God for what I am going to do now, but not to a fellow like you. I know what I am going to riſk—ſo much the better!

                     </sp>
                     <p>The Governor took the letter and began to read, but merely to gain delay, and to have an

opportunity of collecting his little courage; for he could ſee that he ſhould find hot work. The Captain took, in the mean time, a pair of thick leather gloves out of his pocket, and ſtuck his cane into the ground. The governor caſt a ſide glance at him, and perceived the preparations which the old ſoldier was making. Having how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever frequented the fencing academy more than ſeven years, and broken many a rapier; he thought the old crippled Captain was not worth the palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which he felt at the very place where the order <hi>Pour le merite</hi> was ſuſpended. "Well, and what more?" ſaid he ridiculing, while he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter. "What more?" roared the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: "hell and furies! are not you ſenſible that you are a villain?"</p>
                     <sp>

                     </sp>
                     <p>The Captain, being ſeized with an unſpeakable fury, which no pen can expreſs, tore foaming his order from his breaſt, trampled it with his feet to atoms, drew his ſword and ſtammered the words: "Oh! that my voice could r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>It was unfortunately given you by our king; but he knew not to whom he gave it. You are a proof that kings alſo are weak mortals. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend yourſelf!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>The governor drew, and they fought: the old, honeſt Captain, with the pious reſolution to avenge
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037761_0044_100F04CF583BC410"/>
injured innocence, but with an impotent arm, and blinded by rage. The governor, on the other hand, was in the full vigour of life, and armed with ſtrength, caution, and ſkill. The Captain was diſarmed. The governor flung his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt's ſword over the garden wall. "Now, Sir!" ſaid he in an arrogant tone, "your life is in my power; however, I will not interfere with the executioner. You have forfeited your head by having violated ſubordination, the mandate againſt duelling, and trampling upon the king's order. You have offended the king, not me. I ſhall leave it to him to avenge me."</p>
                     <p>He put his ſword triumphantly into the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, collected the fragments of the broken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and went away, rejoicing inwardly at his having been again a villain with impunity.</p>
                     <p>Shame, fury, and ſecret murmuring againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for having denied ſtrength to the arm that defended the cauſe of injured innocence, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the good old man for ſome time ſpeechleſs, "Oh God!" exclaimed he at laſt, raiſing his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling hands to heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>: "God, thou art incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. Why doſt thou beſtrew the path of vice with flowers? why does the villain diſplay the badge of rewarded merit, and trample with impunity upon the firſt and moſt ſacred laws? virtue conceals itſelf in vain in ſequeſtered cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages: vice alſo plunders in the land of pureſt innocence, which certainly is no enemy's country. God! if thou haſt created the worm only to cringe and then to be cruſhed—(he put his hand to one of his pocket piſtols)—who then durſt not march without taking leave? but no, no, no! it cannot be!—Thou haſt certainly prepared good winter-quarters for thoſe who have fought bravely.

                     <p>A tear ſealed this prayer, which aſcended with fervent ardour to the throne of the Omnipotent. He ſtaggered ſlowly towards the houſe, to give orders for Caroline's interment, and to diſcharge the laſt mournful duty. Pity the good old man, ſenſible reader! The worthy veteran, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, will undoubtedly appear more deſerving to you, than the vile conqueror.</p>

                     <p>TO die is, in common life, like dying on the ſtage. The ſpectators weep, while the actor calmly quits the ſcene when the curtain drops, and is ſatisfied to have acted his part with applauſe. The ſame is applicable to the ſtage of the world. The ſenſations of the dying, at moſt, can be compared with that of an actor who performs a favourite character the laſt time, and with tears takes leave of a Public that eſteems him. However, this ſimile is rarely applicable to thoſe who are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. Parents, children, and friends who are
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037761_0046_100F04D29FFD4520"/>
groaning at the death-bed of their darling, taſte the bitterneſs of twofold death; for a gloomy and cheerleſs futurity preſents itſelf to their view, while the happy conqueror anticipates the bliſs of a better world. The ſon loſes his father, but the father meets his parents again. No! death is dreadful only to the unfortunate wretch who loſes his father, conſort, ſiſter, brother, or friend. He ſtares wildly at the lifeleſs corpſe, not knowing how to reconcile himſelf to his loſs, and ſtill hopes that the mournful ſcene which he beholds, is only a frightful dream, from which he expects ſoon to awake; and that ſingular deluſion laſts to the moment of interment. When the dear corpſe has left the houſe, and the funeral train has diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from his gazing eyes, he firſt feels the whole extent of his loſs. The day of interment is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, more diſtreſſing to the unhappy mourner than the day of death. While he ſees the body of his departed friend extended before his eyes, can moiſten his ſtiff hand with his tears, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print kiſſes on his cold lips, his fate appears leſs dreadful to him. But now the coffin is ſcrewed up, the undertakers carry his darling down ſtairs, and, alas! he ſhall never ſee him again. Oh! parting from beloved friends, thou are dreadful! Every ſuffering admits of comfort, every pain is relieved by tears: but parting is relieved neither by tears nor conſolation.</p>
                     <p>The day of interment appeared. Caroline was dreſſed in white ſatin, and her brown hair adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cypreſs: the infant lay in her arms. The apartment was lined with black crape, and eight torches burned on both ſides of the coffin. The afflicted old man ſat at the head wiping with the knuckles of his hands the tears from his eyes, groaning and exclaiming with a faint voice: "I loved her like a daughter! ſhe now is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037761_0047_100F04D5F77FF260"/>
of God! but, alas! her death is more than I can bear!"</p>
                     <p>William was dreſſed in black, his auburn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powdered hair was tied with black crape, and thus he ſtood between the legs of the old Captain, aſking him repeatedly whether his dear mamma would awake no more? Old Conrad ſat in mute ſorrow at the feet of the corpſe, his hands folded, his head bent againſt the left ſhoulder, and ſtaring at the ground. This old Conrad, who, probably, has long intereſted the reader's curioſity, was ſteward in the Governor's houſe, and the only honeſt being who entered the door of his maſter. The Governor would, probably, have turned him into the ſtreet long ſince, if he had not regarded him as a part of his paternal inheritance, and been obliged to confeſs reluctantly that Conrad's fidelity and incorruptible honeſty had ſaved his finances ſeveral times from ruin. The villain ridiculed the honeſt fellow, but did not wiſh to part with him. Conrad, whoſe ſoul was wounded by the exceſſes of his maſter, had been repeatedly on the point of quitting his ſervice. Nothing could have retained him but the idea that the Governor's father had been his benefactor. He ſtaid therefore, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to what he could not alter, and dragged the cart frequently out of the mud, when his maſter had involved himſelf in ſerious difficulties. He was a native of Breſlaw, and thence originated his acquaintance with Ortenberg and his wife. He had been a ſchool-fellow of Ortenberg's father, and always retained a cordial regard for his family. He had accidentally diſcovered the Governor's baſe deſign upon Caroline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the misfortune which threatened his old friend Ortenberg. He informed him immediately of it by the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned note, and returned without delay to his
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037761_0048_100F04D77B86AD90"/>
maſter's houſe, leſt his abſence ſhould expoſe him to ſuſpicion. Ortenberg fled. His flight produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as we know, the moſt fatal conſequences, and Conrad was not the laſt who was informed of it.</p>
                     <p>"Barbara!" ſaid he to his wife. "pack up our little property; I ſhall quit this curſed houſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day." Barbara was one of thoſe wives who by the vulgar are called a bleſſing of the Devil: A little thin, and ſpiteful creature, decorated with a Mulatto noſe, a pair of green eyes, and a ſmall remnant of half and quarter teeth. The gout and aſthma tormented her now and then in a moſt lamentable manner; but her tongue enjoyed the moſt excellent health, for ſhe took all poſſible pains to prove that a <hi>perpetuum mobile</hi> was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, notwithſtanding a practice of near ſixty years, in which ſhe had not taken the leaſt pains to ſpare that wonderful member. Her words ruſhed over the wrecks of her teeth, like a rapid torrent which rolls over the ruins of decayed buildings, and the ſtream of her eloquence continued to flow even when ſleep had touched her running eyes with his ſoporific wand; or to ſpeak in plain language, ſhe talked in her ſleep. By this means, Conrad had diſcovered the Governor's deſign upon Caroline, which Monſieur Coquin, the French valet, had communicated to his gentle helpmate, under the injunction of the moſt profound ſecrecy. She diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked nothing more than going to church, becauſe ſhe durſt not contradict the preacher; however, ſhe preſided in all the meetings of the goſſips of the town. She was perfectly convinced that the words of the Goſpel, <hi>The man shall be the head of the wife,</hi> are not properly tranſlated; and in order to render herſelf capable of refuting that paſſage, took, in her younger years, leſſons in the Hebrew
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:037761_0049_100F053D0D8BC600"/>
language of a ſtout Prebendary, who knew noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it himſelf. But when the wicked world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect her virtue, ſhe abandoned this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution again, and married honeſt Conrad. She now took all poſſible pains to refute, at leaſt by her example, the truth of that paſſage. Conrad loved peace and tranquillity. He ſubmitted quietly to all the whims of his wife, while it militated not againſt his conſcience. But as ſoon as his conſcience told him that it would be wrong to indulge her any longer, he commanded her peremptorily to be ſilent, and when that was of no uſe, applied the eloquence of a good horſewhip ſo ſucceſsfully, as to put a temporary ſtop to the agility of her tongue, and to draw torrents of tears from her green eyes. However, Barbara rarely carried matters to that extremity, and when Conrad ordered her in his authoritative accent, the meaning of which ſhe knew perfectly well, to check the fluency of her eloquence, ſhe obeyed his command without grumbling.</p>
                     <p>Conrad having thus ſupported his authority, he exchanged his ſplendid livery for a threadbare great coat, took his ſtaff in his hand, and ſtept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the apartment of his Excellency, who, exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by yeſterday's duel, recruited his animal ſpirits with a diſh of chocolate ſteeped in Burgundy, and amuſed himſelf with reading the <hi>Pucelle d'Orleans.</hi>

He now may go to market to-morrow, and buy, and cook, and roaſt, if any one is fooliſh enough to give credit to ſuch a beggarly dog. Where will he get bread? Does he think that I have a mind to ſtarve in the bloom of life? It is an eaſy matter to marry; but to ſupport a wife decently and honeſtly, and to be no aſs, no ox—The ſoundeſt blow which ever was diſpenſed by the ſinewy hand of a man, and which ſhook the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of her teeth, put an inſtantaneous ſtop to the ſtream of her eloquence. Barbara reſembled a dog, who, after having barked long enough with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, ſuddenly receives a violent kick, and ſneaks

limping and howling into the houſe. She did not think it proper to wait for a <hi>da capo</hi> of her huſband's careſſes, and ran roaring back. Conrad proceeded to Ortenberg's houſe, and there ſeated himſelf at the feet of the dead Caroline in the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned poſture.</p>
                     <p>Lamenting cripples and weeping paupers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the door. Every one held the laſt alms in his hand which he owed to Caroline's charitable donation; for the Captain, to whom her laſt words were as ſacred as holy writ, had not only made large diſtributions of the money which he found in the place, pointed out to him by his friend previous to her diſſolution, but alſo added a few dollars from his own ſcanty ſtock; which he had hoarded up to purchaſe The Hiſtory of the Thirty Years War. Groans and lamentations reſounded at the ſtreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door from the lips of all theſe poor wretches. They related to each other in doleful accents, how often Caroline's charity had preſerved them from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; how good and ſtrong the ſoup was, which ſhe had ſent to ſome of them in their late illneſs.</p>
                     <p>It ſtruck ten o'clock. The funeral train pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded towards the church yard. The venerable Captain ſtaggered at the head of the poor, behind the coffin, ſupported by Conrad and another of Ortenberg's friends. He had wrapt a crape round his left arm, looking down upon this badge of mourning, and muttering conſtantly, as he went along: "Alas! I loved her ſo much, ſhe ought not to have treated me thus."</p>
                     <p>The clergyman read at the church yard accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cuſtom, a chapter from the Bible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the following words: it would be needleſs, were I to deſcant to you upon the virtues of our ſainted ſiſter. Every one of you knew her; ſhe was a worthy excellent woman."—(Indeed ſhe

was! groaned the Captain)—"Why ſhould I praiſe while deeds ſpeak more ſtrongly than words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs? She now has received the palm of peace in yon better regions, and her reward is unſpeakable. The Lord bleſs thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face ſhine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. Amen!"</p>
                     <p>When the coffin was let down into the grave, and Caroline's terreſtrial part was to be covered with earth, the honeſt ſoldier was no longer able to check the emotions of the moſt violent agony. He began to moan ſo loudly and woefully, that the hearts of all the bye-ſtanders were ready to break. The clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man attempted to comfort him, but he replied angrily;</p>
                     <p>"Alas! reverend Sir, you neither knew her, nor do you know me. I am now good for nothing in this world, for nothing at all. There is a nation among the ſavages who knock their decayed old parents on the head when they grow unfit to enjoy the comforts of life any longer. Oh! that ſome perſon would commiſerate my diſtreſs, and knock me on the head! He returned to the houſe a prey to heart-breaking grief. The firſt object which he beheld on entering his apartment, was a cap lined with fur, which Caroline had given him on his laſt birth-day. He ſeized it with infantine eagerneſs, put it on his head, and went to the looking glaſs, while tears trickled down the venerable furrows of his cheeks. He walked groaning up and down the room more than two hours, before he went to bed. The ſervant found him next morning dead on his couch. An apoplectic fit had terminated his exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The cap which he had received from Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, lay in his folded hands. A tear, which was not yet dried up entirely, ſtood on his cheek.</p>

                     <p>WE acquainted the reader in the antecedent chapters, with the leading ſcenes of this hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for fear of tiring his patience by a long-winded introduction; but it now will be high time we ſhould draw the curtain, and elucidate the events related in the preceding chapters. Charles Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric Ortenberg, the unhappy huſband of Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037761_0056_100F04E6A9E31948"/>
was a native of Breſlaw. His father, an opulent merchant, of that city, had only one ſon beſides him, whoſe name was Nicolaus Ortenberg. The latter was already in his boyiſh years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of the lives of adventurers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of ſea-faring men. When he, at ſchool, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his two elbows againſt the table, devouring, as it were, the book which lay before him with his eyes, and moiſtening the ends of his ſingers with his tongue, in order to turn the leaves more quickly: his ſchoolmaſter could be certain that he ſhould catch him in the act of reading Robinſon Cruſoe, Robert Pierot, or ſome other book of that ſort, inſtead of Julius Caeſar or Cicero; the general conſequence was, the immediate confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his favourite author.</p>
                     <p>However this could not deter him from apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every farthing he could ſave to the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his favourite literature and the bookſeller always got more money from him than the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer and paſtry-cook. His father inferred from this that Nicolaus muſt have a paſſionate deſire to ſee the world. He was glad that his eldeſt ſon diſplayed a liking for the mercantile line, becauſe his wife had made him promiſe, previous to the birth of the youngeſt, that, in caſe ſhe ſhould be delivered of a boy, he ſhould be brought up for the church. He reſolved therefore to ſend little Nicolaus, as ſoon as he ſhould have attained his fifteenth year, to Amſterdam, to article him as apprentice to a great houſe, and afterwards to let him make a voyage to the Dutch ſettlements in the Eaſt-Indies, to gratify his deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. He therefore cauſed him to be carefully inſtructed in accounts, writing, mathematics, Dutch, French and Engliſh, and when he had entered his ſixteenth year, ſent him to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:037761_0057_100F04E8A70424D8"/>
to the houſe of an old friend, to commence his apprenticeſhip. He had never been a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite of his mother, and this was the reaſon why his heart, which naturally was excellent, was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his manners were unpoliſhed. He took leave of his parents without ſhedding a ſingle tear. His head was too much occupied with the deſart iſlands which he intended to diſcover, and the gold and precious ſtones which he expected to find there. He even had made a plan how he would cure the ſkins of the unknown animals which he ſhould diſcover, and to make them fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for being made up into garments than thoſe which Robinſon Cruſoe had employed for that purpoſe. He ſtept, therefore, into the mail, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely occupied with airy caſtles, and no reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his parents, no joſtling of the vehicle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him in his ſweet reveries. Five years of his apprenticeſhip elapſed without giving his manner of thinking another turn; he rather heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his imagination more and more every day. In the long winter evenings, and on Sundays and holydays, when his comrades went to taverns and coffee-houſes, or killed their time and ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their money away at the gaming table, he uſed to ſit down by the fire ſide, leaning his left arm upon a round table, which was loaded with a ſmoaking tea-urn, and always held in his right hand one of thoſe numberleſs imitations of Defoe's Robinſon Cruſoe, which, at his time, inundated Europe.</p>
                     <p>Although the mind of the young man received a very romantic turn by his readings, and his brains were left as deſtitute of ſolid knowledge as his imaginary deſert iſlands were of cultivation; yet he derived from them the advantage of being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered entirely indifferent to all the faſhionable
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:037761_0058_100F04EAAEC340A0"/>
diſſipations of his age, which enabled him to attend with the moſt ſcrupulous diligence to the occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his calling.</p>
                     <p>It was, however, at laſt, impoſſible for him to check his ardent deſire of going to ſea any longer. He teazed his maſter every day to ſend him as fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Eaſt-Indies. I would, however, not have my readers to imagine that he conſidered Batavia as the ſpot where he expected to make his fortune; for the buſtle of that great city, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular conſtitution of the ſtate, and the extenſive connexions which it maintained with all parts of the inhabited globe—all this did not agree with his plans. He deſired that the ſhore where he hoped to arrive on a plank or an empty caſk, ſhould be as wild and uncultivated as the world was on the firſt day of creation, and he would have preferred a garriſon of wild goats to the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment in the ſervice of the States-General. But why then was he ſo preſſing in his requeſt to be ſent to the Eaſt-Indies?—From no other reaſon but becauſe he was perfectly certain that he ſhould be taken on his voyage by a pirate, and carried for a year or two to Algiers, Tunis, or Tripoli, where he expected to effect his eſcape without much difficulty.</p>
                     <p>However, our young adventurer found it more difficult than he had thought at firſt, to perſuade his patron to comply with his wiſhes. Experience teaches us every day that merchants are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reluctant to part with ſervants who are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially uſeful to them; and as Nicolaus Ortenberg, after the expiration of the time of his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, was the moſt uſeful clerk in the count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, upon whoſe fidelity and diligence the Dutchman could implicitly rely, he always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to ſtart ſome pretext to deny the young
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037761_0059_100F04EC421D0400"/>
man's requeſt for the preſent, although it was his father's wiſh he ſhould ſee the world.</p>
                     <p>Nicolaus was, at length, tired of being fed any longer with empty promiſes, and reſolved to take the helm of his life in his own hand. I ſay, he reſolved, which is as much as if I had ſaid, he conceived the idea; for thinking and reſolving is always one act with people of his diſpoſition. It was therefore no wonder that he diſappeared a few days after his bad or good genius had put this idea into his head, leaving the greateſt part of his property behind. He had, indeed, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at firſt, to convey a cheſt with all ſorts of tools ſecretly on board the veſſel, which he hoped would be wrecked on ſome deſart iſland in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his romantic plans; but recollecting that the wreck of the ſtranded ſhip would ſupply him ſufficiently with all implements of that ſort, he abandoned this idea again, and decamped in a beautiful vernal night, indifferently provided with wearing apparel, and ſtill poorer in caſh.</p>
                     <p>Although the biographer of the Ortenberg fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily knows perfectly well what is become of our adventurer, and where he ſpent the ſucceeding five and twenty years; yet he thinks it would be improper to communicate his knowledge of his fate to the reader in this place; but promiſes, at the ſame time, that he ſhall make his appearance again at a period when his arrival will cauſe as much pleaſure as that of Admiral Rodney gave to the political world after the famous battle of the twelfth of April.</p>
                     <p>His clandeſtine departure cauſed the moſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent affliction to his old father. The mother, however, whoſe whole affection concentered in his younger brother Frederic, whom ſhe intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring up for the church, ſoon forgot the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:037761_0060_100F04EEC341FC00"/>
rough ſailor, as ſhe uſed to call Nicolaus. Her huſband, on the contrary, who was on the verge of his eighty-fourth year, could not reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this ſevere blow.</p>
                     <p>Nicolaus was, for his open and guiltleſs heart and blunt honeſty, his very picture, and, on that account, his father's favourite. When all enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and advertiſements were fruitleſs, the old man conſumed his laſt ſtrength by fretting after his darling, and died, at laſt, like an aged oak whoſe laſt remaining ſap has been dried up by a ſtroke of lightning.</p>

                     <p>Caroline Summer was the name of the ſweet creature who had conquered Ortenberg's heart, and, as my readers know, was goodneſs itſelf; and, alas! is already buried. I ſhall not attempt the arduous taſk of portraying all the charms of her beautiful perſon, and her ſtill more beautiful mind. I only obſerve that ſhe had a pair of eyes which no one could behold without feeling the flame of love creeping through every vein—eyes, ſerene and blue like the ſky in a clear vernal morn; animated with youthful fire, and tempered only by the ſhade of her long eye-laſhes, which, when ſhe caſt them down, made her look like a Madonna. Mild, forbearing kindneſs, was the principal feature of her excellent character.</p>
                     <p>They had had frequent opportunities of ſeeing each other in company; always hung their heads when they came to ſome place where they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to meet, and ſaw their hopes diſappointed; were always animated with viſible hilarity when
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037761_0062_100F04F2C76F3A90"/>
one of them unexpectedly entered the apartment. This laſted ſome time, and neither Ortenberg nor Caroline conceived the ſmalleſt idea of reflecting upon that ſingular phaenomenon; for, novels, like thoſe which now-a-days aſſiſt the novices in love to interpret the ſecret meaning of their ſentiments, were at thoſe times as ſcarce as a white raven.</p>
                     <p>The firſt incident which opened Ortenberg's eyes, and actuated him to examine the ſtate of his heart, happened on the following occaſion: Caroline's father was an eminent merchant, and had been an intimate friend of old Ortenberg, whoſe widow had depoſited her little capital with him. This afforded young Ortenberg frequent opportunities to come to the houſe of his miſtreſs on his mother's affairs. One day he happened to enter the apartment juſt when the family were drinking their coffee. Old Summer deſired him to ſit down, and ſaid to his daughter, who ſtood with down caſt eyes, at the tea-table, and could have ſerved a painter as a model of pureſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: "Caroline, offer Mr. Ortenberg a diſh of coffee."</p>
                     <p>I know not whether it was owing to forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or becauſe Caroline was uſed herſelf to drink her coffee without cream; in ſhort, ſhe brought him a diſh of coffee without it, and made a neat courteſy.</p>
                     <p>Any one that had an opportunity of aſking Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg's mother in the realms of death, would have learnt that her ſon had aſſured her repeated<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he could not bear coffee <hi>without</hi> cream. However, Caroline appeared to him a Hebe, the diſh ſeemed to him to be filled with nectar, and from that moment he always drank his coffee without cream. The ſunſhine of metaphyſic, as much as he had learnt of it at ſchool, was inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to enlighten all the folds of his heart, and

                        </gap> whenever his reaſon intruded itſelf as a confidant. I would, however, not have you to believe that he was happy during that ſtate of incertitude; for, the old ſaying, <hi>what I don't wot can't make me hot,</hi> is not applicabe to love. Love frequently heats us without our knowing any thing of its exiſtence; and ſometimes kindles a flame in us that, at laſt, will flaſh from our eyes in ſpite of all our efforts to conceal it, and betray the ſtate of our mind to every connoiſure.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg covered his ſentiments a long time with the cloak of friendſhip, and was afraid to remove it in the ſmalleſt degree, leſt Love, with its whole retinue, ſhould ſuddenly preſent itſelf to his view. However, <hi>Amor</hi> grew at laſt tired of his long confinement, and broke unexpectedly his fetters on a fine autumnal day.</p>
                     <p>Old Summer had company in his garden; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline retired after coffee, when the company ſat down to the card-table, to the remoteſt receſs of a little park which joined it, and ſeating herſelf upon a terrace, took out her knitting, and began to work. I would lay an hundred ducats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a pin, that ſhe ſecretly wiſhed Ortenberg would join her, but alſo that ſhe had no clear perception of this wiſh. Ortenberg ſcarcely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, when he perceived that ſome myſterious charm urged him to quit the company, and his good genius conducted him directly to the ſpot where Caroline was ſitting.</p>
                     <p>He now ſat by her ſide, beneath the ſhade of an ancient beech-tree, which divided itſelf into two branches. A choir of chafinches caroled in the top, and mingled their amorous notes with
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037761_0064_100F04F7686848B8"/>
the ruſtling of its leaves, moved by Zephyr's gentle breath.</p>
                     <p>Caroline plied her needle with the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity, and pulled her ſtraw hat lower over her face, the real motives of which we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as the thick texture of the branches of the beech-tree ſheltered her completely againſt the rays of the ſun.</p>
                     <p>"The weather is beautiful," ſaid Ortenberg. "Yes," replied Caroline: "but it is rather too warm." This aſſertion was an evident falſehood; for the autumnal air blew very freſh; yet, for ought we know, ſhe might really have been too warm.</p>

                     <p>In this tone the converſation was carried on ſome time, although both were very ſenſible that they had to ſpeak of more important ſubjects. A myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſprig which adorned Caroline's boſom, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, at laſt, the converſation more intereſting. Ortenberg begged Caroline to give it him. She took it from her boſom; he extended his hand to receive it; their fingers came in contact; an electric fire ſtreamed through all their veins, and Caroline exclaimed with emotion; "my memory will die as faſt in your boſom as this myrtle will fade." She gave him the myrtle, looked upon her knitting, and a tear pearled in her eye. She averted her face, and attempted to wipe it off unperceived. Both were ſilent ſome time, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg remained ſeveral minutes in the fame poſture in which he had received the myrtle,

He took at laſt his almanack out of his pocket, and wrote the following impromptu on a blank leaf:
<q>
                           <l>Wither muſt the faireſt flower,</l>
                           <l>Though thy hand have gathered it;</l>
                           <l>Naught on earth can brave the power</l>
                           <l>Of decay; beuty, wit,</l>
                           <l>Wealth, and ſplendor, all muſt periſh,</l>
                           <l>Naught but love will never fade,</l>
                           <l>Innocence and virtue cheriſh</l>
                           <l>Faithful love, and kindly ſhade</l>

                           <l>Fate ſows thorns in mortal boſoms,</l>
                           <l>Love alone and friendſhip ſtands.</l>
                           <l>Undiſmay'd when tempeſts lower,</l>
                           <l>Threat'ning in the frowning ſky;</l>
                           <l>Naught impairs their laſting power;</l>
                           <l>Love and friendſhip never die.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>He offered it trembling to Caroline. She read it, while his anxious eyes watched the emotions of hers. Her hand relapſed upon her lap after ſhe had read the lines, and ſhe caſt a glance at her lover, like that which the animated ſtatue caſt at Pygmalion. But it was not this glance alone that informed him of his happineſs. Her eye was again directed at the paper, and ſhe imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at laſt, a fervent kiſs upon it. This was the ſignal for Ortenberg. He claſped her in his arms, and inhaled unſpeakable rapture from her lips.</p>
                     <p>However, he robbed her alſo, unfortunately, of a patch which was on her lip, and now ſtuck to his. Neither of them perceived it, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are very obvious. His ſoul was in the ſame ſtate in which it had been at the time when he, for the firſt time, drank coffee without cream; he would, therefore, not have
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037761_0066_100F04FADFAC17E0"/>
been able to perceive it, if he had been covered all over with patches. If we, beſides, conſider, that he prudently took care not to wipe his mouth after having kiſſed Caroline, we may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the patch quietly could occupy its poſt, without being diſturbed by him. If, however, one or the other of my readers ſhould think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that Caroline alſo took no notice of that unmanly ornament, I can ſafely refer him to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair-one, and to aſk her upon her conſcience, whether ſhe was able to lift up her eyes in the next quarter of an hour after having claſped the dear object of her love the firſt time to her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. Caroline at laſt caſt her eyes colouring to the ground, and could not have looked up for worlds. She was ſatisfied with making the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, after half an hour, in which little was ſaid, and much felt, that the company would miſs them, and tripped ſilently on Ortenberg's arm towards the garden-houſe.</p>
                     <p>The company had, unfortunately, been merry at Caroline's expence, on account of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned patch, before Ortenberg had arrived with his mother. Some young gentlemen had wittily obſerved that it covered half a dozen of graces, while others had remarked that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too large. One of the company, who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined himſelf a great wit, had, probably hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſome mirth creating idea, while Ortenberg and Caroline was acting the tender duodrama at the terrace. Apprehending he ſhould be choaked by it, he directed therefore, as ſoon as the young people entered the apartment, his eyes at the place where the patch had been fixed when Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line had left the company. It had diſappeared. However, his lynx-eye, unfortunately, diſcovered that the patch was lodged on the ſame ſpot of the left ſide of Ortenberg's lip, where it had been fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037761_0067_100F04FDE5CF4A70"/>
before on the right of Caroline's. In order to revenge himſelf for being deprived of an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſport his wit, he made the company ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the fatal tranſlocation. Some ſmiled, and others pretended not to have heard his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Old Summer coloured deeply with anger. He caſt an indignant look at Ortenberg, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his paſſion by his geſtures to the whole company. A general ſilence took place; Caroline could not conceal her confuſion. Ortenberg had ſo much preſence of mind to tell the company with a calm ſmile, that Miſs Summer had loſt the patch in the garden, where he had ſound it, after a long ſearch, in the graſs, and as ſhe had refuſed to redeem it by a kiſs, he had made uſe of it, to puniſh her for her obſtinacy. The company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to take his aſſertion for ſterling coin, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the fine turn by which he extricated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and every one believed as much of it as he thought proper. Old Summer watched from that moment every glance and motion of his daughter, and contrived to turn the pupils of his eyes ſo artfully that it would have been uſeleſs if Argus had lent him half a dozen from his ſuperfluous hundred. He failed, therefore, not to obſerve the ſecret preſſure with which Caroline rewarded Ortenberg for his invention, when he, after ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, according to the cuſtom of his old faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned times, kiſſed her hand.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the gueſts had taken their leave, a diſcourſe commenced between the father and his daughter, the thread of which Caroline in vain made repeated efforts to break.</p>
                     <p>The father, ſitting in an eaſy chair, dreſſed in a red damaſk night-gown, a cap of purple velvet on his head, and in yellow ſlippers; a long tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe in his mouth, and a bottle of ale before him upon a ſtraw mat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:037761_0068_100F05004BDE21B8"/>
The daughter, in another corner of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſedulouſly engaged in various little domeſtic occupations, and endeavouring to conceal the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion occaſioned by the expreſſive glances of her father.</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Father.</speaker>
                        <p>My daughter has not behaved well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Caroline made no reply. She ought however, to have conſidered that we muſt not run acroſs the fields when large drops of rain begin to fall, but to endeavour to find ſhelter in the neareſt cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. However, by being ſilent, ſhe ran right acroſs the field; for I challenge all the ſeventy interpreters to declare whether her ſilence was not in fact as much as if ſhe had pleaded guilty! It was natural that old Summer, who ſtood upon the vantage, did not give up his point, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, "ſhe has forgot the advice which her ſainted mother repeated ſo often to her."</p>
                     <p>The old man opened, with this reproach, a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which he, as Caroline well knew, uſed to bring to bear only on very extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. She foreſaw that ſhe ſhould not be able to avoid facing the enemy, and therefore replied with as much reſolution as ſhe was miſtreſs of, "how ſo, dear papa?"</p>
                     <p>Reſolution and conſideration are not always joined. This was, at leaſt, Caroline's caſe, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe would not have made that reply; becauſe old Summer always was highly provoked when one of his family pretended to be ignorant of a fault with which the conſcience neceſſarily muſt reproach the offender every moment. He knit, therefore, his brow, took the pipe out of his mouth, and replied with a tone of voice which was at leaſt three notes lower than uſual.</p>
                     <p>"Have you already forgot the patch?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:037761_0069_100F0501CEA53CB0"/>
This was one of thoſe critical moments in which guiltleſs ſouls rarely act conſiſtently. Caroline had no other alternative, than either to deny the charge firmly, or to plead guilty. She had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon to apprehend that all would be loſt, and that ſhe would no more hear the carols of the chafinches in the beech-tree, if ſhe confeſſed the fact. But in the former caſe it was neceſſary ſhe ſhould lay the napkin which ſhe was folding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately down, toſs up her noſe, and turning towards her father, exclaimed with ſurpriſe, "the patch!"</p>
                     <p>She actually did all this juſt as we have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it; but committed herſelf by doing it too late, and adding "dear papa!"</p>
                     <p>This addition made her father ſuſpect that ſhe could not deny the charge, but wanted to palliate her guilt, by the endearing tone of her voice, and the repeated aſſurance of her filial love, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as he had ſpoken in the <hi>d sharp,</hi> whereas ſhe had replied in the <hi>e flat.</hi> He replied therefore in the ſame accent:</p>
                     <p>"If I really am your dear father, you will avoid in future all companies where you might meet with young Ortenberg."</p>
                     <p>This injunction was like a clap of thunder to Caroline. A gentle ſhower was juſt on the point of guſhing from her eyes: ſhe caught the firſt drops with her mouth, taſting thus for the firſt time the bitterneſs of love, and collected herſelf as well as ſhe could.</p>
                     <p>"Your commands ſhall be obeyed," ſaid ſhe, in a crying accent, put her night-cap on, kiſſed her father's hand, and went to bed.</p>
                     <p>However, ſhe cloſed her long eye-laſhes to no purpoſe, and could not get a wink of ſleep all the night.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:037761_0070_100F0503E1081DA0"/>
Ortenberg was in no better ſituation. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther queſtioned him about the patch, before he went to bed, and he confeſſed, and denied not, proteſting that Caroline was the only woman in the world who ever had intereſted him, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his mother not to refuſe him her maternal benediction, if ever he ſhould be ſo happy as to obtain her hand. But we know of how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſuch benedictions are, no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be pronounced by a prieſt or an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The bleſſing of the old lady availed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, although ſhe beſtowed it moſt liberally; for Caroline was obedient to her father's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, becauſe ſhe could not help it, and her glances could but rarely tell her lover at church that this reſtraint had blown up the ſpark of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into a blazing flame, inſtead of extinguiſhing it.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg hit at laſt upon an expedient which any other young man, leſs blinded by love than he was, would have found out much ſooner. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline had a married ſiſter, a good-natured little woman, at whoſe houſe ſhe ſpent every week an afternoon, and ſtaid till night. It was not advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to appoint a meeting with Ortenberg in her houſe, becauſe it was to be apprehended her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law would ſurpriſe them.</p>
                     <p>The young lover poſted himſelf every even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he knew that Caroline was with her ſiſter, againſt ten o'clock, in a little lane where ſhe muſt paſs on going home. The ſervant who ſaw her home was entirely devoted to her, and thus the lovers could ſee and embrace each other at leaſt a few moments. Caroline was always rather timid on theſe clandeſtine meetings. Her heart and knee always trembled like that of Chloe in the 23d Ode of Horace, when the breath of Zephyr ruſtled in the leaves of the vine which
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037761_0071_100F0505EF0FD230"/>
run up againſt the houſe, near which they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally met. She never ventured to ſtop longer in the lane than five minutes, and always fled like a criminal, trembling at her own ſhadow when ſhe looked round. Five minutes! how much, and how little time for a loving heart! Thus winter elapſed, and the time drew near when Ortenberg was to quit Breſlaw. Caroline was informed of it. She was with her ſiſter the evening previous to his departure. Her agony increaſed viſibly, when ſhe perceived that it was near ten o'clock; her knitting kneedles trembled, her boſom heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quicker, and her ſiſter caſt a compaſſionate look at her. She ſtarted haſtily up from her chair when the ſervant entered to tell her, her maid was below to fetch her home. It rained violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; however, Ortenberg had nevertheleſs been waiting for her a good while, wrapt in a great coat. She flew anxiouſly in his arms, and her firſt queſtion was: "When ſhall you ſet out?"</p>
                     <p>"To-morrow."</p>
                     <p>Merciful God!—They hung on each other's neck—lips upon lips, mingling their tears.</p>

                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>
                        <p>Caroline, will you never forget me?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Caroline.</speaker>

                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>

                     </sp>
                     <p>"Yes, God ſees us!" repeated Caroline, ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, tearing herſelf from his embraces, and fled.</p>
                     <p>But no! She was not capable of parting ſo ſoon with the darling of her heart. She returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, to embrace him once more. Her timidity had diſappeared entirely. She would not have minded if all the tiles had had eyes—for, the eyes of a world are in the hour of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a contemptible nothing, which is ſwept away by the laſt farewell tears. Ortenberg was, at laſt, obliged to conjure her to go home, to diſengage her hands from his neck, and to entreat her not
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037761_0072_100F0507E729B9F0"/>
to excite the curioſity of the people who were in the ſtreet, "Charles! my deareſt Charles!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſhe, weeping, imprinted the laſt kiſs on his cheek, and went ſlowly home to give her tears time to dry, if poſſible. But, alas! when ſhe came to the corner where Ortenberg ſuddenly was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from her eyes—new bitter tears guſhed from her eyes, moiſtening the flowing treſſes which covered her heaving boſom. She heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a conſiderable time to enter her father's houſe, ſtopping behind one of the linden trees which lined the banks of the canal, warming her hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief with her breath, and holding it againſt her eyes, to diſpel the redneſs. However, grief and confuſion had diſordered her features ſo much, and imprinted their veſtiges ſo deeply upon her countenance, that it was impoſſible for her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal it from the Argus eyes of her father; who aſked her haſtily, as ſoon as ſhe entered the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment: "Good God, Caroline, what is the matter with you? what has happened?"</p>
                     <p>Caroline had already prepared a plauſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, for the confuſion in which ſhe was; for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are never in want of excuſes on ſuch emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. She replied with a tolerable preſence of mind:</p>
                     <p>I have been frightened by a drunken man, on coming home. You know, papa, how fearful I am?</p>
                     <p>The old man took this for ſterling coin, and Caroline was as glad, as ſhe could be in her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, to have reached her ſolitary apartment, where ſhe could give vent to her tears without being interrupted.</p>

                     <p>THE ſenſations with which Ortenberg enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his bed-chamber, the laſt time, were unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably bitter. He neither would nor could ſleep. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the watchman cry the hours, and thought, alas! this is the laſt time I ſhall hear him; he ſaw how the moon ſilvered the tops of the trees in the garden, and thought, alas! I ſhall ſee this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcenery no more. It is ſingular, that objects which never intereſted us before, become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely important to us when we have reaſon to apprehend that we ſhall ſee them no more.</p>
                     <p>The clock ſtruck one. The ſtage was to ſet off at three o'clock. Ortenberg rang the bell for the ſervant, to make coffee, and in a few minutes, the whole houſe was in a buſtle. His mother alſo got up to aſſiſt in preparing her ſon's breakfaſt. Tears ſtarted from her eyes, as often as ſhe looked at her dear Frederic. "God bleſs you, my dear child!" exclaimed ſhe, when ſhe embraced him
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037761_0074_100F050BD0F76240"/>
the laſt time; "God bleſs you, and proſper your ſtudies; walk in the fear of the Lord; have God before your eyes, and in your heart, all your life, and take heed not to ſin knowingly, nor to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any thing contrary to the law of God. God will grant my prayer, and reſtore you one time to my maternal arms, with a pure and innocent heart. Venerate God, do right, fear no one, and my bleſſing will follow you every where. But ſhould you be tempted to ſtray from the path of virtue, then think of your old affectionate mother, and conſider that you would load me with ſhame and diſgrace. Let my grey hair be conſigned in peace to the grave. Oh! my ſon, my ſon! I am old and infirm; I am afraid I ſhall ſee you no more. Farewell! God bleſs you!</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg could not utter one poor word. He moiſtened the trembling hand of his mother with tears of filial love, and flung himſelf ſpeechleſs into the ſtage. He paſſed the houſe of his dear Caroline, ſaw her in the window, dreſſed in a charming morning gown, extending her arms to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as beautiful as the roſeate cloud which juſt emerged from the Eaſtern horizon; her eyes were overclouded with grief, like the riſing ſun when his orb is ſhrouded in a thunder-cloud; he made a ſignal to her with his hand, which was moiſtened with tears, and diſappeared. He was ſcarcely in the open field, when all objects which preſented themſelves to his eyes, contributed to render the ſenſations at parting more painful. The garden in which he unknowingly robbed Caroline of her patch; the terrace, and the tree under which he imprinted the firſt kiſs on Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's lips; the lonely walk at the water-ſide which he uſed to frequent in his boyiſh years: the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant hill where he frequently had played with his juvenile companions; the little wood where
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037761_0075_100F050E8258F7A8"/>
he had laid ſnares for birds; the lake on which he had ſkated. "God!" exclaimed he, while all theſe objects gradually diſappeared from his view. "All this I have, perhaps, ſeen the laſt time!" In a ſhort time he had only an imperfect view of his native town; the ſtage drove down a hill, and his eyes ſought the ſpot in vain where he had dreamed away his boyiſh and juvenile years.</p>
                     <p>He arrived at the place of his deſtination with the firm reſolution to be faithful to the advice of his good mother. He kept his word. Nothing remarkable occurred in the two firſt years of his ſtudies. Caroline and his mother wrote frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; he neglected not to anſwer their letters; and the poſt went regularly. We ſhall, therefore, ſkip over the two firſt years of his academic life. We alſo ſhall not enlarge much upon the third, and only inform the reader that he, at that time, made an acquaintance which had an important influence on the ſubſequent occurrences of his life. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Elhenhorſt, an excellent young nobleman, became his friend.—Although I would adviſe every young man of plebeian extraction to chooſe, at univerſity, no nobleman for his friend, becauſe he would run the riſk of being diſcarded and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, after the concluſion of his academic life; yet Baron Elhenhorſt made an exception. He was a native of Cleves, and ſon of the Prime Miniſter, endowed with uncommon abilities, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing a heart warm for friendſhip, but cold for love. Many young men intruded themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſtrove to gain his friendſhip; becauſe—he was rich. Ortenberg entertained not the leaſt thought of ingratiating himſelf with him, and gained his friendſhip without having ſought it. This happened in the following manner.</p>
                     <p>Not far from the town where they ſtudied was a pond, where Elhenhorſt, Ortenberg, and many
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037761_0076_100F0510E2983380"/>
more ſtudents uſed to ſkate. Ortenberg went one day, about noon, to that place of diverſion, and arrived at the very moment, when, at the fartheſt end of the pond, the ice broke under El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt's feet, and he ſank into the mire up to his ſhoulders. There was, indeed, no danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the pond was not deep: yet every one of my readers will eaſily perceive that the ſituation to which Elhenhorſt was reduced, was far from being comfortable. A perſon who has ſkates faſtened to his feet, cannot eaſily help himſelf, and—what is ſtill worſe—the ice always broke when he attempted to work himſelf out of the mud. Not a ſingle ſoul was near the ſpot before Ortenberg arrived, and for this reaſon the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which he endeavoured to give to an utter ſtranger, although he could not riſk his life, was the more valuable. However, Elhenhorſt was obliged to be ſatisfied with his good intention, for when our young hero haſtened to the ſpot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incautiouſly—as all good natured people are uſed to do when they have an opportunity of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting their fellow creatures—the ice broke alſo under his feet, and he was reduced to the ſame ſituation from which the Baron had ſtruggled above a quarter of an hour to extricate himſelf. Both were half dead with cold, and now began jointly to call for aſſiſtance. This attracted ſome people, and they were, at laſt, fortunately though covered with mud, half frozen, and ſlightly wounded in ſeveral parts by the ſharp edges of the ice, releaſed from their unſeaſonable bath.</p>
                     <p>It always grieves me to ſee that the great and the little generally are leſs grateful when our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be uſeful to them anſwer not our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and intention, although our zeal and merit be the ſame as if we had ſucceeded. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt, differing in his principles with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:037761_0077_100F051265D8B880"/>
of his noble brethren, was as much obliged to Ortenberg as if he really had ſucceeded in his attempt to releaſe him from his uncomfortable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. The moſt cordial friendſhip was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, from that moment, between the two young men. Sympathy had united their ſouls long before that misfortune happened, and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contracted the ties which nature had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.—Propriety! what a troubleſome thing art thou! how often do we ſee a face at the ſight of which our heart whiſpers to us, that man <hi>could</hi> be thy friend, and thou wouldſt love him fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>if</hi> he were. However, ſtiff propriety, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us from ſhaking him cordially by the hand and proclaiming the wiſhes of our heart. He has, perhaps, in that very moment, the ſame idea: but if accident does not come to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, we part with the cold compliment, "I am happy to have had the honour of making your acquaintance." If accident had not befriended Elhenhorſt and Ortenberg, perhaps they would never have been ſo intimate as they now were. They ſpent every hour which was not dedicated to their occupations, in confidential diſcourſes, and many a long winter's evening appeared to them, at the cheſs-board, as ſhort as a ſerene hour in May. Oh friendſhip, thou ſiſter of love! how few are deſtined to be warmed by thy gentle fire! every one does, indeed, offer an imaginary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at thy ſhrine, but, alas! the majority lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the idol of ſelf-intereſt, which rules all over the world, while they vainly think to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at thy altar.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg now enjoyed a bliſs which, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, had been unknown to him. He never had, as yet, taſted the happineſs of communicating his moſt ſecret ideas to a faithful friend, of ſpeaking of his love, of pourtraying the idol of his heart
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037761_0078_100F05141172D7B8"/>
with thoſe glowing colours with which Amor's eloquence furniſhed him, and, in ſhort, of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his bliſs in a two-fold manner, as he was no longer obliged to conceal it within himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Although Elhenhorſt never had loved, nor was inclined to fall in love, yet he liſtened kindly, and ſometimes ſmiling, to his friend, when he vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tendereſt feelings of his heart with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic warmth: and what a feaſt was it for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg's love, when Elhenhorſt praiſed Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's artleſs letters, congratulated his friend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being ſo happy to poſſeſs the heart of a woman who was capable of ſuch noble ſentiments and of expreſſing them in ſuch a dignified manner. In ſhort, congeniality of ſentiments, principles, and propenſities tied in leſs than a year the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble bonds of friendſhip between them. However, all our joys are like a gleam of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine in April. The gloomy hour of ſeparation already drew near: Elhenhorſt was to leave Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort on the Oder, and Ortenberg, who had to ſtay half a year longer was almoſt frantic with grief when he thought of the torments of the impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moment of parting.</p>
                     <p>They ſupped together in Ortenberg's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the night before Elhenhorſt's departure. They mutually preſſed each other to eat, but their agony was ſo great as almoſt to render it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to ſwallow. They roſe from table without ſcarcely having touched a morſel. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would begin to ſpeak of the impending ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the thought of it was, nevertheleſs, the only one which occupied their ſouls entirely, rendering them incapable of thinking of any thing elſe, and laming their tongue, as it were, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other converſation. Elhenhorſt broke at laſt the painful ſilence:</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter">
                        <body>
                           <pb n="80" facs="unknown:037761_0079_100F05160B16C2A8"/>
                           <p>I hope, Ortenberg, you will write very often to me!" ſaid he, playing with his watch-chain, caſting his eyes to the ground, to conceal the tears which ſtarted from them.—"Undoubtedly!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Ortenberg with a half-ſtifled ſigh; and thus their converſation was again at an end. A game of cheſs now was propoſed and begun. But if it be true that this game is the game of kings, and that it bears the moſt ſtriking reſemblance to a battle: I would not adviſe a king to engage the enemy on a day when he is to be ſeparated from a dear friend. But how wildly am I talking? what king can ſay he has a real friend?—Our two he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes played like children, leaving their moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable men undefended without their being taken; ſtaring ſometimes half an hour idly at the board, and forgetting whoſe turn it was to move. The clock at laſt ſtruck ten, and Elhenhorſt prepared to depart. "Adieu, dear Elhenhorſt!" ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg haſtily, preſſing his hand with convulſive agony: "God bleſs and protect you." "We ſhall ſee each other once more to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," replied Elhenhorſt groaning, and left the apartment.</p>
                           <p>But no! they did not meet again. Ortenberg foreſaw that the final parting ſcene would be too much for his and his friend's heart, and tend only to make them feel all the pangs of ſeparation with additional bitterneſs. He had, indeed, promiſed to be at Elhenhorſt's apartment early next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; however, he took a walk to a neighbouring village, and only left the following lines.</p>
                           <p>I am going to take a walk, to avoid taking leave. Farewell, dear Friend. God bleſs you! We ſhall, probably, meet no more in this world. I thank you for the numerous proofs of your
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037761_0080_100F0518742F5448"/>

                     <p>This note was ſtained with tears, and Elhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt's tears mingled themſelves with his. "Good God!" exclaimed he, trembling on ſtepping into the poſt-chaiſe, while he ſcarcely was able to ſtand on his feet; "how dear can a worthy friend render even the obſcureſt corner to us!"</p>
                     <p>Oh, how true, how true, is this remark!—And parting is doubly dreadful, if we know from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that friendſhip, kept up by letters, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grows cold by degrees, and at laſt dies entirely away. Should this world really be the beſt?—and if it were, ſhould not all good men who meet in it, love each other, and conſtantly united, live and act jointly for the good of their brethren? or is this idea too ſublime for this world?—Yes, we ſhall meet again in a better world, in the regions of purer bliſs, to attain, hand in hand, by active virtue, the higheſt degree of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>The two friends correſponded frequently in the beginning. Elhenhorſt informed his friend that he had made a journey to Berlin with his father; that he had been preſented to the king, and been ſo happy to pleaſe the monarch; that he, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, had the beſt proſpects before him, and expected to be ſoon promoted to a very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able poſt. Ortenberg put the letter haſtily in his pocket, took his hat and cane, running into the ſtreet, and aſking all his acquaintances he met, whether they had known Elhenhorſt? and when one replied in the affirmative, he informed him with the greateſt volubility and ſparkling eyes, of his friend's impending happineſs. However, the

correſpondence of the two friends was ſuddenly interrupted by a moſt melancholy incident.</p>

                           <p>I ſhould have been happy to inform you, my dear ſon, that all is well, and that I am cheerfully looking towards the joyful hour when I ſhould receive you again in my maternal arms; however, Providence has decreed it otherwiſe, and viſited me with a heavy affliction on the verge of the grave. Yet I kiſs the rod which chaſtiſes me, and pray every day to God to ſtrengthen you, my ſon, that you may be able to get through the trials which await you. Fate leads us frequently over extremely narrow and rugged roads; however, it alſo heals again the wounds which it inflicts. Old Summer, who had the management of our little property, is a bankrupt, and has diſappeared. I applied immediately to a lawyer; however, I had the affliction to be informed by him, that I have not the leaſt hope to recover any thing. You know that we always placed great confidence in old Summer, and intruſted him with all that we

The lawyer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, therefore, that we ought to think ourſelves happy, if we can recover twenty per cent. and even this, he thinks, will not be paid ſo ſoon as we may want it. God knows what will become of us, and how we ſhall be able to procure the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life. I will not judge.

                     <p>Young Ortenberg's heart was deeply wounded by the contents of this melancholy letter. He ſtood near half an hour motionleſs at the window, holding the fatal letter in his hand. Several peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who paſſed the houſe ſaluted him; however he ſaw them not. Some acquaintances of his wiſhed him a good morning as they paſſed by; but he heard it not. His mother—his Caroline—his mother and himſelf, rendered miſerable by the father of his miſtreſs—his Caroline reduced to poverty—All theſe ideas croſſed each other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and every one of them imprinted the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037761_0083_100ED4CE3A832040"/>
dreadful picture which it contained, deeply upon his mind. At laſt he rouſed himſelf from his ſtupor, and collected all his firmneſs, to prepare without delay for his departure from Frankfort. He had expected to receive a bill of exchange from his mother, and, conſequently, had contract<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a debt with his landlord, which amounted to about twenty dollars. He went down ſtairs, giving a faithful account of his misfortune, and requeſting him to take ſome pieces of wearing apparel, in lieu of payment. His landlord, a creditable and honeſt tradeſman, who loved Ortenberg as much as if he had been his own ſon, liſtened with great emotion to his melancholy tale, and proteſted ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly that no power on earth ſhould prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to commit ſuch a mean action, as he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly called it.</p>
                     <p>"Dear man!" ſaid Ortenberg, "this will do me no good; for I muſt ſell part of my clothes to raiſe, at leaſt, as much money as I ſhall want for my journey."</p>
                     <p>"Dear ſir!" replied, the landlord, "it grieves me to ſee that you place ſo little confidence in me. Would it not have done more credit to you, if you had come down ſtairs and ſaid, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, I am in ſuch and ſuch a ſituation; I ſhould be glad if you could lend me a sew paltry dollars. Is it worth while to make many words about ſuch a trifle? No, no! Mr. Ortenberg, I ſhall not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to ſell any of your clothes. You owe me twenty dollars; I will give you thirty more, if you will give me a bond for fifty. I am ſure you will pay me, as ſoon as it is convenient to you."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he put his hand in his pocket, took a key out of a leather purſe, and was going to open his bureau, to prove that he was ſerious in his offer. But Ortenberg, deeply affected by the generoſity of that worthy man, ſtopped him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="85" facs="unknown:037761_0084_100F051E53B2BD68"/>
"No, my worthy friend," ſaid he, with tears in his eyes: "my clothes are of no further uſe to me. Have I not told you, that I am poor? What occaſion have I in my preſent ſituation for coats laced with gold? I have ſtudied theology, and, conſequently, muſt dreſs according to cuſtom, as ſoon as I am returned to my native town, and wear black or ſome other modeſt colour. I have as little occaſion for my gold watch and my ſilver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilted ſword. I entreat you to take my ſcarlet coat, laced with gold, and the blue one, laced with ſilver, in lieu of payment. If you will lend me thirty dollars, I ſhall take it as a great favour; but inſiſt upon pawning my watch with you for that ſum."</p>
                     <p>They diſputed a great while before they could agree, and Ortenberg was, at laſt, prevailed upon, to give one of his laced coats, in lieu of payment, and to take the thirty dollars upon the other till he ſhould be able to redeem it.</p>
                     <p>I muſt obſerve, on this occaſion, that pride is a fault which my readers henceforth will frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve in Ortenberg, a fault which poverty alone can excuſe, and which ought to be found only among the poor.</p>
                     <p>"Farewell!" ſaid the honeſt citizen, when Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg got into the ſtage. "God protect you, and proſper all your undertakings.

                     <p>Ortenberg could not utter a word. He rode through the town gate, immerſed in gloomy apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. In the ſuburbs he paſſed through a ſtreet in which a new houſe had been built, over the door of which were engraven the words, <hi>This house is in the hand of the Lord.</hi> This was the firſt object that produced again an idea in his ſoul. "God!" thought he: "if that lifeleſs ſtructure be deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of thy protection, my fate muſt alſo be in thy hand. I will not complain, nor murmur; your ways are often dark and thorny, however the goal—although it ſhould preſent itſelf firſt beyond the grave—will be worth the ſtrife." Alas! poor young man, the bittereſt ſtrife awaits thee yet.</p>
                     <p>It began to dawn when he beheld the walls of his native town again. He alighted at the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and haſtened immediately to his mother's abode. The windows were open, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unaccountable to him, as the cold ſtill was pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſevere. Merciful God!—when he entered the houſe—he beheld his mother in her coffin. A ſcene like this cannot be deſcribed; and I ſhall leave the melancholy taſk to the imagination and feelings of my readers. His mother had left a letter for him. He opened it impatiently, and read:</p>

                           <p>I perceived clearly that you will not be able to arrive ſo ſoon as my ſanguine wiſhes flattered me you would. I am ſenſible that God has heard my prayers, and will take me from this world in a few days. Rejoice, my dear ſon, rejoice with me at my impending diſſolution. Nothing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters my death but the idea that the ſituation in which I leave you, is not as good as I ſhould wiſh and you deſerve. However, you have learnt ſomething; truſt in God, and he will direct all for the beſt. Confidence in God, my dear ſon, leads to happineſs here and hereafter. Miſs Summer has been with me ſeveral days, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and nurſed me. The good child frets ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much at the injury which her father has done to me. However, it is not her fault, and I have not arraigned her for it. Neither, I hope,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037761_0086_100F0522379F78B0"/>
will you, my dear ſon. She now is, indeed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to poverty; however, ſhe is of a laborious turn, and fears God. I give you my maternal bleſſing, if you ever ſhould be able to marry her. God bleſs you, and make you happy here and hereafter. Amen. If my eldeſt ſon, Nicolaus, ever ſhould return again, you may tell him that I bleſſed him on my death-bed, and that I quit this world without entertaining the leaſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him. I hope you will bury me in the vault where the remains of my dear huſband are entombed. God knows, I always intended to leave a ſmall legacy to the poor; but the Lord who gave it, has taken it again; praiſed be his holy name. I ſhould, indeed, have wiſhed to hear you preach once before my death; however, God has denied me that pleaſure; I ſubmit to his paternal will. I now ſhall lay down the pen, after having bid you once more adieu; for, I am ſo weak as not to be able to write another line.</p>
                           <p>Merciful God, receive me into thy paternal arms, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Amen.</p>

                     <p>The ſoul of the young man was rent with the moſt excruciating agony, while he peruſed theſe mournful lines; one tear chaſed the other, and convulſive groans deprived him of the power of utterance. He indulged his grief five mournful days in his lonely habitation, without knowing what he was doing. Five melancholy days elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without his having even inquired after his equally unfortunate Caroline. No one came near him but an old maid ſervant, who had known him when a child, and ſhared happineſs and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune many years with his family. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, at laſt, of her own accord, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline had entered into the ſervice of an old la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037761_0087_100F052431189A80"/>
as waiting-woman, and had been in the houſe the day before his arrival, to ſee his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's corpſe once more. She added ſhe had wept bitterly, but ſeemed to be pretty well recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to her new ſituation.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg ſcarcely had heard this account, when his love for Caroline returned again with redoubled force. He diſpatched the ſervant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, to let her know that he intended to pay her a viſit. During the ſervant's abſence he felt for the firſt time that ſweet anxiety, that anxious throbbing of heart, which every young man will have felt while he looked impatiently and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the watch, counting every minute till the wiſhed-for moment arrived. Ortenberg obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the firſt time, that his ſervant was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſlow, that ſhe crept like a ſnail, and was very unfit to be employed as a <hi>Postillon d' amour.</hi> She returned at laſt, and delivered a ſealed note, which contained the following lines.</p>

                     <p>Caroline was no romantic heroine. She had a humane heart; but this and weakneſs, are almoſt inſeparable. It was with the greateſt difficulty ſhe had wrote the afore-mentioned letter to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg. She had not expected to receive ſuch a wild, deſpairing anſwer, and therefore was not able to perſiſt in her reſolution. Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn her, ye fair ones, for not having been gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with enthuſiaſtic punctilio; I would lay any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that not one of you would have acted otherwiſe in a ſimilar ſituation. Caroline ſent word to Ortenberg, that ſhe expected to ſee him at ten o'clock the next morning.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the firſt ſtorm had abated, and the lovers were again able to caſt the anchor of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they began to look out for a ſafe port, to which they could ſteer with united exertion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, men think and meditate frequently with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abating aſſiduity, and when they imagine they have found out ſomething entirely new, generally hit upon an object which would have preſented itſelf to their view, at firſt ſight, if they but had had eyes to ſee it. Ortenberg and Caroline had been cloſeted and conſulting above two hours, when they agreed that Ortenberg ſhould apply to the conſiſtory, to examine, and qualify him for
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:037761_0090_100F052A9E4F8968"/>
the poſſeſſion of a living, and that Caroline ſhould remain in the ſervice of her lady, till this wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for object was attained. The lady rung the bell, and Caroline intimated to Ortenberg, that it was time for him to go, but made him promiſe, before he went, to viſit her only once every week, leſt he ſhould expoſe her to the calumny of buſy goſſips. The condition was, indeed, very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; however, he was ſufficiently indemnified for his ſelf-denial, when the long wiſhed for Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day came, and Ortenberg, could rove his native fields, by the ſide of his dear Caroline. No routs nor ſplendid feaſts can afford pleaſures like thoſe which he felt on theſe occaſions. Oh Heavens, what a ſcene of bliſs would it afford, if it were poſſible to eſtabliſh a club conſiſting entirely of lovers—provided the number were even.</p>

                     <p>HALF a year had now elapſed! Ortenberg was examined before the whole conſiſtory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much well merited applauſe, and at laſt
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037761_0091_100F052C92DEEEC0"/>
was diſmiſſed, with the ſtrongeſt promiſes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promoted to the firſt living that ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vacant. However, theſe reverend gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, know after the next quarter of an hour, as little of their promiſes made to an honeſt fellow not to let him ſtarve, as the crutch knows that the lame leans upon it. Ortenberg knew this by the experience of others. He therefore did not think it prudent to expend the ſmall ſum which he had obtained by ſelling ſome uſeleſs furniture, and to rely implicitly upon the faith of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend patrons. He made ſeveral attempts to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the place of a tutor. But wearing his own hair, contrary to the cuſtom of all divines of his times; his endeavours were entirely fruitleſs, and he ſaw himſelf neceſſiated to keep an obſcure day ſchool, in which he inſtructed the children of trades people, for a ſmall monthly ſtipend.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg earned by that deſpiſed though ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable occupation, ſcarcely as much as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport his life. The confuſion in which the death of his mother had involved him, the preparation for his examination, and the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his ſchool, had hitherto taken up the greateſt part of his time, and cauſed him to leave two of Elhenhorſt's letters unanſwered. Elhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt knew not what to think of his ſilence, and wrote a long epiſtle to his ſilent friend—in which he loudly complained of his ſuppoſed neglect, and murmured at his own melancholy fate.</p>
                     <p>Grief and uneaſineſs really overclouded poor Elhenhorſt's days. He had obtained the poſt which the king had promiſed him. He acquired honour and wealth, and had reaſon to hope to riſe higher in a ſhort time. However, his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors, ſeeing that he diſcharged his duty with unremitted zeal, had burthened him with ſuch a load of buſineſs, as left him little time for recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

If a young man who is buried the whole week among a heap of duſty documents, and has even on a Sunday only a few hours to ſpare, which he is doomed to kill at the card table,—if ſuch a young man is not to complain, he really muſt be as unfeeling as a block, and deſtitute of all noble ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg was deeply affected by the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly epiſtle of his friend. He anſwered it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, imputing his long ſilence to the death of his mother, and his public examination. He mentioned, indeed, that he had loſt all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty through old Summer's bankruptcy, but was too proud to complain, or to drop only a ſingle word about the utter want of the neceſſaries of life, to which he frequently was reduced. He aſſured his friend, on the contrary, that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for nothing; that he was in hopes of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a comfortable living, and ſhould ſoon be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the arms of his Caroline. Thus their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence had been taken up again, and was carried on regularly till Elhenhorſt's untimely death interrupted it.</p>
                     <p>Caroline had the misfortune to get acquainted with a wretch who poiſoned all the pleaſures of her life, and rendered it an almoſt uninterrupted train of miſery. The lady in whoſe ſervice ſhe was, was a proud conceited fool, a puppet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſoul, who had no other merit but that which ſhe derived from her pedigree, and entertained a very ſuſpicious connection with a certain Colonel, whom we already have introduced to our readers on a former occaſion. As the principal aim of the robuſt Colonel and the wanton lady tended entirely to enjoy the world, and to give variety to their pleaſures, <hi>he</hi> was always provided with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing men ſervants, and <hi>she</hi> took care never to be without a pretty waiting maid, which enabled
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037761_0093_100F053082B47D58"/>
them to aſſiſt each other in caſe of neceſſity. She had not informed Caroline of this honourable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, becauſe ſhe imagined this was entirely ſuperfluous, and, beſides, took it for granted, that a young woman in her humble ſituation would be proud of having a Colonel, who, beſides, was a nobleman, for an admirer.</p>
                     <p>Caroline was ſitting in her apartment, on a hot ſummer's day, thinly attired, on account of the intolerable heat. The Colonel, who had not found her lady at home, entered her chamber, and ſeated himſelf oppoſite her, aſſailing the bluſhing girl with jokes, to which no chaſte ear can liſten without indignation. A look of Caroline's flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye, which could have confounded impudence itſelf, lamed his tongue a few moments. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, heroes of the toilet like him are not eaſily frightened. "The fortreſs is beautiful!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, with a ſelf-ſufficient ſmile: "I muſt ſtorm it!"</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he extended his hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Caroline's neck handkerchief. Caroline ſtarted up, anger and contempt glowed in her countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Colonel! I ſhall complain to my lady of your rudeneſs!"</p>

The Baroneſs perceived it in the looking-glaſs, before which ſhe was ſtanding, examining the damage which her coeffure had received; for, ſhe was not uſed to condeſcend honouring her woman with a look. "Why have you been crying?" aſked ſhe negligently. "The Colonel," replied Caroline, while a torrent of tears guſhed from her eyes, "has treated me like the moſt abandoned woman."</p>
                     <p>"How!" ſaid the Baroneſs, with faſhionable indifference.</p>
                     <p>Caroline repeated her complaint.</p>

                        <p>It is, indeed, a great misfortune for a girl like you to be liked by a Colonel, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, is a handſome man, has conquered more hearts than enemies, and ought by no means to be denied a favour by you.</p>

                     <p>So ſaying, ſhe went to the harpſichord, and played a country-dance, without taking any further notice of Caroline, who went in an agony of deſpair to her apartment, and moiſtened her knitting with tears.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg, unfortunately, came that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moment, contrary to his uſual cuſtom, to pay her a viſit, informing her, with a cheerful countenance that he was in hopes to obtain a comfortable living in a ſhort time. The words died on his lips when he perceived her woeful ſituation. We ſhall not inquire whether Caroline did right or wrong in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming him of the inſult which ſhe had ſuffered from the Colonel and her lady. Suffice it to ſay, that ſhe repreſented her forlorn ſituation faithfully to him; that ſhe had no other friend beſides him, that he entreated her in the moſt affectionate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to conceal nothing from him; and that ſhe thought her connexion with him required the moſt unreſerved confidence. She ought, indeed to have forſeen the fatal conſequences of her frankneſs. However, who can eſcape his deſtiny?</p>

                     <p>ORTENBERG's heart was torn with the moſt excruciating agony during Caroline's relation. It was impoſſible a proud and noble mind like his could have brooked ſuch a daring and ſhameful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. He was ſeized, for the firſt time in his life, with frantic fury. His eyes rolled wildly in their ſockets, his veins ſwelled, and his nerves were convulſed. He ruſhed out of the apartment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liſtening to Caroline's anxious ſcreams, ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inebriated with fury, through the ſtreet, and was almoſt ſenſeleſs when he entered his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He wrapped himſelf in a long cloak, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing a ruſty ſword under it, and flew to the Colonel's houſe. The latter was not at home, and Ortenberg meaſured the anti-chamber with haſty ſtrides, firmly reſolved not to quit the houſe, until he ſhould have avenged Caroline's injury. He
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037761_0097_100F05390C907DE0"/>
waited a long time for the Colonel, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had time to recover from his blood-thirſty frenzy. A thouſand doubts began to croſs each other in his mind. He began to reflect on the fatal conſequences which this action would unavoidably produce; he ſhuddered at the idea of murdering a fellow-creature, or depriving Caroline, by his own death, of her only protector, and his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began to waver, his blood grew cooler, and he was already on the point of quitting the houſe, when the Colonel entered the anti-chamber. The ſight of that unfeeling wretch overturned at once all his good reſolutions. His blood began again to ferment violently, and he followed his rival to his cloſet. The Colonel ſtarted on ſeeing a man in his cloſet, who was an utter ſtranger to him, and whoſe eyes flaſhed with an unuſual ferocity.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037761_0098_100F053A8E87C1D0"/>

God forbid! your bride is your bride, but nevertheleſs a charming girl. Or ſhould I not do juſtice to her beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is your bride? This would be ſingular, indeed. I ſhall not hinder you from inhaling the ſmell of a fragrant flower which blows in my garden although it is my property. Why ſhould we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to break each other's neck for ſuch a trifle. Take this purſe, it contains, an hundred Louis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d'ors—</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Ortenberg could contain himſelf no longer. "Villain! defend yourſelf!" exclaimed he, flying furiouſly at the Colonel. The latter ſcarcely had
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:037761_0099_100F055C393971D0"/>
time to draw his ſword and to hold it againſt the furious young man. But more was not wanting for his defence. Ortenberg being blinded by rage and unſkilled in fencing, ran into the Colonel's ſword and received a deep wound in the abdomen, which however was not mortal. "You ſee what it is to be too haſty!" ſaid the Colonel, ſneering, and rung for his valet. A ſurgeon was ſent for: Ortenberg's wound was dreſſed, and the Colonel ſent him home in his carriage.</p>
                     <p>This incident is the moſt evident proof that my tale is no fiction; for if it were, Ortenberg would have pierced the Colonel like a ſecond Grandiſon, and kicked all his ſervants valiantly down ſtairs. But as all the events which we relate of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg family happened in a very natural man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and as it is conſiſtent with the regular courſe of nature that a cool ſoldier ſhould run a furious divine through, the Colonel conquered, and the unfortunate young man was carried wounded to bed.</p>
                     <p>The malicious conqueror ſtood before the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, repairing his locks, and having wiped the heroic ſweat from his martial brow, rode to the Baroneſs.</p>
                     <p>"I have had the moſt comical incident!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he on entering the apartment: "<hi>le Diable m'emporte,</hi> your ladyſhip is waited on by enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed princeſſes."</p>

                     <p>With theſe words he ſkipped out of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtroking his calves, whiſtling an air, taking
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037761_0100_100ED4D3AD1A6AD0"/>
a looking glaſs out of his pocket to admire his pretty face, and went into Caroline's chamber. The unfortunate girl was juſt upon her knees in a corner of her chamber, imploring Providence to preſerve her innocence and to protect her lover.</p>
                     <p>It was dangerous for the Colonel to ſee a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at prayers, becauſe he always apprehended on ſuch occaſions to be choaked. He raiſed a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing horſe-laugh. Caroline turned round, caſting a contemptuous look at the wild wretch, and was going to quit the apartment. The Colonel ſtopt her.</p>
                     <p>"Stop a little, my angel! I ſhall ſoon have done (laughing violently).

                     <p>When he had told her he had run him through, Caroline ejaculated a loud ſcream, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint. However, her apprehenſion for her lover's life ſoon animated her again with new

ſtrength. She hit the Colonel a violent blow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the breaſt, which made him reel.</p>
                     <p>"Ortenberg wounded!" exclaimed ſhe: "God curſe you, vile villain!" She ruſhed into the ſtreet undreſſed as ſhe was. Not a thought of propriety came into her mind; Ortenberg's wound was conſtantly before her eyes; ſhe ſeemed to fly, and before five minutes had elapſed, ſtood trembling at Ortenberg's bed ſide.</p>
                     <p>"Charles!"</p>
                     <p>"Caroline!"</p>
                     <p>She was dragged from the bed. The poor young man was ſufficiently tormented by agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ideas; her compaſſionate and almoſt frantic love would have killed him in that moment. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline was not admitted again before the ſeventh day, when he began to mend. They moaned, wept and ſighed together; however there was no remedy againſt this misfortune.</p>
                     <p>Caroline had quitted the houſe of the Baron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs immediately, and, in the ſimplicity of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent heart, entered into the ſervice of an old woman, who was thought to be a lady of rank, and concealed the moſt contemptible ſoul under the maſk of artificial piety. Envy and avarice were the principal ingredients of her character, and varniſhed with canting devotion—She was formerly a coquette, and now a procureſs, when a young rake had ſufficient money to bribe her. She went frequently to church, ſung the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norous diſcant in the whole pariſh, and her eyes were red with crying in the drieſt ſermon. She boaſted much of her exemplary piety, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to converſe with ſuperior ſpirits. She even ſank never into the arms of a lover at the time when ſhe acted the part of a wanton co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette with applauſe, without aſſuring him with tears in her eyes, that he was the firſt man upon
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037761_0102_100F05408AC22A68"/>
whom ſhe beſtowed her favours conquered by the omnipotence of love. She was a moſt garrulous talker, and knew the art of diſtending and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging ſo much upon the moſt trifling incident, as if it were a piece of elaſtic yarn and her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors marble ſtatues of patience. She had read the bible above ſeventy times, and the revelation of St. John 133 times. She kept a faithful jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of every thing that happened in the town and in her houſe, ſubjoining always pious remarks to it. As ſhe was proud to ſhow that journal to every one that wiſhed to ſee it, I think giving a few ſamples of it to the reader will not be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an act of indiſcretion:</p>
                     <p>May 16. At four o'clock in the afternoon my next door neighbour's chimney was on fire, which, however, unfortunately, was ſoon extinguiſhed. Oh my merciful Saviour, extinguiſh the confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of his ſins, leſt he ſhould be hurled down into the eternal fire from whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                     <p>May 20. Sewed peaſe. Oh, thou Holy Father in Heaven, extirpate the thiſtle out of the ſinful hearts of my fellow chriſtians and ſow the peaſe of thy grace into them.</p>
                     <p>June 1. Finiſhed the peruſal of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſeventy-fourth time. Oh, thou Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, be merciful unto thy unworthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Anna Maria of Xantippendale, that ſhe may be able to glorify thy name, and to edify thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful neighbours by reading it as many times again.</p>
                     <p>July 13. Had my whole houſe white-waſhed. Oh, thou Holy Father in Heaven, waſh away the manyfold ſins of my proud neighbour; leſt Satan ſhould put her one time into his large waſh tub.</p>
                     <p>July 23. Bought Eaſt Indian handkerchiefs. Oh, thou bloody Saviour, ſave the poor Indians
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037761_0103_100F0542E8CE1350"/>
from the clutches of Satan; for, they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the incarnate Godhead.</p>
                     <p>Aug. 2. Heard a very edifying diſcourſe on Chriſtian ſelf-denial, preached by the Rev. <hi>Dr. Hornbelly,</hi> during which I had ſhed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of tears. Mrs. Wolman, that wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſat at my right hand without ſhedding one poor tear of contrition. God judge that proud woman! ſhe put a hard dollar into the plate for the poor orphans, out of mere vanity.</p>
                     <p>Aug. 15. Took Miſs Summer into the houſe. Oh, thou Supporter of widows and orphans, move the compaſſion of men, that they may commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſituation of that pretty child, and my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bear fruits hundred and thouſand fold.</p>
                     <p>Sept. 1. Had the misfortune to draw blood in beating a ſick beggar girl, while I chaſtiſed her with Chriſtian meekneſs, to make her ſenſible that ſhe ſhould not beg alms for her blind father and herſelf, of a poor woman like me. The wicked juſtice ſentenced me to pay a fine of 20 dollars, for which my merciful father in heaven will damn him here and hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Sep. 9. Old Meyer, the merchant, broke a leg. A viſible judgment of God; becauſe he is ſo rich, and a devoted ſlave to his mammon.</p>
                     <p>Oct. 6. The lightning ſtruck into the church of St. Andrew, and damaged the pew of Lady D. Oh, thou wonderful Jeſus! the wicked wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had left it an hour before.</p>
                     <p>Dec. 1. Killed a pig. Oh, thou lovely Jeſus! convert the impious Jews, that they may eat pork. Amen.</p>
                     <p>This will be ſufficient for my readers to form an idea of a character, which was a mixture of malice and abſurdity; the former was concealed by the latter, like an aſſaſſin, who is diſguiſed by the maſk of a faun. The gentle Caroline
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037761_0104_100F0544AF2945D0"/>
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined only that ſhe was a ſingular woman, to whoſe oddities ſhe muſt accommodate herſelf; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe did not reliſh her mode of life, which was occupied with nothing elſe but praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſcolding, railing againſt the wicked world, curſing the impudence of beggars, complaining of the dearneſs of proviſions; raſping tobacco, and combing dogs; yet ſhe thought herſelf ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently happy to be free from all perſecutions, and to wait for the developement of her fate in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the buſtle of the world.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg now had completely recovered from his wound. The Colonel had not failed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his proweſs in all companies, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the unfortunate young man in the moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous light. The children pointed with their fingers at Ortenberg when he went abroad the firſt time. "Be patient, my poor heart," ſaid he by himſelf: "The living which I am to have, will indemnify me for all my ſufferings. I ſhall not care for all the world, when I am houſed in my peaceful parſonage with my dear Caroline; I will perform my duties faithfully, love my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners, cheriſh my wife, and live happy, quiet and unenvied, enjoying the bleſſings of God with a grateful heart."</p>
                     <p>Poor, deluded man!</p>
                     <p>He reſolved to apply the next day to all the reverend gentlemen who had to diſpoſe of his fate, and to remind them of their promiſes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before we proceed farther, my duty as a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer requires, I ſhould make my readers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the characters of the reverend pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of our hero.</p>

                     <p>HIS Excellency Baron Alexander, of Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenburzel, was preſident of the Conſiſtory. He was famous for ſpeaking little and eating much. He never went to the court of Conſiſtory with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having his pockets ſtored with cakes. He generally fell aſleep as ſoon as he had finiſhed his laſt cake, and when he awoke, ſaid <hi>Yes.</hi> This is all that we can ſay of him.</p>
                     <p>Further: The Right Reverend Father in God, Joſeph Lactantius Ignatius Hogſtyerius, Biſhop of D**, and member of ſeven Academies of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and of twenty-two Latin and German So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties. He was a man after God's own heart, who was not for external pomp, but humbly, and with ſelf denial, walked the thorny path of life. He was ſix feet three inches high, and the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of his venerable belly, was two feet five inches. A large wig as white as ſnow, contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pleaſantly and awfully with his black beard and eye-brows. His gait was graced with Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh grandezza. One of his hands reclined upon the abovementioned venerable belly when he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

in the ſtreet, while the other diſpenſed the benediction to the multitude. The writings which immortalized his name, conſiſted in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemic of 37 quarto volumes, 134 Diſſertations, and 572 Sermons againſt the pleaſures of the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Flavia Roſamunda Shnurr was a fatherleſs and motherleſs orphan, 43 years old. She had known the venerable prelate when he was a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, and always received many ſpiritual and corporeal benefactions from him. She now had ſuperintended his houſe and kitchen more than ſeventeen years, and was aſſiſted in the diſcharge of her domeſtic duties, by five foundlings who had been ſound at different times at the door of the pious man, and owed their education to his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity. Further:</p>
                     <p>The Reverend Godfrey Godhart Godhelp Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god Blockheadius, Archdeacon of St. Bernard, whom his mother had qualified for a Saint from his baptiſm, by the number of Godly names which he received. He was a little man; his face was broad, and his eyes were always half cloſed. They flowed with tears at the ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, whenever he opened them. His whole life was devoted to mourning at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity of the world. For this reaſon, he had alſo a prevailing predilection for the black colour. His wig was black, the face of his wife was of a blackiſh hue, his arm chair was covered black, and his domeſtic animals conſiſted of a black cat, a black dog, a black cock, black cows and horſes, and his favourite diſh was black pudding.</p>
                     <p>The fourth arbiter of Ortenberg's fate was the Reverend Doctor Fipſnoſius, two feet eight inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es high, very meagre, gifted with a ſqueaking voice, and graced with a large protuberence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

buckles when he raiſed his eyes to Heaven, and he appeared to be a dwarf when he ſtood by the ſide of the Right Reverend Father in God Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantius Ignatius Hogſtyerius. He was very proud of his preaching ex-tempore. He wore a well powdered wig, and as the pulpit was rather high, his preſence could be perceived only by a cloud of powder which roſe from his head, as often as he ſhook it in the heat of eloquence. Through this cloud a reprimanding voice was heard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming howling, and gnaſhing of teeth to his pariſhoners. He imitated that howling ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as to make his auditors imagine they heard the damned moaning in full chorus. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways willing to lend upon pledges, "becauſe," ſaid he, "we are commanded by ſcripture not to bury our talents." When Ortenberg came to him, he had juſt finiſhed a Sermon upon the parable of the rich publican.</p>
                     <p>The laſt perſon with whoſe character we have to acquaint the reader, is the Reverend <hi>Doctor Theologiae et Philosophae,</hi> Olearius Mauritius Calfs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headius. Famine and his perſon ſeemed to be twins. His chin was one of the longeſt in the whole kingdom, and his body ſeemed to be a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſkeleton. His bones rattled when he lifted up his hand, and thoſe that came near him could eaſily count his ribs. His Sermons were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lectures upon the Syriac and Chaldean. Theſe languages occupied his ideas ſo much that he, one time, in his abſence of mind, read the goſpel of the paralytic, and held a ſermon on the golden calf. Another time he was ſent for to the houſe of a ſick perſon, but being juſt occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with finding out the root of a Syriac word, he went by miſtake into a houſe of bad fame, where he inſtantly was ſurrounded by three ladies of pleaſure. He awoke at laſt from his Syriac
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037761_0108_100F054D291B9EE0"/>
reverie, and fled with horror from that abode of infamy. However, the neighbours who had ſeen him go in, ſhook their heads with indignation, and exclaimed "Good God, what buſineſs had our paſtor in a brothel?" Dame Fame had ſpread this news all over the town before a quarter of an hour had elapſed. "Have you heard of it?" ſaid an old toothleſs matron to a neighbour. "For goodneſs ſake don't mention it; it grieves me to think of that ſcandalous incident."</p>
                     <p>"Such an old man ought to be aſhamed to go to a public ſtew."</p>
                     <p>"Merciful Heaven, what a ſcandal!" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Right Reverend Father Hogſtyerius. "Make no proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof," ſaid he to Miſs Flavia Roſamunda Shnurr.</p>
                     <p>"I thought it would come to that!" groaned the Archdeacon Blockheadius; "the world is verging towards diſſolution!" "Indeed, it does!" ſqueaked Doctor Fipſnoſius, while he was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in filling ſome ducats. The poor, guiltleſs Calfſheadius was ſummoned before the tribunal of his colleagues, and would have been ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from office, if he had not proved that it was impoſſible for him to viſit a houſe of pleaſure for carnal purpoſes.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE given a faithful picture of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſupporters of the church, on whoſe nods our heroe's ſate depended. Ortenberg, dreſſed in his beſt black ſuit, from which the old faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant carefully had bruſhed every atom of duſt, his unpowdered hair curled into a round ſwelling lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k, ſtepped, with every mark of ſupplicating humility in his countenance, to the gilt portal of his Excellency Baron of Sturzenburzel. Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg's pride ſubmitted this time willingly to the bitter neceſſity of meaſuring an anti-chamber with humble ſteps. Our hero who always trembled with indignation at the name of a paraſite of the great, imagined that now he was doing nothing but to what he was intitled by the public proofs which he had given of his abilities. Poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded young man! Right depends upon power: power upon gold, and the gold is in the poſſeſſion of malicious fools.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="unknown:037761_0110_100F055221E46828"/>
"They have promiſed it to me," ſaid Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg by himſelf. Unexperienced youth! go and build thy houſe upon ſand; but reſt not thy hopes upon the promiſes of the great. The wind which a fly produces by the motion of her wing, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to overturn all thy airy caſtles.</p>
                     <p>The hope of being bleſſed with Caroline's hand, finally conquered all difficulties which Ortenberg's pride threw in his way.</p>
                     <p>A Swiſs, dreſſed in a ſcarlet livery, decked with gold, ſtood at the portal. His plump hands were negligently folded on his back. His thick head ſcorned to return a kind nod to the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's ſalutation, and his greedy eyes ſtared at Ortenberg's hands; but alas! they were as emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as his pockets. "My lord is not at home!" grunted the hireling. Ortenberg perceived the preſident's head in that very moment at one of the windows of the dining room, and informed the ſurly Cerberus of this diſcovery.</p>
                     <p>"That may be," replied the brute, in the moſt indifferent accent: "I tell you, nevertheleſs, my lord is not at home. So ſaying, he turned his back on the confounded young man, pinching the roſy cheek of a milk woman, who was paſſing by.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg retired. The following diſcourſe took place in his heart:</p>

                     <p>Pride was ſilent, and Ortenberg ſucceeded the next morning in obtaining admittance to the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.

                     <p>The valet's tongue made a ſhort pauſe, to wait for the effect which he expected to reſult from the diſcovery of his rank. But when he heard that Ortenberg replied only by a dry <hi>So!</hi> he thought it would be neceſſary he ſhould add a few words more, to make the petitioner ſenſible of the importance of his poſt. He hemmed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with an air of open dignity, ſpit in his ſilk pocket handkerchief, played with his watch chain, and looked at a ſparkling ring of paſte, which he wore on his finger. In this judicious poſture he

He had never met with a ſimilar reception. To ſee a propoſal, which, in his opinion, ought to be accepted with rapturous gratitude, rejected with the moſt inſupportable indifference, was more than the philoſophy of a valet could bear. However, the wretch was too much of a courtier, not to be able to conceal his vexation. He was, indeed, extremely diſtreſſed about a proviſion for his old aunt, and reſolved, therefore, to try once more what could be done. Being apprehenſive the diſcourſe would ſtagnate entirely, if he ſuffered the ſtranger to recover, from the high opinion of his conſequence with which he thought he had inſpired him, he reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it ſo quickly, that he even did not know what he was going to ſay:</p>

"I have alſo—I could alſo—I am a—" <hi>A Knave!</hi> cried a parrot in a diſtant corner of the room, whom Ortenberg had not yet noticed. <hi>A Knave!</hi> repeated the parrot diſtinctly, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg laughed. The face of the valet was covered with a ſcarlet hue; he caſt a furious look at the innocent bird, and attempted in vain to make the honey of his eloquence flow again.</p>
                     <p>"Never mind, my good fellow!" ſaid Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, rather contemptuouſly; "don't let us kill time with uſeleſs talk. Tell your maſter that I wiſh to wait upon him."</p>

You muſt come again ſome other time." Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg ſmiled, and left the conceited upſtart.</p>

                     <p>With theſe words love turned to pride, careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, and preſenting two pictures which ſhe had haſtily drawn. One repreſented the helpleſs Ortenberg, and the unprotected Caroline; and the other Ortenberg in Caroline's arms. Unfeeling pride glanced ſeveral times at them, and began to doze a little.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg appeared the next morning again in the preſident's anti-chamber. His Excellency was one of thoſe people, who, having experienced no want themſelves, are not capable of forming an idea of the miſery of their brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin, not out of malice, but from unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able weakneſs and unfeelingneſs, which render their ſtate ſo comfortable, that they carefully avoid every opportunity by which it could be diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>His anti-chamber was every day crowded with half-famiſhed ſkeletons, who, every morning with faſting ſtomachs, ſaw the fragrant breakfaſt of their patron carrying through the apartment in which
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037761_0115_100ED4D1CE9AD888"/>
they were uſed to dance attendance. They were indefatigable in paying their humble reſpects to the voluptuous arbiter of their fate; but ſcarcely were honoured with a kind nod of the head du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a life-long twelve-month, ſpent in uſeleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and many of them were urged by gnawing hunger to ſteal the parrot's almonds. If his Excellency's belly was wanted to aſſiſt at ſome public breakfaſt, he ſneaked away through a back gate, flinging himſelf into his gilt chariot, and withdrew from the hollow eyes of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clients. His parrot ſoon learned to pronounce the words <hi>Oh God!</hi> very diſtinctly. Whole mountains of duſty petitions, whoſe authors had died of hunger long ſince, lay towered up in his ſtudy, as he called the apartment in which he ſigned his name <hi>once</hi> in a month. <hi>A sumptuous treat</hi> was, beſides the powerful recommendation of his valet, the only infallible means of obtaining his conſet to a petition. The poor endeavoured to move his heart, and the rich tickled his palate; the poor miſſed their aim, and the rich always car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their object.</p>
                     <p>Our hero certainly could not have obtained acceſs to his ſitting room, neither on that nor any other day, if accident had not befriended him. The air was extremely ſultry, the rays of the ſun had releaſed millions of inſects from their temporary priſons, and an immenſe number of flies had taken poſt on a cold veniſon paſty, upon which the Baron intended to breakfaſt. His Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was, indeed, not remiſs in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repel the hoſtile army, but his fleſhy arm was ſoon tired, and the flies returned always in great numbers; he rung, therefore, the bell, and ordered his people to be ſummoned to attack the bold intruders with united forces. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing allies appeared without delay: John, the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:037761_0116_100F055DC0B9A370"/>
huntſman, with a net, which originally was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to catch larks; William, his running foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with a napkin tied to a pole; Robert, the cook, with his kitchen apron faſtened to a ſkim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and Samuel, the coachman, with a broom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, which was armed with a horſe tail. The commanding general addreſſed his faithful allies in the following pathetic manner: Thoſe d***d flies inveſt every morſel I am going to eat. Knock every one of them down, and let not one eſcape, that could give me further diſturbance!"</p>
                     <p>After this energetic addreſs had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all windows and doors were thrown open, and a general chaſe began; when the routed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſuddenly retreated through the windows. A large column took their flight through the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, and aſſailed Ortenberg, who inſtantly took out his pocket handkerchief, and attacked them with ſo much ardour, that large drops of ſweat ran down his face.</p>
                     <p>His Excellency, who was ſitting oppoſite the door, condeſcended graciouſly to obſerve, that a hungry client aſſiſted voluntarily in putting his enemies to flight. The great man was ſeized with a ſudden fit of laughter, which was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commonly beneficial to his noble ſtomach, as to make his appetite return with additional energy. The pleaſure which this afforded to the worthy preſident, prompted his Excellency to make a gracious ſign to Ortenberg with his left hand to draw nearer. Our hero obeyed the kind invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſtantly, after an humble bow.</p>

My cook's ſon is alſo a man of uncommon merit beſides his great eloquence. You would be aſtoniſhed were I to enumerate all his good qualifications. He knows, for inſtance, to preſerve fruit— <stage>(His Excellency ſcarcely could keep his eyes open)</stage>—and can drink—drink—</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Here the great man ſuddenly extended his arms and legs, while the thoughtful head ſank upon the left ſhoulder. He muttered a few more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken accents, and ſoon ſignified by a loud ſnoring that the audience was at an end, and Ortenberg had no hopes left.</p>
                     <p>Our hero now proceeded to the houſe of the Right Reverend Father in God Hogſtyerius, well knowing that he was the leading man in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and frequently had ſilenced the preſident by his ſonorious voice. He ſtill knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould laugh or grieve at the ſingular manner in which he had been received by the preſident. But when he reflected upon the broom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick with the horſe tail, the veniſon paſty, and the chaſe of the flies, he was ſuddenly ſeized with a loud fit of laughing in the open ſtreet. This happened, unfortunately, juſt when he was within a few ſteps of the prelate's houſe, who was ſmoking a pipe of canaſter at the window, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently blowing the ſmoke into the ſtreet. It was a ſhocking ſight for his Saintſhip to ſee Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, that great ſinner, laugh in the ſtreet. He held the ſubſequent philoſophical ſoliloquy while Ortenberg aſcended the ſtairs:</p>
                     <p>"That fellow has laughed."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:037761_0119_100F056497857818"/>
"Either with or without cauſe."</p>
                     <p>"In the latter caſe, he is a downright fool."</p>
                     <p>"Should the former be the caſe, he either has laughed at me, or at ſome other object."</p>
                     <p>"If he has laughed at me, he will be damned for ever and ever!"</p>
                     <p>"But ſhould he have laughed at ſome other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I cannot conceive how the conſcience of ſuch an atrocious ſinner can permit him to laugh."</p>
                     <p>The reſult of the whole ſoliloquy was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as my reader will eaſily gueſs:</p>
                     <p>"Ortenberg is a ſinner."</p>
                     <p>"He can laugh, and, conſequently, is not even ſenſible of his being a ſinner."</p>
                     <p>"A hardened ſinner will be doomed to howl and to gnaſh his teeth."</p>
                     <p>"Ergo, Ortenberg muſt howl and gnaſh his teeth."</p>
                     <p>The charitable prelate rejoiced inwardly at his philoſophical genius when he had brought forth his excellent concluſion. He contracted his briſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eye-brows when Ortenberg opened the door of his apartment, and called to him with a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering voice,</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Ortenberg, what do you want? If you are coming to me for comfort or aſſiſtance, you will find neither. Return to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>OH my country, my country!" exclaimed Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg with bitter anguiſh, when he came into the ſtreet. "I renounce the happineſs of cloſing my miſerable days where the bones of my anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors reſt. My aſhes will not be mixed with theirs; my name ſhall be mentioned no more in theſe abodes of injuſtice and cruelty!"</p>
                     <p>He went to Caroline.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>We muſt part, dear Caroline! and, perhaps, ſhall meet no more in this world. I return you your liberty. If you ſhould meet with a worthy young man who offers you his hand and heart, heſitate not to make him happy. My prayers—my bleſſing—but you know what I feel for you. Adieu, my deareſt love; God bleſs you!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>He claſped the weeping girl in his arms.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>In ſuch an embrace did you pledge your faith to me; in ſuch an embrace I return it to you. May your life be as bright and bliſsful as the few precious days of our love were. Alas! they are gone for ever!</q>—</p>

He groaned, diſengaged himſelf from her arms, claſped her again to his heart, wept, tore himſelf once more from her, and fled to his ſolitary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode.</p>
                     <p>I ſcarcely need to obſerve to the ſenſible reader that I have written down only the words of this affecting ſcene, and not the feelings which agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the minds of the unfortunate lovers. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned nothing of what Caroline ſaid; becauſe—ſhe could not ſpeak, but only feel.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg's agonies were no longer boiſterous; he reſembled a perſon who, having ſtruggled a long time againſt the overwhelming billows, at laſt drops his arms, exhauſted by the ſeverity of the conflict, and commits himſelf to the mercy of the waves. He did every thing which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, with a kind of unconſcious ſtupor. The firm reſolution to quit his native country as ſoon as poſſible, was, however, conſtantly preſent to his mind. He ſold all his remaining property at half price, and paid his trifling debts. After having ſatisfied all his creditors, his whole wealth was reduced to a coat, a few ſhirts, and ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in money. "Be firm, my poor heart!" ſaid the unfortunate young man when he approached the frontiers of his native country, ſupported by an oaken ſtaff, and caſting a laſt tearful look at the town of his nativity: "Be firm, my poor heart! I ſhall not be left without bread. God will let ſome grow for me too. I ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meet with hypocriſy and ignorance diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the maſk of religion. Contentment and temperance want but little; and that little I can procure by the labour of my hands. God, God! if it be true that individuals are protected by thee, oh! then be the ſupporter and father of my Caroline!"—</p>

After a journey of ſome days, when his ſix ſhillings were already ſpent, and he knew not where to get a morſel of bread for to-morrow, he arrived in the beginning of a ſerene day at the gates of H**, a ſmall Pruſſian town.

                     <p>Ortenberg had ſeated himſelf on a large ſtone. He took his breakfaſt out of his pocket, while he was ſinging, ſharpened his knife, and took his frugal meal on the verdant turf. A pure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious air ſeaſoned his bread, and a choir of nightingales threw a thin veil over the pictures of his grief.</p>
                     <p>An honeſt citizen of K** who was weeding his field, had liſtened to Ortenberg's ſong behind a hazel buſh, and was deeply affected by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy

notes. His emotion increaſed when he ſaw Ortenberg breakfaſt with cheerful ſatisfaction upon a piece of black bread, and a few dried prunes. He alſo took notice of the gloom which overclouded the traveller's countenance, although his hilarity of mind, that ſweet fruit of a good conſcience, brightened it with lucid rays. The poverty of his dreſs contributed to increaſe the intereſt which his perſon and behaviour created. The citizen could not reſiſt his urgent deſire to accoſt the pious pilgrim. He took his hat off, and ſtept forth from his hiding place with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—inſpiring looks.</p>

                     <p>The ſimple cordiality with which the honeſt fellow made his offer, touched Ortenberg's heart. "With pleaſure!" replied he with a cheerful countenance, and took up his little bundle. The citizen had, in the mean time, tied his ſallad in a handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>"Will you give me leave to carry it for you? I am ſure it muſt be too heavy for a man of your age."</p>

field which we have juſt left, in the ſweat of my brow, as a day labourer. It now belongs to me. When my maſter perceived that I was a diligent and ſober fellow who feared God, he gave me his daughter in marriage; ſhe was a ſweet and excellent woman. The Lord took her from me two years ſince, after we had lived forty-four years in a peaceful and pious ſtate of matrimony.</p>

Alas!

                        <p>No; dear Sir! God has not granted me that happineſs. Perhaps it is better as it is. However, I have a mother who is an hundred years old.—Who would nurſe and wait upon her

in the laſt days of her great age? upon her who nurſed me when I was an helpleſs infant. Who would cloſe her eyes, if the Lord were to deprive her of her laſt ſupport? It is principally on her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I wiſh to live a little longer. I owe her a great deal, more than I ſhall ever be able to repay.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Much leſs would have been ſufficient to intereſt Ortenberg's good and feeling heart in favour of that good old man. He ſeized his hand with great emotion. "Venerable old man?

                     <sp>

                        <p>I have heard you ſing a very pretty hymn. We hope for better joys than this world can afford. This is the only comfort of oppreſſed virtue. I do not doubt but you are one of that claſs.</p>

                        <p>Don't ſay ſo. Who knows what good may finally ariſe from your ſufferings.

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:037761_0128_100F0576792B5C58"/>
I do any thing for you? Have you any buſineſs to ſettle at H**? My fellow-citizens love me, and will be glad to do me a favour.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Juſt ſuch a frank and cordial language was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to prevail upon Ortenberg to confeſs that he wiſhed to open a day-ſchool at H**. The old man promiſed to exert all his influence to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it among his numerous acquaintances, and they arrived at laſt at his ſmall peaceful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. "Be cordially welcome under my roof," ſaid the Citizen; "and take up with the humble fare which my houſe can afford."</p>
                     <p>The old mother met them at the door of the parlour, ſupported by a crutch, and nodded kindly to the ſtranger. Her ſon tapped her gently on the ſhoulder:</p>
                     <p>"I have brought you a gueſt, dear mother. His name is—Dear, ſir, what is your name? I really forgot to inquire after it."</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg mentioned his name.</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Citizen.</speaker>
                        <p>Well! well! the name is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. God regards the heart. People who have the greateſt names, are frequently the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt knaves.—Mother, let us have ſomething to eat; my gueſt is hungry.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>The cloth was inſtantly laid, and three good people dined cheerfully together! Three good people at one table! you will not find them at the tables of the great.</p>
                     <p>The plan concerning Ortenberg's ſchool was diſcuſſed again after dinner. The citizen preſſed Ortenberg to accept of free board and lodging in his houſe; but could not perſuade him to conſent. Ortenberg was determined to owe every frugal morſel which he ſhould eat to no one but himſelf. Labour for our ſupport creates and ſatisfies hunger. Thoſe idle drones, who are fattened with the marrow and ſweat of the poor, cannot enjoy their
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:037761_0129_100F0578F5FEC8D0"/>
wealth. Thus ſpoke and thought that exiled young man, who was not worth a groat, and would not have <hi>thought</hi> otherwiſe, though he would have <hi>spoken</hi> differently, if he had poſſeſſed millions.</p>
                     <p>The old man exerted his good-natured eloquence in vain, and it was to no purpoſe when he begged him to conſider that neither himſelf nor his aged mother would be able to ſpend the little with which God had bleſſed him.</p>
                     <p>"Be my ſon!" exclaimed he with paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: "I have no children whom you could rob."</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg never ſuffered his heart to get the better of his principles. He was deeply affected, but perſiſted, nevertheleſs, firmly in his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                     <p>"It will afford me pleaſure," ſaid he, "to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you as a father; for alas! I neither have a father nor a mother! but I ſhould be undeſerving your paternal love, if I ſhamefully could abuſe your good nature. It may be pride, which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is a ſteril ſoil; however a noble exertion of all my abilities is the fruit which it produces. In ſhort, I never will accept a charitable gift of any perſon whomſoever. I will never beg for any thing. I would exchange my heart with no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whatever. Of whom could I beg without leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the value of this heart? I hate hypocriſy—a hypocrite is a knave!"</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Citizen.</speaker>
                        <p>But many an honeſt man is reduced to the neceſſity of begging; and there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances—</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>
                        <p>True my venerable friend, there are inſtances in which begging is the ſweeteſt triumph of humanity. If I cannot ſave my deſerted friend from miſery, by my own exertions, I ſhall beg for him, and be proud of it.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Citizen.</speaker>
                        <p>Mr. Ortenberg, I will preſs you no
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:037761_0130_100F057B953C7A48"/>
further; the will of man is his heaven. All that you have ſaid, is, indeed, very pretty, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud you for it; however, it appears to me, not to be quite conſonant with truth. But I am a ſimple man, and cannot preſume to diſpute with you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Thus terminated the noble conteſt between be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent generoſity and the conſciouſneſs of the dignity of man.</p>
                     <p>The following was the reſult of their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg took poſſeſſion of a garret in the houſe of the honeſt Citizen, which was ſcantily furniſhed, and for which he agreed to pay a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate rent. He dined at the table of his foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, and in lieu of payment, inſtructed two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan godſons of his hoſt in religion, writing and reading. Supper, as well as all ſuperfluous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage with which Mocca, China, and the two Indias furniſh us, were entirely baniſhed from the table of our hero. "I will prove," ſaid he by himſelf, "how little man wants, if he <hi>will</hi> want little."</p>
                     <p>The old man promiſed to ſpeak in the evening with ſome of his friends, and to perſuade the oldeſt and moſt reſpectable Citizens to intruſt him with the education and inſtruction of their children. He was as good as his word. Ortenberg ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in leſs than eight days, daily ſurrounded by five or ſix boys, whoſe education procured him, indeed, only a ſcanty ſubſiſtence, but enabled him, at the ſame time, to gratify his prevailing paſſion, pride, and to owe every morſel which he ate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his diligence; for the honeſt Citizen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in vain artifice and perſuaſion to render his ſituation more comfortable.</p>

                     <p>READER, I ſhall attempt to give a faithful deſcription of Ortenberg's external and internal ſituation. He lived in a ſmall low garret, with a kitchen adjoining, which, however, was never blackened with ſmoke, while it was in Ortenberg's poſſeſſion. The condition of his apartment was the moſt ſpeaking proof of his poverty. Four ſtraw chairs, two tables, and a wooden bench for his ſcholars, a piece of a broken looking glaſs, and a ſorry turn-up bed, was all his furniture. A dark window with round panes ſet in lead, half covered with paper, afforded a proſpect of part of a ruined wall, the reſidence of ſhrieking owls, whoſe melancholy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> voices frightened ſleep, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaining ſolace, from his ſolitary couch. The wall which was the remnant of a powder maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, deprived him pretty much of the cheering light of day; and the gloom which prevailed in his apartment was heightened in no ſmall degree by the browniſh colour of the walls. The decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roof was frequently a ſport of the winds; rain and ſnow defied this crazy ſhield, and poured damps and unwholeſome air into his apartment. Narrow and dark ſtairs ſeemed to bear his foot ſteps with indignation, groaning and bending under their weight. The whole room was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly filled with the unpleaſant ſmell ariſing from the work of a tanner, whoſe yard was under his window. Who of my readers is not ſenſible that a cheeful abode is the moſt neceſſary requiſite to render a diſmal ſate tolerable, and that an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:037761_0133_100F05815323CF90"/>
ſufferer muſt be rendered entirely unhappy, in ſuch a gloomy priſon! Ortenberg's mind ſhrouded itſelf timidly in a gloomy, impenitrable miſt.</p>
                     <p>He was ſurrounded from the dawn of morning till the duſk of the eve covered nature with its ſable mantle, by a ſmall flock of children, whom he inſtructed in ſubjects which afforded only a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical occupation to his mind. The only poor reward which he enjoyed from the labours of the day was confined to a ſolitary walk which tended more to nouriſh his melancholy mood, than to diſpel the gloom of his mind. The produce of his ſchool was ſcarcely ſufficient to defray the ſmall expences of his frugal table, and his ſimple dreſs.</p>
                     <p>He had no acquaintance beſides his landlord, to whom he never complained. His wounds bled inceſſantly; however, he rejected the healing bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam which nature diſtills from confidential com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. The town contained two men of letters, as they were pleaſed to call themſelves, a corpulent magiſtrate, and a ſtill more corpulent prieſt. The former was an abject ſlave to his belly, and the latter was no acquaintance that ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ortenberg; for he ſhunned all prieſts like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſince his departure from Breſlaw. There was no food for the mind to be procured at H**. Bibles and hymn books compriſed all the litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which the place afforded, ſome volumes of Sermons excepted, which the corpulent preſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and by all the inhabitants were regarded as a library. However, even if the barbarous town had been inundated with bookſellers ſhops and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating libraries, yet Ortenberg's ſcanty revenues would have prevented him totally from all acceſs to theſe magazines of learning. His mind lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed therefore in the priſon of inactivity, and he was incapable of allaying his unhappineſs by
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:037761_0134_100F0582D84326B0"/>
improvement in knowledge, labour, and ſtudy, which alone can ſometimes diſpel the gloom of miſery.</p>
                     <p>His reaſon had dictated to his heart the cruel law to beat no longer for Caroline. He thought it would be criminal in him, were he to write to her, as this might eaſily contribute to nouriſh her hope and paſſion. It was no eaſy taſk for him to deny himſelf that pleaſure: however, he collected all his firmneſs to oppoſe the imperious dictates of his heart, and renounce with heroic fortitude, the ſweet pleaſure of an intimate correſpondence.</p>
                     <p>Then the poor, unfortunate ſufferer had no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment left?—Yes! he ſtill had a few cheerful moments; namely, thoſe which the kind letters of his Elhenhorſt procured him. The expences of poſtage diſtreſſed him, indeed, frequently very much; however, he rather would deny himſelf ſome neceſſaries of life, than forego the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the pleaſing conſciouſneſs that he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a faithful and ſincere friend, whoſe heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied time and diſtance. My readers know that Elhenhorſt could have no idea of Ortenberg's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable ſituation, and imagined it was entirely different from what it really was; becauſe Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg never complained.</p>
                     <p>As ſufferers who are deſerted by all men, muſt have ſome object of their affection, Ortenberg had tamed two pigeons, with whom he ſhared his ſorry fare, and who afforded him many ſweet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by their innocent attachment to him. He became every day fonder of his brute compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they ate out of his hands and mouth; their cooing was his lullaby; their careſſes turned his gloomy anguiſh frequently to ſoft melancholy, and he would not have exchanged the morſel of bread which he ſhared with his pigeons, for the groaning table of the magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="unknown:037761_0135_100F05854A275998"/>
He had now languiſhed ſeven leaden months in this melancholy ſituation. It grew more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing every day; the gloom of his mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed viſibly, his ſtrength dwindled away, and he hoped his ſufferings would ſoon be termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the all healing hand of death. Not one deſire, not a ſingle expectation remained in his boſom. Death! death alone was the object of his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>He was ſitting one evening, by the faint glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of a lamp, ſupporting his head upon his hand, and contemplating a fly who had burned her wings in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lame.—Conceive, reader, if you can, conceive the rapturous joy which like elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric fire thrilled his whole frame, when the door was ſuddenly flung open and Elhenhorſt ſtood before him. His travelling coat was ornamented with a ſparkling ſtar; for his merits had ſoon raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a country where merit, at that time, was the only recommendation. But this very ſtar, made Ortenberg ſtart back, when he already had expanded his arms to preſs his long loſt friend to his ſuffering heart. However, the miniſter flew towards him with marks of the moſt heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt joy.</p>
                     <p>"Ortenberg! Ortenberg! have I become a ſtranger to your heart? Have you ceaſed to be my friend?</p>
                     <p>They flew into each other's arms—their eyes were fixed on each other. Once more embrace. Their looks were dimmed; for their eyes ſwam in ſweet tears. A third embrace. No words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the meeting of their hearts—nor ſhall I attempt to deſcribe by words the rapture of a ſcene which only can be felt.</p>

covered with a ſparkling ſtar, can be ſuſceptible of friendſhip.</p>

                        <p>In that caſe I would trample this ſtar to atoms. Your ſentiments are ſtill the ſame, noble and proud, even towards your friends. But come, let us ſit down and chat a little. I have travelled twenty four miles more to-day than I am uſed to do, to ſurpriſe you this evening. How are you? How do you live?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>
                        <p>Very well.</p>

                        <p>The death of my mother—the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy fate of my Caroline.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>He never could pronounce Caroline's name, without being deeply affected. The ſight of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt recalled to his mind all the happy even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings when his friend had kindly aſſiſted him in building airy caſtles; when the whole world yet lay open before him, and he knew malice, envy, and chicanery, only from hear-ſay. This ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recollection, which, added to the bitterneſs of his preſent ſituation, mellowed him ſuddenly, and he began to unboſom himſelf to his friend. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my readers already know his lofty mind—he ſeemed to have entirely forgotten his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and mentioned not a ſyllable of it to a man who was his ſincereſt friend, and had it in his power to extricate him at once, from all his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. He related only the ſufferings which the miſery of others cauſed him, and ſeemed to be perfectly ſatisfied with his own ſituation.</p>
                     <p>However, although his lips uttered no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, yet his hollow eyes, his meagre appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his half torn garment, and his ſorry apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſpoke his diſtreſs plainly enough. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt ſurveyed his friend's apartment with tearful eyes, and his bleeding heart vowed ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aſſiſt the unfortunate man. Ortenberg was
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:037761_0137_100F058A298CBFD0"/>
thrown into the greateſt confuſion, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Elhenhorſt ſurveyed every corner of his room. He haſtened to draw his friend into a converſation, and to turn his attention to ſome other object.</p>

                        <speaker>Elhenhorst.</speaker>
                        <p>It is no ſecret. You know what a heavy burden lay on my ſhoulders; I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſeveral times in my letters to you. I was ſcarcely able to endure it any longer, and was ſeized with a melancholy gloom of mind, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſhould ſay, with dark miſanthropy. I was neceſſiated to ſpend the greateſt part of the day amongſt tireſome dead, amongſt whom Juſtini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus certainly was the moſt tedious, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me mechanically to fly the living. My ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors took notice of my gloomy exiſtence when I leaſt expected it; they ſeemed to be convinced that the camel, which always muſt travel with the caravan to Mecca, without being ever releaſed, becomes lame at laſt. The king informed me unexpectedly by a letter, in his own hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that he had appointed me to be miniſter plenipotentiary at **, and that I am to repair thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within three months. I am now going to Berlin, to thank the king, and to obtain my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>

But I know that Caroline is the ſole object of all your wiſhes. The worthy Ortenberg cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the darling of his heart, who would willingly ſhare a ſcanty income with him, ſhould renounce, on his account, all comforts of life, honour and many other advantages which a crowd of adorers would offer her, if ſhe were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with him.</p>

                     <p>Thoſe of my readers, who have formed a juſt idea of Ortenberg's noble and generous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will eaſily conceive that this came not in his mind, when he raſhly aſſured his friend that his company at ſupper would give him the greateſt pleaſure. The ſight of a dear friend, with a ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtar on his breaſt, had made him for a time forget his wants. However, even when he recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his poverty, he was not in the leaſt diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by it. His good heart, overflowing with friendſhip, inſtantly pointed out the means of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying Elhenhorſt's requeſt and his own wiſh. Ortenberg killed his two pigeons.</p>
                     <p>It is impoſſible to conceive the anguiſh which he felt when he took a knife from the dreſſer, and one of his darlings, apprehending no harm from her benefactor, fearleſsly ſtroked her bill againſt the fatal inſtrument. His heart bled more than the dying pigeon, when he ſaw her blood flow, ſaw her convulſive ſtruggles, and imagined he read in her breaking eye—What harm have I done you? A ſtream of tears guſhed from his eyes; he averted his face from the bleeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his ſolitary hours, went to the window and endeavoured to collect himſelf again, leſt El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt, on his joining him again, ſhould have reaſon to ſuſpect that he had ſacrificed for him his laſt and only pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>His landlord's ſervant, a good natured creature, who was very much attached to Ortenberg, eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated a loud ſcream, when he brought the two
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:037761_0141_100F059204332260"/>
bleeding pigeons into the kitchen, and deſired her to dreſs them for ſupper.</p>
                     <p>"For God's ſake, Mr. Ortenberg!" exclaimed the ſervant trembling: "what have you done?"</p>

                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Servant.</speaker>
                        <p>Your pigeons! your good, faithful pigeons! <stage>(She ſobbed, and mingled her tears with the blood of the poor creatures.)</stage>
                        </p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>"Be not a fool!" ſaid Ortenberg with ſtifled emotion: "there are plenty of pigeons to be got."</p>
                     <p>He left the kitchen, aſcending again to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. There he ſat down, cheerfully ſmiling, by the ſide of his friend, enjoying the happineſs of congenial communication, and forgot his pigeons. Elhenhorſt related every trifling incident which had happened to him during their ſeparation. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg returned his communication with equal ſincerity, repreſenting, however, the heavy blows of his adverſe fate in a humourous light, and ſtriving anxiouſly to pourtray his misfortunes in comical colours. He ſaid, for inſtance, only a few words about his fruitleſs application for the promiſed living, but dwelled the longer on the chaſe of the flies and on the deſcription of Miſs Shnurr.</p>
                     <p>The ſervant now appeared with the roaſted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. Her red eyes ſcarcely could retain a new torrent of tears which was ready to break forth.

                        </gap>ed on wings of heart felt pleaſure, a ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which he had grown almoſt an utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. They parted at laſt with cordial embraces.</p>
                     <p>

"Farewell, my dear friend," ſaid Elhenhorſt: "I hope we ſhall ſoon meet again! I then will force you to confeſs that there are ſtill ſome feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls in this world, deſerving of the love and confidence of a worthy man."</p>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt ſcarcely had quitted the houſe, when he ſuddenly was accoſted by a weeping girl, (the ſervant of Ortenberg's landlord,) who ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſobbing, "Dear Sir, you certainly are a great Lord. For God's ſake have pity on that worthy man. God will reward you for every aſſiſtance you give him."</p>

                     <p>His tears ſcarcely permitted him to utter theſe few words.

                     <p>"I now am ready to liſten to your long tale!" ſaid the King when Elhenhorſt entered his cloſet. The latter gave a faithful account of Ortenberg's fate; mentioning, however, no names.</p>

                     <p>"God! is there no help for my unfortunate friend?" exclaimed Elhenhorſt, when he had left the palace. A tear trembled in his eye and a melancholy gloom overcaſt his countenance. His ſituation obliged him to go every day to court; his countenance was a ſpeaking picture of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing friendſhip. The King obſerved his dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but pretended not to ſee it, and ſpoke no more to him. Elhenhorſt had already formed the plan to reſign his place and to live with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg at one of his eſtates, when he, one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was ſuddenly ſummoned to court. He found the King with a paper in his hand.</p>

"I have cauſed inquires to be made at Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lau!" ſaid the monarch when he ſaw him. "The account which you have given me is true, word for word, and I am glad of it for your ſake. Tell your friend that it does not become a clergyman who is to preach meekneſs, to ſuffer himſelf to be blindly ruled by his paſſions. I have appointed him to be maſter of the grammar ſchool at W**. Here is the patent. However, I ſhall deprive him again of his place, if I ſhould hear that he ſhews as much paſſion to his pupils as he did to the Colonel, whoſe name I do not want to know. I ſhall make inquiries about him."</p>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt's rapturous joy ſtraightened his breaſt and deprived him of the power of ſpeech. He dropt on his knee.</p>

He ſcolded his people the firſt time in his life, for being too ſlow. He was, at laſt, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his poſt-chaiſe; his heart flew, and the fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt horſes appeared to him to be as ſlow as ſnails. At the cloſe of the ſecond day, he came to a town which was only thirty-five miles diſtant from H**. Night was ſetting in; however, Elhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt ordered immediately freſh horſes, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his road with joyful impatience. "To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row," ſaid he to himſelf; "to-morrow, when the day dawns, ſhall I claſp my unfortunate friend to my boſom, happy through me. Oh God! how amply haſt thou rewarded me for all my troubles and ſorrows!"</p>

When he had travelled ſome miles, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found darkneſs already covered the face of the globe, he perceived that the poſtillion drove over f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </sp>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt was vexed.</p>
                     <p>"Muſt I loſe my way juſt now!" exclaimed he; "now while I wiſh to fly on wings of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to have the firſt ray of the dawning morn for a cheerful witneſs of a bliſsful meeting?"</p>
                     <p>The poſtillion drove onwards as well as he could, the wheels contended with the field-ſtones, the ſparks flew from the gravel, the horſes got into a moraſs, and the chaiſe was overturned. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt received no injury but a bleeding noſe, and having his great coat covered with mud. He ordered his people to aſſiſt the poſtillion in diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the chaiſe from the mud, took his piſtols, wrapped himſelf in his cloak, and ſat down upon a riſing ground.</p>
                     <p>Here I ſhould have the beſt opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a ſentimental diſcourſe between Elhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt and the moon, which juſt emerged from a dark maſs of clouds, and ſilvered their margin. Elhenhorſt thought this is the moon! but, as for the reſt, was ſo unfeeling as to blow the ſmoke of his tobacco pipe in her face. The poſtillion was ſtill more unfeeling; for he was ſo impudent as to exclaim: "If that curſed moon had come ſooner, I ſhould not have loſt my way."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:037761_0148_100F05A08AD4F6E8"/>
The moon cared not a pin for their want of feeling, and diſengaged herſelf entirely from the clouds which enſhrouded her orb, to be a witneſs of a ſcene which at once gave a different turn to Elhenhorſt's ideas.</p>
                     <p>He was ſitting on the turf, contemplating the ſmoke of his pipe, which the nocturnal breeze diſpelled, and thought, this is a picture of glory; and thus his ideas ſoon reverted again to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate friend. He was juſt going to anticipate the heavenly ſcene, when he ſhould ſurpriſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg with the pleaſing intelligence which his letter-caſe contained, when ſuddenly piercing ſcreams from an adjacent thicket ſtruck his ear. He mechanically laid hold of his piſtols on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cry of diſtreſs. Elhenhorſt was naturally brave, and had a heart which could feel for the diſtreſs of others. The lamentations of an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate wretch never failed to touch him to the quick; his arm and purſe had felt it frequently. He ſtarted up: "William, draw your hanger, and follow me!"</p>
                     <p>The poſtillion remonſtrated, proteſting that he ſhould not be able to repair the damage which the carriage had received in leſs than two hours, if William did not aſſiſt him.</p>
                     <p>"William, follow me!" was the only anſwer which the Baron returned, and both went towards the ſpot whence the ſcreams proceeded. It now changed into hollow groans, which ſcarcely were audible; however, the glimmer of a light in the thicket, ſerved Elhenhorſt as a guide.</p>
                     <p>He arrived at the ſpot and beheld—a young beautiful girl with a gag in her mouth, ſtruggling under the hands of three villains, who were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to violate her. The laſt ſtrength of the girl ſeemed to be exhauſted. She had in vain torn the cheeks of her enemies with her nails, and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:037761_0149_100F05A375A26C48"/>
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, to no purpoſe, to ſeize with impatient fury the ſword of the officer who ſeemed to be the leader of theſe wretches. A cord was tied to her round white arms, her recollection left her, and the guardian angel of her innocence wept.</p>
                     <p>Virtue conquers but rarely; however, it is not always ſubdued.</p>
                     <p>"Stop!" exclaimed Elhenhorſt, with a loud voice, cocking his piſtol. "Wretch, deſiſt, or you are a dead man!"</p>
                     <p>The officer turned round, ſeized with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and drew his ſword. His accomplices un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheathed their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The officer was going to ruſh upon Elhenhorſt, but ſuddenly ſtopt ſhort, when he beheld the cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed piſtol in the ſtranger's hands.</p>

I have pledged my honour, and never ſtaked it in jeſt. Retire, ſir! exclaimed he once more, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing with cautious ſteps towards him.</p>

The officer retired, and Elhenhorſt went up to the lady, who had fainted away.</p>
                     <p>Peace to the aſhes of the monk who invented gunpowder! Thouſands maintain he has been a curſe to mankind; but here is an inſtance of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved innocence which muſt be brought to his account. Elhenhorſt's piſtols alone were capable of preventing a bloody conteſt, the ſucceſs of which would have been very doubtful, on account of the ſuperiority of the enemy. However, the murderous inſtrument in Elhenhorſt's hand made him in that moment abſolute maſter of the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling wretches who ſtood before him.</p>
                     <p>Every invention is, therefore, ſalutary in the hands of an honeſt man.</p>

                     <p>They obeyed.</p>

                        <speaker>Elhenhorst.</speaker>

                     <p>His orders were punctually executed. The two wretches carried the lady away, and William was cloſe at their heels with his cutlaſs. The officer was petrified, bit his nails, gnaſhed his teeth, but was ſenſible of his impotence.</p>

                     <p>With theſe words he retired, and followed his prize. His truſty William had already reached the carriage, which the coachman and his other ſervants, in the mean time, had ſufficiently repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſenſeleſs girl was put into it: her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers received ſome laſhes inflicted by the whip of the coachman, and retreated as faſt as poſſible
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:037761_0151_100F05A7A098DD28"/>
to the thicket, where their diſappointed maſter was venting his impotent fury on the innocent graſs.</p>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt proceeded on his journey, reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heavenly conſciouſneſs of having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a good action, and left the recovery of his fair companion to God and nature.</p>
                     <p>Morning dawned already, and Aurora's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing breath animated ſilent nature with new life. The revigorating breezes of the morning air inſtilled new ſtrength into the exhauſted frame of the fair ſufferer, and ſhe awoke from her ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. Her ſoft, blue eyes opened themſelves, and ſparkled in the dawn of the coming day. Her cheeks put Aurora to the bluſh; the firſt ray of Phoebus kiſſed timidly her blooming lips; young zephyrs ſported with her auburn treſſes.</p>
                     <p>"Where am I?" whiſpered ſhe ſoftly, like the breeze of the morning air in the thin twigs of the beech-tree; like the trembling notes of a flute.</p>
                     <p>"In the hands of a gentleman," replied El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt: "be eaſy, dear lady, you are ſafe."</p>
                     <p>This anſwer, Elhenhorſt's noble countenance and benevolent looks, diſpelled at once the gloom that hung on her eyes; ſhe ſeemed to be going to ſpeak, her lips opened themſelves, and wanton cupids reſumed their places in the dimples of her cheeks. However, a new gloom ſpread it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuddenly over her charming face, when her bloody fingers recalled the ſcene of laſt night to her mind. Her heart was on the rack; her heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boſom panted for air, and the blooming roſe turned to a pale lily.</p>
                     <p>"Am I ſtill as I was?" aſked ſhe with pale and quivering lips, while ſhe caſt down her eyes. The moment in which ſhe expected to hear El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt's

                     <p>Good God! exclaimed the girl, with folded hands, and raiſing her eyes to heaven. Her lips moved ſoftly; ſhe ſeemed to pray. Elhenhorſt contemplated her in ſilence; that is to ſay, his lips were ſilent; however his heart ſpoke louder than it had done hitherto; panted more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than it ever had done before.

                     <p>The girl now turned to Elhenhorſt; Elhenhorſt trembled.</p>
                     <p>"My lord! to whom owes an unfortunate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſervation of her innocence and life?"</p>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt trembled ſtill more violently. What a ſingular change! He had been uſed to ſmile with pity at the beauties of his native country, when they attempted to inſnare his heart by a thouſand female artifices; to face firmly every eye that expected to conquer him by its fire or languiſhing and tender looks. He took no notice of a white arm, or an elaſtic boſom: and when he happened to caſt a look at the charms of beauty, he contemplated them like a man who admires a fine picture. But how different were his ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>now!</hi> His boſom was ſtraitened the firſt time, and his eyes were afraid to meet thoſe of the fair ſtranger.

                     <p>THE ſtranger ſcarcely had pronounced the name Caroline Summer, when the colour fled from Elhenhorſt's glowing cheeks. He ſtarted back and ſqueezed himſelf into the oppoſite corner of the chaiſe, no leſs firmly and anxiouſly than if he had committed a ſacrilege. His pale face grew longer, his eyes ſtared, his mouth remained open, his foot trembled to touch the hem of her gown, every look of his, every word he had uttered, appeared cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to him.

He reſembled a dreaming perſon in the firſt moments which ſucceeded that fatal diſcovery; for, a riſing paſſion is a ſweet dream which deludes our mind with pleaſant and new ſenſations, and makes us anticipate the gratification of our wiſhes in the very moment of which they were begotten. Imagine that ſuch a charming viſionary dream were chaſed from your mind by a ſudden alarm of fire, and you will have an idea of Elhenhorſt's feelings in the firſt moments when he learned who the enchanting ſtranger was. The emotions by which they were ſucceeded, were like the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a wanderer, who, in the darkneſs of night, ſuddenly perceives by a flaſh of lightning, that he ſlept at the brink of a precipice. But he had ſcarcely conceived the idea, <hi>This girl is the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress of my friend!</hi> when he ordered the poſtilion to ſtop, and ſilently quitted the carriage without being able to account for that involuntary action.</p>
                     <p>"What a ſingular man!" ſaid Caroline by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſhall I rejoice at my preſervation, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to have fallen from the talons of a vulture, into the fangs of a tyger? But no, no, it cannot be; the Creator writes an illegible hand, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is an impudent comedian, if this man be a villain!"</p>
                     <p>Who could blame Caroline for her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and doubts? Elhenhorſt's conduct was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, that confidence itſelf would have read the brooding over a black deed in the diſordered countenance of this unknown. Caroline wiſhed to enquire of the poſtilion or the valet, after the name of her preſerver; however Elhenhorſt's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cloſed her lips.

A long pauſe. The ſouls of both travellers feaſted upon the raptures of overflowing ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of happineſs, but were, nevertheleſs, not totally unclouded. A ſigh eſcaped Caroline's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—that ſigh whiſpered—"Ortenberg." El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt's breaſt was ſtrengthened, for he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a timid youth who wreſtles the firſt time with a vigorous man.</p>
                     <p>Caroline's curioſity urged her at laſt to ſpeak: ſhe ſaid baſhfully, "I have not heard from him theſe eight months.—No letter—not a ſingle line—it is, indeed cruel!—I know not whether he is ſtill alive?</p>
                     <p>She knew, indeed, well enough that he was alive; for Elhenhorſt had intimated it ſufficiently; however, her queſtion properly ought to have been, "I know not <hi>where</hi> he lives."

Both temples were covered with black plaiſters, of the bigneſs of a crown-piece, againſt head ach, rheumatiſm, &amp;c. &amp;c. A tooth from a ſcull, ſewed in a piece of ſilk, depended from her faded boſom, which was to ſerve as a taliſman againſt the tooth ach. The fragment of her noſe was adorned with a pair of green ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, with the aſſiſtance of which ſhe was reading a chapter from Ezekiel. Her wrinkled hands knitted at the ſame time a ſtocking of coarſe yarn, and the nodding of her head, the langour and blinking of her half-cloſed eyes, betrayed that ſhe, at the ſame time, enjoyed the ſweetneſs of ſleep, and, conſequently, was employed in three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ways.</p>

                     <p>"Having finiſhed the chapter, ſhe marked the place where ſhe had left off with a piece of green ſilk, put her ſpectacles into a ſhagreen caſe, and waddling towards me, to ſurvey me from top to toe, with a moſt curious loquacity. Her firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was not very encouraging for a timid girl of my age. <hi>You are, probably,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>a daughter of Mr. Summer, who broke ſix months ago?</hi>

Theſe words lacerated my heart. However, I collected myſelf. Benevolent minds, thought I, are not always endowed with delicate ſentiments. <hi>You are poor and deserted,</hi> continued ſhe, <hi>but you have received a handsome figure from the mercy of God, and must make a good use of it.</hi> I then did not underſtand the horrid meaning of theſe words. <hi>You have met, in Lady Anna Maria of Xantippen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, with a sinner who has found grace before God, and is of a charitable disposition,</hi> concluded ſhe; <hi>and if you are diligent, and walk in the paths of modesty and piety, and always follow the advice of an experienced and pious woman, you will never lack any thing that may be requisite for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of your body and soul.</hi>

becauſe that very ſame coachman had drove her late lord ſeven years to the town-houſe, and at laſt aſſiſted in conveying him to the grave. She could not, therefore, reſolve to leave him to the fortune of his whip. He was a round, healthy-looking figure, ſang a ſonorous baſs, and always began the evening hymn, which was ſung when the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was over, with great dignity.</p>
                     <p>"The ſecond figure which entered the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a dirty man-ſervant, who was juſt come from the field. His face was ſun-burnt, and his hands were covered with bliſters. He was chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he took his ſeat, and his fatigue and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſeemed to curſe the artificial devotion which he was forced to diſplay. He was followed by two females, one of whom was very old and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the other young, gay, and apparently, more diſpoſed to laugh than to pray. The former was the cook, and the latter the houſe-maid.</p>
                     <p>"The devotion was opened with an edifying hymn, after the concluſion of which Lady Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippendale ſaid a prayer which ſhe had learnt by heart, exhorting me to do the ſame. I confeſſed frankly that I never had learnt a prayer by heart, and that I was convinced God paid little regard to the blabbering of our lips, being ſatisfied with the pious emotions of our hearts. She proteſted with a deep groan, that my youthful heart was already infected with the baneful poiſon of libertiniſm: lending me immediately a prayer book which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained prayers for every day in the year, the leap-year not excepted, and exhorted me to ſhew atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and devotion during the pious oriſons of the reſt of her domeſtics.</p>
                     <p>"The coachman roared his prayer, while his breath laſted, without paying any attention to ſtops and half ſtops; the ſervant, whom the houſe-maid ſecretly pinched and teazed, followed his example
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037761_0164_100F05BC2160C108"/>
luſtily. The cook alone groaned her prayer with all the expreſſions of the ſincereſt contrition. The devotion concluded with the hymn, <hi>Now all the woods are fast asleep,</hi> &amp;c. and the meeting was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. She enjoined me once more before I went to bed, to ſtudy her prayer book, under-lining with her own hand thoſe paſſages which in her opinion were moſt moving. I was obliged to learn every day two prayers by heart, and durſt not attempt to alter an obſolete or an ambiguous word arbitrarily. "Thou ſhalt not add unto the word, neither ſhalt thou diminiſh aught from it," ſaid ſhe, whenever I attempted the ſlighteſt alteration. She poſſeſſed the ſingular gift to prove any thing from the Bible, citing ſome paſſages out of its connexion, and thus rendering it ſubſervient to confirm what ſhe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to demonſtrate. However, I begin to talk wildly; excuſe the joyful loquacity of the liberated dove who has eſcaped from her cage.</p>
                     <p>"Our mode of life was nearly as follows: We roſe very early in the morning. I was compelled to ſew, my fingers ſore while I aſſiſted at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Revelation of St. John, which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to me, verſe after verſe, proteſting ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſhe had diſcovered in it the downfall of the Pope ten years ago, and alſo had written to him to warn him againſt the wicked French, but never received an anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"About noon we went together into the kitchen, to aſſiſt the cook in preparing a frugal dinner; or, to ſpeak the truth, we watched Mary, to prevent her from waſting too much butter, or poiſoning the victuals by adding too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſpice. After dinner Lady Xantippendale always took a nap, and I was kept cloſe at work. She made her appearance again at four o'clock, and combed her lap-dog. She then went again into her cloſet to tranſact ſome private buſineſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037761_0165_100F05BE9106FE58"/>
her pledges, winding up the pawned watches, counting and filing her ducats. Every half an hour which ſhe could ſpare before ſupper, was devoted to reading in the Bible. Our ſupper was as frugal as the dinner, conſiſting in a few thin ſlices of bread. The above mentioned evening devotion ſerved in lieu of the deſert; and when it was over, we were permitted to go to bed. This is a faithful picture of our daily mode of life, which was never altered in the ſlighteſt degree, except on a Sunday; when we went twice to church, and in the afternoon criticiſed the dreſſes of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances inſtead of reading in the Bible.</p>
                     <p>"Little as I reliſhed this manner of living, yet I took cheerfully up with all its inconveniencies, flattering myſelf with the ſweet hope that I ſhould be ſafe from perſecution, and that my friend—why ſhould I not ſay my lover?—would releaſe me one time from it. I began already to reconcile myſelf to it, and to court the favour of the old Lady by the moſt unremitted attention: in which I apparently ſeemed to ſucceed pretty well. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, how great was my aſtoniſhment and terror, when I, about a week ſince, entered the apartment of my miſtreſs, and beheld the Colonel, whom I had not ſeen ſince that unfortunate day. A cold tremor ran through all my limbs; I was going to retire; but when he made me a reſpectful bow, and continued to converſe with my miſtreſs on money affairs, I tranquillized myſelf, fetched my work and ſeated myſelf in a corner. The Colonel went with my lady into her cloſet, and they ſtaid near an hour and an half; I was ſeized with fearful apprehenſions, and trembled violently. My reaſon repreſented to me that the viſit of an officer who always was in want of money, was nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, conſidering the traffic which the old lady carried on. My heart aſſented to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

my reaſon; however, I trembled nevertheleſs. He came back at laſt, walked with proud gravity through the apartment, and having made a ſlight bow to me diſappeared, I caſt a ſcrutinizing look at the old woman, but could not perceive the leaſt change in her features. I perſuaded myſelf at laſt that the Colonel had given up all deſigns upon me, and thought no more of that incident.</p>
                     <p>"The day before yeſterday was the dreadful time when the enfernal plot was executed. The old woman had told me already the preceding eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that a relation of her's, who lived fifteen miles diſtant from the town, would ſend her carriage for her to take her a few weeks into the country, and that I muſt get myſelf ready to go with her. I had no ſuſpicion, but rather was rejoiced at having an opportunity to breathe the country air again, and cheerfully packed up ſome linen and wearing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel.</p>
                     <p>"A carriage and four appeared really the next day about noon at our door, the old woman delayed our departure till towards evening. The firſt delay was occaſioned by her afternoon's nap; having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed it ſhe went at leaſt twenty times all over the houſe to ſee whether all was ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; and when we, at laſt, were going to ſet off, ſhe recollected ſuddenly that ſhe had forgot certain papers which ſhe had promiſed to her relation. Having rummaged all her drawers and carefully locked them again. ſhe went down in the kitchen to ſee whether the fire was quite extinguiſhed. She then read a long lecture to her domeſtics, in which ſhe enjoined them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtricteſt order and economy; and when I hoped, at laſt that we were going to ſet off, after I had been ready three or four hours, ſhe called me back again once more, putting a hymn book into my hand and croaking a hymn of a traveller who is going on a dangerous journey, I laughed inwardly, as I had not the leaſt apprehenſion that my journey
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037761_0167_100F05C21A731A58"/>
really would prove dangerous. I now can eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the ſlowneſs with which ſhe prepared her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for our final departure: ſhe was anxious to put it off till night ſhould be ſetting in; but I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not the leaſt ſuſpicion.</p>
                     <p>"We got at laſt into the carriage, and took a road which was entirely unknown to me. The ſun was ſetting, when we perceived a village at ſome diſtance. There is a houſe at the other end of the village, ſaid the old woman, where we ſhall reſt a little and take ſome refreſhment. We then ſhall have only half an hour's ride to the ſeat of my relation. I thought it ſingular that we were to reſt ourſelves to eat and drink at a place which was ſo near the ſpot of our deſtination; however I ſtill entertained no ſuſpicion, becauſe I knew from experience that Lady Xantippendale was fond of regaling herſelf at the expenſe of other people, and was told that the houſe belonged to a rich niece of her's. We really were received by a perſon, who pretended to be the ſteward of her niece, and offered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments to us. We ſtaid near an hour, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our journey when the ſhades of night already had ſhrouded the fields in darkneſs. I perceived, notwithſtanding the darkneſs, to my utter aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that four white horſes had been put to our carriage in the room of the black ones with which we had ſet out. I communicated my aſtoniſhment to the ſteward, on getting into the carriage, and was told that the black horſes belonged to his miſtreſs, and that the lady whom we were going to viſit had ſent her own horſes. I was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied with this explanation, and ſuſpected nothing.</p>
                     <p>"We had not proceeded half a mile when the old lady ſuddenly ordered the coachman to ſtop, telling me that ſhe muſt get out a moment, and that I ſhould remain quietly on my ſeat. My art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

heart ſtill apprehended no harm. But ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two maſked men jumped into the carriage, and the coachman drove on as faſt as his horſes could run. I ſcreamed and was gagged by one of my conductors. I prayed and ſcratched; but my hands were tied; my recollection forſook me and I fainted.</p>
                     <p>"As far as I can recollect, I remained ſome hours in that ſituation. The moon had riſen when I recovered the perfect uſe of my ſenſes. One of my conductors was ſnoring and the other betrayed his being awake, by coughing. I groaned and prayed to God for aſſiſtance. The day began to dawn. My two conductors had pulled off their maſks. I concluded by their whiſkers that they were ſoldiers.</p>
                     <p>"We arrived a few hours after day-break, at a lonely houſe in a thick foreſt, where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a fellow with long red whiſkers, and a pair of little pig's eyes. His dreſs was that of a peaſant. He welcomed me with a civil ſmile, and begged me to alight, and refreſh myſelf in his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The ſoldiers carried me out of the coach. I was very faint, and ſank upon a turf ſeat, near the houſe. One of my conductors, whoſe eyes diſplayed a faint ray of humanity approached me. Make yourſelf eaſy, Miſs! ſaid he ſoftly; you are in good hands. Our maſter is generous and liberal; you will come to no harm. I now ſhall take the gag from your mouth; but conjure you not to ſcream; for, it would be of no ſervice to you, as we are in a place where no perſon can hear us; and I ſhould beſides be compelled to reduce you to a ſituation from which I ſhould wiſh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you.</p>
                     <p>"He now took the gag from my mouth, and I began to ſcream aloud, as ſoon as I was at liberty. The fellow with the red whiſkers laughed, and his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037761_0169_100F05C78EF21490"/>
companion was in a violent paſſion; but the other ſoldier who had ſpoken to me firſt, ſaid, in a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably civil accent:</p>
                     <p>"Miſs, I ſhall ſuffer you to ſcream a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to convince you that no perſon can hear you. But if you do not leave off ſoon, I ſhall be compelled to be again troubleſome to you. You ſee my comrade begins already to be impatient.</p>
                     <p>"But when I continued to ſcream moſt violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtead of following his advice, he realized his menace, gagged me again, and conveyed me to a dirty room, which was blackened with ſmoke, and ſmelled of tobacco and the fumes of beer. The furniture conſiſted of long deal tables, and benches on both ſides. The windows were hung with beer pots. Only a ſingle chair ſtood in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and I was deſired to ſeat myſelf upon it. I was ſome hours in a ſtate of inſenſibility. <hi>God be merciful unto me, and preserve my innocence!</hi> This was the only idea which occupied my ſoul, and compoſed my prayers. My conductors in the mean while, beguiled their time with taking their breakfaſt and ſmoaking tobacco, and were delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to read the obſcene rhimes which the gueſts had written againſt the walls and windows.</p>
                     <p>"I remained in this melancholy ſituation till noon, when I was aſked whether I wanted to dine? I refuſed by ſhaking my head, and was urged no further. The ſoldiers and the caroty fellow ſat down to dinner and drank freely.</p>
                     <p>"After dinner, when the owner of the houſe was occupied in the kitchen and the moſt ferocious of my two conductors was faſt aſleep, I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted again by his companion, in whoſe eyes I perceived now and then a ſpark of humanity.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Miſs, ſaid he in a compaſſionate tone, I pity you ſincerely, I cannot ſave you, though I ſhould wiſh to do it. But why do you yourſelf

render your ſituation more unpleaſant? You ſee that your ſcreams are of no ſervice to you; I will take the gag from your, mouth, if you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me to be ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"The mild accent in which he delivered theſe words kindled a faint ſpark of hope in my ſoul. This man, thought I, can ſtill take ſome intereſt in the unmerited ſufferings of others; I may, perhaps, be able to prevail upon him by my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to aſſiſt me in making my eſcape. I nodded to him, and was inſtantly diſengaged from the troubleſome gag, and the cords with which my hands were tied.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my friend! exclaimed I, wringing my hands: Oh! my friend! ſave my innocence! God and your conſcience will reward you for it!</p>

When I was juſt on the point of quitting the room, the owner of the houſe joined us, and left us no more. I was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſtunning agony.

His compaſſionate looks attracted my notice. I told him that he ſeemed to have had a better education than people in his ſtation uſed to have.

He gave me an excellent education, and endeavoured to animate my juvenile heart with love for virtue and probity.

mind. The cruel phantom of honour cauſed us to fall out one day when we were intoxicated. We were in a numerous and licentious company—our companions urged us to decide our difference by a duel—they gave us ſwords—and I plunged mine into the heart of a young man, who was my only and ſincereſt friend, and the laſt conſolation of a poor, aged, and diſconſolate mother, who ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived his untimely death only a few weeks.

now thought it was impoſſible God could ſuffer a being to be diſhonoured, who always had adored him with innocence and purity of heart. I trembled indeed, when I got into the carriage; however, the firſt frenzy of deſpair had abated; my ſoul conceived again ſome hopes; and I thought at laſt, if the worſt ſhould come, I can only die. I am, perhaps called by God to die as a martyr for my innocence.</p>
                        <p>"They had gagged me again, but left my hands free. The carriage drove over unbeaten roads. We met not a ſingle perſon, and not a ſound of a living being, except the ruſtling of a ſolitary lizard in the dry furze vibrated in our ear. One of my companions ſang very obſcene ſongs, ſmoaked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and ſneered at his comrade who looked mournfully out of the window.</p>
                        <p>T"he ſun had already concealed his radiant orb, and the darkneſs of the night was ſetting in rapidly when we arrived at the hill, where we were to meet the Colonel. We ſtopt; but ſaw no perſon. A ſaint ray of hope roſe in my mind, and I flattered myſelf with the cheerful illuſion, that the villain perhaps had already received the reward of his crimes, had been thrown off his horſe or attacked by robbers on his way. But alas!—two men on horſeback appeared at ſome diſtance, a few hours after, when the moon had riſen. My heart was convulſed, my knees trembled, and I could ſcarcely ſupport myſelf on my legs.</p>
                        <p>"Have I caught you at laſt, little rebel? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Colonel, while he haſtily diſmounted and went towards me.

                        <p>Caroline's perſon was animated with new life and vigour, like a half-faded flower when a gentle ſummer rain refreſhes it with its re-invigorating moiſture. A ſoft roſe-colour tinged her cheeks,

her brow and boſom, and ſpread even to the finger-ends; her eye ſparkled like the morning ſtar, when it announces the riſing ſun. A thouſand queſtions thronged from her ſoul, her roſy lips quivered, doubtfully which of them they ſhould render audible firſt; for, every one of them appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her to be equally important.</p>
                        <p>"Ortenberg at H**!" ſtammered ſhe with an enchanting confuſion: "and we are on the road to H**? and we ſhall be there to day?—Perhaps, the—ſteeple—which I ſee yonder—"</p>

                        <p>Caroline's heart beat violently; ſhe was ſeized with a ſweet nameleſs uneaſineſs; the colour of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037761_0176_100F05D50388F3F8"/>
her face changed every moment; ſhe attempted in vain to ſpeak, and her impatient eyes roved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitively from one ſide to another.</p>
                        <p>The road ſerpentined between gardens. Her imagination whiſpered to her, whenever ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a cool inviting ſpot: Ortenberg has, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, been ſitting there; on that meadow he walks in the refreſhing ſhade of evening, reſts here on the banks of this rivulet, thinks of his Caroline, and recalls to his memory the many happy hours which we ſpent together. "Should we not meet him?" whiſpered <hi>Hope</hi> to her ſiſter <hi>Expectation.</hi> Expectation grew anxiouſly attentive, gazed wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at every diſtant object, and miſtook every child for the long miſſed lover; fancied to ſee in every peaſant's coat the light grey frock in which he had taken leave of Caroline.</p>
                        <p>Elhenhorſt ſat with folded arms by her ſide, and read with rapture the ſlighteſt emotions of her heart, in the open book of her phyſiognomy. He read undiſturbed, without being interrupted in his ſweet obſervations by a ſingle look of the dear girl; for Caroline had too much to ſee and to gaze at; had now to ſtretch her neck, now had occaſion to murmur ſecretly againſt nature for confining her looks by a hill; and now to be vexed at the ſlowneſs of the poſtillion; and all theſe ideas and ſenſations croſſed each other with ſo much rapidity, as to make her forget her companion entirely. She had eyes only for the ſteeples of the town which lay before her; ears only for every ſound which proceeded from that direction; ſenſation only for her love.</p>
                        <p>The carriage now rolled round a hill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! they were ſuddenly before the gates of the town. A loud, tremulous Ah! eſcaped Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line when ſhe beheld the gate.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>"This lady?"—muttered the officer ſmiling. "However, I ſhall put in my report: Baron El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt and attendants. I have the honour to wiſh you a happy journey."</p>
                     <p>The ſneering tone and looks with which the officer ſaid this, did not eſcape Caroline. She was ſenſible of the ambiguity of her ſituation; her cheeks glowed.</p>
                     <p>Elhenhorſt ordered the poſtillion not to put up at the <hi>Wild Man,</hi> becauſe he did not wiſh to embitter the approaching ſcene of rapture, by the ſight of a villain. We ſhall have time enough <hi>after</hi> dinner, thought he, to ſight out our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                     <p>The carriage ſtopt therefore at another hotel, and the travellers were ſhown into an apartment which had a cloſet adjoining to it. Elhenhorſt deſired the trembling Caroline to ſtep into it, and ſent for his friend.</p>
                     <p>Words cannot expreſs the ſenſations with which he looked through the window, and ſaw Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg coming up the ſtreet. His feelings were a mixture of rapture and anxiety—a tear ſtole from time to time down his cheeks. He opened
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037761_0178_100F05DA00011170"/>
the door of his apartment. Ortenberg aſcended the ſtairs panting for breath, and—both lay in each other's arms.</p>
                     <p>"Friend, you have kept your word faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!" ſaid Ortenberg, ſhaking Elhenhorſt's hand while he ſtept into the apartment. "I did not expect you ſo ſoon."</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Elhenhorst.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, deareſt friend, I have kept my word. I deſerve this teſtimony. I promiſed you to compel you to confeſs, on my return, that I deſerve your confidence. You only have let me gueſs your diſtreſs; but no matter of that: I gueſſed it. Take this, continued he, taking the King's patent from his pocket: take this; the King has appointed you to be head maſter of the grammar ſchool at W**.</p>
                        <p>Ortenberg—the indigent, ſtarving Ortenberg—who had not the ſmalleſt glimpſe of hope le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>t—raiſed ſuddenly to a ſtate of moderate affluence, which enabled him to ſatisfy all his wiſhes: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg was ſpeechleſs, he ſeemed to be rooted to the ground; he ſtood before his friend with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded arms, holding his cane in one and his hat in the other hand, while all his muſcles trembled and tears ſtarted from his eyes. He now gazed at the parchment and now at his friend. His lips quivered, his whole frame ſhook, he could not find words, he was not able even to ſtammer.</p>
                        <p>And behold: the folding door was ſuddenly flung open, but not wide enough for Caroline's expanded arms. She flew towards her lover with a convulſive Ah! which ſeemed to reproach her rapture for its overflowing ecſtacy, and threw her trembling hands round his neck.</p>
                        <p>Elhenhorſt wept. His valet ſtood at the door and ſobbed. Ortenberg knew not whether he was awake or deluded by a ſweet dream. He ſtaggered, wanted to ſpeak, he ſtammered; El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henhorſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037761_0179_100F05DB845275E8"/>
conducted him to a ſofa. His joy was too powerful for him. He reſembled a blind perſon who beholds the radiant orb of the ſun the firſt time, and fainted. Caroline threw herſelf upon him and hung upon his pale lips. Elhen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt ordered him to be bled. He recovered the uſe of his ſenſes, and aſked himſelf whether he had dreamed.</p>
                        <p>We ſhall leave the finiſhing of this picture to the imagination of the feeling reader, and let him gueſs the thouſands of queſtions which were put and anſwered on either part. Elhenhorſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, by Ortenberg's deſire, his landlord to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The honeſt old man could not eat for joy. Elhenhorſt had the greateſt difficulty to prevail upon his happy gueſts to eat and to ſpeak; for they feaſted only with their eyes. He was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to aſk more than ten times before he could receive an anſwer; but was teazed to repeat the ſame reply an hundred times.</p>
                        <p>"When do you intend to depart?" whiſpered he at laſt into Ortenberg's ear.</p>

                        <p>Ortenberg and Caroline were too much enrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to miſs Elhenhorſt. He had left them, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037761_0182_100F05E21520E7B0"/>
returned again without their perceiving it. They had not ſeen or ſpoken a word to Ortenberg's landlord, who ſat only a few ſteps diſtant from them. Ortenberg had ſpilled half the contents of his coffee-cup on Caroline's lap, and Caroline had torn his ruffles with a pin; but neither knew any thing of it.</p>
                        <p>The carriages were ordered to be got ready. The old Citizen had crammed Ortenberg's little property in a portmantua, and ſhed torrents of tears. All was now ready, the poſtillion blew his horn, the horſes ſtamped, Ortenberg took Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roline by the hand, and aſſiſted her to get into the carriage. He had already put one foot into it, to follow her, when the old Citizen, who had been ſtanding behind him, holding his hat in his hand pulled him by the coat, looking at him with tearful eyes, and ſeizing him by the hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word.</p>
                        <p>"My benefactor!" exclaimed Ortenberg, while the tears guſhed from his eyes, and threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the trembling arms of the old man.</p>
                        <p>"My ſon!" ſtammered the old man. This was all they were able to utter. The old man diſengaged himſelf from Ortenberg's arms, laid his hands upon his head, as if he were going to give him his benediction, and raiſed his eyes to heaven. He ſeemed to pray. He then ſhook him violently by the hand, and ſuddenly turned into another ſtreet.</p>
                        <p>The honeſt old man loſt, by Ortenberg's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, his only and laſt comfort, and ſurvived it but a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>The travellers reached the place of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination in a ſhort time, without complaining once of the badneſs of the roads; for their hearts were as ſerene as the ſky. Ortenberg's arrival having been notified previouſly to the citizens
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037761_0183_100F05E4C019B220"/>
of W**, they had prepared a ſmall but comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able houſe in the ſuburbs for his reception. His appointment, by an immediate order from the king, his winning modeſty, Caroline's charming livelineſs, the friendſhip of a man of Elhenhorſt's conſequence; all this contributed to procure him the moſt flattering reception at W**.</p>
                        <p>As Elhenhorſt, on account of the impending duel, pretended that the moſt urgent buſineſs would not permit him to ſtay long, the young couple celebrated their marriage a few weeks after his arrival. I ſhall not attempt to draw a picture of that happy day; for Caroline's, Ortenberg's, and Elhenhorſt's feelings cannot be expreſſed by words; as for the other gueſts who were invited on that occaſion—they ate, drank, played, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſported their wit, and conducted themſelves perfectly as German gueſts are wont to do on a German wedding. The young couple were teaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the jocund company, till—till Hymen join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hands with his brother Amor.</p>
                        <p>The new-married couple were yet faſt aſleep in the morning, when the ſmacking whip of the poſtillion rouſed Elhenhorſt. "God bleſs you!" ſaid he, as he ſtole by the bridal chamber on tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe: "May all your days be like this ſmiling ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal morning, and may you want for nothing but your departing friend."</p>
                        <p>The morning was beautiful. The pure picture of the riſing ſun trembled in Elhenhorſt's parting tears. He wiſhed to have witneſſed the firſt rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his awaking friend—and the enchanting bluſhes of the lovely bride; however, he was bound by his word of honour, and flew through the gate, which juſt had been opened.</p>
                        <p>The ſerene ſky, the variegated verdure of the fields, and the beautiful banks of the Rhine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the gloom which overclouded his mind.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:037761_0184_100F05E6F93AB9F0"/>
Indeed nature can make any thing of us; we laugh and weep, we exult and mourn with that all powerful enchantreſs. Elhenhorſt experienced that change of feelings, and the confirmation of this truth.</p>
                        <p>Nature, that ſublime painter, charmed him till he came to Duiſburg, with the moſt exhilarating pictures and groupes. The Rhine ſerpentined before him, through fertile fields; floating ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers decked its proud ſurface, and the rays of the ſun reflected from its blue waves. The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly <hi>Ruhr</hi> ſought her majeſtic friend, creeping with ſoft murmurs through rich meadows and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and ruſhing exulting in his arms. The maſts of light colliers appeared and diſappeared alternately between the cluſters of trees which lined the banks. The milk girl came ſinging from the paſture, carrying her clean ewer on her head; the wild dove cooed in the top of the tree, and the lark carolled her cheerful matins. The contented countryman earned with ſerene ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the reward of his labour, the pipe of the ſhepherd reſounded through the plain, and ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flocks gamboled on the verdant hills.</p>
                        <p>But when Elhenhorſt had left Duiſburg, and was going to croſs the proud foreſt of oaks, which the ancient Romans already admired, clouds, big with thunder, towered on the ſouthern horizon, and darkened the gloomy foreſt. The ſtorm roared in the tops of the majeſtic oaks, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured indignantly, lightnings whizzed through their branches, a heavy ſhower of rain waſhed their dark leaves. The horſes who were brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the foreſt, fled frightened in every direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the wild boar concealed himſelf in the thicket, and the ſquirrel fled to find ſhelter in a hollow tree. Elhenhorſt's mind was overſpread with a melancholy gloom, anxious preſentiments
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037761_0185_100F05E87B7C9788"/>
ſtraitened his boſom, and every flaſh of lightning appeared to him to unfold a dark futurity.</p>
                        <p>But he had ſcarcely left the foreſt behind, when the ſtorm ceaſed, the thunder was ſilent, and the ſun emerged from the womb of the dark clouds in majeſtic ſplendor, forming a radiant rain-bow in the moiſt atmoſphere. Every pearly flower perfumed the air with new fragrancy: the odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous exhalations which emanated from the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling meadows, refreſhed Elhenhorſt's languid frame, and the gloom of his mind fled as the clouds diſappeared from the horizon.</p>

                     <p>"He arrived at Duſſeldorf at ſeven o'clock in the evening. When he mentioned his name at the gate, the officer who was on guard gave him a note, which had been left for him. It contained the following words:</p>

At nine o'clock! ſaid Elhenhorſt, ſoftly, and flung the letter on the table, without being vexed at the brutal wit and the fooliſh boaſting of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt. After dinner he wrote the following letter to Ortenberg:</p>

                           <p>The world is ruled by prejudices, the fool and the wiſe obey them. The fool, becauſe he knows not what prejudice is; the wiſe, becauſe he is not always capable of deſpiſing them with the contempt which they deſerve. Very ſmall is the number of thoſe whoſe unſhackled mind weighs every action in the balance of cool reaſon; and I muſt confeſs that I am not one of them. I have received a challenge, and muſt obey the fatal law of honour. If I ſhould fall I beg you will accept the encloſed draft, as the laſt proof of my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Send it to Cleves, to my old faithful ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who will haſten to execute the laſt commands of his maſter. I ſhall be no more if you really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this letter; for, I have ordered William to deliver it only in that caſe. Kiſs your lovely wife in my name. God bleſs you.

                     <p>The encloſed note was a draft of eight thouſand dollars. He alſo wrote a letter to his ſiſter, to whoſe children he left his whole property, in caſe he ſhould be killed, recommending his old ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard to them. He then took a walk, ſaw the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gallery of pictures, and a few more remarkable objects, and went to bed at ten o'clock. He ſlept ſoundly till next morning, when William came to tell him that his horſe was ſaddled.</p>
                     <p>He was at the appointed place a little before nine o'clock. The Colonel did not keep him wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They ſaluted each other coldly. Each of them had only one ſervant with them. The ſun was divided, and they agreed to fire at the diſtance

of eight ſteps. Elhenhorſt did all this with ſilent caution, and a ſeriouſneſs and coolneſs which ſeemed to diſconcert his antagoniſt a little. The Colonel changed colour ſeveral times, his hand trembled when he put the powder on the pan, and he ſquinted with confuſed looks from under his hat, at his cool-tempered antagoniſt, who ſtood oppoſite him in the calmeſt poſition, holding his piſtols under his left arm, and looking at him with unſhaken tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>"Will you ſoon be ready?" aſked he at laſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impatiently.</p>

                        <p>He preſſed his hat in his face, and folded his arms. Elhenhorſt fired his piſtol in the air.</p>

                        <p>The Colonel fired, and Elhenhorſt fell. He ſpoke no more. The ball had penetrated the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his breaſt. He turned himſelf ſeveral times in the ſand, and died without a groan.</p>
                        <p>The Colonel fled to Holland. His rich rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions huſhed the affair up, and impoſed upon the king. The villain was promoted ſix years after this incident to the rank of General, and appointed Governor of W**. His arrival at that place drove peace and contentment from the abode of honeſt Ortenberg. Caroline's death—Ortenberg's flight—all this is now no longer a myſtery to my readers.</p>

orchards and fertile fields ſurrounded the cheerful valley, to which none of thoſe vices had penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which diſgrace the gorgeous-palaces of the great. Good natured, pious people ſpent there their guiltleſs life in happy uniformity, which alone makes days glide away like hours. A cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman—peace be with his aſhes—a clergyman who, as a pious teacher of virtue and a feeling man, led his ſmall flock the road of true happineſs, and was a pattern of meekneſs and modeſty, had lived twenty-ſix years among his peaſants like a beloved father in the circle of his family.

                        <p>"Let us now depart in the name of God!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed he, taking his ſtaff in one hand and the little William, who was eight years old, by the other: "let us turn our backs on this town, yet without ſhaking the duſt from our ſhoes. May God mend thoſe that are not incorrigible, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thoſe who are ſtung by a repenting conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Come, boy, let us wander to the huts of peace!"</p>
                        <p>William, who neither knew nor cared to know what his foſter-father meant by the <hi>huts of peace,</hi> tied his ſmall bundle of linen to a ſhort ſtick, and as it juſt ſtruck ſeven o'clock, rejoiced inwardly that he was permitted to ſtroll though the fields, inſtead of going to ſchool, he was highly pleaſed with the change of his ſituation; and are we not all like children on ſuch occaſions? Even the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of a melancholy accident, makes, in the firſt moment, an agreeable impreſſion upon us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our ſoul is conſtantly panting after a change of ſenſations.</p>
                        <p>The road to the neighbouring village led by the church yard. Conrad thought it would produce a ſalutary effect, if he were to agitate the young mind of the artleſs boy by ſenſations which could not be expunged in the ſolitude that was going to receive them, and, perhaps, might have an uſeful influence on his future life. He conducted him to the grave of his mother, which diſtinguiſhed itſelf by the freſhneſs of the clay.</p>
                        <p>"Kneel down!" ſaid he to William, proſtrating himſelf upon the grave: "here is your good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entombed; ſhe hears us; her ſpirit ſoars round us. Do you ſtill recollect her?</p>

                        <p>Conrad had gained his purpoſe; William's heart was deeply<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> affected. They quitted the church-yard. Conrad caſt a laſt melancholy look at the grave of the good old Captain. No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monument told the paſſing wanderer whoſe aſhes were reſting here. Cloſe to it was a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did mauſoleum of an uſurer, founded upon tears and groans of ruined widows and orphans.</p>
                        <p>They arrived at the village againſt noon. Old Conrad had made up his mind to requeſt a night's lodging of the firſt inhabitant he ſhould meet, and in caſe of failure, to apply to the clergyman, whoſe benevolence and humanity were generally known.</p>
                        <p>The villagers being juſt employed in getting their harveſt in, he went through a great part of the place without meeting with a ſingle perſon.

He was ſitting upon a bench beneath the ſhade of a lime-tree, and had a ſhort pipe in his mouth. He roſe when he ſaw the ſtrangers, taking his worſted cap off and bidding them a good day.</p>

                        <p>Old Conrad went to his room, knelt down, and thanked Providence for the unexpected aſylum he had found. Barbara could not ſpeak well enough of Mr. Unger's civility.

He ſpoke of youthful ſins, and obſerved that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſinner continued to walk on the road of vice, only becauſe he thought that his amendment would come too late.

                        <p>When the clergyman concluded with the words, "Ye deluded ſinners, return to the path of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; come and throw yourſelves into the arms of virtue and piety; that the Lord may have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on your ſouls, when you are called hence!" he heard him ſob audibly. This appeared ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to him. "It is impoſſible," thought he, "that ſuch a good and compaſſionate man could have been a villain. What may be the cauſe that this ſermon made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon him?" He could not refrain from aſking his hoſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when they went home.</p>
                        <p>"Alas!" replied Unger, preſſing Conrad's hand violently, "I was a great ſinner!

This unexpected diſcovery rendered the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of poor William more comfortable. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had, indeed, not much, but what little he poſſeſſed, he ſhared willingly and honeſtly with him. His father had died two years ſince, and enjoyed in his advanced age the pleaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix years an ocular witneſs of the repentance and amendment of his only ſon. He did not truſt to external appearances in the beginning, and apprehended his ſon's conduct was nothing but a farce which he acted in order to be appointed his heir. But when four years had elapſed and every one gave his ſon the teſtimony that he was the worthieſt character in the whole pariſh, his paternal heart was at laſt ſoftened, he recalled his curſe and exchanged it for his bleſſing. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger never rendered himſelf again unworthy of it. The recollection of his former deviations from the path of virtue, rendered him more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and all his actions were weighed in the balance of a rigorous conſcience. A perſon who has once loſt his innocence and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſincerely, is leſs expoſed to the dangers of ſeduction than unſuſpecting ſimplicity; and what is virtue which never has been tried nor over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dangers and difficulties? nothing elſe but ſounding braſs or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

                     <p>SIX years had already elapſed in uninterrupted uniformity. Conrad carried on his profeſſion, and as Unger let him live in his houſe rent free, and beſides, gave him all aſſiſtance his circumſtances could afford, he ſupported himſelf honeſtly. The good clergyman inſtructed William ſome hours every day with his own children; the boy grew up, was healthy in body and mind, and would have been compleatly ſatisfied with his fate, had not the ſpiteful Barbara frequently imbittered his ſcanty fare and childiſh pleaſures. She called him every day a beggar boy, and his father a good for nothing vagabond, who never would return again, and probably had long ſince died on a dunghill. This afflicted the lad moſt painfully. He ſat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a day in a ſolitary buſh and wept. Old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad applied indeed the horſewhip, ſometimes, which always produced a momentary calm; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was of too peaceful a diſpoſition to be able to have every day recourſe to that expedient, and Barbara grew daily more fractious and ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, particularly after ſhe had failed in a certain deſign upon Unger's heart, probably becauſe it

was not ſufficiently ſupported by her charms. One day—however we ſhall let the acting perſons ſpeak themſelves.</p>

                        <p>I will be plain with you. It reflects, indeed, no honour on my wife; however, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara, I can't help it, you have nobody to blame but yourſelf.

                     <p>The negroes, who were the only perſons in the room who knew what a terrible puniſhment it is, in thoſe hot countries, to be doomed to work in the mines, ſmiled at each other, and nodded applauſe.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg continued: if <hi>this</hi> be the caſe, I muſt, indeed, leave him here no longer; for, I rather would have him to be among the Malays, than with a ſcold. But what ſhall I do? Take him with me now? There is no room in my chaiſe. Poſtpone my journey? that will not do; I muſt abſolutely go to the town of Wernigerode. <stage>(Muſing a few moments).</stage> Is there no clergyman in the village?</p>

                        <speaker>Conrad.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, Sir, we have one, a dear old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. He has inſtructed William gratis theſe ſeven years.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Ortenberg.</speaker>
                        <p>Did he? God will bleſs him for it. Come, honeſt Spiller, I muſt preſs that man to my heart, upon my ſoul I muſt.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>Old Conrad put his Sunday's coat on, and they went together to the parſonage. The miniſter's wife received them at the door with a cheerful countenance.</p>
                     <p>"Will you take a walk in the garden? my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is watering his flowers."</p>

"Bravo!" ſaid Ortenberg: "theſe are good aſpects. I do not think, friend Spiller, that my Negroes will have an opportunity here of making uſe of their ſalivary talent." Welli! Welli! groaned he, when he ſlept into the garden, and Conrad perceived a tear ſtarting from his eye. The clergyman came to meet them, and both were the moſt cordial friends before an hour had elapſed; for, when two open-hearted and honeſt men meet, they feel in the firſt minute benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in the ſecond confidence, and in the third love for each other; and the fourth cements their hearts with indiſſoluble bonds. Ortenberg at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to force a ring of great value upon the honeſt clergyman, as a proof of his gratitude for having inſtructed his poor nephew ſeven years, without having had any proſpect of being reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ring was firmly rejected. "My heart," ſaid the worthy man, "has rewarded me ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently for what I have done; you would rob me of this reward, were you to force me to exchange it for a jewel, which I even cannot value."</p>
                     <p>The honeſt ſeaman was ſenſible that the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was perfectly right; however, it grieved him to appear to be ungrateful, and no ſmile graced his ſun-burnt cheeks till he had obtained the promiſe from the diſintereſted old man, to be intruſted with the fate of his two eldeſt ſons. His looks brightened inſtantly up, and he now ſcrupled not a moment to requeſt the clergyman to take his nephew a few weeks in his houſe, till he ſhould return from Wernigerode, which was cheerfully granted. This ſmall number of good people ſeated themſelves round a table which was loaded with no other delicacies but freſh butter and fruits; however, hilarity adorned their faces, from which no French cook had diſpelled the colour of health.</p>

Againſt the concluſion of the frugal meal, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg whiſpered a few words in the ear of one of his negroes, who left the room, and ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again with ſome bottles of cape-wine, a tobacco-pouch, made of buffalo ſkin, and a long Indian pipe. "Heyday, children," exclaimed Ortenberg, when he ſaw him come; "joy and mirth are not far off, when friends and wine are together. I can eaſily perceive that you wiſh to know what has happened to me, during my long abſence from my native country?

A ſpark from the wick fell unfortunately into the bung-hole, the brandy caught fire, the caſk burſt, and the burning liquor got among the charcoals. Some pails of water were poured upon the coals, and the fire ſeemed to be entirely extinguiſhed.</p>
                     <p>"Water! more water! exclaimed the captain: "pour a deluge on the coals."</p>
                     <p>"The coals began to ſwim. "It is of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence!" ſaid the Captain to me. We went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon deck, reſuming our converſation and ſmoaking our pipes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:037761_0210_100F061CD9ADC2D0"/>
"But what ſhould happen? Half an hour after, we heard again violent cries of fire. The Captain flew down, and I after him. It was a confounded ugly buſineſs. The flames beat in our faces, the fire had ſpread among the coals, and the danger was the more preſſing as three rows of brandy caſks were piled upon one another, contiguous to the coals. An immenſe quantity of water was poured upon them, when a new misfortune added to the danger of our ſituation. The half extinguiſhed coals cauſed ſuch a thick, ſulphurous, and benumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſmoak, that we were in danger of being ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. However, we ſtruggled bravely againſt the impending danger. The Captain maintained his poſt like a man, commanding his people with the greateſt calmneſs, and the fellows relieved each other by turns, to reſpire a few moments on deck. However, ſeveral of the crew were ſuffocated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could get out of the hold. I myſelf was obliged to lean my head againſt a caſk, and to turn my face towards the opening, to draw a mouthful of pure air.</p>
                     <p>"Neither the Captain nor myſelf, could, at length, ſtand it any longer; we were obliged to quit the hold, and I adviſed him to order his gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder to be thrown over board. But he would not liſten to my advice. "What the d—I ſhall we do, if an enemy were to attack us?" I thought being taken was not half ſo bad as being blown up. However, he was of a different opinion, and the gun-powder remained where it was.</p>
                     <p>"The fire craſhed and crackled in a dreadful manner, the ſuffocating ſmoak grew thicker and thicker, and no perſon could ſtay in the hold any longer. The fellows took to their hatchets, and cut holes through the lower deck, pouring floods of water down. Our long boat had been in ſea three weeks, and the little boat had alſo been launched,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:037761_0211_100F061ECF902950"/>
becauſe it was in the way of our people. The general terror was dreadful, no land or ſhip was near, and nothing could be ſeen but fire and water. Our people ſlipped overboard, one after the other, and ſwam to the boats, where they concealed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the benches, intending to leave us in the lurch, as ſoon as their number ſhould be large enough.</p>
                     <p>"The ſteerſman accidentally looked over board, and perceived the boats crowded with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; thoſe that were in the long-boat, called and beckoned to him; fear made him turn a traitor; he jumped over board and joined his companions. "But let us at leaſt take the Captain in!" D—n the Captain!" replied the fellows, "his command is at an end." They cut the cable and run away. I could not blame them for it; for every one is his own neareſt neighbour.</p>
                     <p>"I was ſtill on the lower deck, aſſiſting the Captain. We worked till the ſweat ran in ſtreams from our bodies, apprehending no treachery, when our people ſuddenly exclaimed, "Merciful God! we are loſt; the boats have given us the ſlip!" You may eaſily conceive how we ſtared when we got on the upper deck, and ſaw the fugitives row briſkly away. But what could we do? The Captain order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ſail to be hoiſted, and his people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to come up with the traitors, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to run them down, if they ſhould refuſe to take us in.</p>
                     <p>"We ſtrained every nerve to overtake them; but Providence ordained it otherwiſe. We were within a cable's length from them, when they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wind, and we ſoon loſt ſight of them.</p>
                     <p>"Children," ſaid the Captain, "make your peace with God, and redouble your exertions, otherwiſe we ſhall be inevitably loſt. Run and throw the gunpowder overboard, before the fire reaches the barrels."</p>

                     <p>"Do not give way to deſpair," ſaid the Captain, "God may yet preſerve us, more water my lads!"</p>
                     <p>"More water was poured down; deſpair gave us additional ſtrength; we poured torrents upon the flame, and the fury of the sire ſeemed to abate.</p>
                     <p>"However, our joy was of a ſhort duration. The oil caſks caught fire, a circumſtance which rendered our ſituation ſtill more deſperate.

Yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued our labour with unabating aſſiduity, carrying water into the hold, and throwing powder barrels over board. We had already flung ſixty barrels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea; however, there were ſtill three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred left: they took fire, and the ſhip blew up, and was ſhivered into millions of pieces in a twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye.</p>
                     <p>"I was juſt ſtanding on deck, by the main-maſt, commanding ſixty-three men, who were drawing water, there being ſtill an hundred and nineteen people on board.

                     <p>"Love of life ſoon reſtored me to the uſe of my ſenſes; I looked round me and beheld the main.

maſt at my right and the fore-maſt at my left hand I got upon the former, and groaning, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the dreadful ſcene of deſtruction which exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted itſelf to my eyes. Not one living ſoul beſides myſelf was to be ſeen. I was on the brink of deſpair, curſed the hour of my birth on account of my impending deſtruction. I thought of my father without tears, of God without murmuring, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned the juvenile raſhneſs which had involved me in that lamentable ſituation. I was already on the point of plunging into the water, to ſhorten the agonies of death, when my dog raiſed his head above the waves and ſwam towards me. Words cannot expreſs the ſenſations which I felt on ſeeing that faithful animal. The feelings which agitated my mind were ſo powerful as to draw tears from my eyes for the firſt time ſince my infancy. "Poor fellow!" exclaimed I, "come and die with your maſter!"</p>
                     <p>"The dog came nearer and crawled upon the maſt; however it turned itſelf ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under me, that I had the greateſt difficulty to keep myſelf upon it, and the dog was repeatedly thrown into the water. I endeavoured therefore to lay hold of a flat piece of the ſteerage, upon which I ſaved myſelf with the dog.</p>
                     <p>"Fear of death had hitherto ſuperceded every ſenſation of bodily pain, but I now began to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the conſequences of my fall. My back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone ſeemed to be fractured, and my head was wounded in two different places. I was ſeized with a kind of inſenſibility, and the dog licked my wounds.</p>
                     <p>"Towards evening I recovered the full uſe of my ſenſes, and caſt my eyes all around in hopes of diſcovering the long-boat. I actually ſaw it; but at a very great diſtance. The ſun was ſetting, and my laſt hopes declined with the light of day. I
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:037761_0214_100F06254C7A5600"/>
began to prepare for death, Oh! my friends, the hour of diſſolution is an awful and trying one; eſpecially when we have not acted as we ought to have done. Conſcience awakes in thoſe moments and exerciſes its natural right. That dreadful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer then recalls to our recollection every folly which we have committed, and makes us pay dear for every tranſgreſſion of our duty. We ought, indeed, always to aſk ourſelves, before we commit any action; would you act thus if this were the laſt hour of your life? and, believe me, we then would act differently in many inſtances.</p>
                     <p>"All my ſins crowded on my recollection; I imagined I ſaw my poor father and my mother be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. That night was the moſt agonizing period of my whole life. However, I thank God for it: it recalled me to the path of virtue. I was a raw and thoughtleſs young man, and nothing but ſuch a ſevere trial could have made me ſenſible of my errors.—</p>
                     <p>"I committed myſelf to the mercy of the waves all the night, and my dog whined by my ſide. The darkneſs which ſurrounded me was at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the dawn of day, and—imagine how great my joy was—the long-boat was not above ſixty yards diſtant from me. I called as loud as I could: "For God's ſake, ſave poor Ortenberg!</p>
                     <p>"Several ſailors heard me. "Ortenberg is not dead!" exclaimed they, and rowed towards me. However, as the piece of ſteerage upon which I was ſitting was entirely ſurrounded by the wrecks of the ſhip, they were afraid to come near me, apprehending that they ſhould run foul of the large pieces of timber which floated on the water. They called my dog, but the faithful animal refuſed to leave his unfortunate maſter. They deſired me to ſwim to the boat; however, my wounds had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired my ſtrength too much.</p>

"The purſer plunged at length into the water, and brought me a line which I tied round my waiſt. Thus I got ſafely into the boat, where I met Van Hoorn, the firſt mate. The crew ſurveyed me ſometime with ſpeechleſs aſtoniſhment, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to retire to a kind of cabin in the hind part of the boat, where two people could ſit. There I recovered a little from my pains and terror.</p>
                     <p>"But what ſhould we do now? I adviſed Van Hoorn to keep near the wreck till day break, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting we ſhould be able to pick up ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with which our people were but ſcantily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and, perhaps, find a compaſs; but was told "that the ſecond mate, perceiving that the crew were preparing to quit the ſhip, had taken it out of the cabin and gone to the bottom along with it.</p>
                     <p>"As for the proviſions, Van Hoorn did not think proper to follow my advice, although I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him "that I had been ſurrounded with barrels of cheeſe and ſalt meat the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when I had been ſitting on the maſt." We plied our oars diligently, expecting we ſhould ſee laud after ſun riſe. The ſun roſe, we had loſt ſight of the wrecks of the veſſel, but could ſee no land. Our people grew quite faint-hearted. They agreed that I ſhould be their Captain, becauſe they knew that I had ſome knowledge of navigation. I crept forth from my little cabin to review my people who ſeemed to be quite exhauſted with row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I inquired what proviſions they had, and they ſhewed me eight pounds of biſcuit which was their whole ſtock.</p>
                     <p>"I forbade them inſtantly to row, becauſe they had no means of refreſhing themſelves. I order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to pull off their ſhirts and to make ſails of them. But where ſhould we get thread? We were obliged to untwiſt the lines which were in the boat
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037761_0216_100F0628F3DCB7D8"/>
and to ſhift as well as we could. We had ſoon patched all our ſhirts together and made ſmall ſails of them. Our fellow-adventurers in the other boat followed our example.</p>
                     <p>"Our whole number conſiſted of ſeventy-two people, namely, forty-ſix in the long-boat, and twenty-ſix in the other. They provided me, on account of my mangled body, with a blue cloak and a blanket, the only cover which we had ſaved. Our ſurgeon was one of thoſe who had ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the long-boat, but had not a ſingle medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. He put a poultice of biſcuit on my wounds, and they mended rapidly, nature being aſſiſted by my ſound blood. I had offered my ſhirt to be likewiſe applied for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"We ſailed with a freſh breeze, and had no other guide but the ſtars. The day on which I was ſaved by the crew of the long-boat, was the twentieth of November.—The heat was intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the day-time, the ſun ſtanding directly over our heads, and my teeth chattered at night with cold, againſt which my dog alone protected me in ſome degree. We were occupied on the twenty-firſt of November and the two following days in compoſing a Jacob's ſtaff, to take the altitude. The ſhip's carpenter, who alſo knew ſomething of navigation, aſſiſted me faithfully, and we ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at laſt, after much trouble, in finiſhing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which anſwered our purpoſe tolerably well. I drew a map upon a board, ſketching Java and Sumatra, with the ſtraight which divides them, upon it.</p>
                     <p>"I had taken the altitude already on the firſt day of our miſery, and found that we were in the fifth or ſixth degree of the Southern latitude, and conſequently, only about 100 miles from land. I repeated my obſervations every day. We divided
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037761_0217_100F062AF0058888"/>
the ſeven or eight pounds of biſcuits which were in our poſſeſſion, in equal ſhares and every one of us received his daily allowance as long as it laſted. We alſo had nothing to drink, neither of the two boats being provided with water. We ſpread our ſails when it rained, and after they were ſoaked through ſqueezed the water into two ſmall caſks, the only ones which we had. This water ſerved us in the day time to quench our thirſt; an old ſhoe was our goblet.</p>
                     <p>"My companions inſiſted notwithſtanding our great want, upon my eating and drinking my fill, alledging that they could not navigate the boats without my advice, and that the diminution of proviſions, which this occaſioned would not be much perceived. However, I took no more than the reſt; and ſlipt now and then a morſel into the mouth of my dog. The other boat was in as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a ſituation as ours, and the crew apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides to be ſeparated from us by a ſtorm, eſpecially as not one of them had a ſufficient knowledge of navigation, and our boat ſailed much better than theirs. They conjured us therefore frequently to take them into our boat; however, our people would not liſten to their requeſt, for fear of expoſing ourſelves to the greateſt danger.</p>
                     <p>"We were at laſt reduced to the higheſt degree of miſery; our biſcuit was conſumed, and no land could be ſeen. Hunger raged in our entrails—I was obliged to ſee—that my dog—who had licked my wounds—warmed my feet—."</p>
                     <p>Here Ortenberg faltered, an involuntary tear ſtarted from his eye; he attempted ſeveral times to continue his narrative, however, his emotion denied him the power of utterance, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors could not help being affected by the feelings of the venerable narrator, which ſpoke more powerfully to the heart than words could have done. Every eye was moiſtened.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="64" facs="unknown:037761_0218_100ED4D8EE57E440"/>
Ortenberg reſumed at length: "Children I cannot ſpeak of the dog; upon my ſoul, I cannot!" A pauſe.</p>
                     <p>"However, what ſhould happen? The crew began to murmur. I exerted my little eloquence, to perſuade them that it was impoſſible we could be far from land; but I attempted in vain to pacify them.</p>
                     <p>"They told me to my face, that I impoſed upon them and myſelf, and had ſteered into the main ocean inſtead of ſailing towards the coaſt.</p>
                     <p>"When we were reduced to the greateſt diſtreſs, Providence ſent us a great number of mews, who hovered a conſiderable time over our long boat which enabled every one of us to catch a few of them without difficulty. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly plucked and devoured raw. What a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious meal! But what was <hi>one</hi> meal to half-ſtarved and emaciated people? Two leaden days more elapſed, and the tortures of hunger returned again, with additional fury.</p>
                     <p>"Since we all muſt periſh," exclaimed Van Hoorn: "let us die together and take our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions into the long boat!"</p>
                     <p>"This propoſal met with no oppoſition this time. We took the people, the oars and ſails out of their boat and left it to the mercy of the waves. We now had fifteen pair of oars in the long-boat which we divided among the rowers. We alſo were provided with a fore-maſt, a mizen-maſt, a large ſail and a bowſprit. The boat was pretty roomy. I divided the crew in two parties, one of which was ſitting, while the other was working the veſſel, and thus they relieved each other by turns.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven interpoſed once more in our behalf ſending us a great number of flying fiſhes, which were as large as the largeſt whitings. We ſeized them with avidity when they dropt into the boat,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:037761_0219_100F062D579765F0"/>
and devoured them raw. Again only a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary relief! We had, however, no ſick among us, which ſurpriſed me the more, as ſome of the crew had drank ſea-water, notwithſtanding my preſſing remonſtrances. Some gnawed their flints and balls, and others even drank their own urine.</p>
                     <p>"Thus our diſtreſs increaſed every hour, and death ſeemed to gain gradually upon us. Heaven ſent neither rain nor mews, nor flying fiſhes to our aſſiſtance, and our meagre countenances diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the moſt dreadful deſpair. Our people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſurvey each other with a kind of ſavage fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity; their greedy looks ſeemed to devour the fleſh of their companions. Some began already to hint that no other expedient was left than to kill a couple of our young people. I ſhuddered at that horrid idea, my heart miſgave me—I raiſed my eyes to Heaven, and implored God, not to inflict ſeverer trials on us than we can bear. I conjured my companions in the moſt affecting manner to ſpare the young people. I ſhewed them my map and the obſervations which I had made every day, and obtained at laſt, a reſpite of three days. However, they added, with the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid oaths, that they were determined to execute their infernal deſign, if we ſhould not diſcover land within that time.</p>
                     <p>"Thus the leaden hours crept ſlowly on, and the moſt excruciating torments of body and ſoul increaſed every moment. I myſelf was almoſt tempted by deſpair, to agree to their ſavage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal; however, we all were exhauſted ſo much the next morning, as to be ſcarcely able to ſtir. Few of my companions were able to riſe from their ſeats, and Van Hoorn could not move a limb. Although my wounds had weakened me very much, yet I was one of the ſtrongeſt, and
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037761_0220_100F062ED9C4F450"/>
ſtill could crawl from one end of the boat to the other.</p>
                     <p>The ſky began to be overclouded on the 2d of December, which was the thirteenth day after we had been ſhipwrecked. It began to rain violently, which refreſhed us a little. The air being calm, we could ſpread out our ſails, quench our burning thirſt and fill our caſks with water.</p>
                     <p>"I was juſt ſtanding at the helm, examining my map, and concluded that it was impoſſible we could be far diſtant from land. I even hoped that the ſky would clear up while I was on my poſt; and that I ſhould deſcry the long ſought ſhore. However, the cutting wind, and the violence of the air drove me at length away. The Quarter-Maſter relieved me, and I crept into the midſt of the croud, to warm myſelf a little.</p>
                     <p>"Not an hour had elapſed, when the ſky cleared up, and the man at the helm exclaimed unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Land! Land! and we all were on our legs in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>"The word <hi>land</hi> ſeemed to have animated us with new life.

The fellow had ſeen right: God be praiſed! we were really in ſight of land. My companions wept like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; one ran againſt the other, and all were fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic with joy. I had great trouble to ſet them to work; however, they ſoon began to row as briſkly as if every one had had a leg of mutton for break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. We crowded all our canvaſs to make the coaſt; however the violence of the ſurge prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our landing. We diſcovered at laſt, fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſmall bay where we caſt anchor, leaping on ſhore as if the gates of Paradiſe had been thrown open before us.</p>

"We diſperſed inſtantly in the woods in ſearch of nouriſhment. I threw myſelf upon the ground, kiſſing it with weeping eyes.

                     <p>"We filled our boat with young and ripe nuts, and weighed anchor againſt evening, intending to look for the iſland of Sumatra, which we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the next morning, the iſland where we had landed firſt, being only a few leagues diſtant from it. We coaſted the weſtern ſhore of Sumatra while our proviſions laſted, till neceſſity forced us at laſt to land. However, this was no eaſy taſk, the ſurge being extremely violent. Five of our beſt ſwimmers got ſafely on ſhore, and ran down

                     <p>We did it, but were prevented from working our veſſel into the river; becauſe a bank againſt which the waves broke in a furious manner, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered its mouth extremely dangerous. I was afraid to attempt working our boat through the tremendous ſurge, without having previouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the general conſent of my companions. I placed them in two rows, and took the opinion of every individual. The fellows agreed unanimouſly that we ſhould brave the danger. Well then, in the name of God, let us run the riſk! I ſtationed two ſailors with oars at the ſtern to puſh the boat off in caſe of neceſſity, and Van Hoorn took hold of the helm to ſteer the veſſel through the roaring ſurge.</p>
                     <p>"The firſt wave almoſt filled the boat, and we were obliged to throw the water out with our hats, ſhoes, and whatever implement we could find. A ſecond wave covered us entirely, and we were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of making uſe of the helm or the oars. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037761_0223_100F063571ABCA30"/>
were a treat which we had not expected to enjoy ſo ſoon.</p>
                     <p>Some of our people who had been roving over the iſland, found tobacco and fire, which gave us reaſon to hope that we could not be far from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited ſpot. We fetched our two hatchets from the boat to cut down ſome trees, and lighted large fires in different directions. My companions ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves around them and enjoyed the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco which they had ſound. We lighted an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional number of fires againſt evening, and three centinels were ſtationed at the entrance of our little camp.</p>
                     <p>"The moon was in her wane; the firſt half of the night elapſed without any ſiniſter accident, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept dreadful pains in our bowels, which was the effect of our having eaten too great a quantity of figs. I had juſt began to feel myſelf a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was going to lay myſelf down to ſleep when our centinels informed us that the natives were advancing in great numbers.</p>
                     <p>"The night was extremely dark; I concluded therefore that their deſign could not be of the moſt amicable nature. Our whole ſtore of arms conſiſted, beſides the above-mentioned hatchets, in an old ruſty ſword, and we were, at the ſame time, ſo ill, as to be ſcarcely able to ſtir.</p>
                     <p>"What ſhould we do? We reſolved at leaſt not to die unrevenged. We aſſiſted each other to get upon our legs, armed ourſelves with fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and ruſhed furiouſly upon the enemy. The ſparks flew far around, the ſight was dreadful, and the Indians took inſtantly to their heels. This was no more than natural; for, how could they have known how large our numbers were? They alſo could not gueſs that we had no other arms but a couple of hatchets and a ruſty ſword.</p>

"They retreated to the woods, and we ſat down again round our fires, where we ſpent a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable night; for, we ſtarted up when a lizard ruſtled in the dry graſs. Van Hoorn had retired to the boat, to cover our rear in caſe of an attack.</p>
                     <p>"Three Indians came the next morning with the firſt dawn of day towards us from the wood. I diſpatched three of my people, who already had made a voyage to India, and knew ſomething of the language and the cuſtoms of the country, to meet them.</p>
                     <p>"Of what nation are you?" was the firſt queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>"While they were treating together, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians proceeded towards the long-boat, to know whether we were provided with arms. However I had anticipated their errand, and ordered the ſails to be ſpread over the veſſel."</p>
                     <p>"Undoubtedly," ſaid our people, "we have got plenty of muſkets and more powder and ball than we ſhall want."</p>
                     <p>"Upon this intelligence they marched off again, and promiſed to bring us rice and fowls. They kept their word, and we gave them about ſix ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings which we had collected among ourſelves. They ſeemed to be perfectly ſatisfied with their bargain.</p>
                     <p>"Aſſume a commanding air," ſaid I to our people, "and treat them as if you were at home here!"</p>
                     <p>"We ſat down upon the graſs with apparent unconcern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and began to feaſt upon our purchaſe.</p>

"We enquired after the name of their iſland. They pronounced a great number of unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words; however, the word <hi>Sumatra</hi> was not amongſt them. Nevertheleſs, we were ſtill in hopes that the iſland where we were could be no other; becauſe they mentioned Java, and pointed with their hands towards the direction in which we ſuppoſed it muſt be ſituated.</p>
                     <p>"You cannot conceive how much we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the ſuppoſed confirmation of our hopes; for, as it is not practicable to navigate the great ocean without a compaſs, we apprehended con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to rove at random on the extenſive deſert of the ſea from eaſt to weſt, and from weſt to eaſt, without ever gaining the object of our wiſhes. And what was our final object? It was no other than to reach a Dutch port, and to be again among Chriſtians. Blockhead that I was! I was never worſe treated than among Chriſtians, and ſpent the happieſt time of my life with an Heathen.</p>
                     <p>"All ſeemed to be well; our people were cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and in good health, and impatient to quit the iſland; however, we were entirely deſtitute of proviſions. What ſhould we do? We diſcovered a kind of hamlet at ſome diſtance, and I reſolved to venture going up the river in a canoe, with four of my companions, and to buy, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our money, as much proviſions as we could get.</p>
                     <p>"We arrived ſafely within a ſmall diſtance of the hamlet. I ſent immediately rice and fowls to Van Hoorn, to divide them amongſt our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. As for myſelf, I had a moſt delicious meal with my fellow-adventurers. The beverage of the Indians, which they draw from a certain tree, was likewiſe not to be rejected, and almoſt got into our heads.</p>

"The iſlanders were ſtanding around us, while we dined in public, and whenever we moved our hand to the plate, followed us with greedy looks, and devoured every morſel with their eyes, before we could carry it to our lips. When we had finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our meal, I purchaſed a buffalo; however, the animal was ſo wild and untractable, as to render it impoſſible for us to lay hold of him, or to drive him before us.</p>
                     <p>"Time elapſed rapidly, and evening began to be ſetting in apace. I went towards the boat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending rather to return again in the morning than to expoſe myſelf to the ferocity of the Indians. My attendants preſſed me to give them leave to ſtay in the hamlet all night, pretending that they ſhould be able to catch the buffalo in the dark. I attempted to diſſuade them from their dangerous deſign; however they refuſed to liſten to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, and I conſented at laſt to let them do as they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>"When I had almoſt gained the bank of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I met<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a troop of Indians, who, as far as I could gueſs by their geſtures, were conſulting together whether they ſhould let me paſs unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted or no. My ſituation was extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. However, I ſeized two of them by the arm, and puſhed them with the air of a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who is not uſed to be contradicted, towards the canoe. They looked ferociouſly at me but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs got into the canoe, and began to row briſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Both were armed with a dagger, or a <hi>crid,</hi> as they call it, and my life was conſequently in their power.</p>
                     <p>"When we had proceeded a little way, the hindmoſt came to me in the middle of the boat, where I was ſtanding, and intimated to me by geſtures, that he wanted money. I took a ſmall coin out of my pocket, and offered it to him. He
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037761_0227_100F063DE58C51E8"/>
contemplated it at firſt with dubious looks, but at laſt wrapped it in a piece of Calico, which he wore round his waiſt. It was but natural that his companion alſo expected to receive ſomething for his trouble. He came alſo towards me, and made the ſame geſtures. I gave him likewiſe a piece of money which he turned round and round, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined on both ſides. He ſeemed more undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined than his companion, whether he ſhould keep it or diſpatch me, which he could have done eaſily as I was quite deſtitute of arms.</p>
                     <p>"You may conceive that I was rather uneaſy at my ſituation. I was ſenſible of the greatneſs of the danger, and my heart beat violently. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he kept it at laſt, and we proceeded down the river with great celerity. When we had finiſhed nearly one half of our way, my two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductors began to talk with great heat, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by their geſtures, that they ſhould attack me both at once; I cannot deny that I trembled violently. I knew not what to do; and in the agony of my heart began to ſing with ſo loud and vociferous a voice, as made the woods reſound on both ſides of the river. My conductors were ſeized with a violent fit of laughter, and ſtared a few moments at me with aſtoniſhment. I could conclude by their countenance, that they did not ſuſpect me in the leaſt of fear or miſtruſt; and thus learned by my own experience, what I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had heard aſſerted, but never would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a high degree of fear urges man to ſing.</p>
                     <p>"When I perceived that this expedient ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, I continued to ſing as loud as I could, while the boat proceeded down the river with great rapidity. I ſoon got ſight of our boat, and made a ſign to our people with my handkerchief

unperceived by my conductors. They ſaw it and fled to my aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>"I now endeavoured to make the Indians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they both muſt ſtand in the ſtern of the canoe, if I ſhould be able to get on ſhore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I apprehended one of them would attack me from behind, while I quitted their veſſel. They obeyed without the leaſt contradiction, and I join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt my companions without having received any injury.</p>
                     <p>"The two Indians enquired carefully previous to their return, where we intended to ſpend the night? We pointed at ſome huts, which we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of braches and leaves. They then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired where Van Hoorn and I intended to ſleep? We replied, "in the long-boat under our ſails;" upon which they got into their canoe, and paddled away.</p>
                     <p>"I related to our people every thing that had happened to me, and gave them hopes that we ſhould ſee our companions again in the morning, with the buffalo which we had bought. The night paſſed in death like ſtillneſs; the ſun roſe, but we ſaw neither our companions nor the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falo, and began to be very apprehenſive about the ſafety of the poor fellows. At length we ſaw two Indians driving a buffalo; however I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtantly that it was not the ſame which I bought the preceding day. One of our people, who had a ſmattering of their language, inquired after the cauſe of that exchange and what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my four companions. They pretended that the firſt buffalo had been too wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable, and that our people would ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them with a ſecond. This appeared ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to me; for the buffalo which they had brought us, was as wild and untractable as that of the preceding day.

be knocked on the head inſtantly, for fear we ſhould loſe our purchaſe a ſecond time.</p>
                     <p>"When the two blacks ſaw the buffalo drop down, they ſet up a moſt dreadful howl, and from two to three hundred Indians ruſhed upon this ſignal from the woods directly towards the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, probably with an intention to cut off our retreat, and to maſſacre every one of us without mercy. Thoſe of our people who had been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in lighting a fire at ſome diſtance, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their intention firſt, and appriſed us of it by a ſignal. I raiſed my eyes, and ſaw forty or fifty more Indians flying towards us from another ſide. Our ſituation was deſperate; however, I animated my people to be faint-hearted. "They are naked wretches," ſaid I; "let us fight them in the plain, and I will pledge my word we will ſoon make them run away as faſt as they came." However, I had reckoned without my hoſt. They grew more numerous every moment. Moſt of them were armed with a ſhield, and had a ſhort ſword in the right hand.</p>
                     <p>"Let us retreat to the boat! exclaimed I, when I ſaw this; for it would have been madneſs, if our ſmall defenceleſs troop had attempted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage immenſe numbers, a grain of ſand againſt a billow of the ſea. We ran as faſt as we could towards the long-boat, and thoſe who could not run faſt enough, plunged into the river and ſwam on board. The enemy was cloſe at our heels.</p>
                     <p>"We were, unfortunately, not prepared for a ſudden departure, having ſpread all our ſails over the boat, in the form of a tent. What ſhould we do? One part of us made all poſſible haſte to ſet the veſſel afloat, whilſt the reſt defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the two hatchets and the ſword, as well as they could. But what did our reſiſtance

avail? The hindmoſt were pierced by the za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gavas (a kind of lances with hooks) of the blacks.</p>
                     <p>"The ſhip's baker, a ſtout gigantic fellow, handled the ſword with great dexterity, and made a dreadful havock among the blacks. I ordered the cable to be cut, and we now rowed away as faſt as our conſternation would permit. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages purſued us into the water, but ſoon loſt ground, and were obliged to abandon their prey. We did all that lay in our power, to pick up our unfortunate companions, who were ſwimming in the river. Thoſe that were not mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, came ſafely on board, a land breeze came to our aſſiſtance, and wafted our veſſel over the ſand banks, through the rocks and the foaming ſurge.</p>
                     <p>"Our enemies had expected that our veſſel would be daſhed to pieces againſt the rocks, and had run to the outermoſt point of the cape; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they were diſappointed in their expectation. We waved our hats, ſet up a loud ſhout, and ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with a briſk breeze.</p>
                     <p>I examined the wound of the brave baker, as ſoon as we were out of danger and perceived that it had been inflicted with a poiſoned lance. It was above the navel, and the ſurrounding parts had already turned black. I began to cut out large pieces of fleſh, to prevent the poiſon from ſpreading farther, but the pains which the poor fellow ſuffered, were to no purpoſe; he dropt down dead at my feet, and we committed his body to the waves.</p>
                     <p>"I counted my companions, and found that ſixteen were miſſing, eleven having been killed on ſhore. The fate of our four companions, whom I had left in the hamlet, was unknown to us; however, we had the greateſt reaſon to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that they had become the firſt victims of our ferocious enemies.</p>

A troop of people took to ſlight when we landed.

However, we found ſweet water, and the rocks with which the ſhore was lined, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us oyſters and muſcles, which we ate with great reliſh, and ſeaſoned with black pepper, of which I had bought a whole hat full in the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
                     <p>"After we had appeaſed the cravings of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we filled our pockets with oyſters and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, repleniſhed our caſks with water, and went again on board.</p>

We apprehended every moment to be buried by the mountainous waves, but nevertheleſs rejoiced at having altered our courſe. Had we continued to ſail along the coaſt, the tempeſt would, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, have daſhed us againſt a rock, or we ſhould have been compelled to land in the neareſt bay, the inhabitants of which, as we afterwards learned, were ſworn enemies to the Dutch, and perſecuted them with fire and ſword.</p>
                     <p>"The tempeſt abated at day-break, and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived three iſlands which lay cloſe before us. We reſolved to go on ſhore, becauſe we expected to find ſome nouriſhment, though they ſeemed to be uninhabited. We ſhaped our courſe to

that which was neareſt, and found that it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely overgrown with bamboo as thick as a man's leg. Neceſſity teaches us to turn almoſt any thing to advantage. We excavated a great number of the thickeſt bamboos from top to bottom, filled them with water and cloſed them carefully. Thus we had multiplied our two water caſks. We alſo found palm trees on the iſland, the fruit of which ſerved to appeaſe our hunger. But this was the only ſort of proviſions which we could find. We roved the whole iſland in every direction, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could find nothing but palm trees and bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boos.</p>
                     <p>"The next morning, at ſun riſe, I climbed up to the top of a high mountain which lay before us, having a ſecret preſentiment that I ſhould make an important diſcovery. I ſtood there and gazed a good while to no purpoſe; my looks wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered over the immenſe creation of God. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gazed till my eyes ached, I thought I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two high blue mountains at a very great diſtance. I recollected that Hans van Shouten, my former maſter, God bleſs him, who had been twice in the Eaſt-Indies, had told me frequently that two high mountains were on the iſland of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, which ſeemed to be blue at a certain diſtance. I concluded further: we came to this iſland when we had the coaſt of Sumatra to our leſt, theſe mountains are to the right, my eyes rove through the ſpace which is between them, without deſcry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing land; there is a ſtrait between Sumatra and Java—hurray! we are on the right tract!</p>
                     <p>"I ſkipt down the mountain as ſwift as a doe to call Van Hoorn, and to communicate my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to him; however, the clouds had conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blue mountains before we could reach the ſpot from whence I had ſeen them.

them. Van Hoorn agreed that my conjecture was not improbable, and we went down again to inform our companions of it.</p>
                     <p>"The joy of our people cannot be deſcribed, they ſung and danced as they carried dates and bamboos filled with water into the boat. The wind was favourable; we weighed anchor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected our courſe towards the blue mountains.</p>
                     <p>"We ſaw a fire at midnight, and thought a long time that it proceeded from a ſhip; however, it was on an iſland which lays in the entrance of the ſtrait.

We were becalmed towards day-break; however—thank God! we were already near the coaſt of Java with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it.</p>
                     <p>"A ſailor who had climbed up the maſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed ſuddenly that he ſaw a fleet, and counted three and twenty ſhips. Our joy was greater than words can expreſs; we danced, ſung, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced each other with tears. We ſteered towards the fleet as ſoon as a ſlight breeze got up. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Providence! (Ortenberg pulled his hat off, and a tear gliſtened in his eyes) it was a Dutch fleet, and we threw ourſelves into the arms of our countrymen and friends.</p>
                     <p>"The Admiral, Van Ternaer, was juſt ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the gallery with a ſpying-glaſs, and being ſtruck by the ſingularity of our ſails and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſent his boat to meet us. Good God! the people who were in it were acquaintances of our's; we had ſailed together from the Texel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>"They took me and Van Hoorn into the boat and brought us on board of the Admiral's ſhip. All the ſailors gazed at us with aſtoniſhment, and Van Ternaer received us like brothers. It ſhould

ſeem that he perceived by our looks that we were hungry; for he ordered the cloth to be laid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and ſat down with us to dinner. Good God! how was I affected when I ſaw bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain! my heart was ſtraitened, the tears ſtarted from my eyes, and I was not able to ſwallow a morſel for ſome time. The reſt of our people joined us ſoon after, and were divided amongſt the ſhips.</p>

My romantic ideas had been correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pretty well, my deſire for adventures had aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, now I began to aſk myſelf where I ſhould get bread?</p>
                     <p>"We arrived at Batavia; the people crowded around myſelf and my companions, ſtared at us, liſtened to us with open mouths, and ſhuddered at our tale; however that was all. Not one of them thought of covering our nakedneſs or appeaſing our hunger; and I confeſs I rather would have ſtarved than ſolicited alms.</p>

"I had, fortunately, applied cloſely to draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my youth, and now could eaſily delineate ſomething upon a piece of parchment which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a human figure. I drew a great number of ſuch figures as my imagination ſuggeſted. Some with hats and ſome with turbans, and ſold them for Roman and Turkiſh emperors. I ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this miſerable manner from one town to the other, viſited Balambuan, Panarucan, Tuban, and came, at laſt, to Bantam in the bay of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catra.</p>
                     <p>"You muſt know that Bantam is a conſiderable place where an extenſive trade is carried on. You can ſee there at nine o'clock in the morning, people of almoſt all nations aſſembled in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place; Portugueſe, Arabs, Turks, Malayes, Abyſſinians, Chineſe, Peguans, Bengales, Guzu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and Malabares. One might think it Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where people of all nations are to meet. You will ſee there no uſeleſs diſputes about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or unbelief, for every one ſerves God in his own way and makes no words, as it ought to be.</p>
                     <p>While I was ſtanding there and gaping at the motley aſſemblage, and watching for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to earn a morſel of bread, I heard ſuddenly ſome perſon behind me ſpeak German. I thought it muſic from another world. My head turned mechanically towards the ſpot whence the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſounds proceeded, and I perceived a man of a middle age, with an open countenance, which inſpired confidence, diſcourſing with another man, who, as I afterwards learned, was a Hambro' Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>When they had finiſhed their converſation, and the Hamburger had left him, I took courage, went up to the man with the good natured countenance, and ſaid: "Sir, I am a poor German, a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of yours. Your countenance tells me that
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037761_0236_100F064FD6AD7738"/>
you are an honeſt man; I conjure you to do a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable deed, and to aſſiſt a ſhipwrecked wretch who has loſt all his property. I wiſh to get my bread by the labour of my hands, but have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting an honourable livelihood; for no one has confidence in a naked fellow, but I neither ſhould like to beg, nor could do it.</p>
                     <p>"The man ſurveyed me from top to toe.</p>
                     <p>"Welcome! countryman!" ſaid he at laſt: "I rejoice to do a work of charity. I do not want your ſervices, but will aſſiſt you as well as I can."</p>
                     <p>"He then took me to his houſe, gave me to eat and to drink, and abſtained from all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome queſtions, till I had appeaſed my hunger. But when I had finiſhed my meal, he began to examine me, and to enquire from what place I came. I gave him a faithful account of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and informed him without reſerve of the follies I had committed. I thought it better to confeſs my errors than to conceal them; for, we are all poor ſinners, and lock up or diſſipate the talent which the great treaſurer in Heaven has lent us, to pay for our entrance into the next world. My frankneſs gained the heart of the worthy German.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Ortenberg," ſaid he to me: "you are an honeſt man. The grief which you have cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your aged father, was early puniſhed by Providence with trouble and affliction. You now have had an opportunity of coming to a proper ſenſe; I dare ſay you have diſcarded your roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic notions, and beg you will ponder the propoſal which I am going to make to you. I am a native of Thuringia; my name is Chriſtian Shwarz I have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twenty years on this iſland; God has proſpered my diligence, and I am a rich man. My domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics love me and I enjoy the eſteem of my fellow-citizens. However, what are love, regard, and wealth, if we cannot enjoy them at the ſpot where
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037761_0237_100F0651D76B8F48"/>
we were born, if the companions of our juvenile days with whom we grew up, do not ſee and ſhare our proſperity? The voice of my native country calls loudly in my boſom; I have ſold all my plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and am going to return in a few weeks on board of a Hambro' veſſel to my dear Germany. If you will keep me company, I will defray the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your voyage, and reſtore you to the arms of your father, who will receive you joyfully.</p>
                     <p>"This was, indeed, a good and ſenſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and came from a worthy and honeſt man; but was it poſſible I could have accepted it? No, indeed, not! No, ſaid I, I cannot accept your generous offer; God knows, I cannot. I muſt firſt endeavour to become a man of whom my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needs not to be aſhamed. It would kill me were I obliged to return to my parents as a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Let the conſequences be what they may; I ſhall not return to my native country in <hi>this</hi> ſtate."</p>
                     <p>"The kind remonſtrances of honeſt Chriſtian Shwarz were thrown away upon me. I could not bear to think that my townſmen ſhould point at me in the ſtreets, and whiſper: "There goes that fool who dreamed of finding golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the Indies, and now is glad to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put his feet again under his fathers table. What a ſcourge is that good for nothing fellow to his parents!" No, I rather would be the ſlave of a Malay, rather moiſten the ſugar plantations with my ſweat, than become a laughing ſtock to my townſmen.</p>
                     <p>"When the honeſt Thuringian ſaw that he could not perſuade me to return to my native country, he counted down—it ſounds fabulous, but God knows he did—he counted down a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ponnes in gold and ſilver fannons.<note n="*" place="bottom">About 625 pounds ſterling.</note> "Take
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:037761_0238_100F06545AFC5340"/>
this money," ſaid he in a tone as if he had given me a glaſs of water; "and do not thank me. I am a rich man, and returning to my country with treaſures which would enable me to buy a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, if I were a lover of principalities. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make, previous to my departure, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a gold calix, a rich covering for the altar, and the like to the Dutch chapel. Man believes frequently that he can pay his debts to God by ſuch nonſenſical gifts; however, I think it is much better to aſſiſt a worthy ſufferer with the ſum which was deſigned for that purpoſe. This is more acceptable to God than a gold calix. Take it my friend, and go with your money to the coaſt of Coromandel, where you will find a thouſand times more opportunities of making a fortune than here. I wiſh you a happy journey. Forget not to pay a viſit to old Chriſtian Shwarz, when you once come back again to Germany.</p>
                     <p>Oh, my friends, ſeventeen years are now elapſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince Chriſtian Shwarz left the Indies. I ſtill think I ſee him in the harbour of Bantam, where he went on board of the Hambro' veſſel; I ſtill imagine that I feel the laſt honeſt ſhake of his hand, and to hear him call to me from deck:</p>
                     <p>"Farewell, Ortenberg! and when you return to Germany, forget not to ſpend a few days in the town of Wernigerode!"</p>
                     <p>"The ſhip got under ſail, and in a ſhort time was borne from my view by a riſing gale. I ſtood on the pier, and wept till ſun-ſet, and ſlept very little that night. But let us proceed!</p>
                     <p>"I now had a thouſand ponnes in my pocket. My benefactor had enjoined me not to ſtay at Java, and I had beſides, no inclination to remain there. I hired a place in a jonke which was to carry pine apples to the continent (for you muſt know that Java produces the beſt ananas in the

Indies). I paſſed Sumatra and came into the bay of Siam, whence I proceeded, after a ſhort ſtay, to Ceylon, I went from the latter iſland to the coaſt of Coromandel, viſited Negapatnam, Kari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kal, Pondicherry, Madras, Maſulipatnam, and thus approached gradually the gulf of Bengal.</p>

                     <p>"One day I happened to take a ſolitary walk into the woods near Bengal, muſing on my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt father, my old mother, and my native place. A ſweet melancholy ſtole by degrees upon my mind. The delightful notes of the chaffinch of Bengal, the plaintive ſong of the Bulbul, the wild accents of the Buzzard, the chirping of the little Quail of Gingi, and the harmonious ſong of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

My imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation roved over the immenſe ocean to my country and the place of my nativity, where I had inhaled my firſt breath, and recalled to my mind thoſe bliſsful days of childiſh innocence, when the pond on the margin of which I was went to play, appeared to me larger than the ſea which now lay before me; when Breſlau ſeemed to me to be a world, and when I hung with gazing eyes on the lips of my father, while he related after ſupper, accounts of the fabulous Indies and their aſtoniſhing treaſures.</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I would have given all the gold of the Nabobs in that moment, if I could have filled the tobacco pipe for my father, ſat down by his ſide on the ſtraw ſtool which uſed to ſtand in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Here honeſt Ortenberg was deeply affected—and attempted ſeveral times in vain to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"I can dwell no longer on this ſubject," ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered he at length, while a big tear gliſtened in his eyes: Friend Spiller you knew him!"</p>
                     <p>A ſolemn pauſe. All were powerfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. "Good old father!" exclaimed Ortenberg, raiſing his eyes and hands to Heaven: "you have forgiven me my follies; I am ſure you have; and when we meet again, wherever it be, you will receive me with that cordial ſhake of the hand with which you bade me farewell; will call to me: "Welcome my ſon;" with the ſame kind and paternal voice with which you ſaid: "God bleſs you my ſon!" yes I am ſure, you will!—and now—children, continued he, while he dried his eyes, don't mention a word more about my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if you wiſh that I ſhould reliſh my glaſs of wine."</p>
                     <p>Another pauſe. Ortenberg had collected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "I was taking a walk, as I told you, and unexpectedly found myſelf bewildered in the wood. I knew not which way I ſhould turn. While I conſulted with myſelf which direction I ſhould take, I heard ſuddenly a murmuring of water, and perceived that I was near a rill: I was dry and proceeded towards it, when I was dry and proceeded towards it, when I was met by a girl of uncommon beauty, carrying a pitcher with water. Her taper form was wrapt in a piece of chintz, an apron made of the wool of the ſheep of Tibet, floated from her waiſt, and

Gold and ſilver chains adorned her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful neck; her diamond ear-rings added little to the luſtre of her charms: her hair was anointed with cocoa oil, and wreathed round a gold pin.</p>
                     <p>"She ſurveyed me with apparent ſatisfaction from head to toe, while ſhe paſſed me, ſkipping lightly over the graſs, and uncovered her ſwelling boſom. The girl thought I, muſt ſurely be an harlot; but I was miſtaken; for I knew not that an unmarried Indian who has had a good educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is obliged to uncover her boſom, when ſhe meets a perſon that belongs to one of the higher caſts, or an European.</p>
                     <p>"This is a civility which the fair ones of the Eaſt perform with as much unconcern as our ladies make a curtſey; and to be plain, I confeſs that this cuſtom appears to me to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with propriety, than the curtſies of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which reduces a woman to a very aukward poſture, that, indeed, does not ſtrike us, becauſe we are uſed to it.</p>
                     <p>"The ſwelling boſom of the fair Indian, which was not ſqueezed up by a corſet, made me forget to quench my thirſt, and deaf to the harmonious ſtrains of the tufted lark of Malabar.

"Stranger, do you want to drink?" ſaid ſhe, with a bewitching ſweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, ſweet girl, I want to drink! replied I with a kind of voluptuous tremor.</p>
                     <p>"She came to me, offering her pitcher, and I drank. The cape-wine here is, indeed, not bad; however, I never reliſhed a liquor ſo much as the water which I received from the hands of ſmiling innocence.</p>

                     <p>"I am Welli" replied ſhe: "the daughter of the pious Bramin Akbar, who lives not far from here in a Sholtre.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sholtre a building for the accommodation of weary travellers.</note> Come with me; I will dreſs a diſh of cange<note n="†" place="bottom">Cange, boiled rice water.</note> for you."</p>

                     <p>"I ſqueezed her hand, a language which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtook in all countries. I had a waiſtcoat with glaſs buttons on; Welli wiſhed to have one; I gave it to her, and ſhe preſſed me in return to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a diamond ear-ring.</p>

                     <p>"We at laſt arrived at the ſholtre, which was not far diſtant from a pagoda, dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Wiſhnu. Her father, Akbar, a venerable

old man whoſe head was ſhaved, met us at the door. His dreſs conſiſted of a piece of Calico which was wrapt round his waiſt; his ſhoulders were covered with the aſhes of cow-dung, and his forehead was marked with three ſtrokes made with ſandal wood and ſaffron.</p>
                     <p>"Stranger, be welcome!" ſaid he: walk in and ſit down at the table of old Akbar, eat of his rice and drink of his cange.</p>
                     <p>"I accepted his invitation with pleaſure, becauſe I was as hungry as an Indian wild cat. The lovely Welli ſkipped buſily to and fro, ſtroked my hair back every now and then, and played with my glaſs buttons. Evening was ſetting in, it was too late for me to return to my lodgings; Akbar or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a couch to be prepared for me, upon which a ſlept but very little, becauſe the image of the amiable Welli was conſtantly about me, near me, and within me; upon my ſoul it was.</p>

"Praiſed be Brama!" exclaimed he three times, and then bathed himſelf. This ceremony, which is called <hi>Sandiwane,</hi> and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed every morning, is, in my opinion, by far more rational than the fumigations of Europeans at the ſhrines of their ſaints.</p>

                     <p>I ſtarted. Serve your God!" ſtammered I. Ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar ſmiled. "Young man," ſaid he with dignity: there is but one God. Let us forget the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Vedam and the bible make. He, who created millions of worlds, preſerves them, and once will regenerate them, is the object of my adoration. Fear and praiſe the Creator, abſtain from doing wrong, do as much good as you can, ſearch after wiſdom, condemn no perſon, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the old, warn the young, raiſe the falling, give to the poor, reflect upon what you was, and conſider what you will be. Oh, my ſon, you will die quietly if you have acted up to theſe principles. No ſtings of conſcience will torment you in your laſt hour, and you will be well received by your judge. This is my creed; is it yours alſo?"</p>
                     <p>"The ſolemn tone in which the venerble old man ſpoke, affected my heart. I claſped him in my arms, notwithſtanding the cow-dung on his ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>"Be my guide on the path of wiſdom," ſaid I with emotion: "Be my father in a two-fold man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner!"</p>
                     <p>"If I am to be your father," replied Akbar, you muſt comply with the manners and cuſtoms of our country. There is but <hi>one</hi> religion in the world; the mortals of the whole globe bend their knees only before <hi>one</hi> God. However, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of men has infinitely multiplied the manner of worſhipping the Supreme Being, though it ſhould be as ſimple as poſſible.

the weak; call none of your brethren an heretic; ridicule none. If you wiſh to obtain the hand of my good Welli, you muſt dreſs yourſelf like a Tamulian; I muſt inſtruct you two months in the language and cuſtoms of my nation. At the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of that period, you may come and ſay in the preſence of my relations, <hi>the gold is yours, and the girl is mine,</hi> and I ſhall reply, <hi>the gold is mine, and the girl is yours.</hi>

                     <p>"I agreed willingly to every condition that could inſure me the poſſeſſion of the charming Welli. The two months appeared indeed as long to me as if they had been years; however a kind look of my bride made me a docile pupil. Akbar frequently ſurveyed me with ſcrutinizing looks; however my frank and open diſpoſition gained me his confidence.</p>
                     <p>I learned in a ſhort time, to waſh the Lingam, and to perform the Sandiwane, with as much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity as if I had been brought up to it. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationary time was elapſed, and—Welli became my wife.</p>
                     <p>"Akbar took me aſide the next day and ſaid, "Young man, I have entruſted you with the greateſt treaſure I poſſeſs; it is therefore juſt I ſhould put you alſo in poſſeſſion of that which is of leſs value to me. Come and follow me!"</p>
                     <p>"We proceeded ſilently towards the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreſt; the old man led the way and I followed him full of expectation. He conducted me by unbeaten paths through wild and intricate buſhes, and ſtopt at length at the mouth of a cavern, which was covered with low ſhrubs.</p>
                     <p>"We ſtept into a cavern, I perceived the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of a ſmall lamp at the bottom; my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor bade me ſtop, fetching the lamp, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral more which hung in different parts of the cavern.</p>

"Heavens! what a ſpectacle for a greedy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean. Large heaps of gold and ſilver, diamonds and pearls lay before me. I was almoſt petrified. I had imagined myſelf to be rich, becauſe I had a thouſand ponnes in my pocket, and there lay a thouſand times thouſand pieces of gold, which bore the coinage of all trading nations.</p>
                     <p>"You are aſtoniſhed," ſaid Akbar: "this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is indeed not the fruit of my diligence, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it alſo is, not the fruit of a crime. We Bramins are obliged to live entirely upon alms, with which the ſuperſtition of the people provides us, ſometimes ſparingly, and ſometimes, richly, according to the degree of their affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. We are, ſtrange to tell, prohibited to work, the people pay us for our idleneſs, and I have been told this is alſo the cuſtom of your country.</p>
                     <p>"I have been a ſervant in the pagoda, from which we are coming during forty circumvolutions of the ſun. I had a father—he went long ſince to the bliſsful habitations of Wiſhnu, who taught me early to walk the paths of wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. He inſtructed me to compute the courſe of the heavenly bodies, in the art of making alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks, and in the knowledge of medical herbs and roots.</p>
                     <p>"All this gained me a name in the adjacent country, the people flocked to my pagoda, either to peep behind the curtain of Nature, or to be cured of diſeaſes; or only to gaze at me. None came with empty hands; the rich brought me diamonds and gold, and from the poor I took only a noſegay.</p>
                     <p>"Here is all the wealth which I have treaſured up theſe forty years for my dear Welli, and now deliver to my dear ſon-in-law. You muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, promiſe me, neither to leave me, nor to

                     <p>"I complied with this requeſt.

Yes, my friends, I have learnt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the goodneſs and wiſdom of God, cheerful ſubmiſſion to his paternal decrees, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his holy laws, moderation of our paſſions, purity and good-will towards mankind, enable us to be ſatisfied with little to inſure happineſs in this world, and to meet futurity without trembling.</p>
                     <p>"I meditated frequently to ſend a part of our uſeleſs wealth to my old father, but did not know how to accompliſh my deſign. I could have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Dutch merchant of Maſulipatnam, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Akbar oppoſed his whole paternal authority to the execution of this plan, becauſe he knew better than myſelf how much this would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed me to the fanatic perſecutions of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean miſſionaries, to whom I might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>

                     <p>"I was obliged to ſubmit, and ſubmitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctance, for Welli loved her father with an unſpeakable ardour. The fatal hour in which the

ſpirit of honeſt Akbar was to return to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Being who had created it, at laſt drew near. He died without a groan, a tranquil ſmile remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his clay cold countenance.</p>
                     <p>"This was a melancholy day. Welli tore her hair, ſmote her breaſt, and rolled herſelf on the ground. All this is cuſtomary in the Indies; however, <hi>her</hi> agony was ſomething more than the mere effect of cuſtom. A crowd of women flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the pagoda, as ſoon as Akbar's death was known, and ſung mournful dirges. I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs how this affected me. The Bramins perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed various rites, and at laſt laid the corpſe upon a palankin, adorned with flowers, and preceded by two men, with a kind of wind inſtruments, which cauſed a moſt diſmal ſound, and a great number of muffled drums. I ſupported my Welli; we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the palankin with tearful eyes. When we came to the pile, which had been erected of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal wood, I was deſired to ſet fire to it, becauſe I was regarded as the head of the family; a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly duty, which I performed with a bleeding heart.</p>
                     <p>"Welli dropped fainting on the ground when the flame blazed aloft. I took her in my arms, and carried her home. We ſpent ſeveral gloomy months, ſhaved our heads, and covered our faces, according to the cuſtom of the Eaſt.</p>
                     <p>"The healing balſam of time reſtored at laſt, part of our loſt tranquillity to us; however, neither I nor Welli wiſhed to ſtay any longer at that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpot. But—oh, my friends!—I am now coming to a period of my life which has deſtroyed my peace for ever. Let me weep, and if you can, weep with me; it will afford me ſome conſolation. My Welli, my dear, good and gentle Welli, was ſtung by a rattle-ſnake, and died in my arms a few hours after.</p>

"God, thou haſt made me empty the bittereſt cup of affliction! all other ſufferings which thou perhaps haſt reſerved for me, will certainly be trifling in compariſon with that unſpeakably painful blow! our moſt ardent wiſhes were accompliſhed—Welli was pregnant—but, alas! oh weep with me, my friends, and let me not weep alone!—ſhe was ſo good, ſo gentle, and ſo loving—oh! oh! let me not weep alone!</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg ſhed a torrent of bitter tears; all wept with him; theſe were obſequies more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than any of thoſe can be that are performed in honour of the gods on earth. He recollected himſelf again at laſt, after a long and painful ſtruggle "My friends," reſumed he, "you now know my ſtory. I performed the laſt melancholy duty which I owed to my Welli, and could not have ſtaid a day longer in a place where every object which I beheld recalled to my mind my former happineſs, which, alas! will never return again. I put my treaſures on board the firſt veſſel that ſailed, and returned to my native country.</p>
                     <p>"I am now here to weep a filial tear on the aſhes of my parents, to make my brother happy, and to viſit my honeſt Chriſtian Shwarz at Wernigerode. When I have executed this, I ſhall willingly lay down my head, and depart to my eternal home, where my Welli and honeſt Akbar are waiting for me."</p>

                     <p>WHEN Ortenberg had finiſhed his affecting tale, the rays of the lights reflected thouſand-fold from the tears which gliſtened in the eyes of his auditors.

But let me tell you, my ſon, that nothing is more deceitful than the picture which our glowing juvenile fancy draws of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; nothing is eaſier overturned, than the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of our imagination, adorned with love, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wealth!

                     <p>Having ſaid this, he roſe, emptied his pipe, and begged to be ſhewn to his bed-room. The wife of his venerable hoſt had prepared her bridal bed for him. It was covered with a ſilk quilt, which was embroidered with a great variety of flowers, and provided with chintz curtains, to keep off the rays of the morning ſun. Uſeleſs preparations! Ortenberg never ſlept in a bed. "I am always terrified," ſaid he, "when I ſink all at once into a ſea of feathers, and the bed billows join over me; my boſom is ſtraitened, and I cannot ſleep." His negroes ſpread a couple of blankets upon the floor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laid a pillow upon them, and his couch was ready.</p>

He awoke in the morning with the firſt dawn of day and got up. Impatience and joyful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation would not let him ſleep, and whenever he cloſed his eyes, he dreamed of Chiſtian Shwarz, and his imagination anticipated the raptures of ſurpriſe which his ſudden appearance would cauſe his benefactor, and the pleaſure which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of his adventures would give him.</p>
                     <p>He ordered the carriage to be got ready, and took leave of his venerable hoſt. "Farewell, my worthy friend," ſaid he: "my heart urges me to be gone without further delay. I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you as ſoon as I ſhall have done chatting with my dear Chriſtian Shwarz. I then ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more maturely, what is to be done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this boy; for I cannot do it now, becauſe my imagination is too much occupied by other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which abſorb all my faculties of thinking!" He got into the carriage and arrived two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the town of Wernigerode in the Harz.</p>
                     <p>When he came to the turnpike, a drunken gate keeper aſked him who he was, and whence he came? Ortenberg informed him of both, under the condition that he alſo ſhould ſatisfy his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and tell him whether Chriſtian Shwarz lived in the town and was well?</p>
                     <p>"Chriſt—ſhan—Shwa—Shwarz?" ſtammered the gate-keeper: "he has given the ſlip to his phyſician and is well."</p>

your coffin! ſhall I not be able to thank you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we meet in a better world?</p>
                     <p>A torrent of tears guſhed down his ſun burnt cheeks; he jumped out of his carriage and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the mourners. No black crape beſpoke his grief; however, the copious ſtreams of tears which ſtarted from his eyes, the ſilent agony which his features expreſſed, diſplayed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſorrows that convulſed his bleeding heart.—All gazed at the ſtranger—"You are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the violence of my grief?" exclaimed Ortenberg in mournful accents: "alas! he gave me a thouſand ponnes when I was naked and ſtarving."</p>
                     <p>The honeſt citizens of Wernigerode who knew not what a ponnes is, thought his intellects were deranged. One of the attending clergymen went up to him aſking him; whether he had known the deceaſed?</p>
                     <p>"Yes, I knew him!" groaned Ortenberg: I knew him, indeed! he gave me a thouſand pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes when I had not a <hi>kauri</hi> in my pocket."</p>
                     <p>The clergyman who contrary to the cuſtom of his colleagues, knew ſomething more than to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the benediction and to rail againſt heretics and infidels, recollected to have read that <hi>kauris</hi> are a kind of little ſhells which ſerve inſtead of ſmall caſh on the coaſt of Coromandel and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar. "I ſuppoſe" ſaid he: "you knew our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed friend in India?"</p>

                        <p>Yes, dear Sir, I ſaw him the firſt and laſt time at Bantam. There he gave me a thouſand ponnes, when I earned my bread by painting Turkiſh and Roman emperors. He made me promiſe to viſit him on my return to Europe; and now when I am come to keep my word I find him in his coffin.</p>

"He is happy!" ſaid the clergyman: he ſees no more the tears of his wife, and hears no more the cries of his children for bread."</p>
                     <p>"How! What! exclaimed Ortenberg: "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my frankneſs; this is falſe; indeed it is. I am happy to hear that Chriſtian Shwarz has left a wife and children—but in diſtreſs!—no, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. He poſſeſſed a princely fortune, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways was an excellent economiſt."</p>

                        <p>He was, indeed; all his fellow-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens can witneſs it. He returned to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with an immenſe fortune; however, repeated misfortunes can exhauſt the greateſt wealth. He built a magnificent houſe, and it was deſtroyed by fire; he bought an eſtate, and it was totally ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hail, inundations, a conſtant failure of his crops, and epidemic diſeaſes among the cattle; he eſtabliſhed a manufactory, and government threw numberleſs impediments in his way; he engaged in trade, and his correſpondents failed.</p>
                        <p>He had juſt as much left as would have enabled him to live comfortably with his family, when he truſted too much to a falſe friend, becoming ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for him to a large amount, and was cheated. He was forced to turn all his property into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in order to eſcape a diſgraceful confinement. This laſt ſevere blow coſt him, probably, his life.</p>
                        <p>"Oh God! oh God! exclaimed Ortenberg, wringing his hands: "is this the reward of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity! who could blame the honeſt who murmurs againſt providence? Why muſt virtue be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted every where by knaves?"</p>

                        <p>What then would be the life of a man?—The deceaſed is happy for having taken this hope with him to the grave. He died with this conſoling perſuaſion, and only the diſtreſs of his wife and children imbittered his laſt moments.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <p>They had arrived at the church-yard during this converſation. Ortenberg requeſted the favour of having the coffin opened once more, as he ardently wiſhed to kiſs the cold hand of his benefactor; however, the cuſtom of the town did not permit it. The common people imagined this would diſturb the reſt of the dead, and would have ſtoned the perſon that ſhould have attempted it, the coffin was therefore committed to the ground, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg moiſtened the earth which was thrown upon it, with his tears.</p>
                     <p>After the officiating clergyman had pronounced the benediction, Ortenberg diſtributed all the money he had with him among the poor.</p>
                     <p>"I don't give it to you" ſaid he: "to pray for the peace of the deceaſed; he does not want your prayers! but weep with me! I prefer your tears to your thanks."</p>
                     <p>It was an affecting ſpectacle. Ortenberg had ſeated himſelf upon the freſh grave, and taking up a handful of earth contemplating it with ſilent grief. The honeſt Wernigeroders ſtood around him, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at him, and knowing not what to think of him.</p>
                     <p>"Enough! enough! exclaimed he at laſt; "his children are yet alive, let us be gone to the widow of honeſt Chriſtian Shwarz."</p>
                     <p>He roſe, took the clergyman by the hand, and requeſted him to go with him to the widow of the deceaſed. They found the poor woman ſwimming
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037761_0257_100F0677AAD23050"/>
in tears, and ſurrounded by three boys half naked, the eldeſt of whom was about ſeven years old.</p>
                     <p>"Excuſe me, madam!" ſaid Ortenberg when he ſtept into the apartment: I do not intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole you, no, I wiſh to mingle my tears with yours."</p>
                     <p>He was as good as his word; for he had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid this when a torrent of tears guſhed from his eyes, which he ſuffered to flow freely. The picture of the deceaſed painted by <hi>Graf,</hi> an excellent like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hung oppoſite him; his eyes caught it; "Yes, this is he!" exclaimed he ſobbing: "thus he looked when he embarked for Germany, and took leave of me! Alas! he has gone on a greater jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without taking leave of me."</p>
                     <p>The clergyman told the aſtoniſhed widow the gentleman was an old friend of her huſband and had known him in India.</p>
                     <p>"Friend! exclaimed Ortenberg: "he was more than a friend to me! he was a benefactor, a father! I am his debtor! I owe him more than I ſhall be able to repay in this world. Permit, me, Madam—boys (calling for his blacks)! bring my trunks hither!" The blacks obeyed. He unlocked it, and taking a leather purſe out, counted 1000 ducats upon the table.</p>
                     <p>"Here, madam, take it. Theſe are the thouſand ponnes which your huſband advanced me when I arrived half naked and half famiſhed at Bantam. God will pay him the intereſt! Sir (turning to the clergyman), I can ſpare no more at preſent; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I take you to witneſs that I engage to ſend to this good lady the widow of my benefactor, within four weeks, <hi>ten</hi> times as much. I am not uſed to give bonds; my word is my bond, and you can rely upon it. I ſhould, beſides, wiſh to erect a monument upon the grave of my honeſt Chriſtian Shwarz, and ſhall ſend you 500 ducats for that

purpoſe. Let it be done after your own ideas; but let the inſcription be as ſimple as poſſible. My name muſt not be mentioned; for I want to erect a monument for <hi>him</hi> and not for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>The good people thought all was a dream; the widow was going to throw herſelf with her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at Ortenberg's feet; however, he was almoſt provoked at it. "I only have done my duty, and nothing elſe," ſaid he: "I ſhould not deſerve to live if I could ſuffer the widow and children of my benefactor to languiſh in diſtreſs. No, no, while I have a morſel to eat, one half of it ſhall be yours."</p>
                     <p>The firſt violent ſenſation of grief yielded gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually to the milder feelings of melancholy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. They began to converſe more connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, diſcuſſed the future domeſtic regulations of the widow, and conſulted about the education of her children.</p>
                     <p>"Would you give one of theſe boys into my charge?" ſaid Ortenberg: "I will treat him as if he were my own ſon."</p>

                     <p>WHAT I have to tell you, kind reader in this chapter, is but very little, for our honeſt Nicolaus Ortenberg does not wiſh that his good actions ſhould be talked of too loudly. He returned to his nephew, ſettled a large ſum upon the ſons of the good clergyman, to enable them to proſecute their academic career with eaſe; he cauſed a neat houſe to be built for old Conrad, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all comforts of life, and added a ſmall capital, to enable the honeſt fellow to cloſe his life in tranquillity and eaſe.</p>

Barbara, who ſtill thought ſhe felt the ſpittle of the blacks on her wrinkled cheeks, was not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the bounty of the generous Ortenberg, and cenſured every thing he did for her and her huſband's comfort. Ortenberg propoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to old Conrad, to ſend her to the houſe of correction, and thus to put it out of her power to poiſon his domeſtic peace. However—oh, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of cuſtom!—the ſcolding Barbara had become neceſſary to old Conrad, he cared very little for her ſcolding, nay, even thought he wanted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when he heard not every day her ſhrill voice reſounding in the houſe and kitchen. "Then keep her in the name of God!" ſaid Ortenberg, the will of man is his heaven." They lived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till Barbara at laſt was involved in ſuch a violent quarrel with death, as to be choaked with paſſion.</p>
                     <p>Ortenberg advertiſed in all the continental newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers; That if Charles Ortenberg, formerly head maſter of the grammar ſchool of W**, ſhould be ſtill alive, he was requeſted to inform his brother Nicolaus and his ſon of his abode."</p>
                     <p>However, this attempt was fruitleſs, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus uſed himſelf gradually to the idea that he ſhould not ſee his brother again on this ſide of the grave.</p>
                     <p>Nicolaus now formed a plan for his future life. He diſliked the monar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Having ſettled every thing that concerned the future happineſs of his nephew, he retired to the Canton of Zurich, bought a large eſtate, ſowed, planted, occupied himſelf with the breeding of cattle, and perceived that ſatisfaction with which

They betrayed their conſciouſneſs of their noble deſcent only at times,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:037761_0263_100F0684D9C555F8"/>
and the words: <hi>His Excellency, my father, her Ladyship, my mother, our subjects,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c, were expreſſions with which they frequently interlard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their diſcourſes.</p>
                     <p>But enough of a couple of deſpicable beings whom accident has thrown into our way, and in whoſe company I always ſtay with reluctance, whether I meet them in the ſtreet or at the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deſk.</p>
                     <p>The converſation with which they condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to entertain William, treated on pretty girls, horſes, hounds, and cits whom they had taken in. Poor William felt the time very long while they were with him, gaped and frequently ſtept to the window to reſpire.</p>
                     <p>Their inane diſcourſe was ſuddenly interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an apparition. I may juſtly call it an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition; for the man who ſtept into the apartment, having knocked repeatedly at the door, looked more like a ſpectre than a human being. Imagine to yourſelf an aſh-grey countenance, hollow eyes ſhaded by thick grey eye laſhes, pale and parched lips, a grey beard and hair of the ſame colour, holding in his ſkinny hands a ſtick, which ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his bending frame, dreſſed in a black thread bare coat which could not cover his nakedneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. He ſtaggered ſlowly and with tottering knees into the apartment; the burden of heavy ſorrows ſeemed to depreſs his frame more than the load of years. His hollow eyes diſplayed however, ſtill a faint ſpark of youthful vigour, and his face beſpoke a kind of noble pride.</p>
                     <p>"Gentlemen," ſaid he, excuſe my intruding upon you. I am a very poor man who wiſhes to die in his native country, and cannot ſcrape toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as many pence as I have miles to walk."</p>
                     <p>What news from the moon, old gentleman?" began one of the counts: "you probably, are juſt
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:037761_0264_100F068748DDAF10"/>
come thence, for I never ſaw on our globe ſuch a libel upon creation."</p>
                     <p>"I was miſtaken! replied the old man, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and caſting a look to Heaven which beſpoke unſpeakable bitterneſs: "forgive me for having interrupted your youthful mirth!"</p>
                     <p>Having uttered theſe words, he turned towards the door, and was going to quit the apartment; but William called after him in a compaſſionate tone of voice.</p>
                     <p>"Venerable old man, ſtop a little you ſhall not leave me without receiving ſome aſſiſtance."</p>
                     <p>"You are right, William!" ſaid the count: "It would be pity were we to ſuffer old Saturn to paſs beyond our horizon."</p>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>William.</speaker>
                        <p>Count, be aſhamed! it is cruel to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule a poor old man, and I ſhall not ſuffer it in my apartment.</p>
                        <p>The old man had in the mean time, turned round again and caſt a grateful look at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous youth. The count returned no anſwer, and William took a crown out of his purſe.</p>
                        <p>The old man accidentally caſt his eyes on a table which ſtood only a few ſteps diſtant from him. It juſt happened to be poſt day. William had received a letter from his uncle and left the cover which was directed to him upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The old man read:</p>
                     </sp>
                     <p>A Monſieur.</p>
                     <p>Monſieur Guillaume Ortenberg. He read it and fainted away.</p>
                     <p>"There you have it?" exclaimed the count: "this is the conſequence of meddling with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars."</p>
                     <p>William deigned not to return an anſwer. He ſlew to the aſſiſtance of the old man, ſprinkled cold water in his face, chafed his temples with Hungary water, and at laſt ſaw his humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

crowned with ſucceſs. The old man opened his eyes again.</p>
                     <p>"Good young gentleman," ſaid he, after having looked round a mom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nt, and recollecting the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in which he had been: "God bleſs you for your humanity—God reward you for it—" He ſeemed to wiſh to ſay more; however, a look which he caſt at the count who had juſt another witticiſm between his teeth, rendered him mute. William preſſed the crown in his hand, ſaw him to the door, and patiently bore the railleries of the counts, who ridiculed him for the tear of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> from his eyes, and which he neither would nor could check.</p>
                     <p>William looked after the old man through the window, and ſaw that he ſlowly ſtaggered towards the town-gate, looking frequently back, ſtopping ſometimes irreſolute, and ſeemed to talk to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He diſappeared at laſt from his ſight, and he was ſoon after delivered from his troubleſome viſitors.</p>
                     <p>William was juſt going to raiſe his ſunken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits by a walk in the fields, when a little ragged boy ruſhed into his apartment, panting for breath, and gave him a note. William opened it and read:</p>

                     <p>It would be fruitleſs were I to attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate to my readers William's picture in that moment, and my imagination labours in vain to repreſent his picture to you as it ſtands before my mental eyes. Your imagination muſt come to my aſſiſtance, and picture to you the rapid changes of his countenance from glowing crimſon to death like paleneſs, the wild diſorder of his

looks, and the trembling of his hands and feet. Methinks I hear his heart palpitate, agitated by fear, joy, and uncertainty; methinks I ſee him fly down ſtairs without a hat, and ſhoot down the ſtreet like an arrow, without even knowing <hi>where</hi> to find his father?</p>
                     <p>"Where? where? ſtammered he at laſt to the boy, who followed him.</p>
                     <p>"In the ſuburbs, at the Golden Swan," replied the boy, and William ſhot along as quick as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ruſhing into the inn, overturning the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and ſtammering his: <hi>where? where?"</hi> with increaſing agony.</p>
                     <p>When the people of the inn ſaw a man ſtanding before them without a hat, trembling like an aſpen leaf, and with a wild and diſordered look, they thought he was mad. William could not ſpeak; <hi>"where? where?"</hi> was all that he was able to utter, and the innkeeper replied at every inquiry: <hi>"who?—what?"</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The boy had, fortunately, followed him as faſt as poſſible, and entered the houſe at the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when William, overpowered by the higheſt ſtretch of all his feelings, was ready to ſwoon. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Follow me!" replied the boy, running up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him three pair of ſtairs, and opening the door of a ſorry garret.</p>
                     <p>There William beheld upon a truſs of ſtraw, the ſame old man who had quitted his apartment a few hours before, and received a crown from him. His eyes were dim, and his diſſolution was near. His right hand graſped the crown, the charity which his ſon had given him. A pitcher of water ſtood by his ſide, and a prayer book lay at his feet.</p>

                        </gap>lung himſelf down by his wretched couch, graſped the neck of the dying man with his arms, as if he were determined to wreſt him out of the hands of death; he ſtill could not find words nor tears to eaſe the agony of his heart, ſhook the fainting old man, wanted to go for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and yet could not reſolve to quit his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs parent. He took his purſe out of his pocket, without knowing clearly what he was doing, flung it down at the feet of his conductor, expecting that he would comprehend his meaning inſtantly. However, the boy picked it up, caſting a ſtupid ſheepiſh look at him, and then at the purſe, and knew not what to do with it.</p>
                     <p>"Phyſician! ſurgeon!" thundered William.</p>
                     <p>The boy was terrified and flew down ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>And, behold! God ſaid unto the Angel of death: Withdraw thy hand! take the bitter cup from his lips, and mix it with tears of filial love, that the black pinions of deſpair cover not his breaking eyes, and he fall ſmiling aſleep in thy arms."—Ortenberg opened his eyes. "Is it you, my ſon? A ray of joy after twelve years ſuffering!" William now recovered the power of utterance, a gentle ſtream of tears removed the agony of his heart. He knelt at the old man's couch with affecting devotion in his looks, thanked God for the bitter ſweetneſs of that hour, and prayed for his father's life.</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo, my ſon! ſaid the dying ſufferer in broken accents: "my hour is at hand; I am hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to have found a ſon who will cloſe my eyes, and commit my bones to the grave.

                     <p>"Refreſh your old father with a drop of wine," ſaid he; "that I may inform you before I die, of the ſufferings which I have endured theſe twelve years."</p>
                     <p>William flew down ſtairs, demanding a bottle of the beſt old Hock, and knelt in a moment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the ſide of his ſick parent.

                     <p>The corpulent innkeeper, whom William's purſe had rendered uncommonly civil and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, waddled up and down ſtairs, brought bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hoſſman's drops, and feather beds, cramming the latter under the patient's head, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his feet, &amp;c. and went himſelf to town, to call in a phyſician.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as father and ſon were again by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Ortenberg collected his laſt ſtrength, and ſolved the myſtery of his ſudden diſappearance and his long abſence to the agoniſed William.</p>
                     <p>The reader will recollect that Ortenberg, in the firſt confuſion which the myſterious note of old

Conrad produced, took the fatal reſolution of going to Berlin and demanding protection and juſtice of a Monarch who has proved repeatedly that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed juſtice as well to the peaſant as to the firſt peer of his realm. However the governor of W** no ſooner was informed of Ortenberg's departure than he gueſſed the real cauſe of it, and perceived that his happineſs and honour were at ſtake.</p>
                     <p>He diſpatched immediately the obſequious and venal accomplices of his numerous rogueries, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o purſue Ortenberg in different directions, cauſing the hapleſs fugitive to be carried to one of his eſtates, the ſteward of which if poſſible, was as great a knave as his maſter, and frequently had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the frantic ſatisfaction of having tormented to death an innocent victim that had been intruſted to his care, without ever taking the trouble to inquire after the motives of his confinement.</p>
                     <p>Poor Ortenberg languiſhed in that place twelve years in a damp cellar. Bread and putrid water were his daily nouriſhment, the damp ground was his couch and the dark vault his cover.</p>
                     <p>Belzebub recalled at laſt the Devil that inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the body of the fiend-like ſteward, to advance him according to his merits.

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:037761_0270_100F0692A0AE41B8"/>
obliged to paſs through Gottingen on his way to the dear objects of his love, and there finiſhed his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
                     <p>But what enabled him to diſguiſe his paternal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eelings and to quit his ſon's apartment without making himſelf known? what elſe but his pride, that baneful paſſion that tyranniſed him from his cradle to the grave. He perceived that the young men who were with his ſon were counts; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he ſhould diſgrace his ſon, or even, perhaps, hurt him, if he were to make himſelf known, after having applied for alms. In ſhort he was ſilent and went away, but ſcarcely had arrived at his garret, when he was overpowered by the heavy load of his feelings.</p>
                     <p>Reader, I perceive an angry look in your eye, compoſed of compaſſion and indignation; aſk your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſincerely whether you never was guilty of a fault? I wanted to pourtray an honeſt man, who always acted as an human being; for my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is not fit for delineating the picture of an angel.</p>
                     <p>The moſt violent paſſions convulſed the heart of the young man while his father related the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly tale of his ſufferings. He now was torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dreadful apprehenſion, and his ſtaring eyes hung on the lips of the old man; tears of grief now rolled down his cheeks, and fury now tinged them with a crimſon hue, and a wild fire flaſhed from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Vengeance! Vengeance!" exclaimed he, when his father had finiſhed his melancholy narrative: "I vow to you, my dear injured father! by God and our bleſſed Redeemer, that I will take a bloody revenge on the villain!"</p>
                     <p>"Not ſo my ſon," ſaid the old man: "you muſt promiſe me to forgive him, as I do on the brink of eternity. He muſt, beſides now be already
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:037761_0271_100F069606560648"/>
far advanced in years, and ſoon ripe for judgment. Promiſe it me! This is the only condition on which I can give you my paternal bleſſing; and only this will enable me to die in peace." William was obliged to obey, and to vow to his dying parent that he would forgive the Governor and never take revenge. Having done this, the old man bleſſed him, raiſed his heart to the throne of God, prayed, and took a ſolemn leave of his ſon. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam ſhed torrents of tears. Ortenberg had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted his laſt ſtrength, and relapſed exhauſted upon his pillow. He ſoon began to rattle in his throat—the angel of death held the cup to his lips—Nature ſtruggled againſt the powerful arm of the laſt foe—ſpaſms announced his approaching diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution—the eyes grew dark—the cheeks turned pale—the lips grew blue—the body ſtiff—only one gaſp more—a long pauſe—and now he breathed the laſt time!</p>
                     <p>William's agony is no ſubject fit for deſcription. The phyſician came too late to ſave the father's life a few hours longer, but time enough to order the diſtracted young man to be removed from the dear corpſe. William was carried home ſick and delirious. Only the ſtrength of youth ſaved him from the gates of death, and the picture of his murdered father was for years conſtantly preſent to his mind, and caſt a gloomy melancholy over his perſon.</p>

                           <p>—I have made up my mind to quit Gottingen, and am waiting for your orders and advice, my dear uncle, to determine finally upon the place of my reſidence, and the career which I am to chooſe. I have gathered a tolerable ſtore of knowledge in various branches of ſcience, and flatter myſelf to be able to do pretty well in any ſituation; for a player, who once knows the cards, muſt be equal to enter into the nature of any game which accident throws in his way, and be able to conduct it well, though the trumps ſhould be in his antagoniſt's hands.</p>
                           <p>It is ſaid that it would be eaſy to write the whole collection of human knowledge which is ſounded on <hi>mathematical certainty,</hi> upon a blank card; and we rummage many a thick folio volume in vain to gather a few words which could be added to that collection. I never quit our public library with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a kind of anxiety; ſo many books, ſo much to read; life is ſo ſhort, the card ſo ſmall, and yet a man muſt be a Polyhiſtor to fill it only half. No, no, I will not chooſe a learned profeſſion! I will rove the boundleſs creation of God, will enjoy the variegated pleaſures of nature, not pry into its moſt occult myſteries in order to form a ſyſtem to-day, which to-morrow would be confuted by the moſt ſimple phaenomenon. However, while I am pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this idea, an internal monitor whiſpers to me: "You are a link in the great ſocial chain; it would degrade you were you to ſpend your uncles wealth in idleneſs, and occaſionally to beſtow a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

which we have for our <hi>self</hi> is a ſingular ſenſation, it is widely different from that which we have for the merits of others. The latter is but too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influenced by the prejudices which we have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed in our youth, by external and accidental attributes, wealth and pedigrees. However, that which affords me ſatisfaction in ſolitude, and frequently renders me ſuperior to ſufferings, and the erroneous opinions of the world; in ſhort, what every honeſt man ſeeks and finds more or leſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, cannot be purchaſed of the voice of the low or titled populace.</p>
                           <p>I will, therefore, devote myſelf to ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, leſt I ſhould be an idle drone in the great bee-hive of the world; I will fly out and in, gather and work: your orders will aſſign me my ſtation.</p>

                           <p>Give me leave to tell you, my dear nephew, that neither the beginning nor the concluſion of your letter has met with my approbation. To ſpeak the truth, William, you have ceaſed being the ſimple child of nature which you was when you left the houſe of your venerable Mentor. The periods and turnings of your letter are ſtiff and affected; you preſume to be in poſſeſſion of the true philoſophy of life, although you are only a book philoſopher. We muſt have ſeen the world, and experienced ſome, if we are not to be aſtoniſhed by every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common appearance, and deſire to bear the joys and ſufferings of this world with equanimity.

Speak the ſimple and

artleſs language of the heart, and fear not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me by frank bluntneſs. As for the ſtation which you are to chooſe, it is nothing to me; this is entirely your buſineſs. I don't care what you are, while you are an honeſt man, and this you can be in any ſtation. However, it would give me pleaſure if you would rove the world a few years longer, and then take a good and gentle wife like my Welli! Alas! I have not yet learnt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce or to write her name without ſhedding tears.</p>
                           <p>The workmen have finiſhed yeſterday the little temple in the garden, and the altar in the middle, upon which the urn is to ſtand that encloſes the aſhes of my Welli. I took the urn out of the cheſt in which it was locked up ever ſince I left the Eaſt Indies; for I had not the courage to tear my wounds open. As I was ſaying, I took it out, and found a pair of bracelets and ſome rings of my Welli's in the cheſt, and ſtrolled with it into the garden. My tears fell upon the urn, my hands trembled ſeveral times ſo violently, that I almoſt dropt it, and my knees knocked together. I was obliged to reſt myſelf upon a turf ſeat. The urn now ſtands upon the altar, the temple is hedged in with roſe-trees, and bears the following inſcription:
<q>TOMB OF THE GOOD WELLI, THE GENTLEST OF HER SEX.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>When my tears once ſhall be dried up, that is, when my eyes ſhall be ſhut forever, it is to remind you, my dear nephew, that I loved my dear Welli better than any thing in this world. I hope you then will viſit our aſhes every morning and evening, and think of us.</p>
                           <p>I command you, nephew, and deſire it of you as the only return for my paternal love, not to let me
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:037761_0276_100F06A12D69D2F0"/>
be buried when I am dead. This is a fooliſh cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and I will have nothing to do with it. Some millions of dead bodies are annually buried under ground, to infeſt the air with peſtilential exhalations, to aſſiſt death in his deſtructive operations, and to enrich the phyſicians. The church yards ought to be divided amongſt poor families to be turned into fertile fields, for the benefit of the living. But the corpſes—Why they ought to be burnt as they do in the Eaſt-Indies, and in other countries, which would prevent them from going through all thoſe horrid degrees of corruption, and to reduce them at once to duſt, from which they were taken.</p>
                           <p>I once was in a muſeum, where I ſaw corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imitated in wax, by a ſkilful artiſt, and I aſſure you, William, it was horrid to ſee how the eyes are covered firſt with a kind of moſs, and the ſtate of the dead body grows more frightful every day. I prefer the burning of the dead to their being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; beſides this, alſo on account of the living relations and friends. They drag you out of the town, ſcrewed up in a box, bury you ſix or ſeven feet under ground, raiſe a tomb over you, and leave you to rot. Your friends and relations forget you, have nothing that could remind them of you, and at moſt, caſt on Sunday, when they go to church, a look at your grave as they paſs, to ſee whether it be not yet overgrown with graſs? If your relations remove from the paternal ſoil, to ſome diſtant country, you remain behind, rot among ſtrangers, are forgotten, and your name occupies at moſt a ſmall ſpace in the church regiſter, or on the genealogy, and you are entirely expung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hearts of thoſe that were dear to you.</p>
                           <p>It is quite otherwiſe if the flame ſaves your body from corruption. The ſmall heap of aſhes which remain, are carefully gathered by the hands of your widow, your children, or your friend; their eyes

moiſten the dear relics with affectionate tears, they are incloſed in an urn, and if your friends ſhould not be able or inclined to preſerve that urn in a temple, like that which I erected to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my dear Welli, they may place it upon a table under the looking glaſs, inſtead of your French clocks, conduct their children to it, take off the cover, and ſhew them the ſmall remains of an human being, and I am ſure, this will make a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon their hearts than their ſtanding with horror before a grave, from which corruption grins, and peſtilential vapours infeſt their ſmelling organs.</p>
                           <p>Do you imagine my ſon, that the Romans and Greeks, whoſe hiſtory I read with admiration in my ſolitude, would have performed ſuch heroic deeds, and devoted themſelves ſo cheerfully to death, if they had been obliged to ſuffer their bodies to be committed to the nauſeous and horrid operations of corruptions? You may ſmile! I am no pſychiologiſt; however, this ſuppoſition has a great deal of probability in my opinion. And it is, beſides ſuch a ſublime ſight to ſee the flame blaze aloft, and the ſmoke tower to the ſkies—one ſhould think the ſpirit were riſing like a phoenix from his aſhes.</p>
                           <p>In ſhort, my ſon, I deſire to be burnt after my death! I have already beſpoke an urn which is to contain the remains of my old bones, and requeſt you to place it near that of my dear Welli. You then may ſometimes take a walk to the temple with your wife and children, in the duſk of eve, relate my hiſtory to them, and think of me.</p>
                           <p>In caſe death ſhould ſurpriſe me unexpectedly, and before I have declared my laſt will as to this point, you are to conſider this letter as my teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and produce it before the magiſtrates, to prevent all diſputes with theſe gentlemen. I

                                 <p>It is entirely indifferent to me whether the reader thinks that the opinion of honeſt Nicolaus be an offspring of innocent enthuſiaſm, or regard it as a propoſal found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon real Pſychology. However, I cannot help relating on this occaſion an inſtance of which I was an eye-witneſs and which I ſhall never be able to forget. I travelled a few ſince through ſeveral parts of Germany, and met at R** with an actor, a very worthy man, with whom I formerly had been connected at Peterſburgh. He had loſt his wife, during the time I had not ſeen him, and his family now conſiſted of a daughter a lively and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young lady, endowed with a rich vein of wit and humour, in whoſe company I had ſpent many happy hours during my reſidence at Peterſburg. She was as lively as ever, abandoned herſelf to her humourous gaiety, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and gave a free vent to her jovial mirth.

I aſked with ſurpriſe: "how the duce happens that ſkull to parade here?" She ſhed ſuddenly a torrent of tears, and replied ſobbing: It is the ſkull of my ſainted mother! My father inſiſts on my having it conſtantly before my eyes, leſt I ſhould forget her maternal admonitions."—I cannot but confeſs that I was ſo much ſurpriſed at that ſingular idea, as to fix my eyes ſometime mute and immoveable on the ſkull. I had known her mother, her form was before my eyes, and now nothing was left but thoſe old bones. Indeed, I was more powerfully affected than I ſhould have been upon her grave. And what do you think, kind reader? Suppoſe the young lady had really been as giddy as ſhe was virtuous. Suppoſe her profeſſion had expoſed her daily to the ſnares of ſeduction, and ſhe had already been reduced to the brink of ruin: would not a ſingle look at that ſkull have been ſufficient to recal her to the path of virtue?—Do not object that time weakens impreſſions of that nature, and at laſt expunges them entirely.—The mother was already two years dead, and the tears of the daughter dropped warm upon my hand. Indeed, if her corpſe had been rotting at the church-yard, ſhe would not have remembered her with ſo much intereſt and emotion!</p>

                           <p>I am now at Hanover, deareſt uncle, and wiſh to ſtay a few weeks longer here. You will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſo kind as to ſend your letters and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I am to have to this place; I lodge at the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Tavern. Baron W**, an academic friend of mine, was the original cauſe of my ſtopping here. I am very well pleaſed with Hanover, the town has ſeveral pretty ſtreets, and fine buildings; the circumjacent country is beautiful, and I have been introduced to ſome very enlightened and worthy men. Their number is, indeed but ſmall; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>one</hi> roſe is worth more than an hundred odorleſs tulips, notwithſtanding their gaudy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                           <p>I have ſpent an evening with the excellent Mr. Zimmerman, whoſe book on Solitude, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me lately, contributes ſo much to ſweeten your ſolitary retirement. He appears in the firſt quarter of an hour to be cold and repelling, the cauſe of which is, probably, to be imputed to the impertinent intruſions of thoſe mechanical tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:037761_0280_100F06A972A0E060"/>
who come only to ſtare at him, and to be able to ſay; I have ſeen the famous Zimmerman. But when he perceives that he has a man before him whoſe heart is ſuſceptible of congenial warmth and unreſerved communication, the chilling clouds which hang on his brow diſappear gradually, and his looks beſpeak ſo much mildneſs and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as to captivate the heart irreſiſtibly, which has been my caſe. I ſhould be proud, if I could flatter myſelf that the love and regard which I have conceived for that excellent man, and not intirely indifferent to him.</p>
                           <p>My friend has alſo introduced me to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of ſeveral noblemen; however, I do not like the tone which prevails there. I never met with more ſtiffneſs, abſurd formality, and fooliſh pride than I ſaw in theſe circles; the ladies diſtinguiſh themſelves particularly in this reſpect. They make a diſtinction here between higher and inferior no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the former think it would be a diſgrace to them, were they to ſpend only a few hours with the latter under one roof, or even in the open air. As I am but a vile plebian, and my anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were only permitted to look at theirs while they tilted and broke each other's bones, you may eaſily imagine that they ſcarcely deign to look at me. My friend W** is frequently very much diſtreſſed at the ſilly haughtineſs with which they treat me—and I?—I will laugh a few weeks more at their folly and then proceed on my travels.</p>

                           <p>You are a fool my dear Nephew; upon my ſoul you, are for laviſhing your time in the company of thoſe noble coxcombs, and confirming them in their preſumption that they do you a great deal of honour by toſſing up their noſes at you.

intrinſic worth of which you can be proud, ſince you degrade yourſelf to be ſhone upon by the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed rays of a lamp. I have a very indifferent opinion of a man who is (or at leaſt) ought to be ſenſible of his dignity, has a comfortable income, and needs but to <hi>seek</hi> friendſhip, and rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among his equals, if he wiſhes to find them, and nevertheleſs intrudes himſelf ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon a circle where he is tolerated only on account of his mammon.</p>
                           <p>I do, however, by no means intend to infer by this remark that a nobleman, a baron, or a count, cannot be a warm friend of a plebian; God forbid I ſhould be ſo unjuſt. There are, indeed, many worthy, noblemen who know very well that nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is an inheritance which impoſes more duties upon them than we humble plebians have to fulfil in our ſphere. However, I would adviſe you, my ſon, not to enter into the bonds of friendſhip with a nobleman, unleſs you have tried him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently whether he be deſerving of poſſeſſing your heart. Watch him with peculiar attention when you meet him in company of other noblemen. If he ſhould heſitate on theſe occaſions to ſhake you cordially by the hand, to withdraw with you to a confidential corner in preſence of his equals, and to enter with you into a familiar converſation, you ought to ſhun him, becauſe he is aſhamed of his friend! upon my ſoul he is! It grieves me to tell you that I have made this experience ſince my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Germany, and that it has coſt me ſome very unpleaſant hours.</p>
                           <p>I am not at all aſtoniſhed to learn that you have found the women more fooliſh and ſilly than the men; this is the caſe every where. The leſs a perſon has deſerved a ſuperior dignity, the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he will be of it.

                           </p>
                           <p>Baron Wall received me with a cheerful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging countenance, yet without denying the man of rank. He is far advanced in years; his face is the picture of old German honeſty, his grey hair grew white in the ſervice of the ſtate, and no one can help loving the man at firſt ſight. The caſe ſtands differently with regard to the Baroneſs, whoſe eyes and noſe beſpeak the Hanoverian family-pride; ſhe can laugh in a moſt chilling and arrogant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is proud of the ſtation of her huſband, and looks with pity down upon the inferior claſſes of beings, like an angel, if I may uſe this ſimile, upon an ant-hill. She returned my ſubmiſſive bow with half a nod of her head, and did me the honour not to ſpeak a word to me. The whole company took notice of me, whiſpers went from ear to ear, and when they had aſcertained that I was not of noble extraction, the games were continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I walked up and down the apartment, looked at the prints, teazed the parrot, counted the glaſs-panes, and did not know what to do with my humble ſelf.</p>

card tables. Although I am no <hi>misogyn,</hi> yet I always was to that moment <hi>timid</hi> in female circles, and as my gallantry is but ſo ſo, I found it really difficult to introduce myſelf to them in a proper manner. An honeſt man is never more in danger of acting like a blockhead than when he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with young ladies of rank to whom he is an utter ſtranger. The dear creatures do not aſk whether the man who is preſented to them be learned, a pattern of probity and a deſerving member of the ſtate, whoſe exterior—though it ſhould be rather ridiculous—ought not to come into conſideration; no, they review him at the firſt bow from top to toe, let all his motions, all the different pieces of his dreſs run the gauntlet through hundreds of curious looks, comment on every word he utters, laugh if his waiſtcoat be too long or his bag too large, and frequently mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him after all, and bluſh at their folly.</p>
                           <p>I do not recollect how I extricated myſelf from that dilemma. The young ladies ſeemed to be rather frolickſome, but for the reſt, were good and harmleſs creatures, whoſe acquaintance I made in a trice. They aſked me how I liked Hanover? whether I intended to make a long ſtay, &amp;c. &amp;c. The converſation was ſoon at an end, the replies and queſtions grew drier and drier, and I ſecretly rejoiced at the fortunate idea of Lady Amelia (the Baron's daughter whom I had firſt ſeen at the tea-table,) who laid her work down and went to a piano forte, which ſtood at the other end of the apartment. "I don't care (thought I) how indifferently ſhe plays; it will at leaſt ſave me the trouble of talking nonſenſe; I need but pretend to be all ear, and may give vent to my thought as I pleaſe." I placed a couple of chairs by the inſtrument, for her and myſelf, and we ſat down.</p>

Amalia laid a ſonata of Hoſminſter upon the deſk, and pulled off her gloves. Gracious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven! what a hand did I perceive! So white, ſo round, ſo little and ſo full—whoever is led through life by ſuch a hand muſt walk on roſes. But all this was nothing to what followed. She began to play, and her notes ſtole upon my heart. The tip of every finger ſeemed to have a ſoul; every movement of the ſweet enchantreſs ſpoke forcibly to the heart. I thought it dangerous to liſten any longer to her enchanting ſtrains, and was going to withdraw my eyes from the beautiful hand, when they unfortunately were caught by her boſom, which rendered my ſituation ſtill more dangerous. I tell you, dear uncle, there is not ſuch another boſom in the world. If the fire of your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be extinguiſhed, you need but recal to your memory that happy moment when you met your ſainted Welli the firſt time, and was hailed by the ſight of her ſwelling boſom. What you felt then was but trifling, it was Greenland cold, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the fire which ran through my veins while I ſat by Amalia's ſide. How the tranſparent gauze heaved and was ſwelled! Cato would have ſmiled, and Plato, forgetting his dreams, blinked at her neckerchief with half-cloſed eyes. I grew dizzy, forgot myſelf, dropped my head, and my lips imprinted a warm kiſs upon her hand. Amalia bluſhed; my perplexity was greater than I can expreſs. She continued to play, was out of time, touched the wrong keys; I knew not where I was. In ſhort, our hearts had underſtood each other; however, I ſhall tell you in my next letter, <hi>how</hi> I betrayed her eyes, and at laſt her lips, into the ſweet confeſſion that I am not indifferent to her, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>Heaven protect us! my poor nephew has loſt his underſtanding! upon my ſoul he has! When you write again to your old uncle, you will do well not to introduce <hi>Plato, the soul in the tip of the fingers,</hi> and ſimilar nonſenſe. What is your whole love affair to me? I will adviſe you not to teaſe me again in a further letter with your amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous declamations, and deſire you not to draw any further compariſons between your dulcinea and my Welli. Marry the girl, in the name of God, but don't peſter me with your deſcription of her hand and boſom; all this is nonſenſe. The hand will not always be round and full, nor will the boſom always heave; you may be ſure of it. An union for life requires more important conſiderations. Many a huſband would rather lay upon a ſtone, than on the ſwelling boſom of a ſcold.</p>
                           <p>However, all this is nothing to me. I do not care whether you marry a ſwelling boſom and a white hand, or any thing elſe; that is your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the happier you are, the more pleaſure it will give me. But it is a bare-faced fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>However, I ſhall be glad if you can contrive to make that enthuſiaſtic fit laſt all your life. But I am not pleaſed at all to learn that you are in love with the daughter of a man of rank; ſhe will be infected with ſo many ſtrange manners, whims, and formalities as to be very little pleaſed with the Indian ſimplicity of your poor old uncle. I tell you, nephew, you will not be able to prevail upon

me to come to your wedding; for the tone of your ſocieties, as you deſcribe it, is much too ſtiff for me.</p>
                           <p>But how come I to talk already of the wedding? as you do not yet know whether the girl will take you, or, which is the ſame, whether her parents will receive you as their ſon-in-law?

If, however, money ſhould be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething to pilot it ſafely into the harbour, you may tell them that you have five thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a year, and will have as much again after the death of your old uncle, Nicolaus.</p>

                           <p>Kindeſt beſt of uncles, your paternal love has drawn tears of gratitude from my eyes. I will not ſpeak much about it; but if God conduct me once happily to your arms, I will prove to you that the ſeeds of your generoſity were not ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a ſterile foil.</p>
                           <p>Being ſure of your approbation, I have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to make application to the parents of my Amelia; they were ſtartled and perplexed, and gave me an ambiguous anſwer. I requeſted my friend W** to reconnoitre the ground for me; a whole week was ſpent in conſultations with the whole family. My plebian origin was put in one ſcale, and my five thouſand a year was put in the other; the tongue was in the middle. Amelia loves me ſincerely; I am proud of this ſweet conviction; however her heart was not aſked.</p>

They ſent me at laſt word by a near relation, that I ſhould have the girl if I would purchaſe a patent for nobility. It is a mere whim my dear uncle, but what can I do? Amalia is innocent of it, and my happineſs is at ſtake. I have already ſpoken to a genealogiſt, and ſhewn him our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeal, which as you know has a man with a whip upon the helmet. He aſſures me that our family muſt be extremely old, and proves by our arms that it formerly was noble. He ſays the Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had once made a long inroad into Aſia; their ſlaves ſeized upon their houſes and wives during their abſence, and took to arms, when their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters returned. After they had ſought a long time with alternate ſucceſs, an old Scythian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at laſt to his brethren in arms, to uſe only the whip againſt the refractory ſlaves, inſtead of warlike weapons. His idea was generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and carried into execution; every warrior ſeized a whip, the ſight of which recalled all the ſervile puſillanimity of the ſlaves, and behold they threw down their arms, and took to flight. The Novogarodians, whoſe town lies in Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, ſtruck a medallion in memory of that event, upon which a horſeman brandiſhes a long whip; and the old Scythian who firſt ſtarted that idea, was permitted to bear the man with the whip in his arms.</p>
                           <p>You ſee, dear uncle, that our family is pretty ancient. I expect your anſwer with impatience, and hope you will have the kindneſs to ſend me a bill of exchange; for you know that now a-days a perſon muſt have money if he wants to be made a <hi>noble man.</hi>

                           <head>X. Nicolaus to William.</head>
                           <p>No, no, William, it cannot be! Your genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt is a fool as well as yourſelf. How can you talk of Scythians and Sarmatians? We are honeſt Germans and nothing elſe. I will give you an explanation in my manner of the fellow with the whip. I ſhould think that our anceſtor was an honeſt carter who led his waggon and his four greys or blacks from one town to the other, and walked humbly by the ſide of his cattle. He, probably, ſaved as much by his induſtry, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him to make himſelf comfortable in his old age, and to leave a good fortune to his children. His children being deſirous to preſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their induſtrious father in the family, put a carter with a whip at the top of the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, where it has remained to the preſent day. This ſounds more natural and probable than the ſtory of your genealogiſt, and you need not be aſhamed of having had a carter for an anceſtor, for his profeſſion was ten times more honourable than that of an highwayman, which was that of all the cavaliers of thoſe times.</p>
                           <p>There has been one before you of our family, who was as great a fool as yourſelf. He did not like the carters whip, and pretended that it ought to be a monk with a ſcourge, aſſerting boldly that the engraver had lengthened it out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance into a whip. I never ſhall forget the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which my father gave him. "Couſin," ſaid he, "would you rather have a lazy big bellied monk for an anceſtor, than an induſtrious uſeful carter? The ſcourge has never been able to drive any evil out of the world, but we owe, perhaps,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:037761_0291_100F06C0517C1300"/>
to the whip, our preſent proſperity." Hark ye, nephew, theſe were the ſentiments of your grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, I would therefore adviſe you not to ſpeak diſreſpectfully of the whip.</p>
                           <p>As for your <hi>purchasing</hi> a title at Vienna, I will not hear another word of it. A title bought for money is ſtill leſs worth, than one that has been inherited, and ſince I have read in <hi>Schloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer's</hi> Journal how much is to be paid for a patent of a count, baron, and nobleman, I cannot help thinking with contempt of theſe deſpicable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices.</p>
                           <p>The beſtowing of titles was originally a moſt excellent inſtitution; they were obtained only by merit and courage, and the dignity of knight did not even deſcend to the children. The ſame practice is ſtill kept up in China and other rational countries, where the father is a miniſter of ſtate while the ſon is a common ſailor, if he be not deſerving of a better ſtation. Such a title is worth while accepting, and we bow willingly to ſuch a noble man. However, the beardleſs boys who rove our country, and cauſe themſelves to be ſtiled my Lord, are in my eyes leſs reſpectable than a laborious <hi>Paria</hi>
                              <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Parias</hi> compoſe the loweſt and moſt deſpiſed caſt or tribe in India. Thoſe that come near them are conſidered as being impure.

Our ſovereigns ought to be aſhamed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing for the ſake of dirty lucre, their patent's nobility, to fellows who have no other merit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which they derive from their pelf, and thereby deſtroy the ſpur of honour which is the main ſpring of monarchies.</p>

This is my creed with regard to this point, and you may eaſily conclude that you neither will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my conſent nor money to purchaſe a title. Deſerve a title by your ſuperior merit, and I ſhall honour you for it, and be proud to call you Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Ortenberg.</p>

his uncle's conſent, procured him free acceſs to the Baron's houſe; he was permitted to take a ſeat by Amalia's ſide at table, to attend her on her excurſions, yea, even to ſee her ſometimes in her own apartment. The ſweet girl, accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf to regard him as her intended huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, gave free vent to all her feelings, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually buried the arrow of love ſo deep in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, as neither to be able nor inclined to pull it out again.</p>
                     <p>The old honeſt Baron who in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had approved of young Ortenberg's court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but was entirely under petticoat government, was rejoiced, on account of the ſmallneſs of his fortune, to have an opportunity of marrying Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, his darling daughter, to a man like Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg; he cared nothing about his plebeian ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and the fooliſh demand that he ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a title at Vienna, originated entirely in the head of his dear helpmate. The Baroneſs was, indeed, glad to have an opportunity of getting rid of a girl whoſe blooming beauty eclipſed her ſading charms.</p>
                     <p>She reſolved, at the ſame time, to condeſcend to accept of her intended ſon-in-law, a preſent of a pair of brilliant ear-rings, or any precious trifle of that ſort, and to do him the honour of giving ſplendid balls and ſumptuous ſuppers at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which the declining ſtate of her purſe, and the univerſal intruſion of her plebeian creditors, had prevented her to do for years. How grateful ſoever theſe proſpects were to her favourite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities; yet I would not have the reader to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they were ſufficient to procure her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to receive William without a title into her family. Her mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>o was: <hi>Pain bis et honneur!</hi> and if William, like the kings of Perſia, could have aſſigned the revenues of a whole province
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:037761_0295_100F06C91655AE90"/>
for every piece of her dreſs, all his provinces would have been ranked among that claſs of things which, indeed, can be borrowed without being paid for, but cannot be compared with a rotten piece of parchment.</p>
                     <p>Poor William! the poſt is arrived, the poſtman is already in the ſtreet in which you live, you ſtand at the window with a beating heart, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters your houſe, the ſervant brings you a letter, which, indeed, is ſealed with the family ſeal, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Scythian brandiſhes his whip, but is ſo light and thin, that it is impoſſible it could contain a few hundreds of yellow comforters. But who knows? the uſeful invention of bills of exchange, which alone ought to be ſufficient to endear the Jews to us, affords ſome reaſon to hope that it may be animated with a ſlip of paper which begins with the words: Pleaſe to pay three weeks after date, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He opened the letter, read it impatiently, threw it indignantly upon the table, took it up again, peruſed it once more, and folded it and at laſt put it into his pocket with a deep ſigh. "What ſhall I do? what will the Baroneſs ſay? what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malia? what her father?" Theſe queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in his head like the vortices of Carteſius, till he reſolved at laſt to write once more to his uncle, to attack his heart with the eloquence of love, to paint his diſconſolation, his deſpair and to leave his miſtreſs and her parents in the error that he had not yet received an anſwer from his uncle, till he ſhould have aſcertained what effect his epiſtle would have on his flinty heart.</p>
                     <p>He ſat down and drew up a letter, but I muſt decline repeating to my readers all the arguments and ideas which he introduced; for his diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late epiſtle ſwelled to the ſize of a book, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe in which he laboured to prove, that it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely

neceſſary we ſhould accommodate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the follies and humours of the world, ſupporting his arguments by the opinions of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern philoſophers, and non-philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and elucidating them by a powerful hoſt of examples. "Would you not, my deareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle," wrote he amongſt others: "have thought the old Bramin Akbar to be the moſt cruel and unjuſt of men, if he had refuſed to unite his Welli to you, becauſe you was no Tamulian, and did not belong to his caſt?"</p>
                     <p>"Very true!" replied Nicolaus: "and I give you leave to form any opinion of Baron Wall, who will not let you have his daughter, becauſe you are no Baron."</p>
                     <p>"Did you not yourſelf," continued William: "ſubmit to the rites which he preſcribed to you? Did you not perform the <hi>Sandi wane,</hi> did you not adorn the <hi>Lingam</hi> with flowers, not becauſe you thought this was a more powerful ceremony, than the ſprinkling with holy water, but becauſe the poſſeſſion of Welli depended upon the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that ceremony? Believe me, deareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, we ſhould be compelled to fly to dreary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts, to turn <hi>Anchorites,</hi> and to renounce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with men for ever, if we were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe every little ſacrifice to the rooted prejudices of our times. You are more to me than a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you gave me more than life, for I owe to your generous care every accompliſhment of my mind which renders me worthy of poſſeſſing my Amalia. You deſtroy your own work, and rob me in one moment of every thing you gave me, by depriving me of that ſweet hope. Amalia alone is able to ſpur me to arrive at greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and I ſhall turn a villain, if I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:037761_0297_100F06CC91500990"/>
"You may turn any thing," replied Nicolaus, "except a nobleman <hi>for money.</hi> Did I not tell you that you ſhould endeavour to deſerve a title by your merits? Have you no courage to earn an order by devoting your abilities to the ſtate? Fie, ſhame! Love ought to raiſe your ſentiments, and you whine like an effeminate Corydon."</p>
                     <p>"Well, I then will turn ſoldier!" exclaimed William in a paſſion: "the military line is the only one in which I may hope to purchaſe that miſerable diſtinction at the expence of my blood. I will fly to encounter dangers! I will <hi>voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fly</hi> into the midſt of ſcenes of carnage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to which the grey veteran <hi>creeps</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and reluctant, will attract the general's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and either wreſt an order from the icy hand of death, or fall on the field of battle."</p>
                     <p>Thus ſpoke William, glowing with youthful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and animated by the fire of the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love, with enthuſiaſtic fervour. His amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous frenzy made it appear as eaſy to him to mount the ſummit of the Cordilleras, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Amalia ſoon read me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy in his eyes, and drew the dreadful ſecret from his heart.</p>
                     <p>After an awful pauſe, during which a pearly tear ſtole from her blue eye, ſhe offered him her hand with a mournful ſmile:</p>
                     <p>"Dear William! ſaid ſhe: I am ſcarcely ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, and you are only in your twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fifth. I will remain conſtant to you."</p>
                     <p>That William ſwam in an ocean of bliſs, that he claſped Amalia in his arms, and ſealed the vow

                     <p>A diſpute had ariſen at that very time between two of the moſt powerful monarchs of Europe, which, however, laſted only a ſhort time, becauſe the old lion, as Raynal ſays, ſtept once more forth from his den, and ſhook his mane with noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. William applied for a commiſſion in the army of the king of Pruſſia. Fortune was propitious to him. Count *** was juſt raiſing a corps of light cavalry, and as young Ortenberg diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his noble and poliſhed fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and wanted not for money, he obtained a commiſſion as firſt lieutenant. His captain was ſhot ſoon after in a ſkirmiſh, and our hero who had received three wounds on the ſame occaſion, ſucceeded him in his command.</p>

One day—he juſt had received a letter from Amalia, new ſire rolled through his veins, he felt himſelf bold enough to ruſh into the midſt of the moſt hazardous dangers—on that day he rode with about twenty of his men round the enemy's camp, teazing the out-poſts, when he ſuddenly heard a firing of piſtols at ſome diſtance. He rode towards the place of action, and ſaw a ſmall party of Pruſſians fighting againſt a ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Auſtrian huſſars. An old Pruſſian General had ventured too far on a reconnoitring party, his retreat was cut off, and he was ſo dangerouſly wounded as ſcarcely to be able to keep himſelf in the ſaddle. William ruſhed furiouſly upon the enemy, paved himſelf a way to the General, who was preſſed on all ſides, and came to his aſſiſtance, at the very moment when an Auſtrian huſſar was on the point of ſhooting him through the head. William's ſabre ſevered his arm, the piſtol went off, but the ball hit only the General's horſe, who dropped down and rolled himſelf bleeding upon his rider. William was alſo in danger of loſing his life, a ball whizzed by his head, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a cut of a ſabre in his arm.</p>
                     <p>The enemy was at length diſperſed, the old Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was diſengaged from under the dead horſe, and carried fainting to his tent. He was carried to bed, a ſurgeon dreſſed his wounds, and he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes; "Where is the officer who ſaved my life?"</p>
                     <p>William ſtood at the foot of the bed; the blood ſtreamed from his wound.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, you are my preſerver," ſaid the General, with a faint voice, extending his hand towards William: "I owe you a great deal; will you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me with your name."</p>

He added, he could not reflect without trembling on the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which this might have produced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the king to reward the brave Captain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſerts."</p>
                     <p>He ſigned the report with a trembling hand, and diſpatched it by a courier. William quitted the tent, and the General was left in private with his chaplain.</p>
                     <p>It is no difficult taſk to convert, at the brink of the grave, a libertine, who never took the trouble to ſin after principles, and was a free-thinker, for no other reaſon than that of having an opportunity to ſtun his conſcience. The <hi>Rev. Mr. Simson,</hi> a ſtout ſquare-bodied man, who had courage enough to exchange the bible for a ſword, in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and to march at the head of an army, now raiſed his thundering voice, ſhaking the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the wounded ſinner, which juſt ſeemed to awake from a long lethargy, painted the eternity of damnation in horrid colours, and aſſured the officers on coming out of the tent, after having exerted his pulmonary powers two hours, that he had ſaved a ſoul from the clutches of the devil.</p>

                     <p>It is but natural that he now was aſhamed of having betrayed ſo much weakneſs, as he called it,

and ſhunned William's company as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He ſcarcely ſpoke to him when he could not avoid him, ſpoke doubtfully of his courage, to palliate his ingratitude to his preſerver, and at laſt, when William's preſence became more and more intolerable to him, conceived the diabolical deſign of making away with him in an unſuſpected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He contrived for this purpoſe to cauſe Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam to be commanded to all poſts of danger. The artleſs young man, who thirſted after honour, and ſuſpected no treachery, went cheerfully wherever he was ordered, and always returned to the camp with additional laurels.</p>
                     <p>The fame of his courage and zeal for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, had already reached the ears of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief. He enjoyed the reſpect and love of his brother officers, and was eſteemed by his ſuperiors. Fortune ſmiled on him.</p>
                     <p>He was ordered one day to eſcort a waggon with money, and left the camp at the firſt dawn of day. He had not been many hours abſent when a courier arrived from Berlin, and among other diſpatches alſo brought intelligence that the king had been pleaſed to grant the brevet of a major to Captain Ortenberg, and to honour him with the order of <hi>Pour le Merite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ortenberg's promotion was made known in the army. No countenance beſpoke envy, ſincere joy ſparkled in every eye; every one wiſhed to be the firſt harbinger of that fortunate event; the return of William's regiment was impatiently waited for; ſome of his more intimate friends rode out of the camp, to meet him.</p>
                     <p>The regiment returned at laſt in the evening. It had been obliged to ſkirmiſh a great deal; the greater part of it had been cut to pieces, many officers wounded, and ſome killed—Captain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg was among the latter. A piſtol ſhot had
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:037761_0308_100F06E457C1FC48"/>
wounded him in the neck; he ſtill kept his ſeat, though with difficulty, when another perforated his breaſt, and he dropt from his horſe. His lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant attempted to carry him away; but he was already dying. Collecting his laſt remaining ſtrength, he pulled his watch out of his pocket, gave it to the lieutenant, and conjured him by their mutual friendſhip, to deliver it himſelf to Amalia, and to requeſt her to keep it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a man who had died for her. The lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant gave him his word of honour, and he breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his laſt.</p>
                     <p>Many a rough warrior, many a veteran grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier wept a tear after him. His corpſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the camp and buried with all military honours.</p>

                     <p>"HE was an excellent fellow! upon my ſoul he was!" groaned Nicolaus when he heard that his nephew was dead. "Alas! I now ſit here lik Robinſon Cruſoe on his ſolitary iſland, have

every thing in abundance and am nevertheleſs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of all comforts. The architect has built a beautiful houſe for me; but, alas! it is ſo large, ſo empty; when I blow my noſe in my bed room the ſervants hear it in the kitchen, and my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as ſilent as the grave when my Canary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds and parrots don't chuſe to chatter; one could hear the death-watch click. I have a fine garden laid out after <hi>Hirshfeld'</hi>s theory; however there is no other beaten path in it but that which leads to Welli's mauſoleum, and I have no perſon that calls me from that favourite ſpot. I have a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proſpect into the mountains, but there is not a ſoul to whom I could ſay: look, what a charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing view is this! Of what uſe is my hoard of gold to me? not even a beggar knocks at my door with whom I could ſhare it.—I have lived long enough! a perſon may, ſometimes live too long.—Why did I not reverſe the mad law of the Indians? Why did I not ſhare the blazing pile with the corpſe of my dear wife? Who will now execute my laſt will? Who will commit my body to the flames?—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and heartleſs hirelings will ſurround me when my breath is gone, incaſe my body in a dark box, and commit it to corruption.—Fy! I have, indeed, lived too long!"</p>
                     <p>"Thus moaned old honeſt Nicolaus in his ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and he grew week after week more tired of the world. He roſe from his couch, becauſe the morning dawned, and had not ſlept; he ate, becauſe it was dinner time, and was not hungry; he went to bed, becauſe it was night, and was not ſleepy.</p>
                     <p>He was ſoon tired of leading ſuch a vegetative life. He wiſhed impatiently for the ſociety of ſome ſympathizing being on whoſe hand he could walk to the peaceful grave. He conſidered ſome time, and at laſt ſat down to his deſk and wrote to Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to Baron Wall.</p>

                           <p>The charms of your daughter have coſt my poor nephew his life; I demand an indemnification for that loſs, I conſider your Amalia as the widow of my ſon, and wiſh to be permitted to call her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

I want nothing in return but her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. She ſhall cloſe my eyes and cauſe my body to be burnt. I have only a few years more to live and then ſhe will be my ſole heireſs. I ſhall, indeed not purchaſe a title; however, my calling her doughter will not deprive her of her nobility, and ſhe may beſtow her hand upon a count when I am dead.</p>
                           <p>We two old fellows ſhall, probably not meet in <hi>this</hi> life: however, I will give you a faithful account of her in the <hi>next</hi> world; upon my ſoul I will.</p>

She now looked with ardent deſire towards every poſt-day, came always down ſtairs when the letter-carrier knocked at the door, to receive the newſpaper, running with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſteps up ſtairs to examine the wiſhed-for

ſheets, looked for the name of her beloved William, and found it at laſt—on the liſt of the killed.—</p>
                     <p>Poor, unfortunate girl! Alas, how mournfully did now her juvenile days creep along! She was deprived even of the laſt conſolation of a ſuffering mind; ſhe durſt not give vent to her tears. She was not permitted to indulge her grief, was always ſcolded when ſhe caſt her mournful eyes muſing to the ground, was frequently obliged to hear the moſt cruel inſinuations, and ſuffer herſelf to be chided for diſgracing her noble birth by mean ſentiments, and what was worſe than this, was tormented day after day by the loathſome addreſſes of the little big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied count.</p>
                     <p>Thus deſponding was her ſituation, when the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of honeſt Nicolaus arrived. The father was unwilling to part with his daughter; however, the mother who hoped in vain to overcome Amalia's averſion from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> little count, availed herſelf joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of this opportunity of getting rid of her. She called, indeed the artleſs Nicolaus a <hi>rude Bear,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had mentioned her ſo bluntly by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar appellation of <hi>your Spouse,</hi> as he at leaſt ought to have called her <hi>her Ladyship;</hi> however, the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liants appeaſed her ire a little; ſhe dreſſed herſelf with the precious gift, ſtept to the looking glaſs, and the tongue of the balance ſoon inclined to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg's ſide. She condeſcended to agree to his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>My readers will eaſily conceive that Amalia was extremely glad to leave a houſe where the love of her father ſtruggled in vain againſt his weakneſs, and the pride of her mother poiſoned all her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent enjoyments, even the bitter pleaſure of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                     <p>The treaty was ſoon concluded. Amalia enfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the knees of her father, his tears trickled down upon her hand, his bleſſing conſecrated the hour
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:037761_0313_100F06EDB3AA22A0"/>
of parting. The mother kiſſed her upon her cheek, and declared that ſhe would give her her curſe if ever ſhe ſhould dare to disgrace the noble family of the Wumpſenpumpſes by throwing her heart away upon a plebeian. Amalia flung herſelf into the carriage, attended by an old meager french duenna and proceeded towards ſwitzerland.</p>
                     <p>The old man received her with open arms, and ſent the French antiquity immediately back to Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. He felt in a few hours benevolence for Amalia; loved her after a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ew days, and not many weeks were paſſed when he doated on her. She accommodated herſelf to all the whims and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of his old age, wept with him at Welli's urn, was ſilent when he was diſinclined to chat, read to him when he was cheerfully diſpoſed, ſat down to the harpſicord and lulled him aſleep by her ſoothing play. She ſurpriſed him frequently by a rural feaſt, ſummoned his tenants to partake of his bounty on the pleaſure ground which joined his houſe, and forced him ſometimes to confeſs; that participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the pleaſures of others is the higheſt and pureſt bliſs.</p>
                     <p>His heart was gratefully ſenſible of what Amalia did for him, and he meditated frequently in private how he could give her ſome unexpected pleaſure, and the day on which he had the ſatisfaction to ſucceed in it was to him a day of feſtivity. Thus one month elapſed after the other, and the rays of the riſing ſun emerging from behind the Alps, were hailed every morn by a content, if not a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py couple.</p>
                     <p>One morning—Amalia had juſt riſen.—a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant informed her a gentleman wanted to ſpeak to her. She referred him to Nicolaus; but he inſiſted upon ſpeaking to Lady Amalia Wall herſelf. She went down into the parlour and beheld an officer, who preſented himſelf to her with modeſt propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:037761_0314_100F06EFF6362898"/>
as Baron Waldburg. They ſat down on the ſofa, converſing on different ſubjects; the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant ſeemed diſtreſſed how he ſhould introduce the object of his viſit.</p>
                     <p>"My Lady," began he at laſt, timidly, "I went in ſearch of you to Hanover, to comply with my word of honour which I gave to a dying friend. This watch—belonged formerly to Major Orten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. He fell by my ſide and requeſted me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died to deliver this watch into your own hands, and to deſire you to keep it for his ſake.—Forgive me if I, perhaps, tear again a wound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen which ſcarcely is cloſed.—I ſhould have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the laſt requeſt of my dying friend much ſooner, if the ſervice had not prevented me."</p>
                     <p>Amalia ſwam in tears; ſhe preſſed the watch to her heart. A ſmall ſeal which ſhe had given Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am at Hanover was fixed to it. She wanted to thank the friend of her lover,—extended her hand towards him, but could not ſpeak. The idea that her name had been the laſt word which her dear William had uttered, filled her heart with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſadneſs. Nicolaus now joined them, ſaw the object of Amalia's tears, and could not retain his. I wiſh I had ſuffered him to buy a title!" This was all he could ſay.</p>
                     <p>That day was devoted to ſorrow. Lieutenant Waldburg ſtaid dinner, during which little was ate and leſs ſpoken. The full moon found them in the evening ſitting ſilently at Welli's urn.</p>
                     <p>I now ſhall lay down my pen. Nicolaus and Amalia are ſtill living, whether in Switzerland or at the foot of the Kaukaſus will be indifferent to my readers. Nicolaus moiſtens Welli's aſhes with his tears, and Amalia looks frequently at William's watch, and counts every hour which brings her nearer towards the grave.</p>
