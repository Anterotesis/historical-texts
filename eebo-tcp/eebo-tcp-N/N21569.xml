            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I was commanded to write the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the World, I was immediately after inſtructed by Revelation how; without which I could not, nor could any other Man on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ace of the Earth with certainty, however eminent for Wiſdom and Learning he might be: after it was done, the LORD GOD ſaid to me in a viſion at night,—That is the true Age of the World, and the general computed one is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</p>
                  <p>As the SCRIPTURE is the only great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Knowledge, or Book of written Truth in the World; as it contains the ſacred Records of thoſe Things which GOD has predetermined ſhall be hereafter—as well as thoſe which have been already; and as it contains the Hiſtory of our own Creation, with that of every living thing beſides, It alone, in preference to any Man's opinion, ought to be, without the leaſt doubt, freely believed and confidently depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
                  <p>Although I am enabled, from revealed Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to write conſiderably more than what this Book contains, and which, in Juſtice to the Divine Spirit of Truth from whom it flows, ought to be believed; yet GOD, who inſtructs me in all things, that I may ſhew an example

of preciſion to the Learned, and be admired for it by the Wiſe; that I may give inſtruction to the Poor, and demonſtrate the certainty of what I do write to every Man that has the leaſt knowledge of his Creator, commands me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="21">21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, and ſay, I will ſhake the heavens and the earth;</p>

                     <p>The time alluded to by the prophet, is that which is immediately before the reſtoration of the Jews, in the latter days of the world;— the preſent is it.</p>

                     <p>The meaning of this verſe is, that when the former part of this prophecy is fulfilling, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel will be revived in his deſcendant, who will be, <hi>like himſelf, the viſible prince and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Jews;</hi> the time is nearly come for this man to be openly revealed, and to have, in all other reſpects, this very gracious and very wonderful promiſe from God fulfilled.</p>

                  <p>THE very loud and unuſual kind of thunder that was heard in the beginning of January, 1791, was the voice of the angel mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of the revelation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the judgment of God and the fall of Babylon the Great: it was the loudeſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was heard ſince man was created, and ſhook the whole earth every time the angel ſpoke; it roared through the ſtreets, and made a noiſe over London like the falling of mountains of ſtones.</p>

                     <p>The Lord God was ſo exceeding angry at the time of the loud thunder I have mentioned in the preceding part, that he determined to leave his other judgments unfulfilled relative to London, and burn her immediately with fire from heaven: ſoon afterwards I was informed by revelation of what the thunder meant, and was commanded to go from London beyond the diſtance of eighteen miles. I had <hi>ſimilar to the prophet Daniel at Babylon,</hi> an attending angel to explain all the viſions, and ſupport me under the grief I was loaded with for its approaching fall.</p>
                     <p>The Lord God knowing that I loved him with all my heart, and had often reſiſted the calls of hunger and diſtreſs, rather than comply with cuſtoms that would offend him, pitied me; for I had beſeeched him to let me inform the people of London of their danger, and try by

all poſſible means to ſave them; but was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed permiſſion, becauſe they would impriſon and uſe me very ill for it.</p>
                     <p>In addition to all that God had promiſed and repeated by his angel to make me happy, he was now pleaſed to give me another proof of his unalterable regard, and convince me by it, that, <hi>although he could not in juſtice in his recorded judgments ſpare London,</hi> yet for my ſake he would ſhew mercy to ſome: and take care, that by ſickneſs and other cauſes, to remove the perſons I deſired ſhould be ſaved, to a ſufficient diſtance beyond the limits to be deſtroyed and ſunk.

                     <p>Among thoſe I mentioned, was William Pult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, William Pitt, Gilbert Elliot, Charles Grey, the Earl of Buckinghamſhire, the Marquis of Lanſdowne, the Earl of Chatham, Maitland, now called Earl of Lauderdale; Henry Phipp, for I remembered his brother to have done me as act of friendſhip; John Dalrymple, John Griffin Griffin, Alderman Pickett, <hi>becauſe that during his mayoralty he oppoſed by a public adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement the frequency of taking oaths;</hi> in doing ſo be honoured that all-remembering God, who will in due time as publickly honour him for it. Wilberforce, Baſtard, Sheridan, Philip Stephens, Charles Fox: John Luke, a poor quaker; Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Hood; the King and his family, for they were to be gathered into London: Ponſonby, for whom I conceived an eſteem, from obſerving in his countenance openneſs and honeſty; and

poſſeſſing, as I thought, a heart ſimilar to my own, I was led to entreat for him: until laſt year I could aſſign no other reaſon for mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that name than what I have given; but the true one is, that as God had determined not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep in London the people then in it, but likewiſe to allow great multitudes to be drawn to it from all parts of the country, he would be found among the number to be deſtroyed; for which, to prevent his death in ſuch a place, the Lord God influenced me to regard him, that I might afterwards remember ſuch a perſon, and be mindful of his ſafety.</p>
                     <p>I am not in the leaſt acquainted with the man I have mentioned, whom God was pleaſed to diſtinguiſh by ſo great a teſtimony of his regard, but although I am not, and our names are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, <hi>he is, as well as myſelf,</hi> deſcended from David, king of Iſrael. The Counteſs of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghamſhire, whom I am no more acquainted with than the ſtranger I mentioned before, is likewiſe deſcended from David, king of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; the family ſhe is married into are alſo of the Hebrews, and are deſcended from Joſeph the once preſident of Egypt.</p>
                     <p>There are many families of the ſame origin as thoſe three I have named, made known to me by revelation, but I am forbid to mention any of them at preſent for public knowledge.</p>
                     <p>After entreating for the perſons I have ſet down, and pointing from my mind to numbers beſides, whoſe names I did not know, I was, <hi>to prepare me for the deſignation of God,</hi> carried up to heaven in a viſion, and ſaw on my right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

was the Holy Ghoſt, and was the very ſame that deſcended on the head of my bleſſed Saviour, when he came up from being baptized in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Jordan; he kept between me and <hi>Satan,</hi> who was then revealed that I might witneſs it, and great power given him to viſit the earth.— The Lord God then ſpoke to me from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of a white ſhining cloud.</p>
                     <p>After this I was in a viſion, <hi>having the angel of God near me,</hi> and ſaw Satan walking leiſurely into London: his face had a ſmile, but under it his looks were ſly, crafty, and deceitful. On the right ſide of his forehead were ſeven dark ſpots; he was dreſſed in white and ſcarlet robes.</p>
                     <p>Again I was in a viſion, and ſaw London a ſcene of confuſion; it was effected on a ſudden; all the people were armed and appeared quite furious: I was carried through the city in the Spirit of God to ſee all things that were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould come to paſs, and be informed how quick they could be accompliſhed.</p>
                     <p>After this I was in a viſion, and ſaw a large river run through London coloured with human blood.</p>
                     <p>Exceedingly unhappy for all that I ſaw, and which I knew would ſoon be fulfilled; I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entreated the Lord God to give me one more inſtance of his mighty regard, <hi>by ſparing London and the great multitude in it.</hi> I ſaid, I acknowledge, O Lord my God, that the people do very wrong, but it is through compulſion, and for want of knowing better.</p>
                     <p>The Lord God was ſo highly diſpleaſed, that I ſhould, after all his former kindneſs, ſtrain his affection and entreat him to annul his <hi>recorded judgment,</hi> as to ſtop me, and in a voice of great

ſharpneſs and anger, ſaid, <hi>They have my bleſſed Goſpel, and will not obey it.</hi> The angel that was appointed to give me inſtruction forſook me in an inſtant on hearing this anſwer. I trembled for my life, and ſeemed to be another man; for I was afraid of being deſtroyed with the city.— It was three days after this before the Lord God would be reconciled to hear my prayers, and ſpeak to me with his former kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>In ten days after the three I was in a viſion, and being carried up to heaven, the Lord God ſpoke to me from the middle of a large white cloud, and ſaid in a ſtrong clear voice—All, All. I pardon London and all the people in it for your ſake: There is no other man on earth that could ſtand before me to aſk for ſo great a thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For ever, O Lord my God, I will praiſe and thank you for this great inſtance of your bleſſed regard; all Nations will hear it, and may all Nations honor you by their obedience: your great mercy is over them all, and by its goodneſs the world is now ſafe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had London been deſtroyed in the year of 1791, the place where it ſtands would have formed a great bay, or inlet of the channel: all the land between Windſor and the Downs would have been ſunk, including a diſtance of eighteen miles each ſide, but conſiderably more towards the ſea coaſt; it would be ſunk to the depth of ſeventy fathoms, or four hundred and twenty feet, that no traces of the city might be ever found, or even ſo much as looked for.</p>

                     <p>I was in a viſion, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to a field of young wheat, which was grown about four inches high from the ground: an elderly Engliſh woman ſtood by me; <hi>ſhe had no covering on her head,</hi> but over her arms was an old black ſilk cloak; it was worn threadbare, and rent in many places. While I was obſerving the dreſs and poverty of the woman, the wheat ſprung up in an inſtant, and ſhot out to the ſize of full ears, the largeſt I ever ſaw in my life: aſtoniſhed at ſuch a ſight, and wondering what it ſhould mean, I ſtooped to feel ſome with my hand; when I had, <hi>the woman looked down to me with a countenance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of great diſtreſs to implore my pity and aſſiſtance,</hi> then turned her face away to the eaſt, and afterwards looked up to heaven, as if ſhe wanted rain and a cool wind.</p>
                     <p>After this I caſt my eyes over the ſurface of the land; it was ſcorched to a dark brown, and frightful to look at: I could ſee no graſs in the meadows, and the buſhes in the hedges were all burnt brown; <hi>ſo great and mighty was the heat:</hi> I could ſee no beaſts in the fields, and the fowls of heaven were all flown away.</p>

                     <p>The trees, buſhes in the hedges, graſs in the meadows, and what corn was left from the hail, would be cut off and deſtroyed by this great and mighty heat.

                     <p>The 15th of Auguſt 1793, was the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord God to fulfil the parts of the Revelation I have mentioned, and puniſh

the world with deſolation; but from his great mercy and regard for me, that I may be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this country, and by all others, when I am revealed, ſuſpended his judgment for a time— it hangs however over all nations.</p>
                     <p>Look at the age of the world; read atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively the chapters I have mentioned, with what I have wrote beſides; and you will diſcover in your own breaſt a light, to ſee and believe by.</p>

                     <p>All the prophecies given in viſions from God, are concealed from the knowledge of man by myſterious alluſions, until the proper time, and the appointed perſon for them to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. For it is not in the cunning of any one man, even aſſiſted by the wiſdom of all the reſt on earth, to ſearch out the deep ſecrets of God, or with truth to unfold the meaning of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: <hi>they are wonderful;</hi> they cannot be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered until God himſelf pleaſes to remove the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſecrecy; and, through an appointed perſon, bleſſes the world with a knowledge of their true meaning.</p>
                     <p>The fulfilling of the judgments of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſtructively they may prove to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and nations which they are directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, are not allowed to affect my perſonal ſafety, nor operate in the leaſt to my prejudice: for the certainty of my elevation, to the greateſt <hi>principality</hi> that ever will be, in the world, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

be prevented by the riſe or fall of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power on earth; becauſe it is the repeated covenant of God to my forefathers, and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred promiſe now by Revelation to myſelf.</p>
                     <p>The obſcurity of David was no objection, with a diſcerning God, to make him the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of Iſrael, and afterwards promiſe the ſucceſſion to his family forever; neither is mine now to his fulfilling that promiſe, and holding me up to the world, as the viſible governor of the Jews. For all the works of God are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and very far exceed the capacity of man to know where they begin, how they are direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, on whom, or which way they will end:— I that have more knowledge of them, and of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, revealed to me, than any other under the whole heaven, obſerve the operation of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery new one with more amazement than the former.</p>
                     <p>Therefore my preſent poverty is no obſtacle to my future elevation, neither is it of much concern to myſelf; for the time of my being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, with power from heaven, is nigh; when God, to manifeſt his regard, will give me favor with many, and influence all the people of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to help me.</p>
                     <p>I am the prophet that will be revealed to the Jews, to order their departure from all nations, to go to the land of Iſrael, their own country, in a ſimilar manner to Moſes in Egypt, but with additional power.</p>
                     <p>I was an officer in the Engliſh navy, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſo, although I did not know it, that the judgment of God on David, king of Iſrael might be fulfilled, which was, that the ſword ſhould never depart from his houſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 AND there came one of the ſeven angels, which had the ſeven vials, and talked with me, ſaying to me, Come hither, and I will ſhew thee the judgment of the great whore, (meaning Rome) that ſits upon many waters, (meaning her government over many nations.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, (meaning, they have been ſeduced to imitate her evil practices,) and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are likewiſe deluded to drink deep to a ſtate of inſenſibility from her vain doctrines.)</p>
                     <p>A remarkable inſtance of this was very late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed, and really fulfilled at Naples;— which, although governed by a king, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in the ſee of Rome, and about ſixty miles diſtant. In conſequence of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent irruption of fire out of mount Veſuvius, which is but a few miles from Naples, the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a human head, called St. Janarius's, was carried in proceſſion, lifted up, and held out, fully believing, that by honoring the ſaint, through even this ſmall part of his image, he himſelf in heaven, would be influenced to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God, to ſtop the great rivers of fire which iſſued from the burning mountain.</p>

an act of ſuperſtition and deluſion, is indeed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing. But it is a part of that great chain of errors, ſtill continued, which the Roman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, at a former period, moſt wickedly bound its people in all nations, but clergy in particular with; and which is plainly foretold by St. Paul, in the fourth chapter of his Firſt Epiſtle to Timothy, verſe 1. Now the Spirit <hi>(which is the Holy Ghoſt)</hi> ſpeaks expreſsly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of devils:</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Speaking lies in hypocriſy, having their conſciences ſeared with a hot iron:</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Forbidden to marry, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The papal authority does not allow its cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to marry, from a belief that a man, by liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtate of ſeparation from a woman, is better qualified to fulfil the duties of a prieſt, more acceptable to God, than a man that is a huſband and father. Such doctrine is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof to every diſcerning perſon, that there is a great departure, or falling away, from the true faith; to continue then in the practice, after it is explained and made public by Divine command, is preferring darkneſs to light, the doctrines of devils to the good words of God: it is giving a willing heed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſpirits that St. Paul alludes to. Chriſt, the Savior of the world, who left his goſpel of the kingdom of peace for the direction of all men, never made any ſuch diſtinction; for ſome of his apoſtles were married, and ſome were not: and be, as God the Father, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the creation, bleſſed Adam and Eve, ſaying to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and

                     <p>Theſe two verſes mean the cardinals, who are compared to kings in name; but not in power: they are great, but not independent; they have a great name, but not independent ſovereignty: they are called, like the German electors to the Emperor, as is mentioned in the ſeventh chapter of Daniel, the horns of the beaſt; becauſe they aſſiſt the Pope with their counſel and authority.</p>

                     <p>The pope and cardinals, by their teaching, practice, and government, are in a ſtate of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Chriſt; that is, they practiſe and encourage, to ſupport their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Swearing and War; the two principal things which Chriſt, above all others, prohibits in the moſt poſitive terms. It is for this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his commands in the Goſpel, that they are repreſented as making war againſt him;— they are permitted, through the patient ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, to do ſo, until he can bear no longer with their rebellion; when, to fulfil this prophecy and his decreed judgment, they

will be entirely cut off. Chriſt, as ſupreme head of the church, acknowledges no religion but what he has taught by his Goſpel, which is Chriſtianity; for there is no kind of church but one, and that is viſible man: it conſiſts of one perſon, as well as a whole congregation; of one juſt man in a room, as well as a million any where elſe; he came into the world to ſave ſinners, and redeem them from the chains of eternal death: the bleſſed Goſpel is the great bond of his promiſes, now put into the hands of all men that will receive it for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for which, all that read or hear it, ought to remember their ſolemn covenant in baptiſm, and take care that on their part, the terms of his ſalvation are complied with. To do which, man muſt, to fulfil the deſign of his creation, endeavor to live long, and live happy; to do that, he muſt aboliſh War, and live in conſtant peace; he muſt likewiſe aboliſh ſwearing of every kind, becauſe it leads to falſehood and perjury: and make the innocent words of Yes or No, the ſolemn bond of his public truth.</p>
                     <p>The men that are called preachers of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, inſtead of aſſuming vain titles and lofty political names; inſtead of aſſiſting in any way at councils of ſtate, they ought to ſtand between princes and war, between men and ſtrife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween nations and bloodſhed: they ſhould be true teachers of the Goſpel, and, like the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate diſciples of their bleſſed Savior, always the Miniſters of Peace.</p>

                     <p>As circumciſion to the Jews was the ſeal of their covenant with God, and promiſe of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his law, ſo is baptiſm with Chriſtians the ſeal of their covenant with Chriſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of obedience to his commands.</p>
                     <p>When teachers, profeſſing Chriſtianity, have their maintenance and elevation in the world, dependent on great political warlike govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and want to do, from intereſted motives, what the bleſſed Goſpel prohibits, to add plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to their deluſive reaſons, as in the legal and religious caſe of ſwearing oaths: they go back to the law of Moſes for a precedent, to juſtify their apoſtacy and conduct. The law was for the Jews alone, under the appointed adminiſtration of the Levites and elders, in their own country; nevertheleſs, when ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers acknowledged God, and ſubmitted to its rites, they were alſo allowed the freedom of its benefit; but when Chriſt came into the world, for the redemption of man, he aboliſhed the law, which was temporary, and in its place gave the Goſpel; which is everlaſting. That is, he removed the form of worſhipping God by ſacrifice; the form of coming at the truth by
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028354_0080_0FD8AA7CF98042B8"/>
ſwearing; and that of obtaining juſtice for injury, by repriſal and violence.</p>
                     <p>We all admire the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for his humility and affection, the goodneſs and wiſdom that breathes throughout his Goſpel, and the ſacrifice of himſelf for our ſalvation; yet the generality of the world, as if unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this wonderful inſtance of Divine love, not only refuſe what they promiſed in baptiſm to obey, but likewiſe ſeek, by oppoſition and war, to deſtroy his ſalvation and happy govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace. What does a man require from his wife in marriage, but to love and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him only? Would he not be jealous, and very angry, if ſhe obeyed any commands in oppoſition to his, and honored another with the endearing name of huſband? By the ſame rule, all that are baptized, are, by covenant, comparatively married to Chriſt; for the name of Chriſtian implies a belief in him, and an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his words. Is it wiſe or juſt then, to obey a doctrine contrary to the commands of thy bleſſed Lord and acknowledged Savior? And is it not unkind in thee, O man, to honor thy equal with his ſacred name?</p>
                     <p>As a man cannot, in juſtice, be conſidered as a ſervant, any longer than while he obeys the commands of his maſter, ſo neither can a man, in truth, be regarded as a Chriſtian, any longer than while he obeys the commands of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Hear therefore, all nations, what the Lord God commands me to write, and be warned by it; that, as a maſter is compelled to withdraw his allowance of food, and diſcharge from his houſe a ſervant that will not obey him, ſo will he withdraw his loving kindneſs of peace, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028354_0081_0FD8AA81951C3C60"/>
in anger remove from the face of the earth, that man or family, city or nation, that will only acknowledge Chriſt in word, but in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice refuſe to obey his commands.</p>

                     <hi>PREFACE</hi> TO BOOK THE SECOND.</head>
                  <p>LENGTH of time, change of countries and governments, corruption of language, and haſty copies in writing, before the more exact method of printing became generally uſed, has been the means of not only introducing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſign, into the Hebrew Bible, an inſertion of ſome new words, but likewiſe an expulſion of ſome of the old, which produces a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome few parts, and makes it differ now from what it originally was in the times of David, Solomon, and at the commencement of the Babylonian captivity: ſome parts of the Engliſh tranſlation are, conſequently, erroneous; but they are ſo immaterial as not to affect, in the leaſt, the truth of its ſacred <hi>Records,</hi> or the tendency of its divine inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The few parts of the Engliſh tranſlation, which I am inſtructed to alter in my writings, the propriety will be allowed by every perſon that has diſcernment to perceive, or conviction
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="unknown:028354_0085_0FD8AA8D63197170"/>
to believe:—beyond the limits of my author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for it is preſcribed, I am not ſuffered to proceed in any word or in any way whatever.</p>
                  <p>The following are the words which the Lord God ſpoke to me in a viſion, ſoon after I was commanded to write and make known his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the good of London and general benent of all nations:—There is no other man under the whole heaven that I diſcover the errors of the bible to, and reveal a knowledge how to correct them, ſo that they may be reſtored as they were in the beginning, but yourſelf.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when I began to write I believed it neceſſary to adopt the ſame language as the Scripture does, regularly imitating it in the words—ye thee, and thou; but God ſpoke to me in a viſion of the night, and ſaid—Write in the ſame manner as I always ſpeak to you; write as other men do; write according to the cuſtom of the country you live in; you will then be better attended to, and what you write will be more eaſily underſtood.</p>
                  <p>A man that has been an officer in the navy, whoſe immediate anceſtors have been ſeparated from the Jews ſuch a conſiderable length of time as to make them forget they ever belonged to the name,— ſuch a man declaring himſelf openly to the world a prophet of God, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Prince allotted to order the ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Hebrews from all nations, and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern them in the land of Iſrael, will, with ſome reaſon, I allow, excite both aſtoniſhment and doubt: but from the multiplied recorded teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies I produce, which no other on earth can,
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="unknown:028354_0086_0FD8AA8E432F4AD8"/>
it ought not to prevail with any perſon as a juſt objection againſt believing what I write.</p>
                  <p>For obſerve, ſome hoſtile profeſſion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to be engaged in, to fulfil the recorded judgment on the family I am deſigned to repreſent in the ſeat of government; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with all the certain proofs I have and will conſtantly bring forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with all the juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I advance, the ſurprize and doubt, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at the beginning, ought to vaniſh in as little time as would be requiſite to read again the book which contains the account.</p>
                  <p>But remember likewiſe, from the records of Scripture, that Moſes was taken away in his infancy, and remained ſeparated from his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren for eighty years; the firſt forty of which he was reared in the palace of the king of Egypt, and educated in the language and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the country like one of its own native princes; yet he was revealed to the Iſraelites as the prophet of God, to order their haſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Pharaoh's bondage, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to conduct them to the Promiſed Land.</p>
                  <p>SAUL, the ſon of Kiſh, after being anointed king, prophecied in company with other men, to the great aſtoniſhment of all that ſaw him.</p>

Yet this great monarch this unequalled favorite, this pattern of mercy to all kings, and who alone, of all men under heaven, poſſeſſed the eſtabliſhed promiſe of everlaſting national gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, could not, (but the objection did not proceed from any charge of injuſtice or ſin,) for, being a man of war, and having ſhed much blood on the earth, although done by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs concurrence of the Moſt High, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to build at Jeruſalem a temple of worſhip for him: The great honor was given to Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a king of peace, his ſon and immediate ſucceſſor ſo averſe though neceſſitated to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it was the Creator of the world to the effuſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>IN the firſt year of Belſhazzar, king of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Daniel had a dream, and viſions in the night on his bed; then he wrote the viſions, to ſhew the ſubſtance of what they contained.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Daniel ſpake and ſaid; I ſaw in my viſion by night, and behold, the four winds of the heaven ſtrove on the great ſea.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 And <hi>four great beaſts</hi> came up from the ſea, different one from another.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The firſt was like a lion, and it had eagle's wings: I beheld 'till the wings were plucked, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made ſtand on the feet as a man; and a man's heart was given to it.</p>
                     <p>The lion means George the Third, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent king of England; plucking the wings of the lion, means taking away the power of the king, made ſtand on the feet as a man, with a man's heart, means his reduction to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of other men,—and poſſeſſing ſimilar thoughts.</p>
                     <p>It is more than twenty months ſince I firſt wrote to the king, queen, and miniſter of ſtate, to inform them of many things that would come to paſs; that the time was nearly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed for ſome of the judgments of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

on any account whatever, or even encourage it, for the death of Louis the Sixteenth would be impoſſible to prevent, it was recorded, and could not be avoided; the revolution in France, and its conſequences proceeded entirely from the judgment of God to fulfil this prophecy of Daniel: therefore all attempts to overthrow the judgment, and preſerve the monarchy by force, was oppoſing what was determined in the Scripture of Truth ſhould moſt certainly take place.</p>
                     <p>The aſpect of the war was deluſive, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of ſucceſs that it held out to prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were deceitful; but thoſe encouragements of deluſion were permitted, to bring many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under the judgment of God, and puniſh them for the heavy guilt of oppoſing his decrees.</p>

                     <p>Are you, William Pitt, to whom I wrote in May and June 1792, informing you of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this war to your country, when the war was not intended, ſo inſenſible to your own preſervation and the benefit of your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to continue any longer a war that will involve both you and him in certain death?— What I acquainted you with in 1792, and often ſince, was made known to me by <hi>viſions and revelations</hi> from the Lord God. The <hi>death of Louis</hi> XVI. and the removal of the Engliſh crown from the king's head, to a level with the ground, according to the ſeventh chapter of Daniel; the fall of the queen's palace, and the deſtruction of the Tower; your own removal from adminiſtration, and afterwards death, was among the things which I informed you of would moſt certainly come to paſs as the evil conſequences of this deluſive war. My account to you then, of futurity, concluded with theſe
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028354_0107_0FD8A8D76793CA48"/>
words—"The viſions are eſtabliſhed, and the things mentioned moſt certain and true."</p>
                     <p>When I informed you that England would enter into this war, and the conſequences which would, in deſpite of all your efforts, flow from it, <hi>you deſpiſed me;</hi> for at that time, the war was not intended: and to tell of evils that would moſt certainly enſue from a thing, when the thing they were to proceed from was not deſigned, were to you the effects of folly and deceit.</p>
                     <p>My knowledge of future things is given me from God; therefore what I wrote was true: A little time longer, and England will be ſo much entangled as not to be able to go forward without feeling the pains of that <hi>colonial conqueſt</hi> which is to be the cauſe of her death; nor to retire, without falling under that foreign blow, which will break the empires in pieces, and throw herſelf down on the ground; from whence ſhe is never to riſe up any more.</p>

                     <p>When at the door, on the 17th, I informed the ſpeaker by a letter, that I waited, and was ready to communicate all that I was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In a few minutes after a meſſenger return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with my own letter, who treated me, <hi>in ſuch a public place particularly,</hi> with unfeeling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and incivility. The Lord God ſpoke to me inſtantly, on being ordered to go about my buſineſs, and ſaid—Get away, get away from this place; be under no concern, it was not you that was deſpiſed and ordered away, but me, in your perſon, that ſent you.</p>
                     <p>Soon after my return home I was in a <hi>viſion</hi> and ſaw a large meaſuring rod move through the ſtreets in great haſte, and ſtrike many of the houſes as it paſſed, marking them for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fall. After this I was made to look towards the <hi>Treaſury,</hi> while the Lord God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, at the ſame time—<hi>All that ſide ſhall fall.</hi> In an inſtant, the whole place was cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thick darkneſs; it ſeemed to be everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting darkneſs; darkneſs that ſhould never be removed: And, again, he pronounced, in quick words, as if diſpleaſed—The whole ſhall fall.</p>
                     <p>The information, as will be plainly ſeen by the date, which I gave to the <hi>king</hi> and <hi>miniſter of ſtate,</hi> with what I was commanded to offer to the parliament, was not only before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war with France was entered into, but alſo ſome length of time before it was ever intended:

                     <p>Change times and laws: the meaning of which is, that what God decrees is his law, and this prophecy contains it; an oppoſition by the <hi>king of Pruſſia</hi> to what God has decreed ſhall come to paſs, is endeavoring by force of arms to ſtop the courſe of the prophecy, and change the decreed time for it to be fulfilled. The king of Pruſſia, by threatening, with the great ſtrength of his army, to build up, what God, to fulfil this prophecy, has thrown down; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that monarchy in France, which God, to fulfil his recorded judgment in this prophecy, has removed for ever;—is the meaning of— <hi>And he will think to change times and laws.</hi>

                     <p>And they will be given into his hand, for a time and times, and the dividing of time.

But my prayers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with God, even againſt his own recorded judgment by Daniel, for I beſeeched him to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the unjuſt deſigns of the king of Pruſſia, before he invaded France, after he had, to ſuſpend the prophecy, and for my ſake to turn him back.

at night, and ſaid, "He ſhall go out of France with ſhame and confuſion."</p>
                     <p>This promiſe was fulfilled in the year 1792; for, ſoon after the Pruſſian army entered France, God led it into ſuch difficult places as to endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger its ſafety; he alſo ſent the viſitation of a waſting ſickneſs that forced it to go away, aſhamed and highly diſappointed. Although the other parts of the prophecy muſt neceſſarily be fulfilled to accompliſh the purpoſes of God, and the deſtruction of the Pruſſian monarchy, the king cannot conquer as the judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but he is permitted to oppoſe, ſometimes defeated with ſhame, and ſometimes encouraged by deceitful ſucceſs; until his armies become weak, and the Bear becomes ſtrong; until the proper time arrives for him likewiſe to fall.</p>

                     <p>That intelligent, internal monitor, was in truth no other than the compaſſionate Spirit of the living God, ſtriving, to the laſt moment, to ſave a falling man from the dreadful effects of his own judgment: but the king of Pruſſia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the bleſſed intimation, and reſolved on a war; which, if there was no knowledge of God in the world, no part of human reaſon could find the leaſt colorable pretence to juſtify.</p>

war and other cauſes, incident to human king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, like the ſecond temple at Jeruſalem—long in building—This mighty ſtructure is not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed yet. This is that ſtone, cut out without hands, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, in his ſecond chapter, 34th and 35th verſes, which breaks the head and the feet, the gold and the ſilver, the braſs, the iron, and the clay, of the great image of human power to pieces: and this is that kingdom, mentioned by the ſame prophet, in the 44th verſe following, which is to break in pieces and conſume all other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; but which is to remain itſelf forever.— The name of this univerſal kingdom is Peace; it has the bleſſed Goſpel for its government, and the Lord God for its king.</p>
                     <p>As I knew, in the beginning of 1792, that the king of England would enter into this war, and by doing ſo, fall under the ſame judgment from God as the other monarchs ſhewn in the viſion, unleſs I could, by a juſt explanation of the prophecies, perſuade him to remain at peace; he will, I truſt, with the queen and miniſter of ſtate, do me the juſtice hereafter to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the danger was fully communicated: and that I did not ceaſe in my endeavors to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him from joining in the confederacy againſt France, not only for a long time before he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, but alſo after he had, even till the deſigns of government were ready to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by open preparations for hoſtility.</p>
                     <p>If this war was like any which has preceded it, a prince might, as uſual, ſit down at his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and calculate, from his ſucceſſes, how long to carry it on; or, by his defeats, how ſoon he muſt leave it off: but the death of Louis XVI.

and the revolution in France, having proceeded from the recorded judgment of God, the two <hi>things which have occaſioned it, and which have rendered it ſo entirely different, that its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are already determined,</hi> will be the lame to the monarchs engaged in it, as it happens to a man unexpectedly caught in a large trap, on forbidden ground—the pains of death convince him of tranſgreſſion, before his eyes could warn him of the danger.</p>
                     <p>I know the judgments of God; by them I am directed; by revelation and through his Holy Spirit I write. To fulfil, then, the ſeventh chapter of Daniel, and ſuch parts of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as mean the preſent time and the ſame things, the war now carrying on will involve all the nations engaged in it in great diſtreſs, and nearly all the princes of Europe in death. As I knew all this a conſiderable time before the war, I ſet my heart and my mind to intercede with God, although it was againſt his recorded Judgments, to ſave the king, and <hi>ſpare the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> I live in: I ſucceeded with God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an offer of mercy; but could not with man, to believe and accept it.</p>

                     <p>I find, yes, I feel by dreadful experience, that all men are inſenſible to the conſequences of thoſe judgments, recorded in the Scripture, and are alſo exceedingly hardened againſt believing their true interpretation and time to be fulfilled.

At that time, after mentioning the name of William Pitt, I paſſed by that of his brother; immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after, the Lord God reminded me of it, and, in a voice of great ſoftneſs and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaid, There is <hi>John Pitt,</hi> wont you mention him?

                     </p>
                     <p>In the year of 1790 the Spirit of God begun firſt, (although I always had a preſentiment of being ſometime or other very great,) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten my underſtanding, and teach me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh right from wrong. At that time I was an officer in the navy, and conſidering that vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary ſwearing, which I was obliged to comply with every ſix months as a qualification to receive my pay, was unneceſſary, unjuſt, and wicked, I requeſted to be indulged with permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to receive it without; ſtating at the ſame time, the concealed and unheeded cruelty of the oath, with my own reaſons for objecting to the form: when I was told, in anſwer to my requeſt, that there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to diſpenſe with it.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this I made another requeſt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting my objections to voluntary ſwearing, with obſerving. That if the <hi>order of council</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced an oath in any manner or under any form whatever, and that the man it was directed to operate on, ſwore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a voluntary act—<hi>the reſult of his own free will,</hi>—would it not in the ſight of God in heaven, and every <hi>man</hi> of diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cernment

                     <p>Theſe reaſons with theſe objections, and the letter I received from the admiralty, ſtating their inſufficient power to diſpenſe with the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al form of ſwearing, I publiſhed at that time in the newſpaper called the <hi>Public Advertiſer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>During the time of my writing officially to the Admiralty I had occaſion to write alſo to the preſident, whom I knew to be a member of the council; with the buſineſs of Swearing, which led me to make an application, I remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, That as men, whether few in number or the increaſed multitude of a ſenate were not infallible, they muſt conſequently be ſubject to error. To corroborate more forcibly this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and likewiſe to impreſs a conviction of its juſtice, I mentioned among other things, a deciſion of the privy council relative to a native of Glaſgow, who had his ſhip ſeized in the Weſt Indies for an <hi>undeſigned</hi> infringement of the Navigation act.</p>
                     <p>After a legal inveſtigation in that country, it was clearly proved, and openly acknowledged, that although the apparent defect in the regiſter might authorize the ſeizure, it could not juſtify a condemnation; becauſe the commander, <hi>like an honeſt man,</hi> ſhewed it at the Cuſtom-houſe, and received the approbation of the principal officer.</p>
                     <p>An appeal was lodged againſt this acquittal, by the ſeizing officer in the Weſt Indies, and brought before the Privy Council in England! —the ſhip was condemned.</p>
                     <p>To conſtitute a High Court of Equity, its
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028354_0147_0FD8A94363A601D0"/>
members, to pronounce their judgment agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that very name their exiſtence as a court is derived from, muſt be governed more by the <hi>Intention</hi> than the preſumptive proof. But to conſtitute a Court of Law, its judges muſt be directed by the expreſs letter of the act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament under which they officiate.</p>
                     <p>For example, two men go into a foreſt; while the one is fetching a blow to cut down a tree, the axe flies from the handle and kills the other: Here is a preſumptive proof of murder, and the law very juſtly brings the ſurvivor to trial. But <hi>equity,</hi> viewing this circumſtance in a proper light, declares the innocence, and acquits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                     <p>Another, and more revelant to the ſeizure.— A man buys a ſtamp, to legalize a bond for the better ſecurity of trading with his money, <hi>or in plainer language, lending it on intereſt;</hi> to be certain that this ſtamp is warrantably juſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcribed forms of law, he ſhews it at the Stamp-office, where it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be good and ſafe: after this, in conſequence of ſome defect, it is declared illegal, and the holder ſubjected to a penalty.</p>
                     <p>I believe every man on earth, that has the common faculty of diſtinguiſhing white from black, will agree with me in ſaying, that it would be repugnant to equity to fine the holder for a defect that he had no knowledge of as ſuch, and for what was authoriſed by the very office of government that always iſſued the ſtamps.</p>
                     <p>The law ſuppoſes criminality from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but equity meaſures it from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. The one is external and viſible, provided
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:028354_0148_0FD8A9480E575F18"/>
many years before it may be wanted: the other is internal and ſpiritual, always alive in the heart of every judge that poſſeſſes prudence, learning, and penetration.</p>
                     <p>When I was writing of theſe things, to the Earl of Chatham, on my knees! made a ſolemn vow to the Almighty God, declaring that if he would be pleaſed to enable me, I would moſt ſurely procure an inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Immediately after this, I heard another voice from heaven, ſay, The Lord have mercy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>After making the numerous repreſentations I have mentioned, the Earl of Chatham, with great propriety, acknowledged their juſtice ſo far as to eraſe the word <hi>Voluntary</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed form of ſwearing: but I was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded of the words of Chriſt in the 5th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 34th verſe of St. Matthew, and ſtrictly commanded to obey them. Soon after this, I requeſted from the Admiralty, and often repeated it, a diſpenſing order that I might receive my pay without an oath; but they would not grant it.</p>
                     <p>If the Earl of Chatham had ſhewn me the ſmall favour I aſked for, and certainly it would have been but a very ſmall one to him, he ſhould be held up to the world, at my friend,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028354_0149_0FD8A949839C5100"/>
to be admired and regarded; he ſhould wear ſuch a durable coronet as would make him the envy of princes; it ſhould be a coronet that no human power would ever be able to remove.</p>
                     <p>As the Admiralty would not give me that reaſonable indulgence I requeſted, as they would not ſhew me that kindneſs which as men living by the navy, they might have done with eaſe, and without prejudice to their dignity; I want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a bit of bread to eat: I was beſides treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ill, as to be dragged to a work-houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any legal authority, againſt every remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance I could make, and againſt every threat I could make uſe of to call them to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the injuſtice. The Admiralty knew all this; they might have prevented it, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what was due to me to be paid; but they would neither prevent the evil, nor enable me to be liberated: they would not order the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what was due, until open falſehood was made uſe of to ſay I was out of my ſenſes. It ſeemed as if they were under ſome private ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, though pleaſed with my diſtreſs, of being charged one day or other in the eyes of their country with unfeeling cruelty, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome kind of colourable evidence to juſtify the proceeding.</p>

                     <p>Chriſt having been abuſed at Jeruſalem, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with having a devil, being mad, and out of his ſenſes, makes it the leſs aſtoniſhing for me, that am his ſervant, to be reviled in the ſame manner: For which the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to remind all men, from the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his bleſſed Goſpel, that the ſin is blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt his Holy Spirit, and that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is everlaſting fire.</p>

I am the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to whom the miniſter of ſin was revealed; he is a ſpirit, and no man can ſee him in the open day-light, unleſs ſanctified by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, and his eye-ſight ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>It is for this reaſon that I am the appointed witneſs for God, and his laſt recorded prophet

                     <head>The following are ſome more of the <hi>VISIONS,</hi> which God ſhewed me, and which I am command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to publiſh here.</head>
                     <p>IN the month called July, 1791, I was in a viſion, and was carried away by the ſpirit of God, to the ſea coaſt, in the Engliſh channel— a new ridge of unknown land was brought in an inſtant plain to my eyes, while the finger of a hand wrote, in large capital letters, with great quickneſs, and a voice pronounced twice from heaven, at the ſame time,
<q>SWEDE, SWEDE!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this I was in a viſion in the month of January 1792, and was carried away by the Spirit of God to Sweden, when I was made look through a window in a room; I did, and ſaw a man walk from the ſide of a great chair, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it empty. I could not ſee his face as he went away, and although I could not, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he had committed any crime, I thought with myſelf that he had been doing wrong. Immediately the angel that ſtood by me ſaid, The chair means the chair of ſtate;— and that man you ſaw will make it empty. The king of Sweden is <hi>delivered over for death,</hi> and that is the very man that will ſhoot him.</p>
                     <p>The prince of Orange is cloſely purſued like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but he is not delivered over yet.</p>
                     <p>After this I was in a viſion, and ſaw the Pruſſian eagle perched on a chair of ſtate; ſoon
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028354_0157_0FD8A95B6468EC40"/>
after, on a ſudden, I ſaw the chair, the houſe, and the whole city where the chair ſtood, in flames. The angel that was near me, ſaid, He is likewiſe purſued now.</p>
                     <p>After this I was in a viſion, and the Lord God talked with me, and ſaid, I give you the life of the Swede; but know this for certain, that if you prevent his death, the man himſelf will not believe there was any danger of it.— And when you write hereafter of things in this country, you will be called an impoſtor, a fool, and a liar: you will be impriſoned, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ill. When I ſee this, it will make me angry; I will then begin to kill the people, and I will ſurely deſtroy this city.</p>
                     <p>For which I gave no public information to warn the king of Sweden, and prevent his death. Had this man lived, he would have commanded the German army againſt France; his private plan was to go through Normandy, cloſe by the ſea coaſt, to be ſupplied the eaſier with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from England, and endeavour, by all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible means, to take the harbour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>reſt.</p>
                     <p>He ſaid to himſelf, in his own cloſer. This is the plan I will purſue; it will be giving a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow to the French navy, and getting a ſafe harbour for our own ſhips.</p>
                     <p>All this was made known to me by revelation from the Lord God; and which I communicated to the queen and miniſter of ſtate in 1792, ſome<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>time before the provinces of Brittany and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy ſhewed any open appearance of hoſtility againſt the preſent government of France.</p>
                     <p>In the month of April 1793, I was in a viſion, and was carried away in the ſpirit of God in Ruſſia, where I ſaw a Bear ſtop and reſt itſelf
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028354_0158_0FD8A95F338F2C48"/>
under a large tree; ſoon after I beheld a man, that lay concealed among the branches, drop down ſoftly, and with a ſharp piece of iron, which he held in his hand, ſtab the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ear; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, as he did ſo, I have watched a long time for you, but now I have caught you at laſt.</p>
                     <p>I know by revelation from the Lord God, that this viſion means the preſent empreſs of Ruſſia; for which, being permitted, I give her this warning.</p>
                     <p>Let the death of the kings of Sweden and France, which is but a little time paſt; the death of the king of Spain and another, which will ſoon take place, for they are purſued; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the princes and the people of Europe, that the ſeventh chapter of Daniel and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Haggai are now fulfilling.</p>
                     <p>At a former time, when the Lord God was inſtructing me in a knowledge of the laws and other things, relative to the nation I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to govern, he ſaid, in a viſion of the night, When I bring princes and people from all nations to bow down to you; when I begin to exalt you above the kings of the earth—Be ſober, be modeſt, be reaſonable. And immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after he added, You may inform the king of England that I call you my nephew.</p>
                     <p>On the 3d of March, 1794, I was in a viſion and ſaw the ſun in its full ſtrength, clear and high up in the firmament: ſoon after I ſaw ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſun riſe on a ſudden, equally large as the former, and ſtand cloſe by it: both ſhone with equal brightneſs, and the laſt, as well as the firſt, enlightened the world.</p>

to be printed, and even ſome of it done, the printer was adviſed not to do it according to my form; for, if he did, proſecution, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perhaps hanging, would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to him. For which the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to keep back the additional informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that otherways would be given, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the book.</p>
                     <p>I have ſaid already that the ſixth chapter of the Revelation was now fulfilling: the <hi>four firſt ſeals</hi> are opened, and the covering, which kept the meaning of the prophecies a profound ſecret until the preſent time, is removed: the <hi>recorded</hi> decrees are held up, and God himſelf commands a knowledge, of their contents to be publiſhed for the good of all nations. But if I cannot have the commands of God, and a knowledge of his judgments, printed exactly as I write, how is this extenſion of mercy to be known o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Europe, and the people of London inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any danger that is paſt, or any danger that is to come? All the prophecies in the Scripture were given through men: the Nine-inevites were warned through one.</p>
                     <p>How is the king to ſave himſelf from that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,</hi> determined, and unavoidable death,— which all the powers of armies cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? How is London and the parliament to be ſaved, when they are recorded in the Scripture of truth to be deſtroyed? How is England, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and moſt parts of the world to be ſaved, when they are recorded to be filled with blood by war, and to be made deſolate for ever by earthquakes if the perſon I employ is deterred, by the fears of proſecution and evil, from print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the full copy, exactly as I give it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>The king of England, the chancellor of the Exchequer, ſecretaries of ſtate, other members of adminiſtration, and as many members of both houſes of parliament, as my ability will allow; the biſhops, judges and all the foreign ambaſſadors in London; will have a book ſent to each.</p>
                     <p>On account of my being inſulted, becauſe the Jews do not believe in the firſt book, by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic acknowledgment of it, the Lord God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to remind all men of what is wrote in that book, and to ſay, that as the Jews do not believe in Chriſt, it cannot be expected that they will in me; <hi>neither are they,</hi> until I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in a ſimilar manner to Moſes in Egypt, but with the additional power of ſire as his ſign, to make them.</p>
                     <p>The night before I had finiſhed this book for the preſs, the Lord God ſhewed it to me in a viſion, ready printed, holding it up at the ſame time by one leaf, and ſhaking all the others open, while he pronounced, in ſtrong clear words, and commanded me to write them down exactly as he ſpoke, for univerſal information:</p>
                     <p>There is nothing in this book that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh law can take hold of:—So ſays Him that Iſaiah the prophet calls Wonderful Counſellor.</p>
                     <p>I requeſt every body, in all nations, to read this book with attention, and receive it ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, for although the information and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>Moſes was but a man, and to a man like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he alludes; as the Lord himſelf likewiſe declares in the three following verſes.</p>

                     <p>The prophet Ezekiel in the viſions of God to him, deſcribes the great extent, and grandeur of Jeruſalem at a future time; and likewiſe of its being governed by a human prince.</p>
                     <p>This is the very man, <hi>the appointed of God</hi> that is now abuſed, and publicly reproached in London—<hi>the capital of the ſpiritual Egypt, as is mentioned by St. John in the 11th chapter,</hi> with being a hypocrite, and a fanatic impoſtor.</p>
                     <p>Remember thoſe things, O my God; and as thy thunder on the 7th of this month—Auguſt —was to ſhew thy full determination to throw down cities, and daſh in pieces the council of evil men, if they committed any violence againſt me, <hi>for otherways I ſhould now be lying in the common priſon</hi>—So, O my God, execute; for they have no faith to believe thy juſt judgments, nor charity to be civil to thy meſſenger that declares thy great offers of mercy.</p>

                     <p>In the month called May, 1792, I was in a viſion, and receiving inſtruction from God of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things: he ſhewed me the queen, greatly alarmed at his judgments, by my revelation, with the power of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

afraid. This was communicated, with other things, to William Pitt, in the month called June, 1792. And likewiſe, informing him, at the ſame time, that it would moſt certainly be fulfilled: It will: it is eſtabliſhed with God, and will be ſo.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the month of June, 1792, I was in a viſion, and was carried away, by the Spirit of God, to the palace called St. James's, where I ſaw the preſent king of England; he roſe from his ſeat on ſeeing me, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent me his own magnificent ſtar, at the ſame time breathing on it, and kiſſing, as if kiſſing to take a laſt farewel; yet not with grief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to give, but with evident ſatisfaction. Why the king of England ſhould take his own conſpicuous ornament, and ſend it to me, was a thing that I was greatly aſtoniſhed at; I wiſhed to know the meaning, but could not diſcover; until a loud voice pronounced, down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, The Lord God delivers his life over into your hands, and he will give you any thing to preſerve it. This viſion, with others, and other things, was communicated, by Divine command, to the king, in 1792. The letter, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, with others to the king, the queen, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, were put into the penny-poſt office, to be ſent by that convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, according to the directions I received on that head by revelation from God.</p>
                     <p>1794. This day, called Thurſday, and the 12th of the month called June, I was in a viſion, at the hour of two in the afternoon, when the Lord God ſpoke to me in a voice of great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, carrying me away to the Bank of England at the ſame time, and ſaying, There is one of

twenty. The whole place rung and trembled with the clear, but ſharp ſound of his words, it is by his ſacred and particular command I mention this viſion in writing.</p>
                     <p>The 13th, in the morning, the Lord God ſaid to me, among other things, in a viſion, You ſee thoſe people do not believe, neither will they for all your endeavours; why then do you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to entreat me for them?</p>
                     <p>The 14th, in the morning, the Lord God ſpoke to me, and ſaid, The judgment is now againſt this nation; the thunder, juſt paſt, was to proclaim it: Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be deſtroyed; the prieſts, and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt, ſhall periſh, never to be found any more.</p>

                     <p>After this I was in a viſion, and the Lord God brought cloſe to me, that I might hear the report of a gun that was fired, and ſee a man privately ſhoot at another, to kill him: it was

ſo near, that I ſaw the flaſh, and ſmelt the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Before the death of the king of Sweden I was ſhewn, in a viſion, ſimilar to this, that he would be delivered over from the protection of God, to be ſhot.</p>

                     <p>He has not believed me at any time, although I fully informed him in 1792, and ſince, that it would be ſo: neither will he, until the very evil is viſited on him: and viſited on him, to increaſe his diſtreſs, at a time when he is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with danger, and loaded with trouble; it moſt certainly will.

                     <p>In the month called March, 1794, I was in a viſion, and the Lord God ſhewed me a large and very tall oak tree it ſtood alone; it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely withered, and all its branches were cut off. While I was conſidering the tree, its lonely condition and nakedneſs, I heard a very loud voice call out of heaven, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I know, by revelation, that Chriſtopher Love, a clergyman, who was unjuſtly tried, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put to death in London, in the year of 1651, had the divine Spirit of the living God, and prophecied from it.

                     <p>Remember the words of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, where he ſays, After this manner therefore pray ye, Our father, which art in heaven, &amp;c. As God then is our father, we that acknowledge and pray to him as ſuch, are ſurely his ſons and daughters.</p>

                     <p>The Lord God commands me to remind all people of the loud thunder that was on the 7th of Auguſt laſt, and to ſay, It was a threat from him to deſtroy London, ſooner than ſuffer me to be hurt: take it for a warning, and beware of the dreadful conſequences that will moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue, if a ſimilar injury is intended againſt me: for if you, the Engliſh Government, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to moleſt me, the Lord God is alſo determined to oppoſe you; and will viſit with death on his enemies, and with deſtruction on their capital.

Why do they do ſo? ſaid the Lord God to me. Why? becauſe you have not their <hi>mark,</hi> but my ſeal; you have not their authority, the laying on the hands of their biſhops, to give the Holy Ghoſt to prophecy by, but my Spirit, <hi>yet theſe are the men that pretend to judge of ſpirits,</hi> to diſcern the good from the evil: they ſuppoſe every man, that writes or ſpeaks under the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of God, is a falſe prophet, an impoſtor under deluſion; becauſe the words of truth, by him, go to contradict their mark, their human ordinances, and political forms of prayer.</p>
                     <p>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſays, in the fifteenth chapter of his Goſpel by St. Matthew, "But in vain they do worſhip me, teaching, for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, the commandments of men."</p>
                     <p>And becauſe the annunciation of my kingdom of peace and preſervation, brings with it the ſentence of death againſt their kingdom of war and human deſtruction; therefore, hear what the Lord God ſays to me by revelation, and commands me to write, That, as they have encouraged blaſphemy againſt me, they ſhall not proſper; for I will ſend a blaſt on them that will confound all their counſels: and, as they have encouraged abuſe againſt you, whom I ſent, and who entreated me for their good, I will deliver them over to the power of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies;

                     <p>This verſe means the Elector of Hanover.— Coming up out of the earth, is to ſignify that his country or government is ſituated inland.

                  <p>THIS extraordinary character having, for ſome months paſt, been the theme of the public in general, induces us to ſtate ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars reſpecting him, that, we truſt, will gratify the curioſity of our readers. To ſee a man riſing from the humble ſtate of a work-houſe, to that of a perſon attracting the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ranks and degrees, for his prophetic aſſertions, has juſtly excited aſtoniſhment. Let him be a madman, enthuſiaſt, or hypocrite, he muſt be conſidered as the moſt extraordinary man this century has produced. To cauſe the moſt diſtinguiſhed divines to heſitate in their opinions, reſpecting the truth or falſehood of his ſcriptural expoſitions, is, ſurely, in an untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028354_0208_0FD8C2E0D59D18A8"/>
man, a moſt wonderful trait of character. Allowing him to be a hypocrite, to blind an appearance of truth ſo artfully, with the reality of falſehood, as to confound the moſt learned in ſcripture, evinces a faculty that few men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever powerful in the arts of deluſion, in the courſe of ages, are found to poſſeſs. As a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, there is ſuch an urbanity of manners, ſuch a piety of principle, ſuch a forbearance of ſelf-gratification, ſuch a uniform perſeverance in attending to the welfare of human nature,— that we think it impoſſible for all the faculty, verſed in the different kinds of Mania, to define the nature of Mr. Brothers's madneſs, and to claſs it under its reſpective ſpecies. Suppoſing him an enthuſiaſt, he is equally extraordinary. Such perſons are generally impelled to the moſt ſtrenuous and violent of bodily and mental efforts. Their faculties are in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual agitation. Their paſſions ſeldom find a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uieſcent pauſe from continual excitement.— their object, whatever it may be, ſo powerfully intereſts all their thoughts, that they are never becalmed, by reſt or peace, until nature, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, ſubmits to their ſoothing influence; but, contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o this, Mr. Brothers has appeared to be almoſt diveſted of the common paſſions of nature. Ever calm—ever collected—ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and communicative of ſentiments, dictated by a boundleſs attachment to the peace of man, if an enthuſiaſt, he is, of all enthuſiaſts,—the moſt wonderful.</p>
                  <p>The above obſervations are ſtated merely as evidence of his ſingularity of character. They are not meant to vindicate or diſprove the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028354_0209_0FD8C2E2C673FA40"/>
of his predictions, or his being the choſen reſtorer of the Iſraelites to their kingdom.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the particulars that have tranſpired reſpecting Richard Brothers,—we have to ſtate the following:</p>
                  <p>In 1782, he was a lieutenant on board the Albion, of 64 guns. This ſhip being paid off in 1783, he was reduced to his half-pay, on which he ſupported himſelf until 1789, when ſome religious ſcruples ariſing in his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the taking of oaths, he was prevented receiving his arrears until there were two years due, in 1791. At this period he lodged with a Mrs. Green, in Dartmouth-ſtreet, with whom he had then reſided three years. During this time, he behaved with honeſty, affable temper, and morality of principle.</p>
                  <p>Although he ſuffered the greateſt diſtreſs from not receiving his arrears of pay, amounting to £. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9 by refuſing to take the neceſſary oaths before the Agent, yet he perſiſted in refuſing to be guilty of the crime, which he calls volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſwearing.—The reaſon he ſtated for his refuſal was, that he conſidered ſwearing, every ſix months, as a qualification to receive pay, was unneceſſary, unjuſt, and wicked. Having ſtated what he conſidered the concealed and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ded cruelty of the oath, in addition to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the form, he was told, there was an order of council to take the oath, and that it was not in the power of the admiralty to diſpenſe with it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028354_0210_0FD8C2E3C69C3708"/>He ſoon after ſupported his former objections, and made another requeſt, that he might receive his pay without being obliged to take the oath. On this occaſion, he obſerved, that if the order of council inforced an oath, in any manner or any form whatever, and that the man it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to operate upon, ſwore that he was not forced, but that the oath he took was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act, the reſult of his own free will—would it not, in the ſight of God in heaven, and every man of diſcernment under him on earth, amount to a falſe oath? Theſe reaſons and objections he publiſhed, at the time, in the Public Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſer. He alſo publiſhed the letter he received from the admiralty, ſtating their inſufficient power to diſpenſe with the uſual form of ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Knowing the preſident of the admiralty was a member of the council, he wrote to him: In this, he ſtated, that as men, whether few in number, or the increaſed multitude of a ſenate, were not infallible, they muſt conſequently be ſubject to error. To enforce his aſſertion, he alluded to the deciſion of the privy council, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to a native of Glaſgow, who had his ſhip ſeized in the Weſt-Indies, for what, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, was an undeſigned infringement of the Navigation Act.</p>
                  <p>Such was his averſion to taking the oath, that he endured the want of even a bit of bread. Without conſidering him a Prophet, but merely as a man of purity and piety of principle, he is to be admired for the fortitude with which he endured his ſufferings, rather than obtain relief by committing an act, which appeared to him moſt offenſive to God and man. This conduct
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028354_0211_0FD8C2E9E56E1F70"/>
may be admitted as a proof of his being, at leaſt, ſincere in his religious profeſſions, however he may be the dupe of his own viſionary deluſions.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Green being greatly diſtreſſed for the money due to her from Mr. Brothers, applied to the work houſe board of the United Pariſhes of St. Margaret's and St. John's the Evangeliſt, Weſtminſter. The workhouſe board conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtreſs ſhe muſt ſuffer, as well as what appeared to them, the lamentable ſituation of our Prophet himſelf, reſolved to receive him as a caſual pauper. Agreeably to an order from the board, he was brought about a week after to the work houſe. He entered the room with his hat on, and requeſted they would excuſe his taking it off, as that homage he conſidered only due to the Almighty.</p>
                  <p>At firſt he appeared offended with his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but being deſired to take a chair, his good temper returned. He then took off his hat, and ſaid, he knew when he was treated with that reſpect his character demanded. In this inſtance, he appears to have refuſed taking off his hat, more from ideas of perſonal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than any peculiar homage he meant to reſerve for the Almighty. His examination, containing ſentiments which ſerve to diſplay his temper, and the ſtate of his mind, we inſert it as follows. Pray, ſir, do you know the reaſon of your being brought to this houſe? Indeed I do not. All that I know of the matter is, that I was brought in a very rough manner; but as external objects affect me but little, I acquieſce.</p>
                  <p>I think, ſir, you are in his Majeſty's ſervice?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028354_0212_0FD8C2EEEE6B7410"/>
You are miſtaken, I reſigned two years ſince. I am in the ſervice of a Prince, the greateſt and moſt potent. A Prince, in whoſe ſervices my wages will be certain; but his kingdom is not of this world. What, ſir, was your reaſon for reſigning your commiſſion? Diſguſt; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the military life to be totally repugnant to the duties of chriſtianity, and that I could not conſcientiouſly receive the wages of plunder, bloodſhed, and murder.</p>
                  <p>How did you imagine that you could live without your pay, and that pay, which, from your character and appearance, we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with honor to yourſelf and advantage to your country? Therefore I rejected. I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before, that it was impoſſible for a military man, to take his pay with a ſafe conſcience: I truſt the maſter I ſerve will not ſuffer me to want. I ſhall, in a few days, receive a ſum more than ſufficient to pay this woman's debt, ten times over.</p>
                  <p>Pray, ſir, have you ever been a houſe-keeper? I cannot abſolutely ſay I have not: I once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed for a houſe and was two months in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; but as a very melancholy idea comes acroſs my mind when I think of that period, I hope you will not preſs me further upon the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Certainly we ſhall not; We underſtand, ſir, that you were born in America? I was, in the town of Placenſia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Newfoundland; I have not a friend or relation in this part of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028354_0213_0FD8C2F13357E7D8"/>Where did you lodge before you came to Weſtminſter? In Bridewell precinct.</p>
                  <p>You will excuſe us, ſir, we mean it not as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, but as a neceſſary queſtion; What did you pay weekly? I am above that falſe pride which ſhrinks from enquiry, I will anſwer any queſtion you pleaſe to put to me.</p>
                  <p>I have already endeavoured to live within the bounds of my income—narrow as they were; but you may ſuppoſe, that out of nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally 3<abbr>s.</abbr> but really 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 10<abbr>d.</abbr> per day, I could not afford any ſuperb lodgings.
