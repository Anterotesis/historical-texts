            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>At the requeſt of a great number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, friends to the LIBERTIES of North-America, who were deſirous, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the removal of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts General-Court (unconſtitutionally as they judged) to CAMBRIDGE, that GOD might be acknowledged in that houſe of worſhip at BOSTON, in which our tribes, from the days of our fathers, have annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſought to him for direction, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the choice of his Majeſty's Council.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OLY <hi>David</hi> ſpake theſe words in the name of the Jewiſh nation, looking back to their pious anceſtors, through the ſeveral ſucceſſive periods, in which they had exiſted as a people; and what he ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them is, that they "truſted in GOD". He then records the happy effect conſequent thereupon "Thou didſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them": which deliverance GOD ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wrought out for them in the moſt ſignal manner; "riding in the heavens for their help, and in his excellency on the clouds".</p>
            <p>THE inſpired pſalmiſt reminds the Jewiſh people, in his day, of this piety of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, and the good effect of it, that he might excite in them a becoming concern to make GOD the ſupreme object of their truſt; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging them, in this way, to hope for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, however preſſing the difficulties might be they were under.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011599_0005_0F87795E5457EA90"/>MY text, though thus primarily directed to the Jews to engage their truſt in GOD, that they might obtain deliverance from evil, is yet applicable to other people, under like circumſtances; and may obviouſly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the people of GOD in this land. Perhaps, there are no people, now dwelling on the face of the earth, who may, with greater pertineney, adopt the language of king <hi>David,</hi> and ſay, "our fathers truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thee; they truſted, and thou didſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them".</p>
            <p>I ſhall diſcourſe to the words in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated ſenſe; taking occaſion from them to ſpeak of our pious anceſtors as thoſe who "truſted in GOD"; and then of the good effect of their ſo doing, in the "deliverances GOD wrought out for them". The way will then be clear to point out to us their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity our duty in this day of trouble, and the good effect we may humbly look for from the faithful performance of it.</p>
            <p>IT may with real truth be ſaid of our pious progenitors, that they "truſted in GOD"; that is, that they made GOD the alone ultimate object of their dependence in every time of need. And this they did, not blindly, or groundleſsly, as having no ſolid reaſon for their conduct; but from juſt conceptions of that wiſdom, power, and goodneſs of GOD, which render him a being
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011599_0006_0F87795FF1144138"/>
every way ſutable to be intirely confided in. In this view of the all-ſufficiency of GOD, they ever repaired to him as their ſtrength and refuge, commiting themſelves, and all their concerns, into his hands, and relying on him as their ſupreme help. Senſible of their own inability to provide for and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect themſelves, and of the inability of all creatures without GOD, much more in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to him, they took off their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from every thing elſe, and placed it on him ſupremely and ultimately, as that glorious, and yet gracious, being, who alone was ſufficient to be their guide, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and help, eſpecially in their days of trouble.</p>
            <p>THUS our fathers truſted in GOD; and ſome ſpecial properties of this their truſt, are eminently worthy of notice.</p>
            <p>IT was a truſt accompanied with prayer. This is obſerved, in the verſe immediately following my text, concerning the truſt of the Jewiſh fathers. "They cried unto thee, and were delivered". They prayed, as well as truſted. They not only made GOD their dependance, but commited their caſe to him in humble, fervent ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In like manner, prayer to that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous being who dwelleth on high, was ever
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011599_0007_0F8779611D59A430"/>
a concomitant of that truſt which the pious forefathers of the people of <hi>New England</hi> placed in GOD. They were eminently men of prayer; they prayed always; and their prayers were more abundant, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate and inceſſant, when their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances made it proper to make GOD their ſpecial refuge in any times of more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary difficulty and danger. They now beſieged the throne of GOD, with their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent cries, at once hoping in his mercy, and praying to him for the beſtowment of it.</p>
            <p>THEIR truſt alſo was accompanied with humility, a becoming ſenſe of their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and the infinite condeſcention of GOD, that he ſhould be willing to allow ſuch ſinful undeſerving creatures to place their dependence on him for protection and help. They entertained in their minds exalted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of this favor of the "high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity"; and as low ones of themſelves, in conſideration of their own comparative nothingneſs, much more of their ſinfulneſs, whereby they had expoſed themſelves to the righteous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven.</p>
            <p>THEIR truſt in GOD was likewiſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with profound ſubmiſſion to his alwiſe pleaſure, as to the time, manner, meaſure,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011599_0008_0F877961DE4655F0"/>
and all the circumſtances relative to the good they confided in him for. They were ſo reſigned as to have no will of their own, in oppoſition to GOD's. That was the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their hearts, as well as the language of their lips, in all times of danger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, whether perſonal or public, "let the Lord do to us as ſeemeth good to him". "Father, not as we will, but as thou wilt".</p>
            <p>Again, THEIR truſt in GOD was ſteadily and firmly fixed. Nothing was able to ſhake their confidence in the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and promiſes, no difficulties in the courſe of providence, no diſcouragements, no dangers, no tryals however heavy and ſevere; but in the midſt of all, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all, they had reſt in their ſouls by reſolutely cleaving to GOD as their ultimate hope and refuge. With holy Job they could ſay, "tho' he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him"; Yea, they could triumph in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the 46th Pſalm, "GOD is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, tho' the earth be removed, and the mountains be carried into the depth of the ſeas; tho' the waters thereof roar and are troubled; tho' the mountains ſhake with the ſwelling thereof".</p>
            <p>Yet again, THEIR truſt in GOD was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011599_0009_0F877962A0AF5EE0"/>
with their own endeavours, in the uſe of proper means, in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of needed ſalvation and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: Otherwiſe, inſtead of placing a well grounded confidence in the divine all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, they would have been chargeable with the weakneſs and folly of preſuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the help of heaven. For it ought always to be remembered, tho' it is GOD ultimately who protects, helps, and ſaves; yet, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily does this by the intervention of ſecond cauſes, adapted in their nature to the purpoſe. Our fathers, therefore, that they might not ſubſtitute preſumption, in the room of a well-placed truſt, joined with their dependance on GOD, tho' in abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to it, a due uſe of ſuch means as he has been wont to accompany, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with his bleſſing. Had they, in a time of danger, needleſsly expoſed themſelves, or had they not taken ſuch methods as were wiſe, fit and reaſonable, in order to their own preſervation and ſafety, they would in vain have truſted in GOD; as in this way only they might reaſonably have expected his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, their truſt in GOD was an obediential one. They at once obeyed GOD and depended on him. They made it their care to walk in the way of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011599_0010_0F87796358A109D8"/>
and now they confided in his power, wiſdom, and goodneſs to defend, protect, guide, and do them good. For, as the ſcripture ſays, to which they always paid a ſacred regard, "the Lord is a ſun and ſhield; the Lord will withhold no good thing";— from whom? It follows, "from them that walk uprightly".</p>
            <p>IN fine, their truſt in GOD was exerciſed thro' Jeſus Chriſt. This ſon of GOD's love they eſteemed the divinely appointed medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of communication between GOD and man, and the only one that was ſo. Thro' him they believed GOD was reconcilable to ſinners, and might be a friend to ſupply their wants, to help them under difficulties, to guard them againſt dangers, and to be their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a day of trouble. They accordingly repaired to GOD thro' Jeſus Chriſt, the one mediator between GOD and men, making him their refuge, the ſupreme object of their dependance in regard both of ſoul and body, this world and another. The worthineſs of CHRIST, and not their own, was the reaſon or ground of all they expected in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their truſting in him They knew GOD was ever well pleaſed with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in vertue of his obedience to the death; and that, thro' him, they might with humble confidence rely on him to pity,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011599_0011_0F87796570D40BB8"/>
and help them; to appear their ſavior, and work out deliverance for them. Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made the great object of their truſt, their ſupreme refuge, and all-ſufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector and protector.</p>
            <p>AND they found their account in thus truſting in GOD. For what is ſaid in the latter part of my text, is juſtly applicable to them, "Thou didſt deliver them".</p>
            <p>THE word, "deliverance", carries in it the idea of difficulty and danger, either felt or feared. Our fathers were often expoſed to dangers, and ſometimes called, in the courſe of providence, to ſuffer the tryal of preſſing difficulties. GOD was their refuge in theſe times of trouble, in him they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the effect was, their deliverance out of all their troubles.</p>
            <p>IT was a day of grievous tryal to them, when they were oppreſſed in England, by having put on their necks the eccleſiaſtical yoke of bondage, which was ſorely galling. They were not permitted to worſhip their GOD according to the dictates of conſcience, guided by his word. And unleſs they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the inventions of man, added to the ordinances of GOD, they became liable to fines, confiſcations, impriſonments, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011599_0012_0F8779670F11A2B0"/>
baniſhment. It could ſcarce be believed what they were called to, unleſs they would ſhipwreck faith and a good conſcience, was a rehearſal to be here given of what they ſuffered.—But, as they truſted in GOD, he made way for their deliverance from this tyranny, by bringing them over to this then deſolate land, with CHARTER-RIGHTS, not only ſetting them free from the oppreſſion of church power, but intitling them to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing liberties and privileges, both civil and religious. And very ſignal was the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of heaven on their behalf in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this deliverance. The alwiſe good GOD not only gave them favor with the great men at home, ſo as to encourage their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to this new and unknown part of the world; but made a path for them in the great waters, and bro't them over the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic to theſe then dangerous, becauſe, in that day, untried ſhoars; landing them in ſafety. The deliverance of our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from tyranny and oppreſſion, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them over to this diſtant region, is not unlike his carrying his Iſrael of old thro' the red ſea to the promiſed land of reſt: And that might have been their ſong of praiſe upon this account, "The Lord is our ſtrength and ſong; and he is become our ſalvation. He is our GOD, and we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him an habitation. Who is like unto
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011599_0013_0F8779671A91FC98"/>
thee, O Lord, among the Gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders. Thou in mercy haſt led forth the people whom thou haſt redeemed; thou haſt girded them in thy ſtrength.— Thou haſt bro't them in, and planted them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou haſt made for thee to dwell in, in the ſanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have eſtabliſhed. The Lord ſhall reign forever and ever".</p>
            <p>OUR fathers, after their coming into this land, were at firſt, and for many years, in ſtraits and difficulties, and at times much put to it even for the neceſſaries of life. But as they truſted in GOD, he appeared for their help, and made proviſion for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in ways as extraordinary, as unexpected.</p>
            <p>OUR fathers, after their ſettlement in this land, were ſometimes in great diſtreſs from the ſavages that invaded them, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their deſtruction. And had it not been for marvellous protections afforded to them by GOD almighty, they muſt have periſhed by the hands of theſe enemies. They might with great propriety have adopted thoſe words of the Pſalmiſt, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011599_0014_0F877967D9D6BF00"/>
us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us.—Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. —Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth".</p>
            <p>OUR fathers, even after they had, in a good meaſure, ſubdued this wilderneſs-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, enlarging their borders, increaſing in numbers, and in a plenty of the comforts of life, and, at the ſame time, adding ſtrength and glory to the Britiſh crown, were hardly dealt with by thoſe who had the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their hands. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following ſummary of the tyrannical op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe days will not be eſteemed a miſrepreſentation, as it is taken from the hiſtory of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, wrote by his honor, our preſent commander in chief. "Nero (pag. 355.) concealed his tyrannical diſpoſition more years than Sir Edmund, and his creatures, did months. It was not long before the caſe of ſome, who apprehended themſelves oppreſſed, came under conſideration; one of the Council told them, that they muſt not think the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Engliſhmen would follow them to the end of the world. This gave an alarm thro' the government.—One of the firſt acts of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the reſtraint of the preſs. Randolph [that tool of power] was the licenſer—A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon marriages was more grievous. None were allowed to marry, except they entered into bonds, with ſureties to the Governor, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited in caſe there ſhould afterwards appear to have been any lawful impediment.—Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund conſidered the congregational miniſters as meer laymen. Randolph wrote to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of London, "I preſs for able and ſober miniſters, and we will contribute largely to their maintainance; but one thing will mainly help, when no marriages ſhall hereafter be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed lawful, but ſuch as are made by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the church of England.—The people (356, 537.) were menaced, that their meeting-houſes ſhould be taken from them, and that public worſhip in the congregational way ſhould not be tolerated.—Several churches had agreed to ſet apart days of thankſgiving for his Majeſty's declaration for liberty of conſcience. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor forbad them.—He told them, they ſhould meet at their peril, and that he ſhould ſend ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to guard their meeting-houſes.—Swearing by the book (pag. 358.) which had never been practiſed, was now introduced; and ſuch as ſcrupled it were fined and impriſoned.—The fees to all officers were exorbitant. Fifty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings [money of that day] was the common ſee for probate of a will. The Governor was ſupreme ordinary, and acted by himſelf.—It was a great burden upon widows and children, who lived remote, to be obliged to come to Boſton for every part of buſineſs relative to the ſettlement of eſtates. The fees of all other officers were complained of as oppreſſive. THE HARPIES THEMSELVES QUARRELLED ABOUT THEIR SHARE OF THE PREY.— But the greateſt profit (pag. 359) aroſe from patents for lands. The Charter being vacated, the people were told that their titles to their eſtates were of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.—It was made public, that all who would acknowledge the inſufficiency of their title, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the former government, by petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for new patents, ſhould be quieted upon reaſonable terms.—In the complaint to King James, it is alledged, that the fees of ſome amounted to Fifty Pounds.—Men's titles were not queſtioned all at once. Had this been the caſe, according to the computation then made, all the perſonal eſtate in the colony would not have paid the charge of the patents.—The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor (pag. 361) with four or five of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil laid what taxes they thought proper. This the people complained of as their greateſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They thought themſelves INTITLED TO THE LIBERTIES AND IMMUNITIES OF FREE AND NATURAL BORN ENGLISH SUBJECTS, and conſequently that NO MONIES OUGHT TO BE RAISED FROM THEM BUT BY THEIR RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRESENTATIVES".</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and ſuch like in general, were the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our fathers, under the adminiſtration of Sir Edmund, "who knew too well the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his maſter to give him any concern about the complaints preferred againſt him": But they were the occaſion of a revolution here about the ſame time, the revolution took place in England; a general account only of which would take up more room than can be here ſpared.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only ſubjoin that obſervable remark of our honourable commander in chief, in a note at the bottom of page 391. "Of all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the late government [Sir Edmund's] Mr. DUDLEY felt moſt of the people's reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Oppreſſion is leſs grievous from a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than one of our own country". He further ſays, in the words of Danforth to I. Mather, "Mr. Dudley is, in a peculiar manner, the object of the people's diſpleaſure —They deeply reſent his correſpondence with that WICKED RANDOLPH for overturning the government.</p>

were trampled upon, and arbitrary methods taken to diſpoſe of their lands, and make them ſlaves to thoſe who had it in view to tyranize over them. But, as they truſted in GOD, he made bare his arm for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. This he did by effecting a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

line of the Regal ſucceſſion, ſettling it on her Electoral Highneſs, the Princeſs SOPHIA <note n="†" place="bottom">SOPHIA was daughter of ELISABETH, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King James the firſt. She married COUNT PALATINE of the Rhine; and in her day the whole Palatinate (who were PROTES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANTS) ſuffered greatly, in conſequence of the exerciſe of catholic tyranny. It was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expected her own father would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her needed help; but ſhe had no aſſiſtance from him. The famous Dr. Preſton, maſter of Emanuel-College in Cambridge, and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain in ordinary to his then Majeſty King James, in a Sermon, preached in his hearing, has theſe obſervable words (pag. 52), directed to thoſe who had great power, and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doing good, "Let them conſider that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpeech of Mordacai to Eſther, (chap. 4. v. 24.) <hi>If thou hold thy tongue at this time, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall appear to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy houſe ſhall periſh.</hi> The meaning is this; then there was an opportunity of doing good to the church. Therefore, ſaith he, if thou do not do it, thou and thy houſe ſhall periſh. For if any be an impediment, nay, if any do not do their beſt, <hi>I pronounce this, in the name of the the moſt true GOD, that ſhall make it good ſooner or later, they and their houſes ſhall periſh, and be as the ſtraw that we ſpake of, that oppreſſeth the coal of fire</hi>". Some, perhaps, may look upon this as a prophetic ſpeech, and remarkably fulfilled, when they are told, that Charles the Firſt, King James's Son, was awfully beheaded; and that James the Second, his Grandſon, abdicated the throne, upon which, after the death of Queen Ann, George the Firſt was ſeated, in whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily the ſucceſſion has run on to this day.</note>

            <p>THE religious and civil liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, both of the mother-country and the American colonies, were nearly and cloſely connected with this ſignal interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that GOD, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, whoſe kingdom is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom, and whoſe dominion ruleth over all. Had it not been for this marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous appearance of divine providence, in favor of the people in Old, as well as in New-England, they would have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, not by law, but by ſovereign will, abſolute pleaſure; that is, in plain words, they would, inſtead of being free-men, have been made abject ſlaves. That was the language of our pious fathers, both at home and in this country, upon this great and never to be forgotten deliverance, "The Lord is our ſtrength and refuge, our ſhield and defence. The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad. Aſcribe
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011599_0020_0F87796D83F3C3B8"/>
ye greatneſs to our GOD. He is the rock. His work is perfect. A GOD of truth, and without iniquity; juſt and right is he".</p>
            <p>IN a word, our fathers, as they truſted in GOD, were favored with many deliverances from great dangers, and heavily preſſing difficulties; and in a manner, ſometimes, peculiarly ſtriking and ſurprizing. Perhaps it cannot be ſaid of any deliverances, wrought out for any people, thoſe excepted which GOD wrought out for his Iſrael of old, that they were more ſignally great and glorious than thoſe, in which he made his arm bare for the ſalvation of our fathers in this land. "He made them to go forth like ſheep, and guided them in the wilderneſs like a flock; and he led them on ſafely, and brought them to the place his right-hand had purchaſed for them. He caſt out the heathen before them, and divided them an inheritance as it were by line: Yea, he drove out the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then with his hand, and planted them; he afflicted the people and caſt them out. For they got not this land in poſſeſſion with their own ſword, neither did their own arm ſave them, but the right-hand and arm of GOD, and the light of his countenance, becauſe he had a favor for them".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011599_0021_0F87796DD9586B28"/>THUS we have ſeen, that our forefathers "truſted in GOD", and that GOD, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this their piety towards him, wrought out deliverance for them.</p>
            <p>THE way is now prepared, according to the method at firſt laid out, to point out to us their poſterity our duty in this day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the good effect we may humbly look for from the faithful performance of it.</p>
            <p>IT is our lot, my hearers, to live in a time when the face of providence is angry and threatning. Our mother-country is in a ſtate of great perplexity, difficulty, and confuſion. If we may give credit to the accounts we have from home, complaints run high, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs and diſcontent are grown general, inſomuch that, if GOD does not mercifully interpoſe, no one knows what may be the conſequence. And it is with us, in theſe American lands, a day of darkneſs, a day wherein we are called to put on ſackcloth. We are out of favor with our ſovereign, and moſt of thoſe who ſtand round his throne; tho' it is an alleviation of our unhappineſs, that their diſpleaſure is owing to injurious repreſentations, repeatedly and wickedly made to our diſadvantage.—The reſtraints we are under as to the exerciſe of ſome of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011599_0022_0F87796F85332D40"/>
our rights and privileges are grievous; and the more ſo, as they were the purchaſe of our fathers at the riſque of every thing near and dear to them, their lives not excepted.— In return for the part we chearfully bore in the late gloriouſly ſucceſsful war, which emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied our purſes, brought upon us an heavy debt, and occaſioned a much greater loſs of our young men, the flower and glory of the country, than was ever known before; I ſay, in return for this expence of blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from which we expected to reap great benefit, new duties have been impoſed on us, and without any to repreſent our perſons in parliament, or to act in our behalf; new officers have been appointed, and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train of them too, with enormous ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for this part of the world, and to be paid out of our pockets; in conſequence of which our trade was never before ſo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with difficulties, never ſo loaded with charges, and never ſo obſtructed in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.—And we have, in a meaſure, been treated as tho' we were rebels; otherwiſe, what occaſion could there be for this metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis to be, as it were, garriſon'd with the King's troops, to the infinite hurt of the morals of its inhabitants, and to their being in a variety of ways inſulted, injured, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed? But it would be needleſs to enlarge in a detail of hardſhips we are all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011599_0023_0F87797031B76AC0"/>
to, from what we have already felt, or are now groaning under: Nor ſhall I incur the charge of going out of my line, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon a political conſideration of what may be thought the true ſource of thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which make the preſent, a day of trouble. Tis certainly the truth of fact, however the right of taxation be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we are in a perplext ſituation.</p>
            <p>AND our duty is, after the example of our Fathers, in like circumſtances, to "truſt in GOD". He only is the ultimate object of dependance. On him alone can we ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely for the ſalvation our caſe calls for In vain will it be to look to the hills and to the mountains, to ſecond cauſes of whatever kind or nature; for they are nothing, and can affect nothing, without him, to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of him, much leſs in oppoſition to him. The ſcriptures are accordingly filled with calls to truſt in GOD, eſpecially in a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And we are there told, that "it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to truſt in the Lord than to put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in man"; that "it is better to truſt in the Lord than to put confidence in Princes". Yea, we are there warned againſt placing our confidence in any being below the one true and living GOD, "the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength". Yea, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we have ſuch a ſolemn denunciation as
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011599_0024_0F877970DF155A08"/>
that, "curſed is the man who truſteth in man, who maketh fleſh his arm", that is, in oppoſition to GOD, without a becoming ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the will and pleaſure of the almighty Ruler of the world.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore our duty, nor can we do any thing better, under our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, than to put our truſt in GOD. And if we do this with humble reverence; with all due ſubmiſſion to the ſovereign alwiſe, dominion of providence; and in the uſe of ſuch means as are reaſonable and juſt, and will be ſo accounted by "the righteous LORD who loveth righteouſneſs", we may hope to be delivered out of all our troubles. This was the good effect conſequent upon our father's truſting in GOD. "They truſted", and GOD "delivered them". And he is the ſame almighty good GOD now, that he was in their day. "His arm is not ſhortned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave".</p>
            <p>THE grounds upon which we may hope for deliverance, if we truſt in GOD, are ſuch as render all fear of being either aſhamed or diſappointed, needleſs and unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>GOD has abundantly declared, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation he has made of his purpoſes, that he will be the deliverer of thoſe that ſutably
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011599_0025_0F877971A2748E80"/>
repair to him as their ſupreme refuge, and all-ſufficient help. The texts to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are ſcattered all over the bible. Hence the prayer of David, recorded in Pſal. 17.7.—"O thou that ſaveſt, by thy right hand, them that put their truſt in thee,—hide me under the ſhadow of thy wings from the wicked that oppreſs me, from my deadly enemies who compaſs me about: they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in their own fat; with their mouths they ſpeak proudly.—Ariſe, O Lord, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my ſoul from the wicked". Hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe words in the 33. Pſal. v. 20. "Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that hope in his mercy, to deliver their ſoul from death. Our ſoul waiteth for the Lord: He is our help and ſhield. Our heart ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in him, becauſe we have truſted in his holy name. Let thy mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in thee. In like manner, it is ſaid Pſal. 37. "The ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the righteous is of the Lord: he is their ſtrength in the time of trouble. And the Lord ſhall help them and deliver them; he ſhall deliver them from the wicked, and ſave them, becauſe they truſt him".</p>
            <p>AND this GOD that has engaged delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to thoſe who ſutably depend on him for it, is abundantly able to fulfill his word and promiſe. For he is infinite in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011599_0026_0F8779725E0FE088"/>
of his nature; in wiſdom, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, power, faithfulneſs, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. No obſtacles are the leaſt hindrance to him. All nature is at his command, all ſecond cauſes, whether phyſical, or moral; and he can make juſt what uſe of them he pleaſes in accompliſhing his own purpoſes. He can bring to nought the moſt deep laid counſels; overruling them to his own glory, and the good of thoſe againſt whom they are deſigned. The hearts of men, the greateſt as well as the leaſt, are known to him, and abſolutely under his controul; and he can, whenever he pleaſes, "turn them even as the rivers of waters are turned". No devices of men, whether high or low, can take effect in contradiction to his alwiſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. There are a thouſand ways in which he can defeat them; yea, he can employ the worſt and moſt powerful evil deviſers, as inſtruments to confound their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and bring the contrary to what they intended into effect. In ſhort, all the wiſdom and power of heaven and earth, of all angels and all men, are under the government of GOD; and he can make uſe of it all, ſhould he think fit to employ their inſtrumentality, in working out ſalvation for his people that truly truſt in him: Yea, he could invert the courſe of nature, ſtop the ſun in its courſe, commiſſion the ſtars to fight, and interpoſe
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011599_0027_0F877973EEB03988"/>
by ſtupendous ſigns in heaven, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on earth, for their defence, protection and deliverance. Thus he has done, and he may do the ſame again. There is no with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding GOD. He can with infinite eaſe, in oppoſition to earth and hell, defend and ſave thoſe that make him their ſtrength and refuge.</p>
            <p>LET us then, my brethren, caſt all our care and fear on the Lord. Let us make GOD the ultimate object of our dependance; looking above all ſecond cauſes; not "truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils", and can do nothing but in ſubſerviency to the governing wiſdom of that providence which extends over all human affairs.</p>
            <p>ONLY, let me remind you of one thing, which ought never to be forgotten, and that is; that our truſt in GOD muſt be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with repentance, evidencing its genuine reality by an amendment of our doings which have not been right, and obedience to the voice of the Lord. We ſhall only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, if we pretend to truſt in GOD, while we go on in our ſins, and refuſe to be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. A pious truſt in GOD, and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in ſin, are utterly inconſiſtent with each other. We cannot in a truly religious way, make GOD our refuge, while we retain a
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011599_0028_0F8779751A38B520"/>
love to our ſins, and will not be prevailed on to part with them.</p>
            <p>AND here you will permit me to ſay, our ſins are the worſt enemies we have. They are, properly ſpeaking, the true moral cauſe of all that we now ſuffer, or have reaſon to fear. We may aſcribe the ill ſtate of our affairs to this or the other ſecond cauſe. We may aſcribe it to miſrepreſentations ſent to the mother-country by thoſe, in this, who ſeek their own, not the welfare of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; We may aſcribe it to the pride, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, the hatred of men at home, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with dignity and honor; we may aſcribe it to a malignant ſpirit in ſome, who cannot be eaſie without having the purſes of the colonies ſubjected to their arbitrary pleaſure. But if any ſhould ſuppoſe our difficulties may, in any meaſure, be owing to theſe, or ſuch like cauſes, it muſt be ſaid, they are only ſecondary ones, ſuperintended and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the great Ruler of the world. Men can do nothing without GOD. And whatever difficulties, hardſhips, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they may be the occaſion of, they are only inſtruments in the hands of providence. GOD ultimately is the inflicter of theſe evils; and he would neither inflict, or permit the infliction of them, but on account of the ſins of thoſe who ſuffer by them. Our ſins
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011599_0029_0F877975809D1EA8"/>
therefore, in the laſt reſult, are the alone cauſe of whatever troubles we groan under. Inſtead therefore of reflecting blame on GOD, we ſhould blame ourſelves; and in truth, we have much more reaſon to blame our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for our ſins, than to blame even the ſecondary cauſes of our ſuffering.</p>
            <p>IF then we would truſt in GOD, ſo as to ſecure his favor, and obtain the deliverance we need, we muſt make him our refuge in the way of repentance and reformation; humbling ourſelves in a ſenſe of our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied offences committed againſt the majeſty of heaven, and reſolving, in the ſtrength of divine grace, that wherein we have done ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity we will do ſo no more. If we would hope, upon juſt grounds, to be a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to have continued to us thoſe inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable rights and liberties that have been tranſmitted to us from our fathers, we muſt be imitators of their virtue, truſt in GOD in a way of repentance, and a due care to live in the world piouſly, righteouſly, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the grace of GOD, in the goſpel, has taught us to do, and is ready to enable us to do. If we are but once effectually wrought upon to renounce our ſins, and walk in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, ordering our converſation, not by fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of GOD, we may humbly hope, that GOD will be for
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011599_0030_0F877977166DD628"/>
us; and if GOD be for us, we need not fear who are againſt us. No power whatever, in this caſe, ſhall do us any real harm. The things that, to human appearance, are againſt us ſhall in the end turn out to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. GOD can make the moſt adverſe ſtate of affairs work out our beſt good; and he will certainly do it, if we love him with all our hearts, and ſerve him with all our might, conforming ourſelves to the directions of his word. While we truſt in the perfections of almighty GOD, in the way of doing our duty to him, we need not fear, however dark and melancholly the face of providence may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the preſent. For GOD will be our help. And "happy are they who have the GOD of Jacob for their help, whoſe hope is in the Lord their GOD". While we thus ſet our hope in him, we may triumph and ſing, "the Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies, came upon me to eat up my fleſh, they ſtumbled and fell. Though an hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, my heart ſhall not fear; though they ſhould riſe againſt me, in this will I be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p>I may now, with pertinency, put you upon recollecting, that this is the day, on the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011599_0031_0F87797799392B28"/>
yearly return of which we were wont to take to ourſelves words, and ſay, "we were glad when they ſaid unto us, let us go into the houſe of the Lord. Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O BOSTON. BOSTON is as a city compact together, whither the tribes, throughout the province, by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, the tribes of the Lord, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give thanks to the name of the Lord", preparatory to the exerciſe of one of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant CHARTER-RIGHTS, the ELECTION of his MAJESTY'S COUNCIL.</p>
            <p>The removal of the GENERAL COURT, from this its ancient and conſtitutional ſeat, to tranſact the buſineſs of this day, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily excites in our breaſts thoſe ſenſations of grief which obſtruct the motions of that joy, which, upon this occaſion, uſed to be pure and unalloyed. And our grief is heightned from the conſideration, that this change of place took riſe from thoſe, beyond the atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, who, as we have reaſon to think, wiſh not well to our Sion. But though we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this obſtacle which has been thrown in the way of our joy, we bow the knee in humble grateful acknowledgments to the ſupreme Ruler of the world, that we are not deprived of our RIGHT, in virtue of the ROYAL GRANT, to chuſe councellers from among ourſelves, whatever repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011599_0032_0F87797938ED0368"/>
have been made to thoſe in power, at Home, tending to wreſt from us this inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable right. And it is, I doubt not, the ſincere, ardent prayer of this whole aſſembly, in union with our brethren at Cambridge, that his majeſty's council may this day be filled with men of wiſdom and underſtanding; men of integrity and uprightneſs; men of ability, and well knowing in the times; men that fear GOD, honour the King, and are zealouſly diſpoſed to ſeek the welfare of this people. We have, without controverſie, a ſufficiency of ſuch men in the province. And the fault will lie with thoſe who are entruſted with the elections of this day, or with him who has a negative on their choice, if we have not the beſt men in the country for our councellers, men well acquainted with the conſtitution, laws, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veleges, and intereſts of this people; men of fidelity to their King and country; men of a public ſpirit, who are above acting under the influence of narrow and ſelfiſh principles; men of inflexible juſtice, and undaunted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, who will dare not to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to unrighteous acts, or miſtaken nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; men who will diſdain in their hearts to accomodate their conduct, in a ſervile manner, either to their electors, or him who can prevent their political exiſtence; in fine,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011599_0033_0F877979DF6FDDE8"/>
men who will ſteadily, and in a uniform courſe, act up to their character, ſupport the honor of their ſtations, and approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves invariably faithful in their endeavours to advance the common weal.</p>
            <p>THESE are the men that may be called to ſit at the council-board; and we hope in that alwiſe almighty being, who preſides over the affairs of the children of men, ſo to govern the views, and direct the thoughts, of the electors this day, as that they may be led into the choice of ſuch coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellers as he ſhall own, and ſucceed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the beſt intereſt of this people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under their preſent difficulties and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes.</p>
            <p>AND when the ſeveral branches of the legiſlature ſhall proceed upon the affairs of the public, we pray GOD they may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly diſpoſed and enabled to act as thoſe, who have upon their minds a juſt ſenſe of the vaſt importance of the truſt that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them.</p>
            <p>AND let it not be thought unſeaſonable, no one preſent will think it ſo, if I ſhould ſay, that it may reaſonably be expected of our executive courts, that they act with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and impartiality, in the diſtribution of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011599_0034_0F87797AAEB79840"/>
juſtice. If there ſhould have been, in any meaſure, a failure in this reſpect, ſince the King's troops were ſtationed in this town, from whatever cauſe, it is now hoped that "juſtice and judgment will run down our ſtreets as a ſtream": And I the rather mention this, becauſe the opened earth in one of our ſtreets, in the month of march laſt, received the ſtreaming blood of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlaughtered, and wounded innocents. So ſhocking a tragady was never before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this part of the world; and GOD forbid it ſhould ever be again! Who the ſheders of this blood were may poſſibly appear, upon the tryal of thoſe who are under confinement, as being ſuppoſed to be the guilty perſons. We wiſh them as fair and equal a tryal as they themſelves can deſire. And ſhould they all, or any of them, be found guilty, though their ſin be as "ſcarlet, and red like crimſon", we heartily wiſh their repentance, that, of the mercy of GOD in Jeſus Chriſt, they may eſcape the ſecond death; though our eye is reſtrained from pitying them ſo as to wiſh their deliverance from the firſt death. For the ſupreme legiſlator has ſaid, "whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed"—"life ſhall go for life"—"No

ſatisfaction ſhall be taken for the life of a murderer—He ſhall ſurely be put to death.</p>
            <p>SOME have whiſpered a ſuſpicion, as though a reprieve from death would be granted, ſhould the guilt of blood be faſtned upon ſome who are ſuppoſed to have been actors in this horrid wickedneſs—But it is an high indignity offered to him, who has the power of giving a reprieve, ſo much as to ſuſpect he would do it in the caſe of BLOOD GUILTINESS, clearly proved upon any, in conſequence of a fair and impartial tryal. Surely, he would not counter-act the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law both of GOD and man. Surely, he would not ſuffer the Town and Land, to lie under the defilement of blood! Surely, he would not make himſelf a partaker in the guilt of murder, by putting a ſtop to the ſhedding of their blood, who have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly ſpilt the blood of others! All ſuch ſuſpicions ſhould be ſuppreſſed. They are virtually a ſcandalous reproach reflected on him, of whoſe integrity, and regard to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice, we ſhould entertain a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable opinion.</p>
            <p>I HAVE no need, my hearers, to be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with you to approve yourſelves loyal to our rightful and lawful KING GEORGE the

Third, now ſetting on the Britiſh throne. For it is undoubtedly the truth of fact, that his Majeſty has no ſubjects, in any part of his extended dominions, that would more readily venture their lives and fortunes in defence of his perſon, the ſucceſſion in his royal houſe, and his government within the bounds of the engliſh conſtitution, than we in the MASSACHUSETS-PROVINCE, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the baſe and falſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which have occaſioned his Majeſty, and many of his miniſters, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with a jealous and angry eye. GOD forgive thoſe lovers of themſelves in oppoſition to their King and country, who, from ſelfiſh views, have repreſented this people as diſpoſed to treaſon and rebellion. Let us, my brethren, notwithſtanding the malice of our enemies, and their unwearied attempts, to impreſs the mind of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, by communications to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with an ill opinion of us; let us, I ſay, go on, as we have hitherto conſtantly done, to "make ſupplications, prayers, interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with giving of thanks", for the King as ſupreme, and for all in authority under him", that by means of their wiſe, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and juſt adminiſtrations in government, "we may lead quiet and peceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011599_0037_0F87797CDA4C3550"/>AND may we all ſo conduct in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtations and relations we ſuſtain in life, as that we may honour GOD, ſerve our generation according to his will, and finally be accounted worthy of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into that kingdom that is above, where we ſhall dwell in love and peace, without ſin or ſorrow, through the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ending ages of a bleſſed eternity.</p>
            <p>Now to the "bleſſed and only poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, of whom, and through whom, and to whom, are all things, be honor and power everlaſting". AMEN.</p>
