            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It has long been an opinion among chemists and natural historians, that salt petre is a natural production. It has been said to be found in large quantities on the surface of the earth in Persia, India and China, where it is said to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part a coldness to the atmosphere; but some late enquiries give us reason to suspect that the whole of these accounts are without foundation.

All the Salt Petre which is imported from the East-Indies is made by art. I would not be understood to mean, that this salt is never found in a native state. It is sometimes found adhering to large rocks. It is likewise found in a native state under the arches of bridges, and in vaults, or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014585_0008_0F94332625546580"/>

               <p>The method of extracting the Salt Petre is nearly the same, whatever ingredients we may employ for making it. The ingredients are put into tubs, barrels or hogsheads, perforated at their bottoms. Rain, river, or very pure spring water is poured upon them, which gradually dissolves all the salt they contain, and conveys it drop by drop into vessels provided to receive it. The Nitre in this state con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a large quantity of common Salt.

These are taken out with a ladle as fast as they form, and thrown into a large basket, which stands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the vessel in which the liquor is boiling—when no more chrystals of common Salt can be found, and when a pellicle begins to be formed on the surface of the liquor, it is taken off the fire, and emptied into a number of cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or earthen pans, in a cellar, in which it soon shoots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to chrystals of salt petre.

But it may be observed here, that we have the greatest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to doubt the gentleman's rule of boiling down all his liquors, so as to leave exactly an eighth part, before he set it to chrystalize.—It is natural to suppose that the earths under buildings are very various as to the quantity of nitre they contain, some being plentifully charged, whilst others are but lightly impregnated th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Although I purpose to avoid entering into an abstruse definition of Salt Petre, yet it will be proper just to observe, that this substance is rationally supposed to be compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of three different materials, (viz) a nitrous acid, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile animal salt, and these two fixed, blended together and petrified by a vegitable or mineral alkaline salt, and thus form what we commonly call Salt Petre.—This short definition of salt-petre will serve to shew the propriety of Mr. Glauber's collection of materials recommended in the forgoing processes; and it is ardently to be wished, that every gentleman who heartily desires the salvation and prosperity of America, would exert himself in encouraging and forwarding such kind of collections as soon as may be throughout this Colony.</p>
            <p>But the question will very naturally arise, to know from whence the earths made use of in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>regoing process, could derive either their volatile, annimal, or their vegitable alkaline salts.—It is no ways unnatural to suppose that as those earths had imbibed their nitrous qualities from the air which had found its way to their surfaces, so they might also receive from the same air a sufficient quantity of animal volatile salts, which had been exhaled from animal carcases and excrements, always putrifying on the surface of the earth. As to the vegitable alkaline salt, which is said to be the basis of Salt Petre, I should not have expected a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency from the unchanged filtering tub of ashes, which was all the alkaline that gentleman made use of. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, experiments may be very easily tried, to determine this matter, by mixing a small quantity of lime or ashes with a tub of the above earth, before it is lixiviated, and then lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iviating the same qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
