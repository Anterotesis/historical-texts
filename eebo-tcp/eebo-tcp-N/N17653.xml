            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE laſt time I had the pleaſure of being in your company, you did me the honour to requeſt my opinion upon the AMUSEMENTS and PUNISHMENTS which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for ſchools. The ſubjects are of a very oppoſite nature, but I ſhall endeavour to comply with your wiſhes, by ſending you a few thoughts upon each of them. I am ſure you will not reject my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons becauſe they are contrary to received practices, for I know that you are accuſtomed to think for yourſelf, and that every propoſition that has for its objects the intereſts of humanity and your country, will he treated by you with attention and candor.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with the ſubject of AMUSEMENTS. Monteſquieu informs us that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the laſt day of the life of Epaminondas, were the ſame as his amuſements in his youth. Herein we have an epitome of the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of education. The amuſements of Epaminondas were of a military nature; but as the profeſſion of arms is the buſineſs of only a ſmall part of mankind, and happily much leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the United States than in ancient Greece, I would propoſe that the amuſements of our youth, at ſchool, ſhould conſiſt of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes as will be moſt ſubſervient to their future employments in life. Theſe are; 1. agriculture; 3. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical occupations; and 3. the buſineſs of the learned profeſſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a variety in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of agriculture which may readily be ſuited to the genius, taſte, and ſtrength of young people. An experiment has been made of the efficacy of theſe employments, as amuſements, in the Methodiſt Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at Abington, in Maryland; and, I have been informed, with the happieſt effects. A large lot is divided between the ſcholars, and premiums are adjudged to thoſe of them who produce the moſt vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables from their grounds, or who keep them in the beſt order.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the employments of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture cannot afford amuſement at all ſeaſons of the year, or in cities,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:022866_0002_0FBA9A5A2B4BA610"/>
I would propoſe, that children ſhould be allured to ſeek amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſuch of the mechanical arts as are ſuited to their ſtrength and capacities. Where is the boy who does not delight in the uſe of a hammer—a chiſſel—or a ſaw? and who has not enjoyed a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pleaſure in his youth, in conſtructing a miniature houſe? How amuſing are the machines which are employed in the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of cloathing of all kinds! and how full of various entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the mixtures which take place in the chemical arts! each of theſe might be contrived upon ſuch a ſcale, as not only to amuſe young people, but to afford a profit to their parents or maſters. The Moravians, at Bethlehem in our ſtate, have proved that this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not a chimerical one. All the amuſements of their children are derived from their performing the ſubordinate parts of ſeveral of the mechanical arts; and a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable portion of the wealth of that worthy and happy ſociety is derived from the labour of their little hands.—</p>
            <p>If, in theſe amuſements, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal ſhould be made to that ſpirit of competition which is ſo common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong young people, it would be the means of producing more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the children, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to all who are connected with them. The wealth of thoſe manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing towns in England, which employ the children of poor people, is a proof of what might be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from connecting amuſement and labour together, in all our ſchools. The product from the labour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this way, from all the ſchools in the United States, would amount to a ſum which would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exceed calculation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To train the youth who are intended for the learned profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or for merchandize, to the duties of their future employments, by means of uſeful amuſements, which are <hi>related</hi> to thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will be impracticable; but their amuſements may be derived from cultivating a ſpot of ground; for where is the lawyer, the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, the divine, or the merchant, who has not indulged or felt a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſome part of his life, for rural improvements?——Indeed I conceive the ſeeds of knowledge in agriculture will be moſt productive, when they are planted in the minds of this claſs of ſcholars.</p>
            <p>I have only to add under this head, that the common amuſements of children have no connection with their future occupations. Many of them injure their clothes, ſome of them waſte their ſtrength, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their health, and all of them prove, more or leſs, the means of producing noiſe, or of exciting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry paſſions, both of which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to beget vulgar manners. The Methodiſts have wiſely baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every ſpecies of play from their college. Even the healthy and pleaſurable exerciſe of ſwimming, is not permitted to their ſcholars, except in the preſence of one of their maſters.</p>
            <p>Do not think me too ſtrict if I here exclude <hi>gunning</hi> from among the amuſements of young men. My objections to it are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It hardens the heart, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting unneceſſary pain and death upon animals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is unneceſſary in civilized ſociety, where animal food may be obtained from domeſtic animals, with greater facility.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It conſumes a great deal of time, and thus creates habits of idleneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It frequently leads young men into low, and bad company.</p>
            <p n="5">5. By impoſing long abſtinence
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:022866_0003_0FBA9A5BACEE0788"/>
from food, it leads to intemperance in eating, which naturally leads to intemperance in drinking.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It expoſes to fevers, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents. The news-papers are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally filled with melancholy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the latter, and every phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt have met with frequent and dangerous inſtances of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in the courſe of his practice.</p>
            <p>I know the early uſe of a gun is recommended in our country, to teach our young men the uſe of fire-arms, and thereby to prepare them for war and battle. But why ſhould we inſpire our youth, by ſuch exerciſes, with hoſtile ideas towards their fellow creatures?— Let us rather inſtill into their minds ſentiments of univerſal benevolence to men of all nations and colours. Wars originate in error and vice. Let us eradicate theſe, by proper modes of education, and wars will ceaſe to be neceſſary in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The divine author and lover of peace "will then ſuffer no man to do us wrong; yea he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove kings for our ſake, ſaying, touch not my anointed and do my people no harm." Should the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with whom war is a trade, approach our coaſts, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from us, as Satan did from our Saviour, when he came to aſſault him; and for the ſame reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will 'find nothing in us' congenial to their malignant diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; for the flames of war can be ſpread from one nation to another, only by the conducting mediums of vice and error.</p>
            <p>I have hinted at the injury which is done to the health of young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by ſome of their amuſements; but there is a practice common in all our ſchools, which does more harm to their bodies than all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements that can be named, and that is, obliging them to ſit too long in <hi>one place,</hi> or crowding too many of them together <hi>in one room.</hi> By means of the former, the growth and ſhape of the body have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; and by means of the latter, the ſeeds of fevers have often been engendered in ſchools. In the courſe of my buſineſs, I have been called to many hundred children who have been ſeized with indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in ſchool, which evidently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the action of morbid ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia, produced by the confined breath and perſpiration of too great a number of children in one room. To obviate theſe evils, children ſhould be permitted, after they have ſaid their leſſons, to amuſe themſelves in the open air, in ſome of the uſeful and agreeable exerciſes which have been mentioned. Their minds will be ſtrengthened, as well as their bodies relieved by them. To oblige a ſprightly boy to ſit <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> hours in a day, with his little arms pinioned to his ſides, and his neck unnaturally bent towards his book; and for <hi>no crime!</hi>—what cruelty and folly are manifeſted, by ſuch an abſurd mode of inſtructing or governing young people!</p>
            <p>I come next to ſay a few words upon the ſubject of PUNISHMENTS which are proper in ſchools.</p>
            <p>In barbarous ages every thing partook of the complexion of the times. Civil, eccleſiaſtical, military, and domeſtic puniſhments were all of a cruel nature. With the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of reaſon and chriſtianity, puniſhments of all kinds have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſs ſevere. Solitude and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour are now ſubſtituted in many countries, with ſucceſs, in the room of the whipping-poſt and the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.—The innocent infirmities of human nature are no longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and puniſhed by the church. Diſcipline, conſiſting in the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of officers, has leſſened the ſuppoſed neceſſity of military exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; and huſbands—fathers—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022866_0004_0FBA9A5D4CC8CBF0"/>
and maſters now bluſh at the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the times, when wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſervants, were govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by force. But unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this ſpirit of humanity and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation has not reached our ſchools. The rod is yet the principal inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of governing them, and a ſchool-maſter remains the only deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot now known in free countries. Perhaps it is becauſe the little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their arbitrary and caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power have not been in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to complain. I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour therefore to plead their cauſe, and to prove that corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (except to children under four or five years of age) are never neceſſary, and always hurtful, in ſchools.—The following arguments I hope will be ſufficient to eſtabliſh this propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Children are ſeldom ſent to ſchool before they are capable of feeling the force of rational or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation. They may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be deterred from committing offences, by motives leſs diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the fear of corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By correcting children for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and negligence in ſchool, their ideas of <hi>improper</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> actions are confounded, and hence the moral faculty becomes weakned in after life. It would not be more cruel or abſurd to inflict the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whipping-poſt upon a man, for not dreſſing faſhionably or neatly, than it is to ferule a boy for blotting his copy-book, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpelling a word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the natural affection of a parent is ſometimes inſufficient, to reſtrain the violent effects of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den guſt of anger upon a child, how dangerous muſt the power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting children be, when lodged in the hands of a ſchool-maſter, in whoſe anger there is no mixture of parental affection! Perhaps thoſe parents act moſt wiſely, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truſt themſelves to inflict cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after they are four or five years old, but endeavour to puniſh, and reclaim them, by confinement, or by abridging them of ſome of their uſual gratifications, in dreſs, food or amuſements.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Injuries are ſometimes done to the bodies, and ſometimes to the intellects of children, by corporal puniſhments. I recollect, when a boy, to have loſt a ſchool-mate, who was ſaid to have died in conſequence of a ſevere whipping he received in ſchool. At that time I did not believe it poſſible, but from what I now know of the diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the violent emotions of the mind, and the ſtrength of the body in children, I am diſpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that not only ſickneſs, but that even <hi>death</hi> may be induced, by the convulſions of a youthful mind, worked up to a high ſenſe of ſhame and reſentment.</p>
            <p>The effects of thumping the head, boxing the ears, and pulling the hair, in impairing the intellects, by means of injuries done to the brain, are too obvious to be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Where there is <hi>ſhame,</hi> ſays Dr. Johnſon, there may be <hi>virtue.</hi> But corporal puniſhments, inflicted at ſchool, have a tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſenſe of ſhame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deſtroy all moral ſenſibility. The boy that has been often public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whipped at ſchool, is under great obligations to his maker, and his parents, if he afterwards eſcape the whipping-poſt or the gallows.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Corporal puniſhments, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſchool, tend to beget a ſpirit of violence in boys towards each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which often follows them through life; but they more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beget a ſpirit of hatred, or revenge, towards their maſters, which too often becomes a ferment

of the ſame baneful paſſions towards other people. The celebrated Dr. afterwards Baron Haller declared, that he never ſaw, without horror, during the remaining part of his life, a ſchool-maſter, who had treated him with unmerited ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he was only ten years old. A ſimilar anecdote is related of the famous M. de Condamine. I think I have known ſeveral inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this vindictive, or indignant ſpirit, to continue towards a cruel and tyrannical ſchool-maſter, in perſons who were advanced in life, and who were otherwiſe of gentle and forgiving diſpoſitions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Corporal puniſhments, inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſchools, beget a hatred to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in young people. I have ſometimes ſuſpected that the devil, who knows how great an enemy knowledge is to his kingdom, has had the addreſs to make the world believe that <hi>feruling, pulling</hi> and <hi>boxing ears, cudgelling, horſing,</hi> &amp;c. and, in boarding-ſchools, a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtarving,</hi> are all abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the government of young people, on purpoſe that he might make both ſchools, and ſchool-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters odious, and thereby keep our world in ignorance; for ignorance is the beſt means the devil ever contrived, to keep up the number of his ſubjects in our world.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Corporal puniſhments are not only hurtful, but altogether unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in ſchools. Some of the moſt celebrated and ſucceſsful ſchool-maſters, that I have ever known, never made uſe of them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The fear of corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by debilitating the body, produces a correſponding debility in the mind, which contracts its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of acquiring knowledge. This capacity is enlarged by the tone which the mind acquires from the action of hope, love, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon it; and all theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions might eaſily be cheriſhed, by a prudent and enlightened ſchool-maſter.</p>
            <p n="10">10. As there ſhould always be a certain ratio between the ſtrength of a remedy, and the excitability of the body in diſeaſes, ſo there ſhould be a ſimilar ratio between the force employed in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſchool, and the capacities and tempers of children. A kind rebuke, like freſh air in a fainting fit, is calculated to act upon a young mind with more effect, than ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants of the greateſt power; but corporal puniſhments level all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and tempers, as quack-medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines do all conſtitutions and diſeaſes. They diſhonour and degrade our ſpecies; for they ſuppoſe a total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all moral and intellectual feeling from the mind. Have we not often ſeen dull children ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improve, by changing their ſchools? The reaſon is obvious. The ſucceſsful teacher only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated his manner and diſcipline to the capacities of his ſcholars.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I conceive corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inflicted in an arbitrary manner, to be contrary to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of liberty, and that they ſhould not be tolerated in a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Why ſhould not children be protected from violence and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as well as white and black ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?—Had I influence enough in our legiſlature to obtain only a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle law, it ſhould be to make the puniſhment for ſtriking a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, the ſame as for aſſaulting and beating an adult member of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>To all theſe arguments I know ſome well diſpoſed people will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the <hi>rod</hi> has received a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine commiſſion from the ſacred Scriptures, as the inſtrument of correcting children. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the <hi>rod,</hi> in the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, by a very common figure
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022866_0006_0FBA9A601D9E0800"/>
in rhetoric, ſtands for puniſhments of <hi>any</hi> kind, juſt as the <hi>ſword,</hi> in the New Teſtament, ſtands for the faithful and general adminiſtration of juſtice, in ſuch a way as is moſt calculated to reform criminals, and to prevent crimes.</p>
            <p>The following method of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſchool, I apprehend, would be attended with much better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, than that which I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew, to be contrary to reaſon, humanity, religion, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the experience of the wiſeſt and beſt teachers in the world.</p>
            <p>Let a ſchool-maſter endeavour, in the firſt place, to acquire the confidence of his ſcholars, by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deportment. Let him learn to command his paſſions and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, at all times, in his ſchool.— Let him treat the name of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being with reverence, as often as it occurs in books, or in converſation with his ſcholars.— Let him exact a reſpectful behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards himſelf, in his ſchool; but in the intervals of ſchool-hours, let him treat his ſcholars with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and familiarity. If he ſhould even join in their amuſements, he would not loſe, by his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, any part of his authority over them. But to ſecure their affection and reſpect more perfectly, let him, once or twice a year, lay out a ſmall ſum of money in pen-knives, and books, and diſtribute them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſcholars, as rewards for proficiency in learning, and for good behaviour. If theſe prudent and popular meaſures ſhould fail of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting offences at ſchool, then let the following modes of puniſhment be adopted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Private</hi> admonition. By this mode of rebuking, we imitate the conduct of the divine Being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his offending creatures, for His <hi>firſt</hi> puniſhment is always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>privately,</hi> by means of the <hi>ſtill</hi> voice of conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Confinement after ſchool-hours are ended; but with the knowledge of the parents of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Holding a ſmall ſign of diſgrace, of any kind, in the middle of the floor, in the preſence of a whole ſchool.</p>
            <p>If theſe puniſhments fail of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming a bad boy, he ſhould be diſmiſſed from ſchool, to prevent his corrupting his ſchool-mates. It is the buſineſs of parents, and not of ſchool-maſters, to uſe the laſt means for eradicating idleneſs and vice from their children.</p>
            <p>The world was created in love. It is ſuſtained by love. Nations and families that are happy, are made ſo only by love. Let us extend this divine principle, to thoſe little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities which we call ſchools. Children are capable of loving in a high degree. They may therefore be governed by love.</p>
            <p>The occupation of a ſchool-maſter is truly dignified. He is (next to mothers) the moſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant member of civil ſociety. Why then is there ſo little rank connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that occupation? Why do we treat it with ſo much neglect, or contempt? It is becauſe the voice of reaſon, in the human heart, aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates with it the idea of deſpotiſm and violence. Let ſchool-maſters ceaſe to be tyrants, and they will ſoon enjoy the reſpect and rank, which are naturally connected with their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>We are groſly miſtaken in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up wholly to our governments, and even to miniſters of the goſpel, to promote public and private order in ſociety. Mothers and ſchool-maſters plant the ſeeds of nearly all the good and evil which exiſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022866_0007_0FBA9A619757B158"/>
in our world. Its reformation muſt therefore be begun in nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and in ſchools. If the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits we acquire there, were to have no influence upon our future happineſs, yet the influence they have upon our governments, is a ſufficient reaſon why we ought to introduce new modes, as well as new objects of education into our country.</p>
            <p>You have lately been employed in an attempt to perpetuate our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as a free people, by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the means of national cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and defence;<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Clymer is one of the Repreſentatives of Pennſylvania, in the Congreſs of the United States.</note> but theſe are feeble bulwarks againſt ſlavery, compared with habits of labour and virtue, diſſeminated among our young people. Let us eſtabliſh ſchools for this purpoſe, in every townſhip in the United States, and conform them to reaſon, humanity, and the preſent ſtate of ſociety in America. Then, Sir, will the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations who are to follow us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the precious ideas of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and excellence of republican forms of government, which I well recollect you cheriſhed with ſo much ardor, in the beginning of the American revolution, and which you have manifeſted ever ſince, both by your public and private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>We ſuffer ſo much from tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional error of various kinds, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, morals, and government, that I have been led to wiſh, that it were poſſible for us to have ſchools eſtabliſhed, in the United States, for teaching <hi>the art of forgetting.</hi> I think three-fourths of all our ſchool-maſters, divines, and legiſlators would profit very much, by ſpending two or three years in ſuch uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
            <p>An apology may ſeem neceſſary, not only for the length of this letter, but for ſome of the opinions contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. I know how apt mankind are to brand every propoſition for innovation, as viſionary and Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian. But good men ſhould not be diſcouraged, by ſuch epithets, from their attempts to combat vice and error. There never was an improvement, in any art or ſcience, nor even a propoſal for meliorating the condition of man, in any age or country, that has not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the light of what has been called, ſince Sir Thomas More's time, an <hi>Utopian ſcheme.</hi> The application of the magnet to navigation, and of ſteam to mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical purpoſes, have both been branded as Utopian projects. The great idea in the mind of Columbus, of exploring a new world, was long viewed, in moſt of the courts of Europe, as the dream of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary ſailor. But why do we go to ancient times, for proofs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant innovations in human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs having been treated as Utopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſchemes. You and I recollect the time, when the abolition of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro ſlavery in our ſtate, as alſo when the independence of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, and the preſent wiſe and happy confederacy of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, were all conſidered by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our ſober prudent men, as ſubjects of an Utopian nature.</p>
            <p>If thoſe benefactors of mankind, who have levelled mountains in the great road of human life, by the diſcoveries or labours which have been mentioned, have been ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with obloquy, as viſionary projectors, why ſhould an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual be afraid of ſimilar treatment, who has only attempted to give to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022866_0008_0FBA9A6312207508"/>
that road, from its beginning, a ſtraight direction.</p>
            <p>If only a dozen men like your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, approve of my opinions, it will overbalance the moſt illiberal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they may meet with, from all the learned vulgar of the United States.</p>
            <p>For the benefit of thoſe perſons who conſider opinions as improved, like certain liquors, by time; and who are oppoſed to innovations, only becauſe they did not occur to their anceſtors, I ſhall conclude my letter with an anecdote of a miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in London, who, after employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long ſermon, in controverting what he ſuppoſed to be an heretical opinion, concluded it with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, "I tell you, I tell you my brethren,—I tell you again, —that an old error is better than a new truth."</p>

                  <hi>P.

The author concludes this part of his work, my friend informs me, with a dream, in which he beholds with ineffable joy, the avenging angel deſcending from heaven, and afterwards conſuming in an immenſe bonfire, certain ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd ſchool-books, and <hi>all the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules</hi> in the world.</p>
