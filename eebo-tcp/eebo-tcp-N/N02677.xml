            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Have preſented thee with a ſmall Volume, in which is contained much Truth, which may through the bleſſing of God give thee great Satisfaction, if thou ſearch the Scriptures diligently, and ask Wiſdom in Faith, of him who is the giver of <hi>every good and perfect Gift;</hi> without whoſe help, I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee no profit.</p>
            <p>The Matter I treat on, is about Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, Election, and Reprobation, according to his foreknowledge; and of the death of Chriſt for the Sons of Men. The Body and Subſtance of all Objections I have laboured to anſwer, briefly and plainly, and that both by Scripture
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003171_0003_0FEFD5E8E95BC4C0"/>
and Reaſon, to the ſatisfaction of all rational Men fearing God. And I am conſcious to my ſelf before God, that I aim at nothing more, then the Glory of the great God, <hi>in whom we live, move, and have our Beings</hi>; and <hi>to whom we muſt all give an account of all our Actions,</hi> at the great Day: and in the next place, at the good and benefit of all that ſhall read or hear the holy Scriptures, and by them try theſe following Lines. They are ſo few, that thou mayſt eaſily purchaſe them; and if thou findeſt no profit in them, it will be but three or four Pence loſt: but if they prove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thee, it will be very well beſtowed.</p>
            <p>The Times are now drawing nigh, in which the Lord himſelf will appear from Heaven, to take an account of every Man, how they have ſpent their talents of wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he hath lent them: &amp; happy will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man be, that can give up his account with joy, can ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> that they have <hi>labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have conſciences void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God &amp; towards all Men;</hi> and <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the Ordinances and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord blameleſs</hi>: the which while ſome Men are labouring after, I find them drowned and loſt in a labyrinth about Predeſtination, Election, and Reprobation;

of which diſtractions I my ſelf have formerly had my ſhare: but now through mercy having eſcaped them by the help of the Lord, I think it no leſs then my duty to inform others; and to that end I have compoſed theſe few lines, which now I commit to thy ſerious conſideration; deſiring thee to ſearch the Scriptures, and ſee whether the Things I have written be ſo or not: and judge impartially; and <hi>the Lord give thee underſtanding in all things</hi>: into whoſe Hands I commit thee, to be guided here by his Counſels, that afterwards thou mayſt be received into Glory with him: in whoſe Service I deſire to continue,</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Scripture ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. ſpeaking of Gods Election, that <hi>he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. calleth the Saints <hi>Elect, according to the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God the Father through Sanctification of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, unto obedience,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Paul</hi> (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13) ſaith to the Saints, that <hi>God hath from the beginning cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen them to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto he called you by our Goſpel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which places we muſt needs conclude, that God hath choſen ſome to life and glory, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before or from the foundation of the world, becauſe the Scripture ſaith it; <hi>and</hi> (as Chriſt ſaith in another caſe) <hi>the Scripture cannot be broken.</hi> Therefore the wiſdom of all Chriſtians is, To la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have judgements informed according to the Scriptures, and that the Scriptures, and their Judgements may ſpeak both one thing: and to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003171_0005_0FEFFB58A0D9DDC8"/>
that end, Let us conſider the manner of Gods ſpeaking to the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. He faith to our Father <hi>Abraham, As it is written, I have made thee a father of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before him whom he believed, even God, who quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the dead, and calleth things that are not as though they were,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve, God ſpeaks then in that preſent time to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nations,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was not the Father of one Child at that time, but <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.5. how then muſt we underſtand, <hi>I have made thee a Father of many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle telleth us plainly, <hi>Rom</hi> 4.17. that it was ſo before God, who <hi>calleth things that are not, as though they were:</hi> and ſo he calleth <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of many Nations, though he was not as yet; no not the Father of <hi>Iſaac, in whom his ſeed ſhould be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like may again be obſerved when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſt <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World,</hi> Rev. 13.8. yet he was not ſlain many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years after</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſame may again be conſidered about Gods Election from the foundation of the world, thus:</p>
            <p>God calleth <hi>Abraham, a Father of many Nations,</hi> though not ſo; God calleth Chriſt, <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the Wourld,</hi> though not ſlain many thouſand years after, till he was a man in the fleſh: even ſo he calleth men elected from the foundation of the world, though not elected many
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003171_0005_0FEFFB58A0D9DDC8"/>
thouſand years after, till they are men in the fleſh: yet it is all ſo, and done before God, who foreſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and knoweth all things, even from eternity to eternity; and therefore <hi>calleth things that are not as though they were:</hi> for he ſeeth the beginning and end of all mens actions, whether good or evil, at once; and knowing as well from the foundation of the world what men would do in their generations, as they can know when their lives and actions are finiſhed. He therefore could as well conclude of mens ſalvation or damnation then, as men can know themſelves at the end of their days, or at the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>By all which it is clear, that as Chriſt was called <hi>a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the World,</hi> and yet not ſlain nor touched till the day of his death: ſo alſo, although God calleth men Elect from the foundation of the world, yet they are not Elect nor choſen, until the very day of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and turning from ſin to God: for God <hi>calleth things that are not as though they were</hi>: from whence it is evident they were not Elect, although ſo called.</p>
            <p>Again, if we conſider Election according to the foreknowledge of God, it is plain from that text in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God, through ſanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.</hi> From whence I reaſon thus:</p>
            <p>If the Elect are choſen through the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit, then they were not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen before they had the Spirit, and were ſanctified by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003171_0006_0FEFFB5B074F3740"/>But they had not that ſanctifying Spirit before they had a being, either in the World, or elſe in their Mothers Womb at leaſtwiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore not choſen from the foundation of the World, but only as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Again, 2 Theſſ. 2.13. <hi>We are hound to give thanks alway to God for you, Brethren, beloved of the Lord, becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, whereunto you were called by our Goſpel.</hi> From whence I argue thus:</p>
            <p>If the Saints are <hi>choſen to ſalvation through ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Spirit, and believing of the truth,</hi> and were <hi>called to believe that truth by the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel</hi>; then they were not choſen before they had believed the truth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did hear the Goſpel, by which they were called to believe.</p>
            <p>But they were choſen through believing the truth, and called to believe it by the Goſpel, as aforeſaid; and <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17.</p>
            <p>Therefore not choſen before <hi>they</hi> had a being, no more than Chriſt was ſlain before <hi>he</hi> had a being.</p>
            <p>For according to the Scripture they were <hi>choſen through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth</hi>: and if through it, then not without it (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but it is through it, therefore not without it. Moreover, they were called to this Faith <hi>by the Goſpel</hi>; which they never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had a being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003171_0006_0FEFFB5B074F3740"/>Therefore it is clear, their Election was not before their Converſion, though God ſaw it before: neither indeed can it be, becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are all <hi>choſen in Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 1.4. but I can prove that thoſe very Elect <hi>Epheſians</hi> were once out of Chriſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Remember</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that at that time ye were without Chriſt, Hope, without God in the world</hi>: From whence I argue thus:</p>
            <p>If at that time they <hi>were without God,</hi> and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt,</hi> then at that time they were not in him: for they could not be without him and within him both at one time: and if not in Chriſt, then <hi>not choſen in him,</hi> as all rational Men will grant. From all which I conclude,</p>
            <p>That Men were elected in Chriſt, according to the Scripture, yet never in him, before they believed in him: and they never believed in him, before they heard the Goſpel: and they never heard the Goſpel before they were born. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not Elected, though ſo called by <hi>God who juſtifieth the ungodly,</hi> and <hi>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</hi>

            <p>Again, how plain is it <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 12. where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>they whom God did predeſtinate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſel of his own will, to be to the praiſe of his glory,</hi> were ſuch as did firſt <hi>truſt in Chriſt</hi>: and in ver. 13. he ſaith, that <hi>they truſted in Chriſt after they heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of their salvation</hi>; (not before) the which they never heard before they were born, all Men will grant that have but reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003171_0007_0FEFFB5D5B7B2800"/>Again, how clear is that text, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the foreknowledge of God:</hi> whence it is plain, if God <hi>knew them,</hi> before he <hi>Elected them,</hi> then he knew them as Men in the fleſh, and not as they were nothings: and if he knew them as they were Men, they muſt needs be born firſt; for of nothing, nothing can be known before time, nor choſen in time. Therefore I conclude, that the real and abſolute act of Election comes to paſs in time, though known of God before time, who according to his foreknowledge <hi>calleth things that are not as though they were</hi>; and ſo calleth Men that are not Elected as though they were Elected.</p>
            <p>And thus is the great Objection about Gods Election anſwered, and the ſtumbling-block ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, to the end that Men might <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> and <hi>make their Calling and Election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame may alſo be conſidered of Gods predeſtination, or fore-appointing all obedient Believers to Life and Salvation, (not without, but) <hi>according to his foreknowledge</hi> of all their words and actions <hi>from the foundation of the World.</hi> And ſo likewiſe he predeſtinateth or fore appointeth all diſobedient Unbelievers and Apoſtates to Death and Damnation (not without, but) <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his foreknowledge</hi> of all their words and actions, <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I do believe that God foreſaw all Men and things, paſt, preſent and to come, at once, at once: I do believe that God foreſaw <hi>Adams</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003171_0007_0FEFFB5D5B7B2800"/>
Fall long before he was a creature in being; for nothing is hid from his eyes, but <hi>all things are naked and bare before him with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4.13.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, <hi>If God did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know</hi> Adam <hi>would fall when he had created him, why then did he make him</hi>?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer two things: firſt, what have we to do to reply againſt our Maker? <hi>ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus</hi>? Shall <hi>Adam</hi> ſay to his Maker, Why haſt thou made me thus [ſubject to fall?] What is that to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſeeing God hath given him and his poſterity means to riſe again to a good or a better condition, and the neglect of that means is that which will riſe up in Judgment againſt all ſlothful diſobedient ones that will not make uſe of their talents of power, wiſdom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which God hath given them, to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling while they may? This well conſidered, will give light into <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.10, 11, 20, 21, 22. and if Men will needs underſtand that God loved <hi>Jacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau</hi> before they were born, they ſhould conſider that God knew them both before they were born and after they were born [alike] according to his foreknowledge, as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But I know that this is brought to prove <hi>that Gods Election is not becauſe of works foreſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer; but what works? It is true, God doth not chuſe us becauſe of any works of righteouſneſs that we have done, or can do,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003171_0008_0FEFFB5F20049C08"/>
out of Chriſt; for out of him no works are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Not of works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt:</hi> therefore no works are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of unbelievers, but the very <hi>prayers of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord</hi>: but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of works of righteouſneſs that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath wrought for us, in his own perſon; and doth work by us and in us, by his Spirit, when we are Believers. And though boaſting in the works of the Law, and boaſting of works before believing be reproved; yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the truth of Chriſt is in me, no Man ſhall ſtop me of that boaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.10. and although he cried down works before faith in ſo many places, yet he preacheth up works after believing, loud enough, in theſe words. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.8. <hi>This a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou conſtantly affirm, That they which have believed in God might be careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works; for they are good and profitable,</hi> &amp;c. and Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> Thus we may ſee, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not for our workings without Chriſt, that we are choſen or predeſtinated to life and glory; yet it is by our workings with Chriſt, when he by his Spirit dwelleth in our hearts by believing, and is <hi>in us the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> for then he worketh in us, and our works are acceptable, becauſe he works them by us, and we work them in him. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We therefore as workers together with him, beſeech you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003171_0008_0FEFFB5F20049C08"/>Therefore if Men would but open their eyes, they might eaſily ſee what works the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he ſaith Election is <hi>not of works.</hi> But of this more plainly anon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer: Although God ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> would fall, yet he ſaw him a Creature firſt, or elſe he could not have forſeen he would fall when he was a Creature: therefore <hi>God is the God of order, and not of confuſion,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. and fore-ſeeth all things orderly, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly.</p>
            <p>So then I conclude, that firſt he ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> created.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He ſaw him fallen, and all his Poſterity in his loyns.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He ſaw Chriſt crucified for them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He foreſaw the Goſpel preached to all Men in their Generations.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He foreſaw all Mens receiving, or refuſing; believing, or not believing; obeying, or diſobeying his Goſpel, in their ſeveral Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, as it was, is, or ſhall be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the end of all ages in order at once. And ſeeing as well then, what Men would do in their Ages and Generations to come, as they do know themſelves when their Lives and Actions are finiſhed, God could thereupon make up his Election and Reprobation, chuſing or electing obedient Believers, according to his foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Life and Salvation; and refuſing and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003171_0009_0FEFFB618607F5E8"/>
reprobating diſobedient Unbelievers, to eternal Death and Damnation.</p>
            <p>And thus is Election and Reprobation to be conſidered, according to the foreknowledge of God in Chriſt, or out of Chriſt from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Which if well conſidered, it would put an end to all the confuſed and diſtracted thoughts in Men about theſe things.</p>
            <p>But it may be that ſome will yet object, <hi>that I hold faith and obedience in us, to be the cauſe of Gods electing or chuſing us to Life and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Faith in Chriſt, and Obedience to Chriſt, is [<hi>a cauſe</hi>] without which God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth none to Life and Salvation, I affirm, becauſe we never read that God choſe any diſobedient Unbeliever to Life and Glory which lived and died ſo: but that it is [<hi>the cauſe</hi>] for which he doth chuſe any, I ſhall utterly deny, and ſhew the contrary, in the Order of Cauſes, thus:</p>
            <p>Suppoſe I ſhould affirm my obedience to be the cauſe of my Election to Salvation, then what is the cauſe of my obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My love to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of my love to Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> My faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of my faith in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that <hi>he died for my ſins, and roſe again for my juſtification,</hi> without which there could be no believers: for take away Chriſt, &amp; take away faith; and then believe who can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003171_0009_0FEFFB618607F5E8"/>But what is the cauſe of the preaching of the Goſpel to us?</p>

            <p>Thus all Men may ſee, that I do not hold that God choſe any to Life and Salvation for any good in them, before he put it in them; as I ſhall make it appear more large, by the Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the cauſes in order, deſcending from God to us, or aſcending from us to God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Gods love was the cauſe of his ſending his Son to die for ſinners.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt dying for ſinners, and riſing again for their juſtification, is the cauſe of the Goſpels preaching.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Our believing is the cauſe of our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The knowing our ſelves juſtified from ſin by the blood of Chriſt, is the cauſe of our love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our love to Chriſt is the cauſe of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our obeying of Chriſt is the cauſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the author of eternal Salvation to us, and all them that obey him.</p>
               <p>Now if we conſider the cauſes in order from us to God, it is as clear, beginning at the laſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Our obedience is the cauſe of our ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Our love is the cauſe of our obedience.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Our believing is the cauſe of our juſtification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The preaching of the Goſpel is the cauſe of our faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, is the cauſe of the Goſpels preaching.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods love is the cauſe of ſending his Son to die for us.</p>
               <p>Thus it appears, that it is <hi>not for any works of Righteouſneſs that we have done,</hi> but of his love and mercy he ſaved us, by ſending a Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. From all which, theſe following things are conſiderable, and ought to be conſidered of all that deſire to fear God aright.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a neceſſity of Gods love in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son to die for us; without which, he had not come to die, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was a neceſſity of Chriſts love in dying for us; without which, the Goſpel could not be preached, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There was a neceſſity of the Goſpels being preached; without which, there could have been no believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15, 17.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a neceſſity of our believing the Goſpel; without which, we cannot be juſtified from our Sins by Faith in the blood of Chriſt: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is a neceſſity of our being juſtified by Faith in the blood of Chriſt; without which,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003171_0012_0FEFFB6931F22200"/>
we cannot come to know that he <hi>loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> Rev. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a neceſſity of our knowing his love wherewith he firſt loved us; without which, we cannot love him again: For, <hi>we love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 John 4.19.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is a neceſſity of our loving Chriſt who loved us firſt; without which, we cannot keep his Commandments: For, <hi>this is love that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous,</hi> 1 John 5.3.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is a neceſſity of out keeping his Commandments, and obeying his voice; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, we cannot inherit the promiſes, nor be heirs of eternal life. For, <hi>Chriſt is become the Author of eternal ſalvation to all thoſe that obey him.</hi> Heb. 5.9. And, <hi>bleſſed are they which do his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and enter in through the gates into the City,</hi> Rev 22.14. And, <hi>we have need of patience, that after we have done the will of God, we might inherit the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 10.36 <hi>for the doors of the Lord's work are bleſſed in their deeds,</hi> Jam. 1.25. <hi>But thoſe that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, he will render indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguiſh upon every Soul of Man that doth evil.</hi> And, <hi>Thoſe which will not hear him</hi> (even Chriſt, <hi>that great Prophet</hi>) <hi>in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto them, ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed from among his People with an everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the preſence of God, and from the glory of his power, when he ſhall come in flaming fire, to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003171_0012_0FEFFB6931F22200"/>
render vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> See Rom. 2.8, 9. Act. 3.22, 23. 2 Theſſ. 1.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>By all which we ſee, that there is as great a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our keeping the Commandments and Ordinances of Chriſt, as there was of Gods ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son to die for us, and as there was of Chriſts dying for our ſins, and riſing again for our juſtification: for, without faith in Chriſt, and obedience to Chriſt, there is no promiſe of life and ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>All which may ſerve ſharply to reprove three ſorts of People.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe which are ignorant and know not Chriſt nor his commands, what they are; and are contented with their ignorance, and think to make that a cloak for their ſins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe which are careleſs, and when they know God, and Chriſt, and his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, will not do them, but preſume upon mercy and ſalvation without obeying of Chriſt. Theſe are thoſe which think to be ſaved by Faith only, without doing the will and work of God in their generation; the which <hi>James</hi> calleth <hi>vain Men,</hi> James 2.14, 17, 20. ſaying, <hi>What doth it profit if they have faith and not works? Can faith ſave them? But wilt thou know, O vain Man, that faith without works is dead? was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our father juſtified by works, when he had offered up his Son</hi> Iſaac? <hi>Seeſt thou not how faith wrought with his works, and by works was his ſaith made perfect.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>That which may be known of God is manifeſt in them: for God hath ſhewed it unto them. For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made</hi>; [<hi>even</hi>] <hi>his eternal power and Godhead: ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> Now if all know enough to leave them without excuſe, then the Diſpute is at an end. Notwithſtanding it is yet further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, That as we hear there is a People in the other parts of the world, which worſhip Idols, or the Sun, Moon, and Stars; yea, that worſhip the Devil: ſo alſo thoſe People do as well hear that there is a People in this part of the world which worſhip God and Chriſt; and do as fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly call us Chriſtians, as we call them Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p>Again, all that worſhip any thing for a God, do by that acknowledge that there is a God: and all that offer ſacrifice to a God, do by that confeſs there is a God offended, or may be offended, and is reconcilable by ſacrifice: and it is apparent, that <hi>thoſe which have not the Law are a Law to themſelves,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 2.14, 15. <hi>which ſhew the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another; In the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all Men by Chriſt Jeſus</hi> [according to my Goſpel,] ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> verſ. 16.</p>

               <p>Having thus briefly gone thorow Predeſtination and Election according to the forekowledge of God: I ſhall now ſpeak a word or two about Chriſts death, and the offer of grace by his death to the ſons of Men.</p>
               <p>The main queſtion is, <hi>Whether Chriſt died for all, or but for ſome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſhall anſwer by the Scriptures, ſhewing, 1. the teſtimony of all the Prophets: 2. of the Angel of God: 3. of Chriſt himſelf: 4. of the holy Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 53.4, 5, 6. ſaith thus: <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our ſorrows: yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, and the chaſtiſements of our Peace was upon him: and with his ſtripes we are healed. All we like ſheep have gone aſtray: we have every one turned to his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of us all.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth plainly, that the iniquities of all thoſe that went aſtray, were laid upon Chriſt. And to him the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all the other Prophets agreeth. <hi>Acts</hi> 10 43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The ſame ſaith that great Prophet <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> John 1.7. <hi>who came to bear
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003171_0014_0FEFFB6DD0C25438"/>
witneſs of the light, that all Men through him might believe.</hi> And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> Thus have all the Prophets, with one conſent, teſtified, that God laid upon Chriſt the iniquities of all that are gone aſtray, that he was the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world, that all Men through him might believe; and that through his name whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould receive remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Angel of God teſtifieth <hi>(Luke</hi> 2.10) the ſame things in effect, ſaying, <hi>Fear not; for I bring you glad tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people:</hi> which was, <hi>that there was born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that day in the City of</hi> David <hi>a Saviour, which was Chriſt the Lord.</hi> By all which it ſtill appeareth, that Chriſt died for <hi>all Men,</hi> or elſe it could not be glad tidings of great joy to <hi>all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but rather ſad tidings to all thoſe for whom he died not, if there were any ſuch.</p>
               <p>And now we come to the words of Chriſt himſelf, who knew his own buſineſs better than any Man elſe: and therefore if his teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with thoſe that have gone before, we muſt needs be convinced that it is a truth. For which, ſee <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. in theſe words: <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the ſerpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life: For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003171_0015_0FEFFB6FCA29C6B0"/>
                  <hi>For God ſent not his Son to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> Thus we ſee the words of Chriſt agree with the words of the Prophets: Therefore it muſt needs be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a truth, that Chriſt died for all as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>And now we ſhall hear what the Apoſtles ſpeak concerning this thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all once dead; and that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live to themſelves, but to him that died for them and roſe again.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. that <hi>there is one God, and one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between God and Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſome for</hi> [<hi>all</hi>] <hi>to be teſtified in due time.</hi> From whence the Reader may do well to conſider, that if we may underſtand the Scripture as it is written, that there is one God and one Mediator; ſo alſo we may underſtand from the ſame Scripture, that the ſame Mediator gave himſelf in due time a ranſome for all. Again, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. that <hi>it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom</hi> Paul <hi>was the chief.</hi> Whence I conclude, If he came to ſave the chief of ſinners, then ſurely he left none without a Saviour, and means of ſalvation. Again he ſaith to <hi>Titus,</hi> Chap. 2.11. that <hi>the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation to all Men, hath appeared.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That he by the Grace of God ſhould taſte death for every Man.</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003171_0015_0FEFFB6FCA29C6B0"/>
And 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. that <hi>he is the propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14. he ſaith (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf and the reſt of the Apoſtles) <hi>We have ſeen and do teſtifie, that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have the teſtimony of all the Prophets, the Angel of God, Chriſt the Lord himſelf, &amp; all his holy Apoſtles, agreeing together in one, to prove, that Chriſt died for all Mankind; and by him grace, mercy, and eternal life, is offered to all, and the worſt of ſinners. The ſubſtance of which I ſhall in order once more put down, that you may take notice of the ſweet harmony of Scriptures in the proof of this precious truth: which is thus:</p>
               <p>That the Lord laid upon him the iniquities of all that went aſtray, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. that he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a ranſom in due time for all Men, yea, the chief of ſinners. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.15. that he by the grace of God taſted death for every Man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. that he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.14. that he is the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world, that all Men through him might believe, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.7, 29. and to him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and Chriſt teſtifieth of himſelf, that God ſo loved the world, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003171_0016_0FEFFB716FC752C0"/>
he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and this is glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great joy to all people, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>And thus the pleaſant harmony of Scriptures, out of the mouths of ſo many faithful witneſſes which none dare deny, muſt needs make ſweet melody in the hearts of all true believers.</p>
               <p>But now it remaineth for me to ſpeak to thoſe Objections which are uſually brought againſt theſe Scriptures. To which I ſhall give a brief, yet (through the help of the Lord, I hope. a) ſatisfactory Anſwer. And to that end I ſhall ſum them all up into four heads, thus:</p>
               <p>The common Objections are raiſed againſt the word [<hi>all Men,</hi>] and the word [<hi>every Man,</hi>] the word [<hi>world,</hi>] and the word [<hi>whole world.</hi>] Which are managed thus: that Chriſt died for [<hi>all</hi>] the [<hi>Elect</hi>] for [<hi>every</hi>] one of the Elect, for the [<hi>world</hi>] <hi>of</hi> [<hi>believers,</hi>] or the [<hi>whole</hi>] <hi>world of the</hi> [<hi>Elect</hi>]</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: That Chriſt died for the Elect, I freely grant, becauſe he died for <hi>all Men, every Man,</hi> and <hi>the whole world</hi> as aforeſaid: but that he died for the Elect as they were Elect, or becauſe they were Elect, I utterly deny, and will ſhew the contrary by the Scriptures anon. But firſt I will conſider the Objections, whether they ariſe naturally from the Scriptures or no: which will appear thus:</p>
               <p>If the Scripture no where ſpeaks of <hi>a world of Believers</hi> and Elect Perſons, then we have
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003171_0016_0FEFFB716FC752C0"/>
no ground to believe that Chriſt died for a world of believers and Elect perſons.</p>
               <p>But the Scripture no where ſpeaks of a ſuch a world:</p>
               <p>Therefore we have no ground to believe Chriſt died for ſuch a world.</p>
               <p>Nay, the Scriptures are ſo far from calling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Elect perſons a <hi>world,</hi> that they are oppoſed againſt the world; as appeareth by the words of Chriſt, <hi>John.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the World, the World would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now if we ſhould grant theſe Men their Argument, it would deſtroy their own principle, which is, <hi>That none of the Elect can periſh.</hi> But that ſome that Chriſt died for may periſh, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in theſe words of <hi>Paul; And ſo ſhall thy weak brother periſh for whom Chriſt died,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.11. But if Chriſt died for none but the world of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as they ſay, then ſome of the Elect may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. And thus their folly is manifeſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall now ſhew by the Scriptures what world Chriſt died for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, in due time, Chriſt died for the ungodly,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>But God commendeth his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us.</hi> ver. 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> From all which we clearly ſee, that Chriſt died for the world of ungodly, and for the world
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003171_0017_0FEFFB7403AF8310"/>
of ſinners, and for the world of his enemies, yea for the world of unjuſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath once ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that he might bring us to God.</hi> But the Elect, as Elect, are not unjuſt: for <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth?</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. Therefore he died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect, but even for the world that <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>We know we are of God, and the whole World lyeth in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p>Obj. But the Saints and thoſe that ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved were once ſinners as well as others. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But that was not as they were Elect in Chriſt, but as they were reprobates, or void of judgment concerning the faith, out of Chriſt, without God, without hope, yea enemies in their minds by evil works: See <hi>verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which hath been the condition of the beſt of Gods people, until they be juſtified by faith, and <hi>made nigh by the blood of Chriſt:</hi> for <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are all under ſin, and every mouth ſtopped, &amp; all the world guilty before God, until they be ſet free by believing in the blood of Chriſt. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21 22, 23, 24, 25. Therefore to affirm that Chriſt died for the Elect, or believers, as they were, and becauſe they were Elect and believers, is abſolute nonſence: as I ſhall now prove, thus,</p>
               <p>They which hold that God intended to ſend his Son to die only for the world of believers, muſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003171_0017_0FEFFB7403AF8310"/>
alſo of neceſſity hold that there was a world of believers before God intended to ſend his Son ſo die; and they were the cauſe of Gods ſending his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If there was a world of believers before God intended to ſend his Son to die, then I pray tell me, 1. what they believed; and 2. whom they believed in, before there was a Chriſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them; and I am ſatisfied: but till then, I muſt needs conclude it is abſolute nonſence and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Again, they which believe that Chriſt was ſent to die only for a world of Elect, muſt alſo needs conclude that there were a world of Elect before God intended to ſend his Son to die.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer: Thoſe which are Elect, are <hi>choſen in Chriſt,</hi> Eph 1.4. and out of him there is no Election: therefore if there was a world of Elect before God intended a Chriſt to die for the Elect, I pray tell me, 1. who were they E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in, 2. and what they were Elected unto: otherwiſe I muſt needs conclude as aforeſaid, (namely) that ſuch reaſoning is without ſence and without Scripture.</p>
               <p>But to end the controverſie, I ſhall commit theſe following things to the conſideration of all rational Men fearing God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture faith, that <hi>Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Luke 19.10.</p>
               <p>But the Elect, as they bear the name of Elect, are not loſt, but a found and ſaved People, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003171_0018_0FEFFB765EE3D258"/>Therefore he died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect; for that had been to ſeek and ſave that which was found and ſaved before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance,</hi> Mat. 9.13.</p>
               <p>But the Elect are <hi>all righteous,</hi> Iſa. 60.21. Chap. 26.1, 2. Luke 1.6. <hi>Zacharias and Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth were both righteous before God,</hi> and <hi>he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect as they were, and becauſe they were Elect and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: neither could he; for <hi>there is none righteous, no not one</hi>; until they be made righteous by faith in Chriſt: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, with <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. for then he had come to call them to repentance and righteouſneſs, that had repented and were righteous before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 5.6.</p>
               <p>But the Elect are not ungodly: for <hi>God hath choſen to himſelf the Man that is godly,</hi> Pſal. 4.3.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect; for that had been to redeem them by his blood that were redeemed before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt died for the unjuſt, that he might bring them to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18.</p>
               <p>But the Elect are not unjuſt, but a juſtified people: and <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> for <hi>it is God that juſtifieth, who then ſhall condemn?</hi> Rom. 8.33, 34.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:003171_0018_0FEFFB765EE3D258"/>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to juſtifie them that were juſt before, and to bring them near to God that were near before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>he came to preach deliverance to the captives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Elect are not Captives and Priſoners under Satan, but ſet at liberty by Chriſt, and are his Soldiers, and do fight the Lords Battles againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil; <hi>ſtanding faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free.</hi> See Eph. 6.11, 12. with 2 Tim. 2.3, 4. Gal. 5.1.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect: that had been to ſet them at liberty, that were at liberty before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Scripture ſaith that he came to give ſight to the blind, and light to them that fit in darkneſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16.</p>
               <p>But the Elect are not in darkneſs, nor yet blind; but, <hi>bleſſed are their eyes for they ſee,</hi> Mat. 13.16. and they are all <hi>the children of the light,</hi> and <hi>of the day,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as or becauſe they were Elect; for that had been to give light to them which had light before, and to open the eyes of them which ſaw before.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Scripture ſaith (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 12.) that <hi>he quickned them that were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins</hi>; ſuch as <hi>in times paſt were without Chriſt, aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from

the covenant of promiſe; having no hope, without God in the World.</hi>

               <p>But the Elect are not dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, but alive in Chriſt, and <hi>their life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> neither are they without Chriſt; for they are <hi>choſen in him</hi>: nor ſtrangers and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners to the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Covenant of Promiſes: but they are <hi>fellow citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God,</hi> Eph. 2.19. and are <hi>made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 13. neither are they without hope; for their faith and hope is in God, and they have <hi>put on hope as an helmet of ſalvation,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the Elect, as they were Elect, nor becauſe they were Elect: for that had been to quicken them that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live before, to bring them into Covenant that were in Covenant before, to make them near to God by his blood that were near before. And thus, by theſe Mens account, the Lord Chriſt loſt his labour of love, and accompliſhed a ſolemn nothing.</p>
               <p>And thus have I ſhewed plainly by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſound Reaſon, that it is abſolute Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe for any to ſay that Chriſt died for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as they were, or becauſe they were Elect: Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That had been to ſeek and ſave them that were found and ſaved before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To call them to Repentance that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented before.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003171_0019_0FEFFB782EA94448"/>3. To preach deliverance to them that were delivered before, and to ſet them at liberty that were at liberty before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To give light to them that were out of darkneſs, and had light before; and to open the eyes of them which had their eyes opened, and ſaw before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To make them near by his Blood that were near before.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To juſtifie them that were juſt before.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To bring them into Covenant, and make them fellow-citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God, that were in covenant and had thoſe priviledges before.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To make them members of his own Body, that were members before.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To quicken them that were alive before.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To make them Children of God that were ſo before, and to preach glad tidings to them that were in a happy Condition before, and had no need of it.</p>
               <p>Thus having ſhewed the contradictions of thoſe that hold that Chriſt died for none but the Elect, I ſhall now proceed to prove by undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reaſons, that it muſt of neceſſity be a truth, that <hi>Chriſt died for all Men,</hi> and <hi>taſted death for every Man,</hi> and was a <hi>propitiation for the ſins of the World</hi>; that <hi>all Men through him might believe,</hi> and that <hi>whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. Becauſe we are commanded to <hi>make prayers, and ſupplications, and giving of thanks for all Men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. but to what end ſhould we, or how can we in faith pray for all Men, if Chriſt did not die for all Men? and that Prayer that is not of Faith, is Sin: for, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin,</hi> Rom. 14.23. and <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
               <p>And now having given theſe Reaſons for the confirmation of Chriſts death for all Men, I ſhall briefly ſhew the dreadful Abſurdities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Judgments which believe that Chriſt died for none but the Elect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is no ſin in them that periſh by it, ſeeing there is not any thing for thoſe Men to believe unto ſalvation, for whom Chriſt died not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then it would be a ſin for ſome Men to believe that Chriſt died
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003171_0021_0FEFFB7D91C23BF0"/>
for them, becauſe they ſhould believe a Lie; and all will confeſs it is a ſin to believe Lies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt died not for thoſe that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then they ſhall not be damned becauſe of their Unbelief, according to the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Satan doth no evil in perſwading Men that Chriſt died not for them, but doth perſwade them to believe the truth, if it be true that Chriſt died but for ſome few of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If Chriſt died not for all, then the Devil deceiveth not thoſe that are damned for Unbelief: and as for the Elect, theſe Men affirm they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived; and ſo the Devil is no deceiver.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then it is no Hereſy to teach ſome Men to deny that Chriſt bought them: contrary to 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. where he ſaith plainly, that <hi>ſome Men bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then it is a Vertue in ſome Men to be Unbelievers, and not to believe in Chriſt that he died for them, but rather to believe that he did not die for them: for if that be a truth, it is a Vertue to believe all truth: And then it followeth, that thoſe that believe that Chriſt died not for them, do as well as they which believe Chriſt did die for them, ſeeing both are true; and it is as much Vertue to believe one truth as another.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and thoſe which according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003171_0021_0FEFFB7D91C23BF0"/>
of Chriſt (<hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.) do preach the Goſpel, the glad tidings of grace and peace to <hi>all Men,</hi> and <hi>every Creature,</hi> do ſin, in that they preach Lies to moſt Men.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If Chriſt died not for all Men, then in vain doth God by the Goſpel call <hi>all Men every where to repentance:</hi> for what good can repentance do to thoſe for whom Chriſt died not?</p>
               <p n="10">10. If Chriſt died not for all Men, why then do the Miniſters of the Nation Baptize all, and ſay they make them members of Chriſt, children of God, and heirs of Heaven, in their Baptiſm?</p>
               <p n="11">11. If Chriſt died not for all, why do the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Nation give the Sacrament (as they call it) to all, and tell all that come, <hi>The Body of the Lord was broken for thee; Take, eat, thu,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>The Blood of the Lord Jeſus was ſhed for thee; Take, and drink thu,</hi> &amp;c. What, will they offer to tell untruths when they are about ſuch a work as that? How then can Men believe them in any thing elſe?</p>
               <p n="12">12. If Chriſt died not for all, why do the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Nation take Tythes of all? What will they take Tythes of thoſe that Chriſt died not for? How can they think to do them any good for that they have of them, if Chriſt died not for them? Would they take it well if a Man ſhould yearly take the tenth part of their goods, and yet do nothing for it?</p>
               <p n="13">13. Laſtly, if Chriſt died not for all, why then doth the Lord ſay, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.) that <hi>he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003171_0022_0FEFFB8094FFCF08"/>
repentance</hi>? Now if the Lord be not willing that <hi>any</hi> ſhould periſh, then did he not give his Son for <hi>all?</hi> Conſider and judge what ſhall hinder theſe Men from pleading thus: <q>Lord, thou ſaidſt thou waſt not willing that any ſhould periſh; but yet thou waſt willing that we ſhould periſh, or elſe thou wouldſt have ſent thy Son to die for us, as well as others, and then poſſibly we might be ſaved; or however, we had been left without excuſe.</q> But now how ſhall the Lord <hi>judge the world in righteouſneſs, by that Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>whom he hath ordained, if the Man Chriſt Jeſus did not die for the World?</hi> And therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that <hi>in this end Chriſt died and roſe again, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living,</hi> Rom. 14.9. which quick and dead he will judge <hi>at his appearing and his kingdom,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. And when he doth judge them, he will judge them <hi>according to the Goſpel</hi>: but how can he judge them in righteouſneſs according to the Goſpel, when there was never any Goſpel for them, or mercy offered to them?</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if Chriſt died for all, and God was willing that all ſhould be ſaved; why then are not all ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe they believe not in the only begotten Son of God, who is their Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. and God called, and they refuſed; he ſtretched out his hand, and they regarded not; he counſelled them, but they would none of his counſels; he reproved them, but they ſet at nought all his reproofs, but followed after lying
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003171_0022_0FEFFB8094FFCF08"/>
vanities, and ſo forſook their own mercies, and denied the Lord that bought them, and brought upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction: and becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, therefore (if you would know wherefore) God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions to believe Lies, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. And again Chriſt ſaith, <hi>How oft would I have gathered you together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings? and ye would not.</hi> Mat. 23.37. And this is the reaſon why ſome Men are not ſaved: for God never promiſeth Life and Salvation to any Man whether he will or no; but threatneth Death and everlaſting Deſtruction to them which believe not, and obey not the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But then you hold free-will, and that Men may be ſaved if they will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I hold nothing but what the Scripture ſaith, and that you ſhall give me leave to hold: neither do I believe that any Man hath or ever had any will or power of himſelf, without God, to do any thing that is good, for <hi>in him we live, move, and have our being</hi>: but in, and through, and by God and Chriſt, we may do all things <hi>for the Lord is a Sun and a Shield, and will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Pſal. 84.11. and he hath given Chriſt to death for all Men, as I have
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003171_0023_0FEFFB825B2422A8"/>
proved already at large; and <hi>He that ſpared not his only Son, but delivered him up for us all: how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8.32. and his hand is ſtretched out all the Day long to a ſtiff-necked gainſaying People. What Man is there that knoweth not, that if he make uſe of all the Will, Power, and Underſtanding that God hath given him, the Lord will double his talent and give him more? And that the Lord have given all Men enough to leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, I have already proved in the former part of the Book; and if any Man would have more, they muſt improve that which they have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for <hi>he that is faithful in that which is leaſt, will be faithful alſo in much: but he that is unjuſt in the leaſt will alſo be unjuſt in much</hi>: Luke 16.10. And what Man is he that doth not know, that he is not condemned for not doing that which he cannot poſſibly do, but for leaving undone that which God hath given them power and ability to do? let any Man deny it, if he can.</p>
               <p>And now whereas it is a queſtion, <hi>whether all Men may be ſaved if they will</hi>;</p>
               <p>I anſwer, What ſhould hinder them if they be willing? for firſt, <hi>God is not willing that any ſhould periſh.</hi> Secondly, <hi>God is willing that all Men ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, and he ſaved.</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9 1 Tim. 2.4. and Chriſt is willing, for <hi>he came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world</hi>: and how did he weep over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>? and <hi>how oft</hi> (as aforeſaid) <hi>would he have gathered them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Hen doth her Chickins? but they would not.</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003171_0023_0FEFFB825B2422A8"/>
And now what hinders Mens ſalvation, but that ſame, [<hi>they would not?</hi>] Conſider well, and judge.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very well: then it ſeemeth by that Scripture that Men have freewill to be ſaved; and indeed I wonder what Man alive deſires not to be ſaved: but it ſeems their willing and running in their own ways will not attain it: it was not <hi>Cain</hi>'s ſacrifice, nor the Scribes and Phariſees long prayers and faſtings with disfigured faces, nor yet their giving alms to the poor, and Tythes of all they poſſeſſed, that could give any of theſe a Manſion in Heaven: (and why?) <hi>Becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.30, 31, 32. and ſo it is to this day; Men would with <hi>Balaam,</hi> gladly die the death of the righteous; and O who would not be ſaved! but then they ſhould come at Chriſts call, and turn at his reproof, and wait for his counſels who is the wonderful Counſellor, and live to him that died for them, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of Chriſt blameleſs, hearing him in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay to them, and follow him whereſoever he go; and when they have done all this with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be contented to bear the reproaches and ſhame that belong to the Croſs of Chriſt, and to have Men, yea wicked Men, and ſome devout and honourable Men and Women perſecute and revile them, and ſay all manner of evil ſayings
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003171_0024_0FEFFB84E4422678"/>
on them falſly, for his name ſake, and indure all this patiently, with ſuch a Spirit as can pray for the ſalvation even of their worſt enemies, as for their own Souls; as Chriſt, who when he had fulfilled all Righteouſneſs, was numbered amongſt tranſgreſſors, and crucified between two thieves, and at that time prayed for his enemies: When we can thus follow Chriſt, then happy are we, <hi>for the ſpirit of God and of Glory doth reſt upon us.</hi> See 1 Pet. 4.12, 13, 14, 15. and the greater is our reward in heaven, for in like manner perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they the Prophets before us. But I confeſs this way is ſo narrow, and this gate is ſo ſtraight, that few can enter and walk therein, except they learn of Chriſt who is humble and meek, and then they will find reſt to their Souls; and by and through him who is the Door, they will go in and out and find paſture. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that although it be not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth in his own ways, and after the imaginations of his own heart; yet it is in him that will run in Gods ways, and follow Chriſt in his Commands and Ordinances whereſoever he go: for it is in God that ſheweth mercy, who hath indeed ſhewed mercy unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and the worſt of ſinners, in ſending his only begotten Son to die for them, to take away their ſins, to call them to repentance, to give them the knowledge of Salvation by the remiſſion of their ſins through his [mercy,] yea, through the [ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercy] of our God, whereby the Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003171_0024_0FEFFB84E4422678"/>
that ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet in the way of peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. who before did not know the way of peace.</p>
               <p>Therefore now let all Men take heed how they ſin againſt ſuch rich mercy and free grace, as is offered to them, even to the worſt of ſinners, by the Lord in the Goſpel of Truth, (which is the glad tidings of our Salvation) leſt mercy riſe up in judgment againſt them in the great day, and left they ſin againſt that true Light that is come into the world to enlighten every Man, (which is Chriſt) who by his word and ſpirit hath made known to the ſons of Men whatſoever he ſaw in the boſom of the Father; yea, even the whole counſel of God, which is neceſſary to Salvation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all Men take heed of ſhutting their eyes againſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For this is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and Men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
