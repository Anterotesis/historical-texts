            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. OUR Great REDEEMER, has by his good porvidence entertained and encouraged his faithful people, with the redemption of many cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, from the hands of our French and Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is infinitely reaſonable, that this good providence of Heaven ſhould be glorified; and a collection, tho' an imperfect one, of certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morables occurring to theſe children of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, will afford ſome great revenues of glory to it; which may be accompanied with ſeveral things, where by the faithful alſo may be more than a little edified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our eaſtern Indians, had no ſooner, with all poſſible aſſurances, renewed their league of peace with us, but being moved by the inſtigation of the French, they perfidiouſly and barbarouſly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſeven of our more naked and ſecure plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and coming at once into the ſcattered families they did, on Auguſt 10, 11. 1703. reward the hoſpitable civilities that were ſhown them, with the murder of above ſeventy Engliſh people, and the captivity of near an hundred. Upon this there enſued leſſer depredations, and captivations, as the treacherous enemy found opportunity for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:019426_0003_0FABA3B74D4ECCA0"/>About half a year after theſe calamities thus begun on the eaſtern parts of the country, the weſtern had a taſte of the ſame cup given to them. On February 1703. 4. An army conſiſting, as it was judg'd, of about four hundred French and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, made a deſcent upon the little town of Deerfield, the moſt northernly ſettlement on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river, which had long been a watchful and an uſeful barrier for the reſt of the plantations in the neighbourhood. They ſurprized the place, about an hour or two before break of day, and in a little time, not without loſs to themſelves, they butchered and captivated above one hundred and fifty of the people. Mr. <hi>John Williams,</hi> the worthy miniſter of that pious and holy flock, was carried into captivity, with five of his children; two of his children were ſlain; and his deſirable conſort, beginning to faint, at about a dozen miles of the doleful journey, they the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reach'd unto Mont-Real, a journey diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd by the parcels now divided, in twenty days, more or leſs, near twenty more of the captives loſt their lives; for the manner was, that if any found themſelves not able to travel through the deep ſnow, now on the ground, the ſavages would ſtrike their hatches into their heads, and there leave them weltring in their blood.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:019426_0004_0FABA3B8DEDB1028"/>The French did buy many of the captives, from the Indians, among whom they met with many inſtances of humanity, more or leſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the humour of thoſe, in whoſe families they became ſervants or ſojourners. Others of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were a long while detained with the Indians in their horrid and howling wigwams, and ſome are to this day miſerably circumſtanced among thoſe dragons of the wilderneſs. Various methods have been uſed for the redemption of theſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and at ſeveral times, there have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſeveral of them; yea, ſeveral companies of them.

            <p>ASTONISHING deliverances have been ſent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the point of deſtruction; but, theſe poor ones have cryed unto

the Lord, and he has remarkably delivered the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>'Tis a wonderful reſtraint from God upon the Bruitiſh ſavages, that no Engliſh woman was eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> known to have any violence offered unto her chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by any of them.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the captives have been murdered by them, neither when they were drunk, nor when the Caprichio's, and the cruelties, of their diabolical natures were to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
            <p>'Tis wonderful, that when many of the captives have been juſt going to be ſacrificed, ſome ſtrange interpoſition of the divine Providence has put a ſtop to the execution, and prevented their being made a ſacrifice. The ſtories are numberleſs. Take a few of them.</p>
            <p>ACRUE of Indians had been three days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of ſuſtenance. They took an Engliſh child, and hung it before the fire to roſt it for their ſupper; but that theſe canibals might ſatiate their—I want a name for it,—as well as their hunger, they would roaſt it alive. The child began to ſwell. A canoe arrived at that inſtant, with a dog in it. The leſſer devils of the crue, propoſed their taking the dog inſtead of the child; They did ſo; and the child is yet living! Her name is, <hi>Hannah Parſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man had valiantly kill'd an indian or two, before the ſavages took him. He was next morning to undergo an horrible death, whereof the manner and the torture, was to be aſſigned by the widow Squa of the dead indian. The French prieſts told him, they had laboured to divert the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019426_0025_0FABA3CC1F9EA678"/>
tygers from their bloody intention, but could not prevail with them; he muſt prepare for the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble execution. His crys to God were hard, and heard; When the ſentence of the ſqua was demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e contrary to every one's expectation, and the revengful inclination ſo uſual and well known among theſe creatures; ſhe only ſaid,—his death won't fetch my huſband to life; Do nothing to him! So nothing was done to him.</p>
            <p>A Woman was carried aſide, by her monſter of a maſter; he faſtened a rope about her neck; It was in vain for her to contend; the hatchet muſt preſently have diſpatched her, if the halter had failed; ſhe had no remedy but to cry unto God; her maſter throws up the end of the rope over the limb of the tree; he aſcends to hale her and to tye her up; and then a fine exploit for the wretch! a <hi>memorable name</hi>! however the limb hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily breaks; down he falls! full of madneſs, he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander juſt in the nick of time comes in upon him; reproaches him very bitterly; takes her away from h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m; and ſends her away to Canada.</p>
            <p>BUT we ought not to paſs over the marvellous diſplay of the power of God, in ſupporting and preſerving the poor captives, when they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled through the horrid wilderneſs, oftentimes much more than a ſcore of miles in a day, and thro' very deep ſnows, and with vaſt loads on their backs; and grievouſly pinched with hunger, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarce one bit of any refreſhment, for whole days together. Poor, weak, ſick women have done ſo!</p>

On the ſudden a new ſtrength entred into her. She tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled that very day, twenty miles a foot. She was up to the neck in water ſix times that very day in paſſing of rivers. At night ſhe fell over head and ears into a ſlough in a ſwamp, and was hardly got out a live. She got not the leaſt cough nor cold by all of this; ſhe is come home alive unto us.</p>

There ſhe lay, till the next night, with none but the ſnow under her, and the heaven over her; in a miſty and a rainy ſeaſon. She ſent then unto a French Prieſt, that he would ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ſqua miſtreſs, who then, without condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

and a little bit of dried mooſe, which being boiled ſhe drank the broth, and gave it unto the child.</p>
            <p>In a fortnight, ſhe was called upon, to travel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with her child in her arms; ever now and then, a whole day together, without the leaſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of any food, and when ſhe had any, ſhe fed only on ground nuts, wild onions and lilly roots. By the laſt of May, they arrived at Coweſick, where they planted their corn; wherein ſhe was put unto a hard taſk, ſo that the child extremely ſuffered. The ſavages would ſometimes alſo pleaſe themſelves with caſting hot embers into the mouth of the child, which would render the mouth ſo ſore, that it could not ſuck for a long while together. So, that ſtarv'd and died.</p>
            <p>Their they ſtaid until they weed their corn; but then ſome of our friend indians coming on them, kill'd ſeven of them; whereat, away they fled for Canada, and never ſaw their corn-field any more. But they made a forty-days ramble of it, before they reach'd thither; in which, if at any time, her heart began to faint, her miſtreſs would be ready to ſtrike the mortal hatchet into her head.</p>
            <p>The French being thought more civil to the Engliſh than to the Indians, her miſtreſs thereat provoked, reſolved, that ſhe would never ſell her to the French. Accordingly ſhe kept her a twelve-month with her, in her ſqual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ghth and heat of her paroxyſms, her miſtreſs would compel her ſometimes to ſpend a winter night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter froſt and ſnow of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019426_0030_0FABA3CFDBC8C330"/>
She recovered; but four Indians died of the fever, and at length her miſtreſs alſo. Another Squa then pretended an heirſhip unto her: with whom ſhe lived and ſaw many more ſtrange deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances. They had the ſmall pox in the family; but ſhe never had it. She was made to paſs the river on the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce when every ſtep ſhe took ſhe might have ſtruct through it if ſhe pleaſed. Many more ſuch preſervations might come into her ſtory.</p>
            <p>At laſt, there came to the ſight of her, a prieſt from Quebec, who had known her in her former captivity at Naridgowock. He was very civil to her, and made the Indians to ſell her unto a French family, for fourſcore livres, where, tho' ſhe wrought hard, ſhe lived more comfortably and contentedly.</p>
            <p>She poured out her continual ſupplications to heaven; ſometimes two or three of her own ſex, would by ſtealth come to join with her in ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to the glorious LORD She had her mind often irradiated with ſtrong perſuaſions and aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ſhe ſhould yet ſee the goodneſs of God in this land of the living.
