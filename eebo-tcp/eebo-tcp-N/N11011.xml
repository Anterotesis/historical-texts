            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I WAS a by-ſtander this day, when your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and the Houſe of Lords decided the very important cauſe of Philip Thickneſs, appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and Peter Leigh and others, reſpondents, and though unconnected with the parties, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unintereſted in the event, I muſt own I was forcibly ſtruck by a ſcene ſo novel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected. I ſtood, my Lord, with ſilent awe, at the bar of that tribunal which I had ever been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to conſider, as the laſt refuge of injured juſtice, I expected to hear a queſtion of law, of infinite nicety, diſcuſſed with wiſdom, and decided with integrity. Judge then, my Lord, my aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, when inſtead of that decency in debate, which ought to be obſerved even in the loweſt court of juſtice, and which I had ever thought in a peculiar manner characteriſtic of the Houſe of Lords, I ſaw proceedings which would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced a Poliſh diet! Yes, my Lord, in all my experience of courts of juſtice, I never ſaw Judges ſo avowedly corrupt, ſo indecently profligate as your Lordſhip and Lord Denbigh! Lord Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den delivered his opinion on the queſtion, in an argument that will carry, to the lateſt times, his fame, and your diſgrace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:013954_0002_0F925C250D957678"/>
Your Lordſhip, in anſwer to him, delivered your ſentiments; I cannot call them an argument, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was nothing that reſembled a chain of reaſoning; and indeed your Lordſhip ſeemed more to rely on the letter you had received from Sir William De Grey, and the converſation you ſaid you had with Sir Eardley Wilmot and Sir Stafford Smythe, than on any reaſons you could advance in ſupport of your decree. When Lord Camden, with a decency becoming the occaſion, and the place in which he ſpoke, reminded your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how improper it was for a Judge, deciding ſo nice and difficult a queſtion of property in the higheſt tribunal of the kingdom, to talk of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, not Judges in that court, who had given their ſentiments in private, probably without much conſideration of the ſubject, moſt certainly without hearing the facts ſtated, and the queſtion diſcuſſed by counſel, what treatment did he meet with? Lord Denbigh's attack upon him was the attack of a ruffian, hired to carry through a profligate meaſure by aſſaſſinating every man who ſhould attempt oppoſition? Your Lordſhip's language was ſomewhat more decent; it was the language of ignorance, delivered with that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which a week and a vain man feels, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a corrupt majority. Has your Lordſhip ſtill to learn, that the opinion of a Judge, though delivered in the courſe of a cauſe in open court, and handed down in print, yet if it is on a point, not before him as a Judge, is never allowed to be cited even by counſel in argument? And wiſely ſo eſtabliſhed, my Lord, for the law of this country gives credit to the opinions of the Judges only on thoſe points which are neceſſarily brought before them in the courſe of judicial proceedings. On
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013954_0003_0F925C25B83AF560"/>theſe points, when they have heard the arguments of counſel, they decide, if erroneouſly, the injured party has his remedy by appeal, if corruptly and iniquitouſly, the deciſion of the Judge appears on the record, and he is amenable to his country's juſtice. Lordſhip ignorant that this is the law, or can your Lordſhip ſay, or will any other man ſay for you, that in the courſe of his attendance on courts of law, he ever before knew a private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and private converſation, adduced by a Judge, not as arguments furniſhing reaſons for an opinion, but as authorities in law, to warrant his deciſion? My Lord, I will defy your Lordſhip, with all your long liſt of adviſers, from the hollow hearted Lord, who made you Chancellor, down to the loweſt driveller who feeds your vanity with flattery, to ſay that ſuch a ſight was ever before exhibited in a court of juſtice. From the exiſtence of courts of law in this iſland, no man, ever before this day, ſaw a private letter produced, read, and relied on as authority by a Judge, pronouncing judgment. Are the arguments of council mockery? Or are they ſuppoſed to ſuggeſt matter, to be weighed by thoſe who are to decide. The judgment of your Lordſhip and the Houſe of Peers this day was avowedly founded on the authorities of men, who had never heard the queſtion diſcuſſed by counſel. If this mode of deciding is to prevail in courts of juſtice, arguments by counſel are needleſs. Your Lordſhip can decide without hearing them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is requiſite than for your Lordſhip to write a letter to ſome friend, his anſwer read in court by your Lordſhip will ſtand in the place both of authority and argument. Is this the way in which juſtice is to be diſpenſed to the ſubject, in the ſupreme tribunals of the country, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:013954_0004_0F925C2698998028"/>
O, ſeats of Talbot and of Hardwicke, from whence thoſe great and god-like men, with pure hearts, and wiſdom more than human, ſhed on this happy land the fragrant dews of juſtice, from whence the vanquiſhed ſuitor was wont to retire ſatisfied, by the arguments he had heard, that he had been miſtaken in his claim, how is your glory faded! The wretched thing, who now fills the place of your late bright inhabitants, attempts not to give reaſons for his deciſions; but tells the ſuitor, in plain terms, that he decides the cauſe on the authority of a letter from one of his friends, who had never heard the facts openly ſtated, or an argument from counſel on the ſubject. My Lord, were I to tell a man, bred up in the courts of Talbot and of Hardwicke, that a Chancellor of this country had decided a queſtion on an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory deviſe, on the authority of a letter from Sir William De Grey, who had never heard an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the queſtion, he would tell me it was a LYE; it would be impoſſible to be true, it would be as repugnant to all ideas of a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's proceedings, as if I was to tell him, that on the firſt day of the term, I had ſeen the Chancellor carried round Weſtminſter-Hall in Bacchanalian triumph, the train, mace, and purſe born by three drunken trulls, picked out of a brandy ſhop at Temple-Bar. My Lord, men's minds are formed by what they have been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to. Thoſe who remember the poliſhed manners and elegant arguments of former Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's, are ſhocked at your Lordſhip's brutal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. <hi>Sic volo, ſic jubeo.</hi> My Lord, I do not uſe theſe expreſſions as merely ſimilar to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's, I do aver that ſince your Lordſhip has had the cuſtody of the great ſeal, I have heard
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013954_0005_0F925C2736DC1910"/>you decide a queſtion at law, argued by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent council, in theſe very words,—I am of a different opinion. I heard your Lordſhip decide in theſe words, I heard that very deciſion reverſed as erroneous. My Lord, your Lordſhip's conduct is become too glaringly deſpicable. When the great ſeal had been taken from Lord Camden, for dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpeak his ſentiments in parliament, and the ever to be lamented Yorke had, by a virtuous death, atoned too ſeverely for the weakneſs of an unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moment (for who can withſtand the perſuaſion of Kings. when they become ſuitors) the gap was to be ſtopped. It was neceſſary that the office of Chancellor ſhould be filled. Your Lordſhip was pitched upon by Lord Mansfield, as a man who being too weak to form opinions of his own, would pay implicit obedience to his dictates; and, in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the great law officer, avow legal opinions, his patron might be unwilling to riſque. This was the ground on which your Lordſhip was made Chancellor. The nation ſaw it, and lamented that an office of ſuch infinite importance ſhould be diſpoſed of from ſuch motives, and to ſuch a man. For my Lord, do you think the world ever conſidered you as a lawyer. Thoſe, who had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Weſtminſter-Hall, knew that your abilities as a man, and your knowledge as a lawyer, were below contempt. They knew that in the character of an advocate you had never got £.200 a year, in all the courts of Weſtminſter taken together. They were aſtoniſhed when you were made a Judge, but they were exaſperated when you were made Chancellor. In the diſcharge of the duty of that office, they ſaw that your deciſions were ever unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by argument, from hence they were led to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that your decrees were made by others. This
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013954_0006_0F925C2B5809B790"/>they ſuſpected, but they did not know it, till your Lordſhip, in the debate of this day, put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beyond a doubt. You will ſay, perhaps, a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor may aſk the aſſiſtance of thoſe whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he eſteems. True, my Lord, but let him call on them in the character of aſſeſſors, that they may hear the arguments of council, that they may be anſwerable for the doctrines they lay down, and that the ſuitor may know by whoſe opinion his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is bound. My Lord, this is your character drawn with more truth than by thoſe ſycophants who tell you that you are a greater Chancellor than Hardwicke, Talbot, or Camden! No man ever doubted about your head; the conduct of this day has fixed men's opinion of your heart. My Lord, it was a foul proceeding.</p>
            <p>It was a black day's work, juſtice ſeemed in eclipſe.</p>
            <p>The ſuitor had ſeen with grief in what weak hands the great ſeal was entruſted, but when he ſaw that if your ignorance led you to decide erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, a packed Houſe of Peers might be brought together to ſacrifice his property to your vanity, he was ſtruck with horror. My Lord, the nation will not bear it, and after the ſcene of this day, your Lordſhip cannot hold the Great Seal.</p>

                  <hi>P. S.</hi> When the decree was affirmed, there was not above five or ſix Lords in the Houſe, beſides Lord Camden, and the preſent Chancellor. Lord Paulet (to his honor be it recorded) moved to have the Judges called in. This motion was over-ruled, and he retired. It was the Duke of Chandois, Lord Denbigh, Lord Cathcart, and Lord Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, who took upon themſelves to decide a nice
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013954_0007_0F925C2C94C1D3D8"/>queſtion of law, which ought to have been argued with wiſdom and diſcretion, but which was debated with paſſion, and decided by party zeal. In ſhort, what raiſed the Chancellor, ruined the ſuitor— THE TIMES.</p>
               <p>Note. When the Houſe of Lords were met to hear the cauſe, a meſſage was ſent to Lord Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field by the Chancellor, to know if he would attend. But the Chancellor very well knew he would not attend. He knew that Lord Mansfield could not reſiſt the arguments of Lord Camden, and that he muſt concur with him in reverſing the decree. Lord Mansfield therefore ſtaid in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall, to decide the property of twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five pounds, and neglected his duty to attend, where ten thouſand pounds were at ſtake as well as the honor of the nation. He well knew the honeſt zeal of Lords Catchcart and Galloway, the villany of Lord Denbigh, and the folly of the cajoled Duke of Chandois, he knew that they would attend conſtantly, to take notes in order to form a determination they went into the Houſe prepared for; namely, to affirm the decree, and do for Lord Mansfield what he durſt not do himſelf.</p>
               <p>Lord Mansfield's perſonal diſlike to the ſuitor has long been well known. When he appeared at the bar of the King's Bench, to receive judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for libelling Lord Orwell, Lord Mansfield jumped from the ſeat of juſtice, and with fury in his eyes, and an agitation of body conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thereto, exclaimed—Commit him! Commit him! An indecency of behaviour which aſtoniſhed the whole court.</p>
               <p>Since writing the above, I have ſeen a letter from Sir William De Grey, in anſwer to one from
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013954_0008_0F925C2D4132B3A0"/>the appellant, requeſting to know, whether the letter read by your Lordſhip in the Houſe of Peers, was read with his privity. Sir William De Grey's anſwer is in theſe words:
