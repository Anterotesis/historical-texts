            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is warranted, and grounded upon the light both of nature and Scripture, <hi>2 Cor: 12.14.</hi> That Parents should lay up for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and leave such an estate behind them, that their posterity after them may comfortably bee provided for, which as it is requisite for the outward subsistence of Children in temporal regards: So it is most necessary for spiritual Fathers (which the word of God tells are not many, <hi>1 Cor: 4.15.</hi> how many Instructours soever there are) I mean for the faithfull Ministers of Christ, to leave a good stock &amp; heritage of Gods Testimonyes for his people commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their charge, and their children in the faith: which care as it was alwayes needfull so especially it is in these times, wherin there is so much Apostacy &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting away from the faith &amp; truth. In this regard we find it to have been the practise of the most precious servants of the Lord, that in their old age they have left their <hi>cygneas cantiones,</hi> their swans songs (as they are called) which they sung not long before they departed this life, as Moses did <hi>Deut: 32.</hi> the occasion of which song is set down <hi>Deut: 31.27, 29. I know your rebellion and your stiff neck: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold while I am yet alive with you, ye have been rebellious against the Lord, &amp; how much more after my death? and ver: 29. I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt your selves, and turn aside from the way that I Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you, and evill will befall you in the latter dayes, because ye will do evill in the sight of the Lord &amp;c:</hi> Therefore ver: <hi>26. Moses commanded the Levites to take the book, and to put it in the side of the Arke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for a witness against them upon any apostacy of theirs.</hi> And is there not as great need that such like course should be taken by Gods faithfull servants and Ministers to leave some workes as it were in the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shua before his death, as appeares <hi>Josh. chap: 23, and 24.</hi> wherein he warnes them against their apostacy most sweetly &amp; pathetically, and particularly remarkeable is that Josh. <hi>24., 25, 26. Joshua made a Covenant with the people, and set them a statute, and Ordinance in Sechem, and Joshua wrote those words in the book of the Law of God, and took a great stone, and set it there under an Oak that was by the Sanctuary of the Lord, and said unto all the people, behold this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it hath heard all the words of the Lord, which he spake unto us, least ye deny your God.</hi>

For the former of these, there is express Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement &amp; charge, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.5, 6. <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Deut:</hi> 6.6, 7. In which last Scripture, every housholder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Commanded of God to have <hi>the words of God in his heart, and that he teach them diligently to his children, talking of them when he sitteth in his house, and when he walketh by the way, when he lyeth down &amp; when he riseth up.</hi> And therefore, if your children &amp; servants be not instructed &amp; taught in the word of God, you will not be able to give any good answer for it before the Lord, having lived in the neglect of so express &amp; plain, so serious and solemn a Commandement. The truth is you have but little love either to God, or to your children, or to your selves, if you make not conscience of this duty. For love to God would both provoke <hi>to keep his Commandements,</hi> of which the teaching of your children is one, and would stirr up the soul that hath it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire &amp; endeavour that God might be honoured &amp; served as much &amp; by as many persons &amp; people as possibly it could attain unto. And therefore how can you say that you love God, when you do not your best endeavour that others, at least your own children &amp; housholds may do him service? Would you have God to have no service but by your selves, or whilest your selves are alive? You know your selves must not live alwayes; therefore it would be some Testimony of your love to his Majesty, if you be carefull to train up a poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the Lord, and so to teach them in his wayes, that your seed may serve him when your selves shall be dead &amp; gone. As for your children, you know they are born in sin, and so children of wrath by nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration &amp; holiness must never see the Kingdom of God; and can you love them, and not endeavour to help them out of this woefull &amp; wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? I think he loves his child, or his freind but little, that seeth him ly fast asleep within the flood-markes &amp; reach of the tide, and so every hour in danger to be swept away &amp; drowned in the waters and waves of the Sea, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000047_0013_0F9F18914DDF0E50"/>
for all this can endure yet to let him alone, and never endeavour to awake him and rouse him up, that he may escape that apparent &amp; imminent danger. Judg then in your selves, what love there can be in you to your poor children when you take no care, or make no conscience to save their soules from the deluge of destruction, and from their sins of heart &amp; life, whereby they are in dayly danger to be swept away with that deluge, &amp; to be overwhelmed with destruction. Please not your selves as if you loved them sufficiently in that you are carefull to provide them meat &amp; cloaths, and other necessaryes for the body. For Turks &amp; Indians can do so; and should not you <hi>be better</hi> and do <hi>better then they?</hi> Will you do no more for the soules of your children then Pagans &amp; Infidels would do for the soules of theirs? Very beares and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Only this care of theirs reacheth no further but to the flesh or body, as indeed they have no immortal Soules to care or be cared for. But I beseech you, let your care &amp; love to your children reach further, even to do your utmost endeavour to help forward the salvation of their precious and immortal soules; else never say you do truely love them. Nay in such case you cannot say you do truely love your selves. For the neglect of this duty will be your own disadvantage, and will further your own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, both in this &amp; in another world. If children be duely instructed when they are young, there is hope they will walk according thereto when they shall be grown, <hi>Pro:</hi> 22.6. and will not this be a comfort &amp; joy of heart to any godly Parent? the holy Ghost tells us that <hi>the wise Son maketh a glad Father, Pro.</hi> 10.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>&amp; ver.</hi> 15, 16.

All this is no more then may well be imagined &amp; supposed to be the woefull condition of many poor children &amp; their Parents, in another world. And if all this seem a light thing in the eyes of any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or housholder, I may say, the Lord be mercifull to such a man, for his heart is very hard.

Yea our Saviour tells us, that those that are <hi>the children of Abraham, will do the works of Abraham, John</hi> 8.39 Therfore as ever you desire to be known unto your selves or others to be the children of Abraham by a true &amp; lively faith, so see that you be carefull to tread in his steps and to do his workes, as in other things wherin he is propounded as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, so in this particular of instructing &amp; well ordering of your children &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.

1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.40. was <hi>busie here and there,</hi> he whom he should have kept was missing and <hi>gone:</hi> So while many men are busie here &amp; there about worldly imployments, the power and life of Religion, which they should have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept, is utterly lost and quite gone. <hi>The deceitfulness of riches, and cares of this life, do as thornes choak the seed of the word</hi> in many professours, that they <hi>become unfruitfull, Mark</hi> 4.19. As Demas forsook Paul through <hi>love of this present world,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 4.10. and Ezekiels hearers could not hear the word with profit, because their <hi>heart went after their coveteousness, Ezek.</hi> 33.31. Oh therefore take heed, I do beseech you, least it be so with any of you, least earthly cares and encumbrances should dull your spirits, and take off their edge in the things of greatest importance, and lest by these things all the vigour of Religion should be wasted and worne out, and nothing be left but a dry &amp; sapless formallity, a spiritless &amp; powerless profession. You would be more happy if you could make a vertue of necessity, I mean if you could turn all the acts of your particular callings, all the imployments that God hath laid upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you about these earthly things, if you could turn them all into so many acts of Religion and Obedience towards God. Which is not a thing impossible, for the Apostle expressly requires it of Servants, that what ever they did (<hi>viz:</hi> in the labours of their callings) they should <hi>do it as unto Christ, as to the Lord and not unto men, Eph.</hi> 6.5, 6 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22, 23. And if servants may do their works and dutyes of their places with such a spirit, why may not masters do theirs with the like spirit, and Parents theirs, and children theirs, and husband &amp; wives theirs, and every man &amp; euery woman perform their earthly imployments in such fear of God, in such singleness of heart, in such respect to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, that all these may be so many several acts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards God, so many parts &amp; expressions of the power &amp; practise of godliness? If Adam had not sinned, his <hi>dressing &amp; keeping the garden Gen:</hi> 2.15. would have been so: and doubtless with our blessed Saviour it was so; for he was <hi>subject</hi> to Joseph &amp; Mary as a child to his parents, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.51. and it is like he wrought with Joseph at the work of a Carpenter, and therfore he was not only called the Carpenters son, but <hi>the Carpenter Mark</hi> 6.3. and his Religious &amp; pious spirit would doubtless do all these external and earthly business with respect to God and in obedience to him. And the truth is, it is not only the object about which actions are conversant, but the heart wherewith they are done, and the grounds of doing them, with the ends that are aimed at therein, that makes them acts of Religion truly pleasing to God; So that if these be not right and spiritual, then preaching &amp; praying, hearing &amp; repeating Sermons, &amp; such like will be no better then acts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness &amp; ungodlyness, and in the issue be charged upon the doers as so many

But on the contrary, civill imployments if they be performed with spiritual minds, upon such spiritual grounds, and to such spiritual ends as they might and ought, then these imployments even these will be accounted &amp; approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, as acts of religion &amp; godlyness, or obedience towards God, and as such will be pleasing in his sight. Wherefore, to make an end of this, let it be your care, and the Lord help you that you may do it effectually, that earthly or worldly imployments may not destroy nor diminish the life and power of godlyness &amp; religion, but that the life &amp; power of religion may breath and be put forth in all your earthly &amp; civil imployments.</p>

at all fast unto me, even unto me, verse</hi> 5. It seemes their fasting was neither with hearts that desired nor aimed to honour God, nor to enioy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and therefore all their fasting is rejected, because God was not sought therein. If you do not seek the Lord in your doings and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, nor make him the end of your desires &amp; endeavours, but that there be something else that your hearts do more esteem then him, and can rest contented withall, though without him, then I must needs say your state in grace is very questionable, or rather unquestionably unsound. For <hi>if any man love the world,</hi> (sure if he love the same better then God) <hi>the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. It is (and must needs be so accounted, even) a vile dishonour &amp; notorious contempt against the alsufficient and blessed God, when any creature whether a mans self, or ought else is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected and esteemed then he. Therefore though <hi>many say, who will shew us any good,</hi> yet let your hearts say, <hi>Lord lift up the light of thy countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and this</hi> shall be to us <hi>more gladnes of heart, then in the time when their corn and their wine increased, Psal.</hi> 4.6, 7.

But it is as true, that this life can not now be had but through Christ, so that <hi>he that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12 If you desire Communion with God and shall sue unto him that you may enjoy it, (and you are most wretched &amp; accursed if you do it not) yet in such case the Lord will speak to you in language like to that of the Lord of Egypt unto Jacobs sonns, <hi>never see my face except your brother be with you,</hi> never look to see the face of God to your comfort in this or in another world, except Jesus Christ be with you, and that you present your selves before God in his Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction &amp; Mediation. You may not think, oh let such thoughts be far from you, that you can have access to God or be accepted of him, for any thing that you have wrought or can work. You know but little of your selves if you do not know, that the best of your performances have need of pardon through the blood of Christ, and therefore they are not able to purchase any pardon or favour for you in the sight of God; no, no, it is Christ alone that must do this for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you and your works must be washed in his precious blood, and so cleansed from the uncleaness that is in you &amp; them, or else both you &amp; they will be rejected of God as most abominable in his sight.

It is he that is that true <hi>Golden Altar</hi> that <hi>Sanctifies</hi> all <hi>gifts,</hi> that are offered upon him. It is he that <hi>offers Incense with the prayers of all Saints,</hi> and perfumes them with his Merits and Intercession, that so they may ascend with acceptance before God <hi>out of his hand, Rev:</hi> 8.3, 4. Wherefore of necessity you must disclaim all thought of any worth in your selves, or in the best of your doings, and look for all acceptance of your persons &amp; performances through Jesus Christ and through him alone, as that blessed Martyr <hi>John Lambert</hi> cryed out at his death, <hi>none but Christ, none but Christ.</hi> When Christ was in the world he was allwayes carefull to honour the Father, &amp; now the Father would have all men to <hi>honour him, even as they honour the Father</hi>; and we are plainly told, that <hi>he that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Son, he honoureth not the Father which sent him, John.</hi> 5.23. And of the honour that we should do unto the Son, this is the Summ, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg all our interest in God, and so in all good to be only through him and accordingly through him alone to look for it, and to behave our selves as those that so do. If you shall through grace do thus, this will be greatly for the honour of Jesus Christ, wherein you have a notable &amp; pregnant example of blessed Paul, as having gone before you in this way of giving honour to the Lord Jesus.
