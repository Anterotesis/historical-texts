            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Lord Jesus Christ. The Knowledge of Him exposes to us the <hi>Pearl of great Price</hi> in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Field. All men</hi> should know these things, but for <hi>old</hi> men to be un-instructed in them, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably disgraceful and pernicious.</p>
                  <p>Again, The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will afford an unspeakable <hi>satisfaction</hi> to our Souls. An Artist, that has met with some <hi>New,</hi> tho' but <hi>small,</hi> Discovery, with a strange <hi>Satisfaction</hi> crys out, <hi>I have found, I have found!</hi> But above all, the Knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ, is a <hi>River</hi> of <hi>honey</hi> to them that are made partakers of it; hence could the Psalmist say, in Psal. 17. 5. <hi>I will behold thy Face, I shall be satisfied.</hi> This <hi>Manna</hi> will fully answer the vast craving raging Appetites of an Immortal Soul; whatever fiery <hi>thirst</hi> was once in such a Soul, yet now, <hi>It shall never thirst.</hi> We read in Phil. 2. 1. about, <hi>Consolation in Christ;</hi> the Knowledge of Christ places us amidst the Springs and Veins of an interminable <hi>consolation.

                  <p>The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, will convey an Eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> to our Souls.

                  <p>And as the <hi>Incommunicable Names,</hi> thus also the <hi>Incommunicable Attributes</hi> of the Almighty God, belong to our Blessed Saviour.

               <p>We may Infer from hence, as we go along, <hi>how foolish, how absurd, how wicked are the</hi> Defpisers <hi>of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> If the Lord Jesus be <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>Man,</hi> and if an <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with Him be an <hi>Attainment</hi> in us, then 'twere very reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Admire Him, Adore Him, and Magnifie Him for ever; to <hi>Despise</hi> him, is of all Follies the most abominable.</p>
               <p>But are any so <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>wicked?</hi> I would to God, there were <hi>None.</hi> But I am to tell you, All that <hi>Neglect</hi> a Christ, so far <hi>Despise</hi> a Christ. Say sincerely, Have you made sure of a <hi>Christ</hi> or no? Have you Accepted him, Embraced him, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly <hi>Closed</hi> with him? Can you certainly and joyfully say, <hi>Christ is mine?</hi> It is to be doubted, that many must confess this thing to have been left undone all this while. But what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this horrible Neglect? Why, men are so taken up with <hi>secular</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> matters, that they have no leisure to acquaint themselves with a precious Jesus? A filthy <hi>Lust,</hi> and a wretched <hi>World,</hi> are the things for the sake of which, a Matchless <hi>Christ</hi> is Neglected by Impenitnent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; it may be said of them, as in Mat. 22. 5. <hi>they made light of him, and went their ways; One to his Farm, another to his Merchandise.</hi> Did not the Jews <hi>Despise</hi> a Jesus, when they preferred a <hi>Barabbas</hi> before Him? every Unbeliever does
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000534_0022_0FA6B431C99CFBB8"/>
as had as this comes unto; and there are two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible considerations to be therefore laid before all such woful Creatures.</p>
               <p>Consider first, The time will come when there shall <hi>None</hi> of you all <hi>Despise</hi> an Inestimable Jesus. As 'twas said in Isa. 13. 12. <hi>I will make a man more precious than fine gold, even a man than the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wedge of</hi> Ophir: So there will a time come, when whole <hi>Wedges,</hi> yea, and whole <hi>Mountains</hi> of the finest <hi>gold,</hi> will not be so <hi>precious</hi> to your poor Souls, as that <hi>man</hi> who is <hi>from the Beginning.</hi> When you shortly see a <hi>God</hi> angry, with you, a Soul going from you, and an <hi>Hell</hi> gaping for you, how much do you think, a <hi>Christ</hi> will then be worth? The Day is at the door, when the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>inate Sinner among us all, will pierce the very Heavens, with such a lamentable cry as that, <hi>O for a Christ, a Christ! a thousand worlds for a saving Acquaintance with Him!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider Secondly, The holy Jesus will then despise, all such as have not seasonably Repented their slighting of him. It is said in Psal. 73. 20. <hi>O Lord thou shalt despise their Image.</hi> Thus, the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> (the <hi>ghost</hi>) of such a sinner, appearing before Christ, the Judge of departed Spirits, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Petitions for pity, and pardon, and mercy, will be answered with nothing but an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Contempt. The Lord Jesus will then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the <hi>Souls</hi> of such miscreants, and when they shriek, <hi>what will become of me?</hi> He will say, <hi>Let the Devils take them, if they will, I will make no
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000534_0023_0FA6B432867A3400"/>
provision for them.</hi> He will then also contemn their <hi>prayers,</hi> and when they Supplicate unto him with never such raging Ardors, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us!</hi> He will only Reply, <hi>I know you not.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Hear, ye Despisers, and wonder, that ye may not perish.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>In a word, since you are so near to your Eternal <hi>Sabbath,</hi> you should gather a double portion of this <hi>Manna</hi> for your Souls; and follow these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in it.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Pray</hi> much for the knowledge of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000534_0027_0FA6B43AE1591048"/>
Lord Jesus Christ. Would we have this <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> we are counselled in Prov. 2. 5. <hi>cry after it;</hi> he that writ that Counsel did himself obtain <hi>knowledge</hi> by <hi>asking</hi> for it. It is said, in Jam. 1. 5. <hi>If any man lack wisdom, let him ask it.</hi> A sincere <hi>Prayer</hi> will do more, towards the <hi>Unveiling</hi> of Christs FACE, and the <hi>Unsealing</hi> our EYe, than the <hi>prayeriess Enquiries</hi> of many years. Now that the <hi>Eyes</hi> of your <hi>Bodies</hi> are almost out, O follow the Lord Jesus with such a cry for your <hi>Souls,</hi> as once that poor <hi>Son of sorrow</hi> made, <hi>Lord, that we may receive our sight!</hi> Those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that study much on their <hi>Knees,</hi> will <hi>Preach best,</hi> and those <hi>Christians</hi> that wrestle much on their <hi>Knees,</hi> will <hi>know most,</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ.

'Tis said of <hi>Moses</hi> in Exod. 19. 3. That he <hi>went up to God,</hi> and then the Lord called unto him, <hi>come up?</hi> The <hi>Jewish</hi> Expositors have this gloss upon it; That <hi>Moses</hi> first made a <hi>spiritual Ascent</hi> by <hi>Meditation,</hi> &amp; then he was favoured with a <hi>bodily Ascent</hi> unto very

God, and it is to Dy exposed unto the Vengeance of Eternal Fire. Poor <hi>old man,</hi> Thou hast already seed many bitter dismal doleful days, and had thy Heart often broken with those <hi>Evil Days;</hi> but be assured, all the past black Hours of thy life are but the <hi>beginning of sorrows;</hi> if thou dost not immediately get an Interest in <hi>Him that is from the Beginning.</hi> If an <hi>old man</hi> don't get out of <hi>old Adam</hi> before he die, he will find an <hi>old Hell</hi> prepared for him; and this also circumstanced with very dreadful Aggravations. How many <hi>sins</hi> does a man commit in one Fifty or Threescore Years! But <hi>old men,</hi> if you are still out of Christ, the God of Heaven remembers all your <hi>old sins,</hi> as fresh as if they had been done but this very morning. Our Lord said of some that were Dead and Damn'd many years before, in Joh. 10. 8. <hi>They ARE Theives.</hi> Even so, the <hi>old man</hi> out of Christ <hi>IS</hi> in the account of God, the same sinner that once he <hi>was;</hi> it may be said of him, as once it was of some, <hi>He is not purged from his old sins.</hi> But what a prodigious load of sins then lies upon such an <hi>old man,</hi> to sink him into the Sulphureous Abyss of Hell! Hence 'twas said in Isa. 65. 20. <hi>the Sinner an hundred years old, shall be Accursed.</hi> It is promised as a great blessing, to live near an <hi>hundred years;</hi> but if a man be a <hi>Sinner</hi> at that Age, his <hi>Age</hi> will be but a <hi>Curse</hi> unto him, he shall have cause to wish that he had never seen such an <hi>Age</hi> as that.

heavier Loads of Confusion and Vexation than those that had not lived so long; that as 'twas said of one, <hi>It had been good for that man, he had never been born;</hi> so it may be said of this man, <hi>It had been good for him, he had never lived half so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years in the world.</hi> When he is Roaring in the Fiery Vaults below, <hi>I am tormented in this Flame!</hi> he will add this Lamentation &amp; Execration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Why dyed I not from the Womb? why did I not give up the Ghost when I came out of the Besly?</hi> It was of old given, as a Resolve to the problem, <hi>Quis miserrimus Senex egenus.</hi> What is the <hi>most miserable sight in the world?</hi> Answer, <hi>an old man in want;</hi> an old man without <hi>bread.</hi> But I'le tell you a far more miserable sight; and that is, <hi>An Old man in sin;</hi> an Old man without <hi>Christ,</hi> an Old man without <hi>Grace;</hi> an Old man tumbling down into the pits of Eternal Desolation.</p>

No, <hi>He hath said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee.</hi> The Philosopher said, Before <hi>Old Age, my care was to live well; but now</hi> under <hi>Old Age, all my care is to Dy well.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you have nothing else to take any <hi>care</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; let the promise encourage you to confine your Cares unto <hi>Dying in the Lord.</hi> 'Tis hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to see with what a possession the Devil holds the Soul of many a poor <hi>Old</hi> man, when he has made them lay aside their dependance upon that unfailing promise of God. The very design of the Apostle in our Context here, is to correct the sin of <hi>worldiness,</hi> particularly in Aged Men. Let them that may have done with <hi>Hopes,</hi> have also done with <hi>Cares</hi> about the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Rejoice that <hi>when</hi> your Change comes, you shall go to the Enjoyments and Embraces of <hi>Him that is from the Beginning.</hi> Say with Aged <hi>Paul,</hi> in Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I desire to Dislodge, and be with Christ, which is by far the best of all.</hi> Death is a fort of a <hi>Cloud</hi> now before your Eyes; but there is a <hi>Bright</hi> as well as a <hi>Dark</hi> side of that Cloud. Look on it, not as a <hi>Destroyer</hi> of your <hi>life,</hi> but as a <hi>Messenger</hi> of your Lord; it is but a Waggon that our <hi>Joseph,</hi> our <hi>Jesus,</hi> will shortly send for you, to fetch you thither, where you shall <hi>behold his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> O be Ravished at the Thought of this, and <hi>Rejoice in the Hope of the glory of God.</hi> If it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

While I was preparing for the Press, one of those little Books which I have sent abroad, the <hi>Devil</hi> from the mouth of a possessed person, in the Audience of several standers by, threatned me with much <hi>Disgrace</hi> for what I was about.

The Devils are <hi>many</hi> for <hi>Number;</hi> their Troops amount unto many <hi>Regions.</hi> We read in Luc 8. 30. about a <hi>Legion</hi> of them, that kept a Garrison in one single person; though a <hi>Legion</hi> contained perhaps twelve thousand and five hundred in it. Very probably there are far more Devils than men in the world; and they swarm like the Frogs of <hi>Egypt</hi> in every one of our Chambers.

                  <p>Secondly, We may also look upon the Devils as a Wicked <hi>One.</hi> The Greek word here notes one who <hi>takes pains</hi> to do amiss.

                  <p>That the Devil is the Enemy of us <hi>all,</hi> is a thing very sensible unto us; and his <hi>power</hi> is called in the sacred Oracles, <hi>the power of the</hi> Enemy.

                  <p>If you ask, <hi>why,</hi> the Devil is our Enemy, the Reply is likewise easy; 'tis from his malignant <hi>spite</hi> at <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>spleen</hi> at <hi>man:</hi> The Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure that the Name of God should be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the world; now 'tis our priviledge that we both do the <hi>Service</hi> of God, and bear the <hi>Image</hi> of God; but because the Devil would be in the Throne of God, therefore he is unwilling that God should have any <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Subjects</hi> upon the face of the Earth. Moreover, the Devils cannot brook it, that any should be above them; as 'tis intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>pride was the condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Because he sees man <hi>Saved,</hi> and himself <hi>Damned;</hi> man <hi>Advanced,</hi> and himself <hi>Degraded;</hi> hence he will do us all the Hurt he can.</p>
                  <p>But he that is thus an Enemy to <hi>all</hi> men, is to <hi>young</hi> men, more eminently so. As the Apostle speaks to <hi>Christians,</hi> thus I may to <hi>young</hi> men, in I Pet. 5. 8. <hi>The Devil is your Adversary;</hi> young men, the Devil is remarkably ambitious to make a prey of <hi>your</hi> precious and immortal Souls. The Devil is an <hi>Abaddon and Apollyon;</hi> for to give him his <hi>due,</hi> to him does appertain the Name, which the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> justly puts upon a <hi>great Son</hi> of his. But <hi>young</hi> men do most of all find him such an one; that as our Lord said unto young <hi>Peter,</hi> in Luc 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

31. <hi>Behold, Satan hath desired to have you.</hi> So may it be said unto <hi>young</hi> persons, <hi>Behold, Satan is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly desirous to have you in his ravenous, devouring Jaws.</hi> The Devil goes ranging, raging, roaring about the world; and <hi>young</hi> men are those whom he is most concerned for the catching and spoiling of. Some have observed, That most of the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations recorded in the Scripture, still fell upon <hi>younger</hi> men. Be sure the Tempter falls foul upon them with a particular eagerness, and energy. And this for two causes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis first, because the Devil sees a great <hi>likelihood</hi> of prevailing on <hi>young</hi> men. Young men have much <hi>matter</hi> in them, for the <hi>Devil</hi> to work upon; there is much <hi>folly</hi> in <hi>young</hi> men, 'tis said in Prov. 7. 7. <hi>I beheld among the simple ones, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

He thinks with himself, <hi>This rash</hi> young <hi>man will suspect none of my hooks and snares; now will be consider his latter End.</hi> He thinks, <hi>This wild young man will take me at my wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and never consider the Chambers of death, which I am bringing him unto.</hi> For this cause he sets upon <hi>young</hi> men with greater <hi>expectation;</hi> and hence u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually with greater <hi>frequency</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> than he does assault other Ages. The <hi>Lusts</hi> of <hi>young</hi> men after those three baits of the Devil, <hi>pleasures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000534_0062_0FA6B692032924A0"/>
grandeur,</hi> are more lively and stirring; and hence a particular activity of Hell shall be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis because the Devil sees a great <hi>advantage</hi> in prevailing on <hi>young</hi> men. The gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>young</hi> men thereunto, is a thing most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally useful to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Devil. It se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Devil in their own Souls. If men are converted unto God, it is usually in the <hi>morning</hi> of their days, if they do not then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Manna</hi> of Christ and Grace, 'tis a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one but they miss of it for ever. God says in Eccl. 12. 1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy Youth;</hi> and the devil knows, that if the Creator be not then <hi>Remembred,</hi> it is likely that he I be <hi>forgotten</hi> for ever. The <hi>strong armed</hi> one is very studious to get and keep a <hi>strong hold</hi> in the Soul of a <hi>young</hi> man; as being sensible, that in <hi>Age,</hi> it will be harder to cast him out. We read in the Gospel about a very <hi>painful Dispossession;</hi> but this was the reason of it, Marc. 9. 21. <hi>This evil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit came unto him of a child.</hi> If the devil make sure of a wretched sinner, till his <hi>youth</hi> he over, 'twill not be easy to eject him; every <hi>new Act</hi> of sin, has given him a <hi>new hold</hi> of the Soul. The Devil haunts the soul of a <hi>young</hi> man, giving interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the motions of the blessed Jesus, &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before our time?</hi> But Alas, if the Devil been't shaken off, before <hi>the time</hi> that age grows upon <hi>us,</hi> he will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000534_0063_0FA6B692B6096B78"/>
ordinarily defie the holy Spirit upon <hi>him;</hi> and he will have a confidence that any <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>lame</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils will be strong enough to maintain the Castle, against our glorious <hi>David.</hi> It also promotes the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the Devil among their neighbours <hi>Young</hi> men have a special fitness for the Devils <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>our, and more success; they keep more compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and so they diffuse their poison further, than can be said of other people. When that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> had work to be done, we find in <hi>Dan.</hi> 1. 4. he will have <hi>young</hi> men brought before him, <hi>skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge.</hi> Thus the furious <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> of Hell, singles out <hi>young</hi> men, that <hi>their</hi> skill and <hi>their</hi> wit, and <hi>their</hi> vigour help to carry on his Affairs, the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually. Good old <hi>Austin</hi> therefore said unto a young Gentleman, <hi>Diabolus cupit abs te ornari;</hi> the devil would be glad if such Accomplishments as yours might be employed for him.</p>
                  <p>From this 'tis, that all <hi>young</hi> men may have their hearts aking to think, how much they are exposed unto the devil; as 'twas cry'd unto that Champion. <hi>The Philistines be upon thee</hi> Sampson; so may it be alarm'd into the ears of young men, <hi>The Philistines of Hell are your peculiar Enemies, O young men, and those Enemies are upon you every day.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>First, That Religious <hi>young</hi> men are victorious over the devil, is evident from the <hi>instances</hi> of the <hi>victory.</hi> To instance a little,</p>
                  <p>First, Religious <hi>young</hi> men there are who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the devil, in respect of the general and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Estates</hi> which they are escaped from. What in the condition of them that continue in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate Estate? Alas, 'tis that of <hi>Band-slaves,</hi> and <hi>Captives</hi> to the devil. It may be said of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed Sinners, as in a 2 pet. 2. 19. <hi>They are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrcome and brought into Bondage;</hi> and it may be said of them, as in 2 Tim. 2. 26. <hi>They are taken Captive,</hi> (and as it were carried away <hi>alive) by the Devil at his will.</hi> The devil has conquered all unrenewed Sinners, and he does horribly lead them, act them, rule over them; he is a sort of a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>God</hi> unto them. But when a Sinner in Converted, he is brought out of this miserable state; he is, according to that in Acts. 26 18. <hi>Turned from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> The devil does not any longer domineer over a Sinner, that is <hi>born again;</hi> he gets rid of his former <hi>Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> like <hi>Israel</hi> escaped from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Armies. Now 'tis the priviledge of some <hi>young</hi> men, that they are thus brought home to God. We read of one that could say in I King. 18. 11. <hi>I fear the Lord from my youth;</hi> now to <hi>fear</hi> the Lord is to <hi>fight</hi> the devil, with a blessed victory indeed.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000534_0065_0FA6B696D6D6EC80"/>
There have been young <hi>Josiahs,</hi> that have <hi>sought the Lord while they were yet young;</hi> there have bin young, <hi>Davids,</hi> that have had God for their <hi>Hope;</hi> their <hi>Trust,</hi> their <hi>Teacher</hi> from their <hi>youth;</hi> and there have been young <hi>Samuels,</hi> that have been <hi>waiting</hi> on God, and <hi>bearing</hi> from him, in their early days As one says, <hi>Wisdom, gravity, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, temperance, are not always confined unto them, that have wrinkled faces, furrowed Brows, dim eyes, palsey hands, leaning on a Staff.</hi> So may we say of this divine <hi>victory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Religious <hi>young</hi> men there are, who overcome the devil, in respect of the particular <hi>Trials</hi> that are made upon them. The devil makes these and those particular Batteries upon <hi>young</hi> men; he says, <hi>I'le now trip up the heels of this young man,</hi> and immediately applies all his Engines to draw the poor <hi>young</hi> man into some <hi>abominable thing.</hi> The devil is conquered in such Encounters, when he can't proceed and prevail in them; 'tis said in Jam. 4. 7. <hi>Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> The Devil is meerly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, when a tempted Soul, silences his Banters, with saying like our Lord, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> or as <hi>Job</hi> answered a Fool, <hi>Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.</hi> As on the other side, when <hi>David</hi> sends for a Mistriss, when <hi>Peter</hi> denie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Cause of God, then the Devil gets the day, and goes with flying colours out of the Field. But it is the priviledge of some <hi>young</hi> men, that they
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000534_0066_0FA6B698EEAB3460"/>
come off well in their spiritual Combates. We read of such a <hi>young</hi> man in Gen 39. 9. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sollicited unto sin, vanquish'd and extinguish'd the sollicitation, by answering. <hi>How shall I do this wickedness, and sin against God?</hi> There are <hi>young</hi> men that won't be gull'd by the proposals of the Devil; but know how to fli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ht them and scorn them all, and with an holy bravery, make him weary of tendring them. Some <hi>young</hi> men are before all the Devils of <hi>Hell,</hi> as young <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was before those of <hi>Earth; Defenced Cities, Iron Pillars, Brazen Walls;</hi> the devils <hi>fight against them, but cannot prevail against them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That it is a singular and special <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> unto <hi>young</hi> men to be thus victorious, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the <hi>qualities</hi> of the <hi>Enemy.</hi> It is said in Prov. 16. 32, <hi>He that rules his own spirit, is better than he that taketh a City;</hi> and indeed there have been those great <hi>Plunderers</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> whom we call <hi>Conquerors,</hi> in the world, that have <hi>taken Cities,</hi> when they could not subdue the passions &amp; Phrensies of their own <hi>Spirits.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But what is it then to be Conquerors over those vast throngs of <hi>Spirits</hi> which assail us from the world <hi>which is not seen, and is Eternal?</hi> Indeed the victory is not purely <hi>our own,</hi> it is said in Rom. 8. 37. <hi>We are more than Conquerors, through him that

                     </hi> But you have been too hard for a <hi>stronger Lion,</hi> than that which Roared upon <hi>Sampson</hi> of old.

                  <p>The Devils have us at a mighty disadvantage, upon this account; it is said in Eph.6. 12. <hi>We fight not against flesh and blood, but against principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities &amp; powers, and</hi> spiritual <hi>wickednesses;</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are <hi>spiritual,</hi> and that renders them very <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful;</hi> they can <hi>smite</hi> us when we can't <hi>see</hi> them; they can attack us &amp; surprise us, by undiscoverable stratagems. Add unto this, That the devils which fall upon us, may say, as they said in that poor man of old, <hi>We are many;</hi> and these <hi>many</hi> devils have our hearts on their parts; there is in us a <hi>party</hi> for them. 'Tis a piece of most Heavenly Gallantry to overcome such an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You have overcome a <hi>subtle</hi> Enemy. He has those things that are called in 2 Cor. 2. 11. <hi>His Devices.</hi>

There are above twenty names put upon the Devil in the Scripture; and not a few of them are forch'd from his <hi>Deceitfulness.</hi> Hence particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, this <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> is called in Rev. 12. 9. <hi>The old Serpent;</hi> he has not only the <hi>paw</hi> of the <hi>Lion,</hi> but also the <hi>head</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and he has <hi>wiles</hi> as well as <hi>darts</hi> to molest us with.

               <p>Avoid all <hi>Uncleanness</hi> whatsoever; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, beware of having light thoughts about some sorts of <hi>Uncleanness</hi> wherein many young people have been so infatuated as to excuse themselves.

This is a <hi>defensive Armour</hi> against the Devil, which better befits every young person, than that of <hi>Saul</hi> did the young <hi>David</hi> of old. But there is one <hi>offensive weapon,</hi> with which we are to manage our Combate against the Devil; and there are two <hi>Stratagems</hi> to be annexed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>In short, there are two particular Directions, for our Encounters with the <hi>Wicked One;</hi> and the quoting of two Texts may lay them suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently before us.</p>
               <p>The first proper Direction for us, is that in Eph. 6. 17. <hi>Take the Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</hi> Compare our Context, I Joh. 2. 14. If young men would <hi>overcome the wicked one,</hi> they must have the <hi>word of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Bible is a <hi>spiritual sword</hi> shaped and formed by the Inspirations of the <hi>Eternal Spirit;</hi> and for a Conflict with the <hi>Infernal Spirit,</hi> it is a <hi>sword</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I may say as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah's, There is none like it.</hi> When the blackest and fiercest of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils made an Onset upon our blessed Saviour, and this with all the three Batteries which he once fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overthrew the first <hi>Adam</hi> withal, how did our Lord <hi>overcome the wicked one?</hi> It was by reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, <hi>It is written,</hi> and by holding up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him the <hi>Scripture</hi> of God. It is remarkable that all the <hi>swords</hi> or <hi>words</hi> used by our Lord for the <hi>overcoming</hi> of the devil were fetched from that one Book of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> but how rich a Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000534_0088_0FA6B6B17A1D9FE0"/>
may the whole Bible then be unto us?</p>
               <p>Let all young people then study the Word of God; we read in Psal 119. 9. Of <hi>a young man</hi> thus cleansing of his way. There was once a young Gentlewoman, that before she was <hi>Nine years old</hi> could say, all the New Testament by <hi>Heart.</hi> O that all young persons would every day seriously and pensively Read the Bible, till their Hearts were become, as <hi>Jerome</hi> call'd his Friends, <hi>The Libraries of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Young people, see that you become ready at <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> and learn to Fence with a sentence of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> against all the passes that the devil is making at you. All the <hi>Commandments,</hi> all the <hi>Promises,</hi> all the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Bible, will be like so many <hi>swords all-edge,</hi> for your service against the <hi>wicked one.</hi> Let the devil see, that you bear in mind what is <hi>written</hi> in Eccl. 11. 9, in Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. and other such awful places. These <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens</hi> will be more terrible to the Devil, than the Hand-writing on the wall, was to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Emperour; such is his <hi>Antipathy</hi> to them, that if you thus <hi>Resist the Devil, he will flee from you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second proper Direction for us, is in Mat. 26. 41. <hi>Watch and Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Devil is busy with us, 'tis by these two Duties that we may overcome him and his Temptations.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Be watchful.</hi> Or, in <hi>Solomons</hi> Dialect, <hi>Be fearful.</hi> Here, quite contrary to what is in other Warfares, The best <hi>Souldier</hi> is he that <hi>feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:000534_0089_0FA6B6B2374EFB38"/>
ways.</hi> Be always on your guard; and continually suspect that the <hi>wicked one</hi> has an <hi>ill design</hi> upon you. Be so watchful, as to keep an Eye upon the <hi>Season</hi> which the devil may be most likely to make an <hi>Hour of temptation.</hi> Is it with you a time of <hi>Security?</hi> Are you grown formal, flighty, weary in Religion? Are your Graces in a slumber? Then wake presently; if you ben't now very watchful, the Devil will serve you, as the Watchmen did the <hi>sleepy</hi> Soul, in Cant. 5. 7. <hi>Smite you, wound you.</hi> Or, are you very confident of your selves? are you ready to say, <hi>I shall never be moved?</hi> Then also wake pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; for if you be not now watchful, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will break your bones, as much as he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous <hi>Peters,</hi> when our Lord said unto him, in Luc. 22. 31. <hi>Satan has desired to have you.</hi> Or, Is it with you a time of <hi>prosperity?</hi> Are you <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly</hi> under the smiles of God? Do Riches and Honours come in upon you? Be sure the Devil will now have a blow at you, if you be not very watchful: this was wise <hi>Agurs</hi> apprehension. For this cause 'tis said in Prov. 1. 32. <hi>The prosperity of Fools shall destroy them;</hi> it furnisheth the Devil with opportunities. When we have an high Sail, he will try to overset us. Or, are you <hi>Inwardly</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the Light of Gods Countenance? Have you newly been <hi>sealed</hi> with Assurances of his Favour? Be sure you shall now also find that the Devil will not let you alone. When <hi>Paul</hi> had been in Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we find in 2 Cor. 12. 7. he is not long free from the <hi>Buffetings of the Devil.</hi> If we have been
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000534_0090_0FA6B6B308B4FD18"/>
in the Mount with God, it is well if you been't quickly pushed upon breaking both Tables of the Law. And yet also perswade your selves that in a time of <hi>Adversity</hi> too, you shan't be free from <hi>Temptation:</hi> He that fell upon our Lord, <hi>when he was hungry,</hi> will fall upon us <hi>when we are troubled.</hi> You had now need beware lest you either <hi>despise the chastening of the Lord,</hi> or <hi>faint, when rebuked of Him;</hi> for you will be shrowdly tempted unto both of these.</p>
               <p>Be so watchful as likewise to mind the <hi>Subject</hi> which the devil visits with his Temptations. 'Tis the <hi>Heart,</hi> that the devil falls upon; wherefore, as the wise man says in Prov. 4. 25. <hi>Keep they heart with all diligence.</hi> Be vigilant about the <hi>tempers</hi> &amp;<hi>postures</hi> of your own hearts, take notice of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss</hi> which is upon them. Know what part you are most <hi>vulnerable</hi> in; and be not like those to whom our Saviour said, <hi>Ye know not what spirit you are of.</hi> That part of your disposition, which like a <hi>Dlilah,</hi> is most likely to betray you into the hands of the hellish <hi>Philistines,</hi> be most exact in your observations of; and let not the devil therein circumvent you, and entangle you.</p>
               <p>Finally, Be watchful as to keep always alive within you; <hi>a sense of the Love of God in Christ.</hi> That is the <hi>peace</hi> of which we are told in Phil. 4. 7. <hi>It shall keep our hearts;</hi> 'tis a military word, <hi>To keep as in Garrison.</hi> O get a rellish of the divine Love in the Mission and Passion of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in our admission to the saving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000534_0091_0FA6B6B3B6BFA3E8"/>
thereof; this will be a sort of a <hi>garrison</hi> for our Souls, and free us very much from the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of our Temptations; it will not be easy for the devil now to disturb the serenity and satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and holy inclinations of our minds. If we begin at any time therefore to lose the lively sense of this <hi>Love,</hi> be so watchful as immediately to recover it; and so, tho' the <hi>Archers</hi> of Hell may sorely grieve us, yet like young <hi>Joseph,</hi> we may have our <hi>Bow abide in strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Be prayerful;</hi> and like <hi>Paul, beseech the Lord thrice.</hi> He that would be little in <hi>Temptation,</hi> let him be much in <hi>Supplication.</hi> When the devil is galling of you, do like those Warriours in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

could not here her there. Why, see to it, that by your daily prayers you <hi>Run to the Rock;</hi> a Dove in the <hi>clefts of that Rock,</hi> will be defended against all the Vultures of Hell that would seize upon it. But unto Prayer, joyn a true Faith in the <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ; look upon <hi>that</hi> as the <hi>meritorious</hi> and also as the <hi>exemplary</hi> cause of all your Successes against the Devil. A filly Papist, will sign himself with a <hi>Cross,</hi> that the devil may have no power over him. Behold, the right way of signing our selves with the <hi>Cross.</hi> Encourage our selves from the view of the Lord Jesus hanging there.</p>
               <p>And let this be accompanied with a strong Faith in the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ. Let that be the <hi>Fountain</hi> from whence we derive all our strength against the devil. A good woman troubled by a devil, said unto him, <hi>Satan, don't meddle with a poor silly woman; but if thou hast any thing to say, speak it unto my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, the blessed Jesus, and see whether he cannot answer thee.</hi> O let us beg the Lord Jesus to give us a little of that <hi>Grace,</hi> by which he did himself once heat the devil here; and let us hope in Him us in that Redeemer, <hi>Who knows how to succour the Tempted.</hi>

our <hi>little</hi> Children. Religious <hi>Children</hi> when they are sitting perhaps upon the knee of an Earthly <hi>Father,</hi> may remember that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Father,</hi> whom they belong unto; namely, <hi>A Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in what Respects may gracious <hi>little</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren call God, <hi>Their Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children may look upon God as their <hi>Father,</hi> in respect of <hi>Creation;</hi> for indeed all <hi>Creatures</hi> thus have Him, for their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 'Tis intimated in Job 38. 28. He is the <hi>Father of the Rain, and of the Dew.</hi> But he is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thus a <hi>Father</hi> unto all <hi>Spirits;</hi> it is said, in Heb. 12. 9. <hi>He is the Father of Spirits;</hi> and thus the <hi>Angels,</hi> are styled, <hi>The Sons of God.</hi> Hence <hi>man</hi> also, every <hi>man</hi> may say unto God, <hi>our Father;</hi> we all owe unto God, our <hi>Production</hi> and <hi>Original;</hi> and, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the words of the Greek Poet, <hi>Aratus;</hi> in Acts 17. 18. <hi>We are his Offspring.</hi> Thus, little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren should betimes be sensible of this, <hi>I am newly come out of the hands of the great God; it is God that made me, and shap'd me, and bestow'd my life and my Being on me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children may look upon God as their <hi>Father,</hi> in respect of <hi> Suscepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> He <hi>undertaketh</hi> for them. God owns a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> unto gracious little Children, by <hi>underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> of their <hi>Patronage.</hi> Indeed, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and a consent of them concerning it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of a <hi>Father</hi> for them; and they say to him, as in Isa. 63. 17. <hi>Doubtless, thou art our Father.</hi> They see that their natural <hi>Fathers</hi> cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all their <hi>wants,</hi> and Remove all their <hi>woes,</hi> and prevent all their <hi>fears;</hi> and hence the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, upon an humble Request of theirs, becomes concerned as a <hi>Father</hi> for them. 'Tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> especially, when they have no other <hi>fathers</hi> to look after them; 'tis said of God, in Psal. 69. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. <hi>He is a father of the fatherless.</hi> When gracious little Children are left as <hi>Orphans</hi> in a wide and a wild world, they may assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>My best father is yet alive; tho my father do for sake me, yet the Lord will take me up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as their Father, in respect of <hi>Adoption.</hi> God in his free grace, accounts them his Children, through the <hi>Sonship of</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ; &amp; thus, as 'tis said in Joh. 1. 11. <hi>They have power to be called the Sons of God.</hi> Gracious little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are <hi>united</hi> unto Him that is the Saviour of the World. As <hi>young</hi> as they are, the Almighty Lord of Lords, and King of Kings counts them <hi>old</hi> enough to be married unto Himself. In the Ancient, Eternal, Well-ordered <hi>Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> the Lord Jesus Christ was made a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick person, representing of all his chosen Ones; he was thus constituted by an Eternal <hi>Agreement</hi> between God and Him; and gracious little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren say their <hi>Amen,</hi> to that Agreement; those little <hi>

the Lord Jesus Christ, and cry unto him, <hi>O be our Surety for good.</hi> Now Christ and they are <hi>one;</hi> the <hi>Reck'ning</hi> of God from all Eternity, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in fulness of Time, hath made them so; and thus these little Children become the Children of the great God. For the Name of God is, <hi>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> the Word of God is, <hi>He shall, cry unto me, Thou art my Father.</hi> It now follows, that all gracious little Children arrive unto that Advancement, in Rom.8.16.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Children of God, and joint Heirs with Christ.</hi> Now they have a <hi>New Name</hi> upon them, and the Lord Jesus now speaks unto them in such Heart-breaking terms as those, <hi>My Father is your Father, and my God is your God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children may look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as their <hi>Father,</hi> in respect of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> 'Tis the preheminence of all Converted persons; that they are <hi>Born again by the Word of God.</hi> But who is their <hi>Father?</hi> We are told in John 1. 13. <hi>They that believe, are born of God;</hi> and there are some <hi>little Children</hi> to be found among true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. These are not by <hi>generation</hi> the Children of God; for thus God is a <hi>Father</hi> only to the Lord Jesus Christ. But they are by <hi>Regeneration</hi> so. The Almighty God says to the Lord Jesus Christ as <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joseph</hi> of old, <hi>Thy Sons shall be mine.</hi> But as for little Children that are brought home to God, by the <hi>Renewing of the Holy</hi> Ghost, these are the Children of the Lord Jesus Christ; they are call'd in Isa. 53. 10.

                  <p>Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children endeavour to <hi>Know</hi> God, as thus an Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p>But what is implied in this <hi>Knowledge?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children would not be without the saving and sincere <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God. They <hi>know</hi> the truth of that in Joh. 17 3. <hi>This is Life Eternal, to know the only true God;</hi> they <hi>know</hi> the truth of that in Prov. 19. 2. <hi>For the Soul to be without knowledge, it is not good.</hi> And this awakens them to seek the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, with such <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>cries</hi> as the Wise man in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> advised his Children unto. Gracious <hi>little</hi> Children complain of themselves, as <hi>he</hi> did of old, in Prov. 30. 3. <hi>I have not the knowledge of the Holy;</hi> and so they become willing to learn; they are willing to learn what <hi>God is,</hi> what His Three <hi>Persons.</hi> and what His Infinite <hi>Perfections</hi> are; they are willing to learn what He <hi>does</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> as Creating and Preserving of all things; and as Redeeming his Elect; they are willing to learn what He <hi>says</hi> in the <hi>Word,</hi> what Mysteries, what Histories, what Commandments, what Promises, and Threatnings He has therein set before us. They think that without some <hi>Knowledge</hi> of these things they must grind like <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>mpson</hi> with his Eyes put out by Hellish <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:000534_0105_0FA6B6C8062BA6A0"/>
and they tremble at such a Doom as that, in Isa. 27. 11. It is a people of <hi>no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; wherefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no Favour.</hi> There is no need of whipping them to their <hi>Catechisms;</hi> to be learning of <hi>them,</hi> is as Pleasant and welcome an Exercise unto these Children, as any that they can be put upon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gracious little Children would not be without an assured <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest and the sweetest sense, God is indeed a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to them; they would have an Assurance of their being <hi>Adopted</hi> and <hi>Regenerated</hi> by the Lord. They look upon God, as the best <hi>Father</hi> in the World; and as the son of <hi>Jesse</hi> sometimes could say, in I Sam. 18. 23. <hi>Seemeth it unto you a light thing to be a Kings Son-in-law?</hi> So 'tis not a <hi>light thing</hi> in the Opinion of these, to become the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of that God, who is <hi>a great King,</hi> and whose <hi>Name is Dreadful.</hi> Gracious little Children are sensible, that they have been the children of wrath, and the Children <hi>of Hell,</hi> and that while they were in their sins they have had the Devil for their <hi>father;</hi> but when they read the eighth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> they count it a thing of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible importance for them, to get into the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Sons of God.</hi> It affects them to see how the children of men are divided, in 1 Joh. 3. 10. Either <hi>the children of God,</hi> or the <hi>children of the Devil;</hi> and they can by no means bear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the children of so black a <hi>father</hi> as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000534_0106_0FA6B6C8B78D6F80"/>
is. Hence they do most heartily, readily, cheerfully close with the motions which the Son of God makes unto them; and as it is said in Gal 3. 26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God, by faith in Jesus Christ;</hi> so, these Children do by <hi>faith</hi> accept of the Lord Jesus Christ as offered unto them in the Gospel; 'tis the language of their Souls, <hi>Blessed</hi> Lord <hi>Jesus, be thou mine, and let me be Thine; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Gracious little Children study to pay unto God the <hi>Acknowledgements</hi> which are due unto a <hi>Father,</hi> yea, unto an <hi>Heavenly Father.</hi> The Carriage of Children to a <hi>father</hi> is imitated in their Deportment before the Lord. And,</p>
                  <p>First, They place on God, the <hi>Affection</hi> which is due unto a <hi>father.</hi> A <hi>father,</hi> is a Name all made up of <hi>love.</hi> As the <hi>fatherly love</hi> of God unto gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious little Children is very marvellous; for thus 'tis said in 1 Joh 3. 1. <hi>Behold, what manner of love, the Father has bestow'd upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God!</hi> So the <hi>Filial Love</hi> of these Children unto <hi>God,</hi> is likewise, <hi>Behold, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of love!</hi> They love none so much as <hi>God,</hi> but tho' they love their <hi>fathers</hi> more than all Creatures, yet they love their <hi>God</hi> with greater out-goings of their little Souls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They pay to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Reverence</hi> which is due unto a <hi>father.</hi> They dare not therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of the Lord; nor Talk, nor Sport, nor Sleep, when they should be worshipping of Him. 'Tis the voice of <hi>God</hi> in Mal. 1. 6. <hi>A son honoureth his father; if then I be a Father, where is my Honour?</hi> Gracious little Children give unto their God the <hi>Honour</hi> of a <hi>father;</hi> if they speak <hi>of</hi> God, it is in a most humble, serious, awful strain, they will not say, <hi>O God,</hi> or, <hi>O Lord,</hi> or say, <hi>God bless me,</hi> and, Lord <hi>bless me,</hi> with a frothy, carnal, heedless interjection; if they speak <hi>to</hi> God, it is with an exceeding veneration: while they are at prayer, they compose themselves unto a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Attention and Intention of Soul; once more, if they hear <hi>from</hi> God, they set themselves as in the sight of him, who is <hi>greatly to be feared and had in Reverence;</hi> while they are in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies where the Word of God is Preach'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they would not use the least wildeness for a thousand worlds.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They yield to God the <hi>submission</hi> which is due unto a <hi>father.</hi> They will by no means dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the will of God, but render a most full, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, absolute Obedience thereunto. Our Lord Jesus could say unto God, as in Luc. 22. 42. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not my will, but thine be done;</hi> and gracious little Children will herein say after that <hi>Holy Child Jesus.</hi> As for the will of God in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> they are very ready to <hi>do</hi> it; they say, <hi>Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do;</hi> and they <hi>do</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they understand he does <hi>bid;</hi> they would fain do, <hi>The thing that good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:000534_0108_0FA808C108B34F68"/>
has required of them.</hi> As for the will of God in his <hi>Providence,</hi> they are very ready to <hi>bear</hi> it; they say <hi>The will of the Lord be done!</hi> and they bear what strokes, what pains, what sorrows, his <hi>Rod</hi> may lash them with; so they <hi>are subject unto the father of Spirits, and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They have a <hi>Dependance</hi> on God as <hi>Children</hi> on a <hi>Father.</hi> Gracious Children are <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Children, they won't easily let a day pass them without <hi>praying</hi> to God, and they go unto God as unto a <hi>father</hi> in their prayers. There was a very little Child whose prayers were so frequent and so fervent, that a Neighbour which discovered them cryed out, <hi>The prayers of that Child will sink me to the bottom of Hell.</hi> Gracious little Children will <hi>pray</hi> at such a rate as to condemn the <hi>prayer l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But how is that? briefly,</p>
                  <p>Gracious little Children, will use to pray with <hi>Boldness.</hi> As a Child will go <hi>boldly</hi> to his Father upon all occasions; thus will these Children be ever now and then coming to <hi>God,</hi> and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks in Heb. 4. 16. <hi>Come boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> When they see the infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Purity of <hi>God,</hi> they do with much fear approach unto Him; but when they see, that <hi>God</hi> is their <hi>father,</hi> this does again encourage them. They been't loth to go tell this <hi>father</hi> of theirs, what they all, in all of their Distresses; no, they go to <hi>God;</hi> and cry, <hi>Abba, father!</hi> and in <hi>all things make known Requests unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:000534_0109_0FA6B6CB678877D8"/>
Again, gracious little Children, will use to pray with <hi>Comfort.</hi> These Children are <hi>comfortably</hi> perswaded of success in their Cryes to <hi>God,</hi> as Children in theirs unto a Father; and they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue at that rate, in Mat. 7. 11. <hi>If ye, being E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, know how to give good gifts unto your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how much more shall your</hi> Father <hi>which is in Heaven.</hi> As L<hi>uther</hi> would say, <hi>That word,</hi> my Father, <hi>used by a praying Saint, all the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick and Eloquence in the world could never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual it.</hi> Thus, these, when they say unto <hi>God, my father,</hi> they promise themselves that no good thing shall be deny'd unto them. Since <hi>God</hi> is their Father, they expect that their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will Pity them, that their Father will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel them, that their Father will supply them; and make them happy for-ever.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They have a <hi>Resemblance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>

                  <p>To <hi>Female Children,</hi> I might mention, <hi>Ann Greenough,</hi> the Daughter of Mr. <hi>William Greenough</hi> Deceased; who left the world, when she was but about five years old, and yet gave astonishing Discoveries of a Regard unto God and Christ &amp; her own Soul, before she went away: When she heard any thing about the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> she would be strangely transported and ravished in her Spirit at it; and had an unspeakable Delight in <hi>Catechising.</hi> She would put strange <hi>Questions</hi> about eternal things, and make <hi>Answers</hi> her self that were extreamly pertinent. Once particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly she asked, <hi>Are not we dead in Sin?</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently added, <hi>But I will take this way, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ shall make me alive.</hi> She was very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and constant in <hi>secret prayer,</hi> and could not with any patience be interrupted in it. She told her gracious Mother, <hi>That she there prayed for her!</hi> and was covetous of being with her Mother, when she imagined such Duties to be going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When she fell sick at last of a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, she would not by any sports be diverted from the Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> wherein she took such pleasure that she did not care to hear of any thing else.

Indeed-sundry <hi>such</hi> little Children, have there been among us; but now, as he that heard a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>two</hi> faithful Friends, presently said, <hi>I would I were a third with them!</hi> So, I hope every one of the <hi>little</hi> Children that have seen these Examples, will say, <hi>O that I may be a third! O that I might be like one of these happy Children!</hi> But,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are <hi>few</hi> little Children, that have and own God for their Father. Indeed, those few little Children, that are descended of Believing Pareuts, have the same <hi>God</hi> that their Parents have chosen both for themselves &amp; theirs, until they are <hi>old</hi> enough to <hi>revoke</hi> or to <hi>renew</hi> the choice; the Children are included in what their Parents <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>have,</hi> until they can stand upon their own Legs; and at what age that is, our God has not, that I remember, expresly spoken; which ought therefore to hasten the cares of little Children, about their own Salvation. Hence we read concerning the children of Believers in I. Cor. 7. 14. <hi>They are holy;</hi> God accepts them, &amp; regards them, as consecrated unto himself. But of those little Children that are come to a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of acting <hi>deliberately</hi> and <hi>rationally</hi> about E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Matters, how few are there that carefully say, <hi>Let God be a father to me!</hi> We may with a special Reference to <hi>little</hi> Children speak in such terms as those, in Psal. 14. 2,3. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to see of there were any that did understand and seek God; they are all gone aside, they are all-together become

                     </hi> or it may be complained as in Isa. 1. 4. <hi>A seed of evil Doers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord.</hi> I confess, there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Thirdly, Very glorious is the <hi>priviledge</hi> of those <hi>Little Children,</hi> that have and own God, for their Father. 'Tis a glorious <hi>priviledge</hi> to be Interested in the <hi>fatherly</hi> Regards of the great God; but so these gracious little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are.</p>
                  <p>'Tis their priviledge, that God has the <hi>Love</hi> of a Father for them. As 'twas said of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and a towardly Child, in Gen. 44. 20. <hi>His father loved him;</hi> unspeakably and infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more loving is the <hi>love</hi> of God unto all gracious little Children.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and so does God love these Children more than the whole world besides; unto such a

Child, the great God says with a peculiar Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis as in Isa. 43. 4. <hi>I have loved thee!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis their priviledge, that God has likewise the <hi>pity</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> for them. When a Child is in <hi>sickness,</hi> or <hi>distress,</hi> the heart of a father even yearns towards it. But the heart of God moves with a more compassionate pity towards gracious little Children in all their Troubles; thus 'tis said in Psal. 103. 12. <hi>As a Father pities his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Lord pities them that fear him.</hi> He feels <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis moreover their priviledge that God has the <hi>pardon</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> for them. A Father will bear with many <hi>Infirmities</hi> in his Children; but God passes by more far away in gracious little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Tho' they desire to do and be better, yet they are attended with many daily <hi>childish weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;</hi> but then our God says, in Mal. 3. 17. <hi>I will spare them as a man spareth his own Son, that serveth him.</hi> Yea, if thro' Temptation they fall into <hi>grosser Scandals,</hi> nevertheless when they come to loath and judge themselves for their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, the Lord will be as ready to forgive them, as <hi>David</hi> was to forgive his Rebellious, but Relenting <hi>Absalom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more, 'tis their priviledge, that God makes the <hi>provision</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> for them. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:000534_0119_0FA6B6D858815C78"/>
shall not <hi>want,</hi> so long as they have a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and a Tender <hi>Father,</hi> able to look after them. But God will provide for gracious <hi>little</hi> Children, after a manner which <hi>Eye has not seen, Ear has not heard, and heart has not conceived.</hi> We are told in Psal. 34. 10. <hi>They that fear the Lord, shall not want any good thing.</hi> These belong to the Family of the Almighty God; and, <hi>Their Heavenly Father knows what things they have need of.</hi> He will furnish them with all suitable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies both Temporal and Eternal.</p>
                  <p>Finally, 'Tis their priviledge, that when they ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

If Children go to a <hi>Father</hi> for any convenient thing, 'tis but, <hi>Ask and Have;</hi> much more is the blessed Access and Success which gracious little Children have in their Supplications to the Lord. Of their prayer, we may say as in Prov. 15. 8. 'Tis his <hi>Delight.</hi> God propounds to them, <hi>Children, what do you want? What would you have? Children, when shall I do for you?</hi> And he <hi>delights</hi> to see them, spreading their Ails before him. Tho' their prayers are but like the <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings</hi> and <hi>Lispings,</hi> of Children, yet the Lord says concerning them, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for it is sweet;</hi> their prayers make a most Heavenly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in the Ears of the Eternal God.</p>

               <p>The first thing necessary for your poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is, your <hi>Authority.</hi> 'Twas said in Lev. 19. 3. <hi>Ye shall fear every man, his Mother and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> is first mentioned, because that she commonly first loses her <hi>Authority.</hi> Look to it, that you keep up a <hi>Fear</hi> of you, in the hearts of your Children, and make them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Another thing necessary, is, your <hi>Instruction.</hi> 'Twas the Report of the <hi>Wise-man,</hi> in Prov. 4. 3, 4. <hi>I was my Fathers Son, he taught me also;</hi> and without this he had never prov'd so <hi>wise</hi> a <hi>man.</hi> Let your Children be most frequently, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, exactly <hi>Catechised;</hi> and let your Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions teach them, how they should <hi>think,</hi> how <hi>pray,</hi> and how <hi>live,</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>A Third thing necessary, is, your <hi>Inspection.</hi> As our Lord asked His Houshold, in Joh. 16. 31. <hi>Do ye now Believe?</hi> So, do you ask your Children, what their <hi>Experience,</hi> and what their <hi>Behaviour</hi> is; penetrate as far into their Circumstances, as that you may assist them against their Difficulties.</p>
               <p>A Fourth necessary thing, is your <hi>Example.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve like him, in Psal. 101. 2. <hi>I will walk within my House with a perfect heart.</hi> It is no rare thing to find it of the Son, <hi>He did according to all, that his Father did.</hi> Let your Children see by your Piety and Charity and Zeal, how they may please God; and never expose, like disguised <hi>Noah,</hi> your <hi>Nakedness,</hi> unto them. And unto all these things add your <hi>Prayer;</hi> your fervent and constant <hi>prayer,</hi> to God. Pray <hi>with</hi> your Children; and let not your Houses be liable to that hideous Thunder-clap, in Jer. 10. 25. <hi>Pour out thy Eury on the Families that call not on thy Name.</hi> A dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Meeting must you have with your Children in another world, If you there have them article
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:000534_0124_0FA6B6DC35EC7D38"/>
at this rate against you, <hi>Lord, if this Bloody Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mine had learnt me to acknowledge thee, I had never come to this place of Torment.</hi> But pray for your Children too; and be like those who, in Mat. 19. 13. <hi>brought little children unto Jesus</hi> O carry them to God in Christ, with your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Cries, <hi>That</hi> He would heal their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Diseases; <hi>That</hi> He would cast every evil Spirit out of them; and <hi>that</hi> according to His promise, He would <hi>circumcise their Hearts to fear His Name for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>H.</hi> But then, <hi>My little children, of whom I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in Birth again, until</hi> Christ <hi>be formed in you;</hi> I pray, let it be your endeavour to be those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ones, which God may be an Heavenly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> unto. 'Tis impossible to express, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, how ready, the Lord is to be the <hi>Father</hi> of you all. He has already been a <hi>Father</hi> to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of such as <hi>you;</hi> and there are doubtless more <hi>little</hi> Children in Heaven, even in the <hi>Fathers House,</hi> than there are persons of any other Age. How much may <hi>this</hi> encourage you; but in the mean time, consider, my dear Children, consider what your condition is. <hi>A Little</hi> Child once became a very <hi>holy</hi> Child, and being asked the reason of it, he said, <hi>Why, I was t'other day in the burying-place, and there I saw a Grave shorter than any self.</hi> Truly, if you'll repair to the <hi>Graves</hi> among us, you'll see many an one of your own Dimensions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>young</hi> as you are, you are <hi>old</hi> enough to Dy; the <hi>Lambs-skin</hi> is in the Market as well as the <hi>Sheep's.</hi> But O consider what will then become of your never-dying Souls, if you have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then made sure of an Interest in God as a <hi>Father</hi> for you. What a terrible thing will it be for you to be then clap'd up in <hi>chains of Darkness</hi> among black Devils against the <hi>Judgment of the Great Day!</hi> When the <hi>Last Judgment</hi> comes upon the world, who shall then appear before the dreadful Tribunal of the Lord Jesus Christ? It is said in Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
