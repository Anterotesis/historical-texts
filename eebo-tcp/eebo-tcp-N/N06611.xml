            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He had been bred a Phariſee, and was an eager and violent Perſecutor of the Chriſtian Cauſe, but after his Converſion, he was an ardent and zealous Promoter and Preacher of that Faith which once he deſtroyed; which laid him open and expos'd him, to the furious Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Rage of his Countrymen the <hi>Jews,</hi> who now roſe upon him, in a riotous and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous

               </gap>s, he there ſtood, and having obtain'd Leave, he made admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Defence of himſelf, by a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of the Manner of his paſt Life, and the wonderful Circumſtances of his Converſion to Chriſtianity: where upon the <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with accumulated Fury and Rage; they lift up their Voices—away with this Fellow from the Earth—they cried out, and caſt Duſt into the Air. In the midſt of this riotous up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, when ſome cried one thing, and ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, among the Multitude, the chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain commanded him to be brought into the Caſtle, &amp; ordered that he ſhould be examined by Scourging, that if poſſible he might find out what the Buſineſs was, and wherefore they they thus cried out againſt him, preſuming that by this Method, he might extort a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: accordingly they bound him with Thongs. At this critical Juncture, Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s Freedom &amp; civil Immunities, as a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> were of great Advantage to him: He ſays to the Centurion that ſtood by v. 25. is it lawful for You to Scourge a Man that is a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008386_0006_102F1A8164572578"/>
               <hi>Roman,</hi> &amp; uncondemened? This Queſtion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a ſtrong &amp; clear Negation. The ſame Truth likewiſe is ſuggeſted, and weight laid upon it in the Sixteenth Chapter of <hi>Acts,</hi> where we are told, that after <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Silas</hi> had been beaten, &amp; caſt into Priſon, the Magiſtrates ſent Word to let them go, in Anſwer to whom, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay v.37. <hi>They have beaten us o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly uncondemn'd being</hi> Romans, <hi>and have caſt us into Priſon; and now do they thruſt us out privily? nay verily, but let them come Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and fetch us out</hi>— let them come them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make up the Matter, and diſmiſs us honourably.</p>
            <p>THE Freedom of <hi>Rome</hi> and a Right to the Privileges &amp; Immunities of that State was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an high, diſtinguiſhing Honor. I ſhall not undertake to give a particular Detail of thoſe Privileges: ſome of them are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd here, which I ſhall take ſome Notice of. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here complains, that he was Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncondemned &amp; without a Tryal: now, it was contrary to the Laws of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſo it is to the Laws of all well regulated States &amp; Kingdoms, to condemn or puniſh a Man without a fair, impartial Tryal, and the Accuſers &amp; Accuſed had Face to Face, &amp; the accuſed have Liberty to anſwer for and defend himſelf: but in the preſent Caſe, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had had no Tryal at all, but they fell upon
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008386_0007_102F1A82EEF09618"/>
and abus'd him, in a riotous, tumultuary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which was a direct Violation, not only of the Laws of common Juſtice &amp; Equity, but of his civil Freedom &amp; Immunity as a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi>: nor was this all, but they had bound and ſcourg'd or beaten him, from both of which he was exempted by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law. To bind or beat a <hi>Roman,</hi> or one who was free of that City, and intitled to the Privileges of it was by no means lawful: hence <hi>Cicero,</hi> in one of his Orations ſays, <hi>Facinus eſt vinciri Civem Romanum, Scelus verberari,</hi> that is, 'tis a great and heinous Crime, either to bind or beat a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen: if they were guilty &amp; deſerv'd it, they had other Ways of puniſhing their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, but Thongs &amp; Whips they accounted too diſhonourable and ſhameful Methods of Puniſhment, and unbecoming the Dignity of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens.</p>
            <p>No Wonder then the Centurion, when he underſtood that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Roman,</hi> was alarmed at what had been done: he goes ſtraightway to the Chief Captain, and informs him how the Matter ſtood, and deſires him to take heed what he did: whereupon the Chief Captain went directly to <hi>Paul</hi> and ſaid, tell me now ſeriouſly and honeſty, are you a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Citizen, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwer'd frankly and truly, yes I am; the chief Captain replys to this Purpoſe, in the <hi>Text,</hi> why that ſeems hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008386_0008_102F1A85AC7BB9D0"/>
probable, from the indifferent Figure and Appearance you now make, unleſs there has been ſome remarkable Change in your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; for I, who hold a conſiderable Poſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, obtain'd that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom at an expenſive Rate, &amp; for a greatSum of Money: <hi>Paul</hi> rejoins, I had no Need of making any ſuch Purchaſe, for I was free-born, born to the Freedom of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Privileges and Immunities of it; it deſcended to me from my Father, who was a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen before me.</p>
            <p>THERE were ſeveral Ways of becoming free of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and being intitled to the Priviliges of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one was by Purchaſe, ſo the chief Captain was made free: another was by Birth, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> came by his Freedom: and ſome were veſted &amp; dignified with theſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, in Conſequence and Reward of ſome ſignal Services they had done the <hi>Roman</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; in this Way, 'tis probable eno' St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Father become free of <hi>Rome</hi>: for many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by ſerving in the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, and ſignanzing themſelves, were endowed with the Freedom and Immunities of Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Words, I apprehend, may well eno' give Riſe to a brief Diſcourſe on <hi>civil Liberty,</hi> and the Privileges, Rights &amp; Immunities that belong to a free State or Government, with a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008386_0009_102F1A89C043F288"/>
particular Application of it to this Government.</p>
            <p>THE Source and Original of civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in General, is Divine and from GOD. The moſt high has ſufficiently inform'd us in his Word, and from the Nature, Reaſon and Neceſſity of the Thing, that it is his Pleaſure, civil Government ſhould obtain among the Nation's of the Earth: but he has not ſeen fit to interpoſe, and expreſly to fix &amp; determine in his Word, that this or that particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del or Scheme of civil Rule &amp; Government, ſhould obtain &amp; be obſerv'd, in this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation, or in any Nation; but has left that Matter, very much, to the Election and Choice of the ſeveral Communities; or, that Matter is over-ruled by a Train of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Events, whence the ſeveral Nations and civil States of the Earth, are led to fix and ſettle in ſome one particular Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather than another.</p>
            <p>As we in this Colony are dependant upon, and hold the Charter of all our civil Privileges, from the Crown of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> it may not he improper, to take a very brief View of that Kingdom, with it's ineſtimable Privileges.</p>
            <p>GREAT <hi>Britain</hi> is a limitted Monarchy, and is ſometimes called, by political Writers, a Republic or Commonwealth, with a Prince at the Head of it: it is governed by Laws of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008386_0010_102F1A8CC9B57940"/>
their own making, and both King and People are bound and oblig'd to act and conduct themſelves according to the Laws of the Realm. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Legiſlature conſiſts of three Branches, the King and two Houſes of Parliament, without the Concurrence of each of which, no Laws can be made, and which mutually temper, aſſiſt and check each other.</p>
            <p>HISTORIANS tell us, that this Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for subſtance, has obtain'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from the earlieſt Times, and the ſame Kind of Government was ſetled by the Northern Nations, in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> which they over-run in the Decline of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and founded new States upon its Ruins: but thoſe Governments on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, as to the free Form of them, gradually degenerated into deſpotick and arbitrary; but in, <hi>England,</hi> it has been preſerv'd, ſecur'd and improv'd. In the Time of the <hi>Saxon Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarchy,</hi> when <hi>England</hi> was divided into ſeven Kingdoms, the Government was free, and ſo it was after thoſe Kingdoms were united into one: King <hi>William</hi> the firſt, a <hi>Norman,</hi> having conquer'd <hi>England,</hi> near Seven Hundred Years ago indeed eſtabliſh'd an abſolute Government there; but his Son <hi>William</hi> the ſecond, to ſecure his Crown, ſolemnly promiſed to reſtore the ancient Government and Laws: and the ſame Promiſes were made by ſome of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008386_0011_102F1A8EA7B10E78"/>
but not well perform'd; which bro't on the War of the <hi>Barons,</hi> in which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and People ſtruggled hard to recover their Liberties, which at length were ſolemnly confirmed to them, by a Charter, which was called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or the Charter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, by King <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOME Attempts were made, by ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Princes, to ſtrip the People of their Privileges, or to curtall and leſſen them; but they ever brought Miſfortunes and Vexatlons upon Themſelves, and ſometimes the Loſs of theirCrowns, or their Lives. When King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt attempted to introduce arbitrary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it blew up a Civil War, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Loſs of his Head: and when his Son King <hi>James</hi> the Second, took large ſtrides towards arbitrary Rule, the Nation jealous of their Liberties, invited over the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; upon which King <hi>James</hi> thought fit to abdicate the Throne &amp; Kingdom; and the Crown was Setled on the Prince &amp; Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> by the Names of King <hi>Williams</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; by whoſe Means &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality it was, that the Crown was Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on the preſent Royal Family, which GOD long preſerve.</p>
            <p>UPON the Acceſſion of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Nation aſſembled in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, took ſpecial Care, expreſly to ſet
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008386_0012_102F1A91748D1830"/>
down, and ſolemnly to declare and aſſert, the ancient, legal Rights, Liberties &amp; Privileges belonging to the Nation, which have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd to this Day, and we hope will long be enjoyed. <note n="†" place="bottom">For the Hiſtorical Facts here related, ſee <hi>Rapin's</hi> Hiſtory of England.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is no Nation now in <hi>Europe,</hi> nor on the Earth, whoſe Civil Government is like that of Great <hi>Britain</hi>—none that exceeds, perhaps none, that, in all Reſpects, equals it in Excellency. Now, as the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> is dependant upon, and derives it's Being and all it's Privileges from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown; and free and excellent Form of our Government, pretty nearly reſembles that of our Mother-Country. The CHARTER of all our Civil Privileges was granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: by which Charter, this Colony was made and conſtituted a Body Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate or Politick, with all the Rights and Immunities of a free People. The Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Colony is eſtabliſhed, and a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod Setled for it's Subſiſtence &amp; Perpetuity. The Whole of this Legiſlative Body, conſiſting of two Houſes, are elected and choſen annually by the free Men of the Corporation; who are under the Solemnity of an Oath, to give their Suffrages, according to their beſt Knowlege, in ſuch a Manner as may conduce
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008386_0013_102F1A95754596A8"/>
to the beſt Good of the Government. In the Hands of this Aſſembly is lodg'd, the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action and Management of the great Affairs of the Government, relating to the Peace, Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Proſperity of the whole Body: To them it belongs, to erect and eſtabliſh Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Courts, of whatever Denomination, for the Tryal of ſuch Cauſes as may properly fall under their Cognizance; to ſettle &amp; fix their Powers, and regulate the Form &amp; Manner of their Proceedings: to them likewiſe it belongs, to make and enact Such Laws and Statutes,—to levy and raiſe ſuch Taxes upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and impoſe ſuch Cuſtoms &amp; Duties, as may be needful for the Security of the People in their Lives, Property and Rights, for the Support of Government, &amp; the Peace and Welfare of the State.</p>
            <p>Our Governors and Civil Rulers are not obtruded upon us from abroad, nor forced upon us by a Superior Authority: they are all elected &amp; choſen by Ourſelves, and from among Ourſelves. The Laws we are under, and which obtain among us, are not the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Injunctions of an arbitrary Ruler; but they are all Laws of our own making—all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted and made by Ourſelves, or by thoſe, whom we have choſen to repreſent and act for us: Our Lives and Limbs, our Property and Eſtates, our Rights and Liberties, our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008386_0014_102F1A98715C94D8"/>
Characters and good Names lie at no Man's Mercy; but they are all guarded &amp; ſecur'd by Laws: as Strong an Hedge is ſet around them for their Security &amp; Defence, as we can deſire; for they are ſcreen'd &amp; defended by Laws of our own chuſing &amp; making. And whatever is needful and proper to be done, from Time to Time, for the Suppreſſing of Diſorders and Immoralities, or Practices and Courſes that are detrimental to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for the promoting of Virtue and good Manners, Diligence and Induſtry, and the general Good, Security &amp; Proſperity of the State; ſtill' this lies with us, and may be done by thoſe whom we chooſe to rule over us. In a Word, we Ourſelves elect &amp; chuſe thoſe, to whom annually the Conduct and Management of the great Affairs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is committed, and whoſe Duty and Buſineſs it is, to watch for the Security, Peace and Proſperity of the State.</p>
            <p>Now, one would be ready to imagine, that the Subjects of ſuch a Government, of ſuch rich and diſtinguiſhing Privileges &amp; Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be all Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to God, for his merciful Indulgence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating Favours—all Chearfulneſs and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity in obeying &amp; honouring the Laws, and ſubmitting to the Adminiſtrations of ſuch a Government: but the moſt valuable &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008386_0015_102F1A9A019F0618"/>
Things in the World, are capable of being perverted and abuſed; and ſo are the Civil Freedom &amp; Privileges of this Colony.</p>
            <p>PERVERSE &amp; diſingenuous Spirits, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable &amp; unthinking Men, by baſking long in the Sun ſhine of Liberty, and indulg'd to the full with the richeſt Political Privileges, and unacquainted with the oppoſite ſtate and ſituation, are ready ſometimes to flight and deſpite their Freedom, and turn their Political Grace and Favour into Wantonneſs: and if all the Public Affairs are not ordered &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, in a Manner that ſuits their Humours, how unreaſonable ſoever; or, if they feel a Burden heavier than common, at an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Juncture—a Burden abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to the Security and Defence, not of their civil Liberties &amp; Property only, but of their Religion &amp; Lives, are ready to imagine their Freedom &amp; Liberties are worth Nothing at all; to murmur &amp; complain; to call for Chains &amp; Shackles, to curſe their Benefactors, revile the Gods, and Speak Evil of Dignities, and with tremendous Raſhneſs, to cenſure and condemn the whole Legiſlative Body of the Colony, and reproach &amp; vilify their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. I hope indeed there are few if any Such Murmurers &amp; Complainers in this numerous Aſſembly. We are called indeed to Liberty, but not to Licentiouſneſs; we
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008386_0016_102F1A9CDDF236C8"/>
have full Liberty to do all the Good we can in our Places, and to ſerve GOD and our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in the Secure, unmoleſted Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of our Lives &amp; Property, and all our juſt Rights; but we have no Right or Liberty to do wrong. The Temper &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct now hinted at, I am perſuaded, is a great and heinous Sin, highly provoking to that GOD, by whom Kings reign and Princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree Juſtice; and who rules in the Kingdoms of Men, and gives them to whomſoever he pleaſes: beſides, it is a very great political Evil; it tends to weaken the Hands, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Hearts of our Political Fathers, who are watching &amp; labouring for our Good,—to cauſe the Publick Affairs, to go on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, &amp; under great Diſadvantage &amp; Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements— to enervate &amp; weaken the Civil State, &amp; to expoſe us to the Inſults of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,&amp;throw us at laſt an eaſier Prey into their Hands. O let us all ſtand at a Diſtance from ſuch a Temper &amp; Conduct, hate &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, &amp; endeavour in all proper &amp; prudent Ways to diſcountenance &amp; ſuppreſs it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appears; Senſible that is not only a heinous Sin againſt GOD, but of pernicious and fatal Tendency, as to the Community and Civil State.</p>
            <p>IN ſtead of the above Spirit &amp; Behaviour, let us all be perſuaded gratefully to reſent, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008386_0017_102F1AA1039315B8"/>
wiſely to improve our civil Freedom and Liberty. As we are ſignally favoured and diſtinguiſh'd by GOD, in the excellent Temper &amp; Conſtitution of our Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="†" place="bottom">There is no more a perfect Civil Conſtitution, than there is a perfect Man to be found upon the Earth; that is the moſt perfect, which is attended with few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inconveniences, &amp; beſt anſwers the great Ends of Government. One of the Inconveniences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a free Government, ſuch as this, is, that the People ſometimes, either thro Ignorance or Prejudice or Caprice, or being wrough upon by the artful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of deſigning Men, drop from the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their ableſt States-men &amp; warmeſt Benefactors. Gentlemen of approved Capacity &amp; Fidelity, &amp; that at a Seaſon, when they ſtand in greateſt need of them: but in ſuch Caſe, I think, they are commonly wont to be ſoon ſensible of their Miſtake, and to reſtore them to their Stations of Eminence &amp; Truſt, perhaps with Advantage to their future Reputation &amp; Honour.</note> and the Privileges and Immunities claimed under it; we ought, I think, in all Reaſon, to take ſome Pains to bring Ourſelves acquainted with the Liberties &amp; Privileges we enjoy; how they differ from, and exceed in Excellency thoſe, of almoſt all other Countries and Civil Communities on Earth: that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of their Worth, Preciouſneſs and ineſtimable Value, we may learn to eſteem and prize them very highly: and in Conſequence thereof, our Hearts, deeply impreſs'd with a Senſe of their vaſt Importance &amp; unſpeakable Value, may glow with ſincere Gratitude, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008386_0018_102F1AA3FA793918"/>
our Lips over flow with Thankſgiving and Praiſes to the bleſſed GOD, the Fountain and Father of all Good; and we may be confirm'd and eſtabliſh'd in our unſhaken Loyalty and Obedience to the Crown of great <hi>Britain</hi> from which we hold and enjoy ſo great Privileges.</p>
            <p>THE Light of this joyful Day, one would think, ſhould ſerve to awaken theſe grateful and becoming Sentiments in all our Minds.—a Day, on which the Suffrages of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration are bro't into View, and the free, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of our Civil Rulers for the enſuing Year is determined—Suffrages not given, I hope, at Random &amp; without Conſideration; for they were given, all given under Solemn Oath: yes, we are bound by Intereſt, Duty and the Solemn Oath of GOD upon us, to give our Suffrages, from Year to Year, for thoſe to rule over us, who, according to our beſ Knowlege &amp; Underſtanding, are beſt quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to fill thoſe Places of Honour &amp; Truſt to which they are to be prefer'd — moſt fit to Support their own Characters, and moſt likely, in Conformity to the great End of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to employ their Power moſt effectually for the Good of thoſe, who are to live under the Shadow of it: they muſt be able Men—Men of Genius, Penetration and Wiſdom — Men of Steadineſs, Courage &amp; Reſolution —

Men of Virtue, Religion and Piety and true Fearers of GOD, Friends to <hi>Zion,</hi> and who prefer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above their chief Joy; who will be a Terror to evil Doers, and a Praiſe to thoſe that do well; they muſt be Men of Truth and unſhaken Fidelity, Uprightneſs, Honor &amp; Sincerity — hating Coveteouſneſs, of a public &amp; generous Spirit, Friends to the Conſtitution &amp; Government, firmly attach'd to it's true Intereſt, free &amp; ready to exert and lay out Themſelves to promote &amp; advance it: thoſe Perſons among us, in whom theſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are the moſt viſible and conſpicuous, ought to be elected &amp; choſen to rule over as from Year to Year: And being choſen and fix'd in their Stations of Honor &amp; Truſt, their Duty &amp; Buſineſs is, to watch for the publick Good, &amp; exert all their Abilities, to promote and advance it; to approve themſelves Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; Benefactors to their Country, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of GOD to us for Good.</p>
            <p>AND anſwerably to their high Truſt and Authority, and our Relation to them, we ſtand bound by the Laws of Heaven, to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of various Duties to our Civil Rulers, to thoſe whom we freely chuſe to be ſet in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us: and thoſe Duties we muſt diſcharge, faithfully diſcharge, or we cannot be ſaid to make a right Uſe &amp; Improvement of our Civil Freedom, &amp; political Rights and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008386_0020_102F1AA74BC4EC98"/>
Immunities, but to pervert and abuſe them. We are bound then to treat the Fathers of our Land with a diſitinguiſh'd, deferential Reſpect &amp; Honour—with Eſteem and Honour in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Station, Dignity &amp; Character. <hi>Fear GOD, Honour the King.</hi> Honour and Fear muſt be given, to whom they are due. We are to guard ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly againſt all ungrounded Jealouſies &amp; Surmiſes, and raſh Cenſures of their Adminiſtrations: always remembring, that every private Perſon is not in a Situation or Capacity to diſcern the Reaſons &amp; Foundation of public Counſels and Adminiſtrations, or to form a right Judgment of them: in ſtead of this, we are bound to treat thoſe, whom GOD in his Providence has Set over us, with great Reſpect, Honour and Reverence: nor is this all; we muſt chearfully obey their Laws and Commands, and Submit to their Orders and Adminiſtrations. They are cloathed with Authority from GOD to rule and govern, and it is our indiſpenſable Duty to be loyal &amp; obedient. Hear the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Inſpiration; <hi>Let every Soul be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of GOD; the Powers that he are ordain'd of GOD.

The honourable Support of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is not an arbitrary Thing, which the Community may do or neglect at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without Sin or Danger; it is a neceſſary Piece of Juſtice, neceſſary by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Revelation; both of which concur, in requiring us to give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Things that are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, as well as unto GOD the Things, that are GOD's. We are obliged likewiſe ſincerely and ſervently to Pray for thoſe in Authority over us, and for the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Heaven on their Perſons &amp; Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trations. Their Work is great &amp; important, their Difficulties, Diſcouragements &amp; Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations many; and the Welfare &amp; Proſperity of the People, yea of every Individual of the Community is concern'd, in the wiſe &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Diſcharge ot their Truſt: and they need Light &amp; Direction from above: We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from Time to Time to bear them upon our Hearts before the Mercy Seat, and ſtrive together in our Prayers to GOD for them, that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008386_0022_102F1AAF266FEB88"/>
they may be Miniſters of GOD to us for good. Look into the Book of GOD, and you will find written, <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty, for this is good &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of GOD our Saviour</hi>: and in all proper &amp; ſuitable Ways, we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Hearts and ſtrengthen the Hands of our Rulers, and endeavour to render their Adminiſtration &amp; Government over us, eaſy, proſperous and ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>AND if we would improve our Civil Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; Liberty as we ought, 'tis likewiſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incumbent upon us, to ſhun &amp; avoid all ſuch Courſes &amp; Practices, as are hurtful and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the Civil State, tend to weaken and enervate it, and expoſe and lay it open to the angry Reſentments &amp; deſolating Rebukes of the righteous Governor of the World; as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all ſinful and immoral Courſes do: and to cultivate and practice all thoſe ſacred Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues &amp; Duties, which give Strength, Firmneſs and Stability to the Body Politic, and greatly conduce to our Security, Peace and laſting Tranquility.</p>
            <p>AND now, what ſhall I ſay, to induce and engage us all to a ready and chearful Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with theſe Serious and, I hope, ſeaſonable
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008386_0023_102F1AB1E2A61248"/>
Advices. Conſider, 'tis the Body, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to which we Ourſelves belong, and of which we are Members, whoſe Cauſe I am now pleading: and how unnatural, how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous would it be, to wound this Body, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure this Community, or to do any Thing to diſhonour and endanger it; or, not to do all in our Power to advance it's Security, Peace and Proſperity? If our civil Privileges were trivial and of little Value, or, if we liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an arbitrary and tyrannical Government, the Caſe would be widely different. Arbitrary Rule or Tyranny is one of the greateſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of Miſery &amp; Deſolation to Mankind—the moſt dreadful Curſe that ever blaſted and devour'd the Earth: but we, of God's diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Goodneſs and Mercy, are called to Freedom &amp; Liberty. Liberty! how charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how animating is the Sound? may we never know it's Worth and ineſtimable Value by being ſtrip'd and depriv'd of it. 'Tis one of the richeſt Gifts of Heaven to the Sons of Men—the ſource and ſpring of almoſt every Thing, that is excellent &amp; valuable upon Earth—the Nurſe of Arts and Sciences, the Parent of Diligence &amp; Induſtry, the Procurer of Wealth and Riches, &amp; needful to the unmoleſted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice of Chriſtianity it ſelf: it adds Chearfulneſs, Eaſe and Alacrity to the Mind—Sweetens &amp; endears the Social Life,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008386_0024_102F1AB36A6535E0"/>
and heightens the Reliſh of all the common Enjoyments of Time. And ſhall we not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue Freedom? ſhall we not prize our civil Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties? and heartily thank GOD for them, and improve them well? Certainly, if we do not, we are of all Men the moſt inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>WHAT can thoſe unhappy Perſons mean, who are Sick of our Liberties, chagrin'd and out of Humour, and ſeem willing to part with them? This muſt proceed from great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; Stupidity. Do they know what it is to be denied Civil Liberty, and to lie at the Mercy of an Arbitrary Ruler? I ſhall ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Nations, where arbitrary Rule &amp; Tyranny have their full ſwing, &amp; the Inhabitants by Millions are oppreſs'd &amp; cruſh'd under it's Weight; but I ſhall mention one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in <hi>Europe,</hi> to illuſtrate this Matter. In the Pope's temporal Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> by a fixed &amp; ſetled Rule or Order, which may not be tranſgreſs'd, all the People are oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver all the Grain they raiſe to the Pope's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, at half Price, to be depoſited in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick Chamber, as they call it, out of which it is bought by the Bakers, at double the Price, and by them it is made into Broad, &amp; Sold at their advanc'd Price to the People; ſo that they who raiſed the Grain, are oblig'd to buy their Bread, at more than Double the Price,, at which they Sold, &amp; were oblig'd to ſell their Grain. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Burnet's Travels.</note>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:008386_0025_102F1AB6257B8138"/>This is but one of the many Inſtances that might be adduced, of the Nature &amp; Miſery of arbitrary Goverment: and how ſtrikingly is this dark view contraſted to the chearing Light of Freedom &amp; Liberty! and it ſerves to ſhow us the invaluable Worth &amp; Excellence of our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges: their Price is above Rubies. We may well ſay with the chief Captain, with a great Sum obtain'd we this Freedom. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtruggled hard, &amp; were at vaſt Expence of Treaſure &amp; Blood, from Generation to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to defend their Civil Liberties againſt the Attempts that were made to deprire them of them: and our Anceſtors enterprized the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of this free Colony, at the Peril of their Lives: and yet we of this Generation may ſay too with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that we were free born, born to Liberty: our Fathers died and went off the ſtage, with a chearful Hope, of tranſmitting their Privileges to the lateſt Generation: and ſhall we their Deſcendants be inſenſible of their Worth, wantonly &amp; madly throw them away, or miſimprove and abuſe them, or take ſuch Courſes, as may incur the Forfeiture &amp; Loſs of them? by no Means: no, let thoſe who are unacquainted with the Sweets of Liberty &amp; a free Government, reproah it, deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak Evil of Dignities, &amp; foam out their own ſhame: but let us, who know better Things, whoſe Lines are fallen in pleaſant Places,

            <p>A public Spirit, and the Love of one's Country, in all Ages and Nations, has been acknowleged and celebrated as a moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant &amp; laudable Virtue.

And if this generous Love of their Country, &amp; laudable Spirit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, was ſo conſpicuous among the Heathen, would it not be an inexcuſable Reproach upon Chriſtians, if this noble Ardor and the proper Effects of it, ſhould be found wanting among them?

And ſhall not our Country be lov'd &amp; valued by us? ſhall not this delightful, animating Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection be found burning, with a Flame not to be extinguiſh'd, in every Breaſt?

               </gap> our Country flouriſhes &amp; improves in Strength, Security and Proſperity, our own Intereſts, civil &amp; religious are the more Safe, &amp; better Secur'd; but if our Country Suffers, we, as Members of this Body Suffer too; if it be deſtroy'd, what a Ruin and Deſolation will it bring with it, upon all that is valuable &amp; dear to us upon Earth? What a Bleſſing is a publick Spirit, an enlarged, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſpoſition! 'Tis an amiable, excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in it ſelf, &amp; it ſpeaks the Perſon, who is graced with it, to be one of the excellent of the Earth.

We ought not to deſire to thrive at the Expence &amp; Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Public, and to erect our private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes &amp; Intereſt on the Ruins of our Country. A narrow, contracted Spirit, a Selfiſh, grovling

Temper, is one of the baſeſt, vileſt and moſt deſpicable Properties, that can poſſeſs &amp; rule the Heart of Man: it would attract &amp; draw every Thing to it ſelf, &amp; there it ſtagnates and dies, or is abſorpt &amp; loſt. Many an excellent and noble Deſign, for the Advancement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Kingdom of Chriſt, of Peace and Righteouſneſs, &amp; for the Security &amp; Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of civil Communities &amp; Kingdoms, is clogged, ſuppreſs'd &amp; rendered abortive, by ſuch a Selfiſh, ſordid Spirit. This Spirit is the Bane of Communities on Earth, but then, for our Comfort, it is confin'd to the Earth, for 'tis certain, it will find no Place in Heaven. But a public Spirit, a temper &amp; Diſpoſition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and purſue our private Intereſt, in a juſt Subordination to the public Good, is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent &amp; recommending Property, &amp; merits the higheſt Praiſes &amp; Commendations: Such a Spirit animating &amp; ruling a Perſon, renders him a public Bleſſing and Benefactor to his Country: 'Tis an heroic Spirit, a Patriot Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, &amp; an Imitation of GOD, the great &amp; good Governor of the Univerſe, who Showers his Benedictions on all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>I know well, 'tis not every Member of a Community, that has either Abilities, or a Call in Providence to Signalize himſelf, in great Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits or Atchievements for the Benefit of his Country: but this <hi>Spirit,</hi> this Temper, in ſome

Degree, is what every one, I hope, is capable of; and ſo, in Proportion to their Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; Abilities, they may approve themſelves Bleſſings &amp; Benefactors to their Country. This Spirit &amp; Temper is a very laudable &amp; Praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Thing at all Times, but it never was more neceſſary, there never was a louder Call for it, in this Land, than in theſe dark and dangerous Times. Let us then ſhake off a contracted Selfiſh Diſpoſition, open our Eyes, enlarge our Views, extend our Good will, and believe it, that our Country calls for our moſt cordial &amp; benevolent Regards: let every Heart be fir'd with a Love to our Country—a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic &amp; generous Spirit inſpire and rule in every Breaſt. I am now inviting You, to ſhake off and abhor the meaneſt &amp; baſeſt Temper, that ever vexed &amp; plagued the World, &amp; which is the ſpring &amp; ſource of innumerable Evils and Calamities to Mankind, &amp; to imbibe that Spirit, and cheriſh &amp; cultivate that Temper, which is the Beauty, the Ornament, the Nobility of the human Mind — is the ſpring of almoſt all worthy &amp; noble Deſigns in Church and State, renders a Man juſtly dear and honourable to the World, &amp; a Benefactor to human Kind. And can we, my <hi>Candid Hearers,</hi> can any of us fail, at this Juncture, to manifeſt our Love to our Counrty, and the high Eſtimate we put upon our precious Privileges, in all proper and

requiſite Ways, and all ſuitable Meaſures for it's Defence and Security. But perhaps you may be ready to ſay, the Scale is now turn'd, and a more hopeful and chearing Proſpect, with Regard to the Event of the War, opens before us, than in Time paſt; thank GOD for it moſt heartily; but be not high minded, but fear, <hi>let not him that girdeth on his Harneſs booſt himſelf, as he that putteth it off.</hi> The Race is not always to the Swift, not the Battle to the Strong. A vain-glorious Confidence in an Arm of Fleſh, &amp; military Preparations (whilſt the GOD of Armies is ovelook'd and diſhonor'd) is the ready Way to Fruſtration and Ruin. The Event of the War will be as GOD pleaſes, He rules among the Kingdoms of Men, &amp; gives them to whomſoever he will. I am ſure, we have ſtill Reaſon, great Reaſon to fear &amp; be humble, to call our Sins to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes, to turn to GOD &amp; ſeek his Face &amp; Favour, and his merciful Interpoſition and Help, that he would go forth with our Armies and fight our Battles for us: let this be the grand Care of every one.

When you conſider what is at Stake, what our Fears are, what our Hopes, can your Zeal Sleep? No, gird on your military Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, draw forth the devouring Sword, baniſh Vice from the Camp, commit your Cauſe to GOD, in his Name ſet up your Banners, and in his Strength, we hope, you will tread down our Foes.
