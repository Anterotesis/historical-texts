            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALL that is required of thee is impartiality. No man can boaſt of a greater attachment to America, than the writer of the following Letters. God has given him a ſoul to diſdain tyranny from the womb, and its faculties have been exerted againſt deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm ever ſince they were capable of action. His heart bleeds to ſee the remnant of ſlavery, in a country which the <hi>Creator</hi> has conſecrated to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. He dreads an inſurrection of the negroes in the ſouthern ſtates as much as any man;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Jefferſon's Notes.</note> but he is confident a dreadful revolution muſt ſoon take place, unleſs the ſlaves are inſtructed and gradually emancipated. It is now in the power of America to ward off the blow, and eſcape the dreadful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe: and if this publication ſhould incline the hearts of any to alleviate the miſeries of their fellow-men, the author has obtained his end.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I SHOULD not trouble you with the following lines, was it not for the bad effect your pamphlet, in vindication of negro ſlavery has had, on the minds of ignorant, weak and ſelf-intereſted men. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are willing to ſuppoſe it unanſwerable, but I told the gentleman who favoured me with your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, that I thought I could anſwer all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you advanced. He pledged me to do it. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. I perform; for,
<q>
                     <l>What I can do, can do no hurt to try,</l>
                     <l>Since you ſet up your teſt gainſt remedy:</l>
                     <l>He that of greateſt works is finiſher,</l>
                     <l>Oft does them by the weakeſt miniſter.</l>
                     <l>Oft expectation fails, and moſt oft there—</l>
                     <l>Where moſt it promiſes; and oft it hits</l>
                     <l>Where hope is coldeſt, and deſpair moſt ſits.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>May the preſent conteſt between freedom and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very prove ſuch. I am young and you are old—where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid, Days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of years ſhould teach wiſdom; but great men are not always wiſe; neither do all the aged underſtand judgment; therefore, I ſaid, hearken to me, I alſo will ſhew mine opinion, concerning <hi>ſlavery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:034442_0004_0FFDC8FEB78B7F68"/>
You begin by ſaying, "that the Bible is the only rule of faith and practice." Granted, for Chriſtians; and it is probable the deiſts after a few years experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will judge the New-Teſtament to contain the beſt rules of action.</p>
               <p>Your aſſertion, "that whatever has been as yet ſaid in favour of the emancipation of ſlaves, has been drawn from reaſon, and the conduct of ſome of the United States," is a palpable error. Slavery has been preached againſt, both by Heathens and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, before the United States were known. Homer ſaid, 2600 years ago,
<q>
                     <l>Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day</l>
                     <l>Makes man a ſlave, takes half his worth away.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>As you ſeem to diſcard reaſon, I ſhall endeavour to prove by the authority of ſcripture (which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but always conſiſtent with reaſon) that even the Moſaic diſpenſation condemns perpetual ſlavery. Yes, ſir, I will produce a "Thus ſaith the Lord," for the manumiſſion of ſlaves.</p>
               <p>I join with you moſt cordially, in "wiſhing rigid diſputants for liberty, to read their Bibles more;" for its doctrines breathe a moſt noble love of freedom, and a perfect hatred of tyranny.</p>
               <p>When you wiſh the citizens of America to read the conſtitutions of the ſtates leſs, I muſt wiſh you a good night; for if it ſhould ever be the caſe, groſs darkneſs will cover the land, and ſtrange infatuation poſſes the people.</p>
               <p>Thirſt after knowledge, religious and political, ſhould be the firſt trait in the character of republicans. The very eſſence of their government, <hi>modus</hi> of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and energy of action, depends on the knowledge and virtue of the citizens. The citizens of America ſhould, therefore, read the conſtitutions of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates with attention; compare them together, and be emulous which ſtate ſhall form the beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and enact the beſt laws, in order to render
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034442_0005_0FFDC90052622570"/>
the greateſt poſſible happineſs to all their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The maxim of their legiſlatures ſhould be, "Nothing is done whilſt any thing remains to be done."</p>
               <p>But I muſt endeavour to ſet you right with regard to that book called the Bible, which you take for granted ſupports negro-ſlavery, and that your treatiſe makes it manifeſt! Do you imagine, ſir, that the <hi>Bible</hi> is like Pope's Temple of Fame?</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where various news he heard of love and ſtrife;</l>
                  <l>Of peace and war; health, ſickneſs death and life;</l>
                  <l>Of old miſmanagements, taxations new;</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>A lie and truth contending for the way;</l>
                  <l>And long 'twas doubtful, both ſo cloſely pent,</l>

                  <l>Inſeparable now the truth and lie:</l>
                  <l>The ſtrict companions are for ever join'd,</l>

               <p>2d. Where a curſe is, a <hi>mark</hi> you think will follow. The colour, ſhape, and even the hair of their heads, prove the poor Africans to be children of the curſe, and fit for nothing but <hi>drudgery and ſlavery.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall proceed to anſwer as briefly as poſſible, and 1ſt. The curſe denounced upon Canaan, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked in the deſtruction of the Canaanites by Iſrael. If you wiſh to lay any ſtreſs on the words, "a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be," you ſhall be a ſervant to the Jew, and the negro ſhall be your's; for it is as probable that you are the deſcendant of Canaan as the Africans, notwithſtanding your curious obſervations in geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. Were not the Canaanites, without diſtinction, devoted to deſtruction, on account of their abominable iniquities. The Gibeonites alone, by their ſubtilty, eſcaped with the puniſhment of voluntary ſlavery. And you cannot be ignorant of the judgments that befel Iſrael for abuſing thoſe <hi>hewers of wood and drawers of water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you aſk where the curſe was removed? I refer you to the goſpel—there hear the word "<hi>it is finiſhed!</hi>"
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034442_0007_0FFDC90592F02118"/>
admitting your own point, that the Ethiopians are the deſcendants of Ham, was not the curſe removed from the eunuch you refer to? Being the ambaſſador of the queen of Candace, and returning from Jeruſalem, not as a ſlave, but as the miniſter of a great nation, he was baptized by Philip, and moſt probably preached the goſpel of Jeſus in his own country, where it flouriſhed for ſome time.</p>
               <p>Pray, Mr. Lawrence, who were the Carthaginians, and out of whoſe loins came the intrepid Hannibal? Were they not Africans? And though they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, they made a great ſtruggle for liberty.</p>
               <p>Your 2d obſervation ſcarcely deſerves notice: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as the prejudice of the age is very ſtrong againſt the colour of the poor Africans, I ſhall make a few remarks.—And firſt, you ſay, "where a curſe is, a mark will follow." Very true; the tree is known by its fruit. But who told you that the deſcendants of Canaan had a black ſkin on account of the curſe?—Neither ſacred nor profane hiſtorians: then it muſt be the child of fancy, owing, I ſuppoſe, to the devil being painted black. But you ſhould remember the Africans, of late, not without cauſe, paint the devil white; and owing to ſuch men as you, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend ſlavery, the name of a chriſtian is become more frightful to them than the devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſhall leave others to philoſophiſe on the colour of ſkins; it is enough for me, that the heat of the fire will turn moſt things black. The ſcorching ſun of Africa, without any cold winters to bleach, has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had this effect, in a long ſucceſſion of years, on the colour and hair of negroes; add to this, that when the colour becomes once tinged, in the union of the ſexes, amongſt all creatures, a likeneſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which may be a reaſon why the blacks do not change their hue ſooner in this country: when inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriages become general, the white colour will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in northern climates, but in more ſouthern latitudes

               <p>My 2d remark is on your obſervation about the ſhape of negroes; "that they are formed for drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery," &amp;c. A man muſt be ſtrangely prejudiced, not to ſee that both labour and thought affect the ſhape of every human being. Hence you may know a cruel ſlave-holder or tyrant by his complexion; as Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon well obſerves, "The whole commerce between maſter and ſlave, is a perpetual exerciſe of the moſt boiſterous paſſions, the moſt unremitting deſpotiſm on one part, and degrading ſubmiſſion on the other: our children ſee this and imitate it. The parent ſtorms, the child looks on, catches the lineament of wrath, puts on the ſame airs, gives a looſe to his worſt of paſſions; and thus nurſed and educated, and daily exerciſed in tyranny, cannot but be ſtamped with odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peculiarities." Is it any wonder, that ſo many of the negroes, between their hard labour, want of thought, and the moſt abject ſlavery, ſhould want fine features? But notwithſtanding their condition, I have ſeen ſome hundreds of negroes as well made as any white man: beſides, if you were to make ſlaves of all the awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward people, I am afraid many of your white brethren would come under the laſh.</p>
               <p>I proceed to conſider your third argument; "we read in the ſcriptures of hired ſervants and of bond ſervants." Yes, and of men having a great number
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034442_0009_0FFDC90BA89B08E8"/>
of wives and concubines: but was it ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? No, ſir, there is not a ſingle clauſe in the moral law that juſtifies either.</p>
               <p>But who are your great patterns of ſlavery? Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Solomon! Let us ſee what kind of ſlaves they had: the former had three hundred and eighteen trained ſervants, born in his houſe, whom Joſephus calls reſpectable men, well inſtructed; they were a part of his family, had received the covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and adopted into the church of God; therefore could not be involuntary ſlaves. And if they were, how unlike your negro ſlaves! When do you inſtruct them to read and write, and teach them to bear arms, to fight with their maſters? No, you are conſcious of guilt; therefore you muſt not inſtruct them, nor permit them to bear arms, leſt they ſhould claim their indiſputable right—equal liberty with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>But what manner of ſlaves had Solomon? Could the man who condemned oppreſſion, and declares death to be more tolerable than ſubjection (Eccleſ. iv.) keep involuntary ſlaves? No. But he brought the remnant of the Canaanites under tribute, and employed ſome of them, for a ſeaſon, as bondmen, in the building of the temple, for which labour they were moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably paid along with Hiram's ſervants.</p>
               <p>But now we have it, Lev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> xxv. 44, 45, 46. The Jews were permitted to buy of the heathen that were around them, and to leave their bondmen as an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance for their children for ever. But what was to become of the children of theſe bondmen? Not a word about them! ſurpriſing, that the law did not mention, "they and their <hi>children</hi> ſhall be your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for ever."<note n="*" place="bottom">The children of bondmen were without doubt born <hi>free,</hi> in Iſrael.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fact is, that the Levitical law knew nothing of involuntary ſlavery, unleſs in the caſe of theft or debt—and in either of thoſe caſes, the year of jubilee
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034442_0010_0FFDC910E13B6A70"/>
cleared all bondmen, without diſtinction. Read the 10th verſe of Lev. xxv. And ye ſhall hallow the fifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land, unto <hi>all</hi> the inhabitants thereof. The words for ever, in regard to bondage, could extend no farther than that year. In ſhort, the Iſraelites could not conſider their ſervants as bondmen any longer than they uſed them as themſelves; the ſame laws were made for the ſtranger as for the Iſraelite. But the poor negroes in America have no law to defend them—their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will not hold good againſt a white man; they may be abuſed, tortured, and are often wantonly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led—but what can they do? Nothing.</p>
               <p>If a bond ſervant ran away from his maſter in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, he was not to be delivered up to him again, but he was to live where he choſe, "where it liketh him beſt—thou ſhalt not oppreſs him," Deut. xxiii. 15, 16. This plainly proves that the Iſraelites had no other law to bind their bondmen, but the law of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thouſands of ſuch voluntary bondmen may be had at this day in Europe, who would willingly attach themſelves and families to good maſters. Yes, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would be given with them, provided their maſters would ſupport them without becoming burdenſome to the public. What a contraſt between the bondmen which the Jews had, and thoſe which the Americans keep! There, if a ſervant ran away from his maſter, none dared to deliver him up again: but he was to live where he pleaſed: here; if a poor wretch runs away, for fear, perhaps, of being flogged to death, all the blood-hounds in the country are after him, and all the newſpapers muſt publiſh, to the eternal diſgrace of their country, that ſuch a negro has run away, with ſo much reward for bringing him back, dead or alive; how many of the poor wretches are at this day wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the woods, and had rather ſtarve themſelves to death than be taken; and when taken, how many put an end to their exiſtence, rather than bear the ſcorpion whips of their maſters. There were no ſuch caſes in Iſrael? would to God there were none in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica!</p>

You triumph, by ſaying, "Now as we have liberty from the Old Teſtament to buy and keep ſlaves, let us ſearch our New Teſtament, and ſee if we can find it forbidden there."

               <p>Are there any in America at this day, ſo wilfully ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as not to know that the poor Africans were kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napped from their native country, by a ſet of <hi>miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> who ought to have been extirpated, long ago, from the face of the earth; knowing this property to be ſtolen, you keep it ſtill in your poſſeſſion, when you ought to return it to the right owners; wherefore, the blood of thoſe innocent men, you deprive of their rights, ſhall be required at your hands.</p>

But the goſpel, ſir, wherever its precepts are obeyed, aboliſhes ſlavery: this is, at any rate, tantamount to its being forbidden.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſermon that Jeſus Chriſt preached, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed liberty to the <hi>captives.</hi> All the prophets preached againſt oppreſſion, and predicted the day of emancipation.

book—and if I was to do the ſame, this alone would be enough againſt ſlavery. But perhaps you will ſay the above text has a ſpiritual meaning; and moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly it has a literal one. Religious and civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty go always hand in hand; they are, in ſome reſpects, as cloſely connected as the ſoul is to the body. The whole ſyſtem of chriſtianity is called by James, "<hi>the perfect law of liberty.</hi>" It could not be <hi>perfect,</hi> unleſs it comprehended the whole family of man, and this it does in a conſpicuous manner: the angels brought glad tidings of great joy unto all people, nations, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and tongue under heaven. The word goſpel ſignifies not only <hi>news</hi> but <hi>good news</hi> to all nations, and individuals who embrace the truth: and the truth ſhall make them free.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, that the believing ſlave will be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately liberated from an unbelieving maſter.

               <p>Suppoſe, for inſtance, that the young man who came to Chriſt to aſk, "what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life," to be a ſlaveholder; Chriſt told him to keep the commandments. O, he was a fine profeſſor! all this he had done! Chriſt admired him: and ſo do I admire many things in my ſlave-holding friends.—But Chriſt ſaid, "there is one thing lacking, go and ſell all that thou haſt and give to the poor." He might anſwer, if a ſlave-holder, there are no poor in my neighbourhood, we all ſupport our own ſlaves! Slaves, didſt thou ſay? What, go to heaven with a load of ſlaves on thy back! no, no, the gate is too ſtrait and the road too narrow for thee. Go and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the principles of liberty, then ſet them free and give them ſomething to begin the world with.

               <p>St. Paul exhorted thoſe who had believing ſervants "not to deſpiſe them, becauſe they were brethren, but rather to do them ſervice, becauſe they are faithful and partakers of the benefit," that is, they are now paid for their ſervices, are well treated, and have full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to change their maſters if they can better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

The precept will continue eternally the ſame; and, in order that you they underſtand it, I would ſend you, for a few years, to be a ſlave to the Algerines, who, by the bye, are angels when compared with many of the Engliſh and American ſlave-holders. Your ſaying, that, if you were a ſlave, your holder had a right to keep you ſo, is downright blaſphemy againſt juſtice and common ſenſe; if you was to ſwear to this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, no man in his ſenſes would believe you.</p>
               <p>It is true, according to the laws of retaliation, the negroes have a right to make ſlaves of all their preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

This is not an exaggerated ſtatement of the caſe, but the real repreſentation of things which are in America in the year 1797. O ſhame! where haſt thou fled!</p>
               <p>But it is the <hi>uſe</hi> and not the <hi>abuſe</hi> of ſlavery which you defend: it is impoſſible, ſir, to ſeparate them: the whole ſyſtem is abominably iniquitous. I know there are many humane maſters in America, who uſe their ſlaves better, than many do their hired ſervants

in Europe. What then, if a man keeps his <hi>whores</hi> well, does that juſtify his having them? I argue againſt the firſt principles of ſlavery; no man has a right to uſe or abuſe another without his conſent, unleſs he be guilty of ſome crime againſt ſociety, which expoſes him to its vengeance; every individual in the univerſe poſſeſſes certain rights which no man can diveſt him of, without injuſtice.</p>
               <p>Your hackneyed phraſe, "Servants obey your maſters," ſuits your purpoſe juſt as well as <q>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone:</q> where in the bible do you meet with the words "Slaves obey your tyrants"? no where.

Gen. xlii. 10. "But to buy food are thy <hi>ſlaves</hi> come." Pſalm cxix. 91. <q>They continue this day according to thine ordinances, for all are thy <hi>ſlaves.</hi>
                  </q> Luke i. 38. and Mary ſaid, "Behold the <hi>ſlave</hi> of my Lord." Luke xv. 29. "Lo theſe many years do I <hi>ſlave</hi> thee." Acts xx. 19. "<hi>Slaving</hi> the Lord with all humility of mind"!!!</p>
               <p>That hired and indented ſervants ſhould be exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obey their maſters, is very rational; and was it not for the ruinous ſyſtem of ſlavery, it would be done more cheerfully. But

               <p>With what face can any ſlave holder pray for the ſucceſs of the goſpel, whilſt he acts contrary to its firſt principles? Or have the Americans (as Day ſaith) ſhared the diſpenſing power of St. Peter's ſucceſſors to excuſe their own obſervance of thoſe rules which they impoſe on others? It is truly ridiculous in a civil ſenſe, that they ſhould with one hand ſign a bill of rights declaring all men equally free, and yet with the other hand brandiſh a whip over their affrighted ſlaves: if men would be conſiſtent, they muſt admit all the conſequences of their own principles; and the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, both as men and profeſſed Chriſtians, are reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the dilemma of acknowledging the rights of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their negroes, or ſurrendering their own.</p>

to buy horſes, chariots, fine linen, &amp;c. as it is to buy the bodies and ſouls of men:—what diabolical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! becauſe what may be lawfully ſold is connected with what no man has a right to ſell; do you ſuppoſe that it juſtifies you in keeping ſlaves;—and the church of Rome in ſelling indulgences, and pretending to bring ſouls for money out of purgatory!</p>
               <p>Your argument with J. Ramſay that the devil is the author of ſlavery, proves you to be a faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Old Nick, otherwiſe you would not be ſo zealous in defending his trade. You charge thoſe who are advocates for the manumiſſion of ſlaves, with "being blinded by the devil;" pray, ſir, to what end did Jeſus Chriſt come into the world? was it not to deſtroy the works of the devil? then according to your own mouth you are condemned to be the man blinded by the devil—and that the friends of emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation are children of light, labouring together with Chriſt to deſtroy <hi>ſlavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which is the works of Belzebub!</p>
               <p>As a champion combating all around, you next meet Mr. Leland, who aſſerts "that the whole ſcene of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is pregnant with enormous evils, and why not liberate them at once;"—"He would to heaven this was done, for the ſweets of rural and ſocial life, will never be enjoyed until then;" had he ſaid juſtice will not be done until then: God will not be honoured by the ſlave holders until then, it would be as well.</p>
               <p>Something, he ſays, muſt be done, and you ſay that this ſomething is already done, and refer him to Titus ii. 9. You might as well refer him to Tobit and his dog, for the exhorting of ſervants to obey their maſters, has no more to do with the obedience to their tyrants, than I have to do with the inhabitants of Jupiter; no, ſir, that ſomething has not yet been done in all the ſtates: the negroes in the firſt place ſhould be inſtructed ſo as to underſtand their rights as men, and their duties as citizens: then emancipate them without heſitation. This inſtead of producing any bad conſequences, would cauſe the bleſſings of God to flow through the land, as our majeſtic rivers roll their rapid waves to the ocean.

I ſhall collect a few out of many which ſpeak againſt oppreſſion. If ſimilar conſequences are deduced from the ſame cauſes, the application of the words Africans, America, &amp;c. inſtead of Iſrael and Canaan, can be no crime; they are, however, wrote in Italics, that you may ſee where the ſcripture-words are exchanged.</p>
               <p>Envy thou not the oppreſſor, and chooſe none of his ways; for he that oppreſſeth the poor reproacheth his Maker. Rob not the poor becauſe he is poor, neither oppreſs the afflicted in the gate. The Lord will be a refuge for the oppreſſed, and will judge the fatherleſs and the oppreſſed, that the man of the earth may no more oppreſs. For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe ſaith the Lord. I will ſet him in ſafety from him that puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at him. They are corrupt and ſpeak wickedly concerning oppreſſion. They ſpeak loftily. But he ſhall judge the poor of the people. He ſhall ſave the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034442_0021_0FFDC930F5A4AE68"/>
children of the needy, and ſhall break in pieces the oppreſſor. The cry of the children of <hi>Africa</hi> is come unto me, and I have alſo ſeen the oppreſſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Britiſh and the Americans</hi> oppreſs them; <hi>and</hi> I will break the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their oppreſſors as in the day of Midian.

               <p>So I returned and conſidered all <hi>the oppreſſions</hi> that are done under the Sun: and behold the tears of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no comforter; and on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Hear this now ye kine of Baſhan, which oppreſs the poor <hi>negroes</hi> and cruſh the needy among them; which ſay to their maſters, come and let us drink, for to-morrow will be as to day and much better: but thus ſaith the Lord, woe to the oppreſſing city! ſhe obeyed not my voice; ſhe received not correction, <hi>in her late ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle for Liberty</hi> ſhe truſted not in the Lord <hi>that he would provide for her if in caſe ſhe liberated her ſlaves;</hi> ſhe drew not near to her God to aſk counſel of him, <hi>who fought her battles and eſtabliſhed her independence.</hi> Wherefore what have ye to do with me, <hi>O Southern States, nor are ye to the north, eaſt and weſt free from blood; for the poor Africans have ye bought and ſold like cattle.</hi> Wherefore have I ſold your ſons and your daughters to the <hi>Algerines and Indians,</hi> and I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt the <hi>ſlave holders,</hi> and againſt thoſe who oppreſs the <hi>poor negroes,</hi> and turn away the ſtranger from his right, for ye were ſtrangers yourſelves <hi>at one time in this land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs him; for ye know the heart of a ſtranger. Wherefore thus ſaith the holy One of Iſrael, becauſe
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034442_0022_0FFDC932D55D67F8"/>
ye deſpiſe this word, and truſt in oppreſſion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs and ſtay thereon. His iniquity ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall ſwelling out in a high wall, whoſe breaking cometh ſuddenly at an inſtant.</p>
               <p>Therefore go to now ye rich men, weep and howl for your miſeries that ſhall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaten: your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were fire. Behold the hire of the <hi>ſlaves</hi> which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them that have reaped and planted have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth: ye have lived in pleaſure on the earth and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your hearts as in the day of ſlaughter. Ye have condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and killed the juſt, and he (<hi>the poor African</hi>) doth not reſiſt you; <hi>but in a mournful tone after being ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and tortured to the laſt degree ſaith with his expiring breath,</hi> "<hi>Maſter, you have killed me.</hi>"</p>
               <p>For thy violence againſt thy brother, (<hi>the African</hi>) ſhame ſhall cover thy borders, <hi>O America!</hi> Becauſe I have called <hi>by a particular Providence upon you to ſet them free, when you obtained your own liberty,</hi> and ye refuſed. I have ſtretched out my hand, <hi>ſince and ſmote your borders, particularly the ſeat of your Federal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a malignant ſcourge,</hi> but you have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. <hi>I have cauſed an inſurrection to take place in the land, and have ſent forth a furious element to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and deſtroy your cities; your commerce likewiſe I have given as a pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y to contending powers.</hi> But ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh as a deſolation, and your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh as a whirlwind: <hi>for I will continue to plague you more and more, until you let the Africans</hi> go free.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye have faſted and kept days of thankſgiving,</hi> but is not this the faſt I have choſen? to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to undo the heavy burden, and let the oppreſſed <hi>African</hi> go free, and that ye break every yoke of <hi>bondage among you:</hi> therefore learn to do well; ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, <hi>and</hi> if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour, if ye oppreſs not the ſtranger, &amp;c. Then
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034442_0023_0FFDC93898AAB280"/>
I will cauſe you to dwell in this place, in the land I have given to your fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ever and ever.—<hi>But if ye continue to keep the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans in bondage,</hi> behold the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> yea, and all who do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch. <hi>No not ſo much as a ſlave-holder in the world</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then ſhall the oppreſſed take up this proverb againſt the <hi>tyrants</hi> and ſay; How hath the oppreſſor ceaſed! What ſhall the prey be taken from the mighty, and the captive be delivered? But thus ſaith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty ſhall be taken away; and the prey of the terrible ſhall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and will ſave thy children. And I will feed them that oppreſs thee with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be DRUNKEN WITH THEIR OWN BLOOD, as with ſweet wine. I, even I, am he that will comfort you <hi>O Africans!</hi>—Who art thou, that thou ſhould'ſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die—and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker; and haſt feared every day continually becauſe of the fury of the oppreſſor, as if he was ready to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>And where is the fury of the oppreſſor? The captive-exile haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he may be looſened, and that he ſhould not die in the pit; nor that his bread ſhould fail. For it ſhall come to paſs in that day that his burden ſhall be taken away from off thy ſhoulders, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke ſhall be deſtroyed becauſe of the anointing—<hi>becauſe of the promiſe and the oath of God, the unction of Liberty</hi> ſhall be poured upon all fleſh; <hi>and</hi> Ethiopia <hi>among other nations</hi> ſhall ſtretch forth her hands to God. <hi>Yes, all the nations of the earth ſhall like kindred drops of rain mingle together in one ocean of love</hi>—<hi>in one family of brethren.</hi> Then I ſhall ſing—
