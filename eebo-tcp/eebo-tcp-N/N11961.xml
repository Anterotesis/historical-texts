            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN the ambition of Princes induces them to break over the ſacred barriers of ſocial compact, and to violate thoſe rights, which it is their duty to defend, they will leave no methods uneſſayed to bring the people to acquieſce in their unjuſtifiable encroachments.</p>
            <p>IN this cauſe, the pens of venal authors have, in every age, been drawn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With Machiavelian ſubtilty, they have laboured to perſwade mankind, that their public happineſs conſiſted in being ſubject to uncontrouled power; that they were incapable of judging concerning the myſteries of government; and that it was their intereſt to deliver their eſtates, their liberties, and their lives, into the hands of an abſolute Monarch.</p>
            <p>MITER<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hypocrites, and cringing, baſe-ſouled Prieſts, have impiouſly dared to inliſt the oracles of GOD into the ſervice of deſpotiſm; to aſſert, that, by the command of the ſupreme lawgiver, we are bound to ſurrender our rights into the hands of the firſt bold Tyrant, who dares to ſeize them; and that when ſo ſeized, it is rebellion againſt God, and treaſon againſt the Prince, for us to attempt to reſume them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015101_0005_0F95D2D82E68A938"/>DEPRAVED as is the human underſtanding, it hath yet ſtrength enough to diſcern the ridiculous falacy of theſe aſſertions: The votaries of ignorance and ſuperſtition may indeed be impoſed upon by them: When we place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited confidence in our civil or ſpiritual fathers, we can ſwallow, with eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moſt improbable dogmas; but there are feelings in the human heart, which compel men to recognize their own rights, to venerate the majeſty of the people, and to deſpiſe the inſult which is offered to their underſtandings, by theſe doating abſurdities. Had princes no other methods to accompliſh their purpoſes, could they not eſtabliſh their uſarpation, without convincing mens judgments of their utility, they would be more harmleſs to mankind than they have ever yet been? They might be ſurrounded with the faſcinating gew-gaws of regal pomp; a few paraſites might bow the knee before theſe idols of their own creating; the weak and the wicked might obey their mandates; but the baneful influence which they now have upon the intereſts of individuals, and of ſociety, would come to a period: they would not revel in the ſpoils of nations, nor trample upon the ruins of public Liberty.</p>
            <p>CONSCIOUS of this, they have uſed arguments, and purſued methods, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different from theſe, to effect their deſigns; inſtead of convincing the underſtandings, they have addreſſed themſelves to the paſſions of men: The acts of bribery and corruption have been tried with a fatal ſucceſs: Men, <hi>We</hi> know, have ſold their children, their country, and their GOD, for a ſmall quantity of painted dirt, <hi>which will periſh with the uſing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>EXTENSIVE as are the revenues of princes, they are ſtill inadequate to the purpoſe of bribing large communities to ſubmit to their pleaſure; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting therefore a few, they have overawed the reſt; from ſmall beginnings, and under ſpacious pretences, they will uſe a ſtanding military force, the moſt ſucceſsfull engine ever yet weilded by the hand of lawleſs domination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:015101_0006_0F95D2D8EEEC40B8"/>WITH ſuch a force, it is eaſy for an ambitious prince, poſſeſſed by nature of very ſlender abilities, to ſubvert every principle of liberty in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his government, and to render his people the moſt abject of ſlaves; if any individual feels the injury done to his country, and wiſhes to reſtore it to a ſtate of happineſs, with a bayonet at his breaſt, a dragoon will compel him to ſilence: If the people, awakened to ſee their intereſt and their duty, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the ſame purpoſe, a military force is at hand to ſubdue them, and by leaden arguments, to convince them of their error.</p>
            <p>AN eaſy taſk would it be to enlarge upon the fatal conſequences of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſuch a ſtanding army in time of peace, and of quartering a lawleſs body of men, who deſpiſe the juſt reſtraints of civil authority, in free and populous cities: That no veſtige of freedom can remain in a ſtate where ſuch a force exiſts; that the morals of the people will be gradually corrupted; that they will contract ſuch an habit of tame ſubmiſſion, as to become an eaſy prey to the brutal tyrant who rules them; hath been heretofore largely and plainly demonſtrated, by perſons ſo much more capable of doing it, than he who is ſpeaking, that it would be preſumption in him to attempt it now.</p>
            <p>THERE is no need of recurring to the ancient hiſtories of Greece and Rome, for inſtances of theſe truths. The Britiſh nation, once famous for its attachment to freedom, and enthuſiaſtically jealous of its rights, is now become a great tame beaſt, which fetches and carries for any miniſter who pleaſes to employ it.</p>
            <p>ENGLISHMEN have been wont to boaſt of the excellence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; to boaſt that it contained whatever was excellent, in every form of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015101_0007_0F95D2D9AC01F208"/>
government, hitherto, by the wit of man deviſed; in their King, whoſe power was limited, they have aſſerted that they enjoyed the advantages of Monarchy, without fear of its evils: While their houſe of Commons, choſen by the ſuffrages of the people, and dependant upon them, repreſented a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public; their houſe of peers, forming a balance of power between the king and the people, gave them the benefit of an ariſtocracy. In theory, the Britiſh conſtitution is, on many accounts, excellent; but when we obſerve it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice, when we obſerve the Britiſh government, as it has been, for a long courſe of years, adminiſtered, we muſt be convinced that its boaſted advantages are not real: The management of the public revenue, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of civil and military officers, are veſted in the king: Improving the advantages which thoſe powers give him, he hath ſound means to corrupt the other branches of the legiſlature: Britons pleaſe themſelves with the thought of being free; their tyrant ſuffers them to enjoy the ſhadow, whilſt he himſelf graſps the ſubſtance of power. Impoſſible would it have been for the kings of England to have acquired ſuch an exorbitant power, had they not had a ſtanding army under their command: With the officers of this army they have bribed men to ſacrifice the rights of their country: Having artfully got their arms out of the hands of the people, with their mercenary forces, they have awed them into ſubmiſſion. When they have appeared, at any time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſert their freedom, theſe troops have been ready to obey the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates of their ſovereign, to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brethren.</p>
            <p>HAVING found the efficacy of this method to quell a ſpirit of liberty in the people of Great-Britain, the <hi>righteous</hi> adminiſtration of the <hi>righteous</hi> king, George the third, determined to try the experiment upon the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. To fright us into ſubmiſſion to their unjuſtifiable claims, they ſent a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force to the town of Boſton. This day leads us to reflect upon the fatal effects of the meaſure! By their intercourſe with troops, made up in general
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015101_0008_0F95D2DA6C8D8C50"/>
of the moſt abandoned of men, the morals of our youth were corrupted: The temples and the day of our God were ſcandalouſly prophaned: We experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the moſt provoking inſults; and at length ſaw the ſtreets of Boſton ſtrewed with the corpſes of five of its inhabitants, murdered in cool blood, by the Britiſh mercenaries.</p>
            <p>THE indignant rage which ſwelled your boſoms upon this occaſion, the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and humanity which you diſcovered, the anguiſh of the friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the dead and wounded, with all the horrors of that memorable night, have been painted in vivid colours by an HANCOCK and a WARREN<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have ſhewn the neceſſity of thoſe exertions made by the town, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated at that time, the deſigns of the enemies to American liberty, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, for the preſent, from the calamities of war.</p>
            <p>BUT the paſt year hath preſented us with a Tragedy more ſtriking, becauſe more extenſive, than this: A Tragedy, which more plainly proves the fatal effects of keeping up ſtanding armies in time of peace, than any arguments whatſoever: We have ſeen the ground crimſoned with the gore of hundreds of our fellow-citizens,—we have ſeen the firſt city in America for wealth and extent, depopulated, we have ſeen others deſtroyed, and heard our ſavage ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies breathing out thirſtings for our blood.</p>
            <p>FINDING their arts inſufficient to flatter, or their treaſures to bribe the people of America, out of their freedom, the Britiſh government determined, by force, to ſubjugate them to their arbitrary will: In conſequence of this determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a large party of their troops marched from Boſton, on the morning of the ever memorable nineteenth of April laſt, fluſhed with the hopes of certain victory,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015101_0009_0F95D2DB2C85A0F8"/>

            <p>THE heights of Charleſtown witneſſed to the world, that Americans, fight<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in the cauſe of freedom, were a formidable foe: although they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by troops, hitherto deemed invincible; although they ſaw the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their countrymen inveloped with flames; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

This audience, acquainted, in the moſt intimate manner, with his numberleſs virtues, muſt feel his loſs, and bemoan their beloved, their entruſted fellow-citizen! Ah! my countrymen, what tender, what excruciating ſenſations ruſh at once upon our burdened minds, when we recall his lov'd idea! when we reflect upon the manner of his death; when we fancy that we ſee his ſavage enemies exulting o'er his corpſe, beautiful even in death; when we remember that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of the rites of ſepulture, he was caſt into the ground, without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction due to his rank and merit; we cannot reſtrain the ſtarting tear, we cannot repreſs the burſting ſigh! We mourn thine exit, illuſtrious ſhade, with undiſſembled grief; we venerate thine exalted character; we will erect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to thy memory in each of our grateful breaſts, and to the lateſt ages, will teach our tender infants to liſp the name of WARREN, with veneration and applauſe!</p>
            <p>WHEN we traverſe the Canadian wilds, and come to the plains of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, where WOLFE once fell, we are there again compelled to pay a tribute to exalted merit, and to lament the fall of the great MONTGOMERY! War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a ſpirit of patriotiſm, too little felt by his venal countrymen, he eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the cauſe of American freedom: He left domeſtic eaſe and affluence: He girded on the ſword which he had long laid aſide, and <hi>jeoparded his life on the high places of the field:</hi> Victory followed his ſtandard, ſhe hover'd o'er his head, and crowned it with the laurel wreath: She was juſt ready to hail him the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of <hi>Canada,</hi> when the fatal ſiſters ſnapped, in a moment the thread of life, and ſeized, from his eager graſp, the untaſted conqueſt! Americans, bear witneſs to his humanity and his valour, for he died fighting in your cauſe and the cauſe of mankind! let his memory live in your breaſts; let it be handed down to your poſterity, that millions yet unborn may <hi>riſe up and call him bleſſed!</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:015101_0012_0F95D2DD6E07E7B0"/>THE tender feelings of the human heart are deeply affected with the fate of theſe and the other heroes who have bled and died, that their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try may be free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But at the ſame time, ſenſations of indignant wrath, are excited in the breaſt of every friend to freedom: He will liſten to the voice of their blood, which cries aloud to heaven, and to him for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance! He will feel himſelf animated with new vigor in the glorious cauſe: Nothing daunted by their untimely fate, he will ruſh into the midſt of danger, that he may ſhare their glory, and avenge their death! Every idea which can warm and animate him to glorious deeds, will ruſh at once upon his mind; and when engaged in the warmeſt battle, he will hear them, from their heaven, urging him to action: He will feel their ſpirits transfuſed into his breaſt; he will ſacrifice whole <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

The legiſlature of Great-Britain is totally corrupt; her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration is arbitrary and tyrannical; the people have loſt their ſpirit of reſentment; and like the moſt contemptible of animals, <hi>bow the ſhoulder to bear and become ſervants unto tribute.</hi> The national reſources are cut off; ſhe is loaded with an intolerable public debt; ſhe is become the ſcorn of thoſe foreigners, to whom ſhe was once terrible; and it is eaſy to ſee that her glory is in the wane.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:015101_0013_0F95D2DE2AF07E20"/>HOW different from this is the preſent ſtate of our country! Deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a race of hardy anceſtors, who loved their freedom better than they loved their lives; the Americans are jealous of the leaſt infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their rights; ſtrangers to that luxury, which effeminates the mind and body; they are capable of enduring incredible hardſhips; with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they ruſh into the field of battle, and brave with coolneſs, every danger: They poſſeſs a rich and a fruitful country, ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, them with every neceſſary and convenience of life; they have inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible reſources for carrying on war, and bid fair ſoon to be courted for their alliance, by the proudeſt Monarchs of the earth. Their ſtateſmen are equal to the taſk of forming and defending a free and extenſive empire: Their Generals are brave and humane, intrepid and prudent. When I name a WASHINGTON, my audience will feel the juſtice of the remark, and acquit me of the charge of flattery.</p>
            <p>POSSESSED of theſe advantages, we ſhould be inexcuſable to God, to our poſterity, to the whole world, if we heſitated, a ſingle moment, in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our right, and repelling the attacks of lawleſs power. Freedom is offered to us, ſhe invites us to accept her bleſſings; driven from the other regions of the globe, ſhe wiſhes to find an aſylum in the wilds of America; with open arms, let us receive the perſecuted fair, let us imitate the example of our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable anceſtors, who loved and courted her into theſe deſert climes. With determined bravery, let us reſiſt the attacks of her impudent raviſhers; by reſolution and firmneſs we may defend her from their power, and tranſmit her bleſſings to millions upon millions of our poſterity. Let us then arouſe to arms! For, upon our exertions, under God, depends their freedom, upon our exertions depends the important queſtion, whether the riſing empire of America, ſhall be an empire of ſlaves or of freemen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:015101_0014_0F95D2DEEB914260"/>ANIMATED by theſe conſiderations, my friends and fellow-citizens, let us ſtrain every nerve in the ſervice of our country! What are our lives, when viewed in competition with the happineſs of ſuch an empire! What is our private intereſt, when oppoſed to that of three millions of men! Let our boſoms glow with warmth of patriotiſm; let us ſacrifice our eaſe, our fortunes and our lives, that we may ſave our country.</p>
            <p>THAT a ſpirit of public virtue may tranſcend every private conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you, the reſpected inhabitants of the Town of Boſton, have plainly manifeſted: With pleaſure you have ſacrificed what ſelfiſh men hold moſt dear, to ſave this oppreſſed land!

Like the ſturdy oak, you have ſtood unmoved, and to you, under God, will be owing the ſalvation of this extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
            <p>WE feel, my beloved friends, our obligations to you! Our hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them; we cordially wiſh it were in our power to reward you for your patriotiſm; to reſtore you to that eaſe and affluence, of which, for our ſakes, you have deprived yourſelves; it is not, But our morning and evening petitions to the guardian God of America ſhall be, that he will bleſs and reward you.</p>
            <p>WITH tranſport, my countrymen, let us look forward to the bright day, which ſhall hail us a free and independant ſtate. With earneſtneſs let us implore the forgiveneſs and the patronage of the Being of all beings, who holds the fate of empires in his hands! With zeal let us exert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſervice of our country, in life: And when the earthly ſcene ſhall be cloſing with us, let us expire with this prayer upon our quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips, O GOD, LET AMERICA BE FREE!</p>
