            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>— Riſe up—and come away. For lo, the Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone. The Flowers appear on the Earth, the Time of the ſinging of Birds is come—ariſe—and come away.</p>

            <p>OF all the meer Men who have lived ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Author of this beautiful Paſſage is pronounced the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, by the GOD of Heaven. And of all the Books which he wrote, this is,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004683_0003_100DB7EC84224210"/>without Diſpute, the moſt elegant, ſublime and devout. The three Books which <hi>Solomon</hi> wrote, are reſembled to the three Diviſions of the Temple which he built; of which the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> is compar'd to this admirable Song. His <hi>Proverbs</hi> contain an excellent Scheme of Morality; and to this anſwers the outward Encloſure, called the <hi>Court of the Gentiles.</hi> His <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> contains the Diſquiſitions of a philoſophical and religious Genius after true Happineſs; and the ſolemn Reflections and pious Arguments render it a <hi>holy Place.</hi> But this <hi>Divine Song</hi> is all conſecrated Rapture; 'tis the <hi>Holy of Holies:</hi> It muſt be approach'd with Reverence and Trembling, and it admits of no unhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Feet to tread its awful Receſſes.</p>
            <p>The Title of the Book is, <hi>The Song of Songs;</hi> and it well deſerves the Name, for it is the fineſt poetical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure now extant in the World. It is not every where over-nice and exact in its Metaphers and Alluſions; but they are bold and grand, elevated and lofty, all Fire, all conſecrated Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Inſpiration!</p>

The Criticks in the Art of Poetry will preſently ſee that it is a <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> Compoſition of that kind to which perhaps the Moderns would give the Name of a <hi>Paſtoral Opera.</hi> That it is a <hi>Dramatic</hi> Performance is eaſily diſcerned, inaſmuch as it conſiſts whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The Words are a Deſcription of the Spring of the Year, in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Great Part of it may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally applied to our Spring: But in ſome Reſpects it varies. The Winter there, as in our Mother-Country, uſed to be cloudy and rainy, and a ſteady fair Weather uſed to ſmile on the Face of the Spring. Indeed it is otherwiſe in our inconſtant Climate, where we ſee the Clouds ſo frequently returning after the Rain.</p>
            <p>Without going into the myſtical or prophetical Way of explaining theſe Words, I ſhall only obſerve, That they are the Invitation of CHRIST to his beloved Church.

Then 'tis that the Face of Nature puts on the moſt gay and alluring Smiles; and the beautiful Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects about us are apt to catch away our Thoughts, and poſſeſs and fill up our Minds. Then 'tis too, that our animal Spirits are moſt ſprightly and vigorous; and our fermented Blood pours along its rapid Current more warm and impetuous. The Chains of the Winter are melted off: and the <hi>Bands of Orion are looſed:</hi> And from this Fluſh of Blood and Spirits, there ariſes a Variety of Temptations. Our Appetites are moſt raging and violent and our inferiour Faculties moſt apt t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> uſurp the Throne of Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcience. We are now moſt eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004683_0014_100DB8052A3DACC8"/>with the tempting Proſpects of Futurity; and we preſume upon a vain Earth, and Happineſs here below, from a Warmth of Temper, and the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of our Blood and animal Spirits. Thus we ſee the Temptations of the Spring both external and internal. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, from the alluring Face of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Internal, from our own Frame and Conſtitution. How proper then the Call? <hi>Riſe up and come away.</hi> Does the <hi>low</hi> Face of the Ground tempt us? <hi>Riſe up.</hi> Get above the Earth. Leave the Molehill for the Emmits to inhabit; but let us take to our ſelves Wings, as Angels, and fly away. Have we our Temptations in <hi>our ſelves? Come away</hi> then; let us get out of our ſelves into CHRIST; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelves from our ſelves, and mortify and root out the corrupted ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Principle in us.</p>
               <p>And indeed nothing will have a greater Tendency to demonſtrate our Sincerity in Religion, than our Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to defeat the ſtrongeſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which aſſault us in this World. When Sin ſpreads all its Snares, and lays all its alluring Bates in our Way,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004683_0015_100DB8080E673D98"/>if we have then Power to overcome all, and paſs unhurt amidſt all, it will be a good Evidence that we are inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Power ſuperiour to our own: That the Holy Spirit is in us; and that we are in good Earneſt in Religion. The ſame Arguments to perſuade Youth to ſerious Piety, are in the ſame Senſe proper to perſwade us to Religion in the Spring. Becauſe we may all the Year look back on it with this concomitant Satisfaction, When Temptations were moſt univerſal, and moſt impetuous, I ſtood the Shock, and was carried graciouſly thro' them.</p>
               <p>And what an Honour will it be for us to overcome Temptations when they are at the ſtrongeſt; and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our Appetites when they are moſt raging and lawleſs?

               <p>And indeed, The Addreſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is proper for us all: For we are all in the Spring of our Being, while we are in this Life. Eternity is like an endleſs Year, of which this Life is like the budding Spring. And, as the Spring is, the Year will be more or leſs fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and bleſſed. If in this Life we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey GOD; the Spring of this Life
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004683_0041_100DB844FAE2EBB0"/>will end in the Heat of a withered Summer, the Flames of eternal Fire. If, on the contrary, we ſerve GOD from a Principle of Faith in CHRIST, our Spring will end in a bleſſed Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt: And we ſhall enter upon the Feaſt of the Fruits that adorn Paradiſe. Death it ſelf will but convey us to the Regions of immortal Life: And our LORD JESUS CHRIST the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, will lead us through the dark Valley, to the green Paſtures, and the ſtill Waters. There the Groves ever bloſſom, the Flowers ever flouriſh, and the Fields are ever green. There JESUS himſelf blooms in unveiled Charms, and invites us to him, with his dear Voice. We may lie upon the Bed of Death, and ſee the endleſs Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhine behind the Glooms, and guild and break away the awful Shadows. We may ſee our dear SAVIOUR at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, encouraging our defired Flight. We may hear his Voice ſound charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the dark Length of the Vale of Death; <hi>Riſe up, and come away!</hi> And the laſt Words we utter, when we leave the Flouriſh of the lower Spring

For ye ſhall go out with Joy, and be led forth with Peace: the Mountains and the Hills ſhall break forth before you into ſinging, and all the Trees of the Field ſhall clap their Hands. Inſtead of the Thorn ſhall come up the Fir-tree, and inſtead of the Brier ſhall come up the Myrtle-Tree: and it ſhall be to the LORD for a Name, for an everlaſting Sign, that ſhall not be cut off.
