            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE is nothing can afford ſuch ſolid and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comfort in any undertaking, as a firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken confidence that the Lord Jehovah is on our ſide, and the cauſe we engage in, is the cauſe of God. As it lays the foundation of true, chriſtian courage, ſo it ought to be the rule by which to walk and conduct ourſelves. If we are zealouſly affected, it ſhould always be in a good cauſe, and ſuch as the God of Heaven will approve of. Unleſs we ſet out with this view, we have reaſon to expect nothing but diſappointment in the iſſue. It muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, who profeſs to believe the being and perfections of a God, that there is not only a general, but particular providence, ordering and directing the affairs of our world, ſo as to ſubſerve the wiſe ends of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This being the ſtate of the caſe, it muſt be a matter of the laſt importance to us, whether in a ſingle or ſocial capacity, that we have God our almighty friend and protector. This belief is undoubtedly implied in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application that has been made, to have a ſermon preached, ſuited to the preſent times and adapted in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner to the circumſtance of ſuch preſent, as are ready to march into the field, gallantly to expoſe their lives in defence of our moſt invaluable rights and privileges. Now if God be for us, who may or can be againſt us? But if God be againſt us, what power can ſucceſsfully engage in our defence?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930"/>
IN our context we have an account of Sennacherib's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent upon Hezekiah's kingdom, together with the ſpecial care Hezekiah took to put himſelf in the beſt poſſible poſture of defence. The means is ours, the ſucceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon God. Sennacherib was then the ſcourge of that part of the world, as Nebuchadnezzar was afterwards. God often raiſes up ſuch inſtruments for the purpoſe of execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, and bringing about ſome important revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They are uſed as the rods of his anger, and when his work is done he caſts them into the fire. Every ſtep is taken by Hezekiah to check Sennacherib's march through his dominions. If we truſt God with our ſafety it muſt be in the uſe of proper means, otherwiſe we tempt, not truſt him.</p>
            <p>IN the 6th verſe the good King gathers the people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſpeaks comfortably unto them. This was infinitely better calculated to inſpire both officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with freſh courage to go into the field, than horrid oaths and imprecations. It is moſt certainly a matter of ſupreme conſequence that ſuch as have the principal direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an army be men of God, that they may inſpire their ſoldiery with true chriſtian courage.</p>
            <p>BE ſtrong, &amp;c. q. d. Do not baſely ſhrink back in an hour of danger, but reſolve to hold it out to the laſt man. Let the ſoldiers quit themſelves like men, make good their parts, ſtand to their arms, and diſplay their valour equal to the goodneſs of the cauſe. Like a General who diſplays his banners under the Lord of Hoſts, he encourages them with the moſt animating conſiderations, that however numerous and formidable the army was that came againſt them, yet theirs exceeded. God, ſays he, is with us, and that is more than all the combined forces of the enemy. At beſt the arm of fleſh is all that they can boaſt of, but with us is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable and omnipotent arm. We have a God in covenant, not only to help us, but to go before and fight our battles.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION. There is nothing tends ſo effectually to inſpire with true courage as a lively impreſſion of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and interpoſition of God.</p>
            <p>IN the farther proſecution of the ſubject, I deſign, thro' divine aid, the following method.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014758_0003_0F94DD8DC6E03930"/>
1ſt. TO ſhew wherein true Fortitude conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. BY what method we are to judge of God's being on our ſide, to fight our battles.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THE grounds of confidence ariſing therefrom.</p>
            <p>I. I am to ſhew you wherein true Fortitude conſiſts.—In general it conſiſts in a temper of mind diſpoſing perſons to perform brave and noble actions, without being daunted at the appearance of dangers or difficulties in the way. With much propriety therefore is this temper recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch as are engaged in the military life, as they muſt endure hardneſs, and lay their accounts to meet with many hardſhips in the diſcharge of their important truſt. True Fortitude is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to compleat a good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. A poor puſillanimous ſoul is unfit for real ſervice, and ſhrinks back in an hour of danger, when duty urges to action. The Heathen Moraliſts reckoned courage in war to be the higheſt diſplay thereof, and that the ſoldier had the beſt opportunity to diſplay his courage, as life, the deareſt thing in the world, was riſqued in war. There is natural Fortitude or Stoutneſs, a large ſhare of which the ancient Romans poſſeſſed, which, however ſerviceable for the ſoldier, yet is eſſentially different from, and vaſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to, the Fortitude I am explaining. Many miſtake its true nature, and at beſt give us but a very feeble and imperfect notion thereof. There is no more illuſtrious diſplay of real Fortitude than to encounter the vicious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the age we live in; to row againſt the current of corrupt cuſtoms, to be ſingly ſober amidſt thoſe who mock at all goodneſs, virtue and piety; to reject the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of kind but wicked companions; and eſpecially to put to the torture and reſolutely crucify one's own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inclinations: This requires a face of flint and an heart of ſteel, the ſpirit and courage of an hero, and the ſtrength of a giant. eſpecially by ſuch as from the nature of their calling, plunge into a ſea of temptation, and are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally dunned with the allurements of enſnaring companions. This, Gentlemen, as it is at the foundation of true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſo it is the beſt armour you can carry with you into the field. "Therefore quit yourſelves like men, be ſtrong,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010"/>
take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt all the wiles of the Devil." Many whilſt they have laid the world in blood and aſhes, have had Victory chained to their chariot wheels wherever they turned, have been mean and baſe cowards, ſubmitted to the tyranny of every unruly luſt and appetite. The vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over carnal ſelf, is more than to ſet flames to whole rowns, and level the proudeſt walls.</p>
            <p>BUT to be particular—</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. TRUE courage does not conſiſt in inſenſibility of danger, but nobly riſing above it in our minds. There can be no diſplay of courage, however great the danger, if perſons are entirely inſenſible thereof. In vain may the perſon aſleep upon a top-maſt in time of a ſtorm, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it was an inſtance of courage; or the drunkard ſtanding upon the brink of an awful precipice. Neither will it be characteriſtic of true courage for perſons to plunge into thickeſt dangers, without a proper ſenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and a mind ready prepared to meet every event. The more quick our ſenſe of danger, the more true heroiſm in engaging therein, as it manifeſts a clear ſenſe of duty and our fixed reſolution to perſevere.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. NEITHER does true Fortitude conſiſt in baniſhing all fear. The fear of God is not only conſiſtent with, but at the very foundation of true courage. There is no ſuch hero as the chriſtian hero, nor is any thing of equal effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to encourage us to meet death, as the fear of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts. I fear many of our gentlemen officers and ſoldiers are accuſtomed to eſteem it an inſtance of cowardice to fear and ſerve God, and therefore caſt off all fear and reſtrain prayer before him. This is not courage but teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or raſhneſs. "What, not fear him who can kill both ſoul and body and caſt them into hell for ever?" Not to fear God is to be a ſervant of ſin and ſlave to every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly luſt. Thus we often ſee that ſober and diſcreet youths, as ſoon as they enter the army grow debauched, learn to profane God's holy name, as though curſing and ſwearing were vices licenſed by the God of Heaven. I hope better things of you, Gentlemen, yet as a faithful friend I muſt warn you.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014758_0004_0F94DD8E8DF10010"/>
3. NEITHER does it conſiſt in expoſing ourſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary danger. Our courage ought to be exerciſed in conjunction with chriſtian prudence, ſo as not to ruſh into danger unleſs a ſenſe of duty calls. To plunge our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the moſt imminent danger where the object to be obtained is very inconſiderable, and the proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining even that little, doubtful, would be injudicious and raſh. Perſons may throw away their lives under the miſtaken notion of fortitude, to perpetuate their names, and gain immortal renown. When the call is clear, and the object to be obtained, glorious, no danger ſhould be avoided—the greateſt difficulties ſubmitted to.</p>
            <p n="4">4. TRUE courage then conſiſts in a free and chearful diſpoſition to encounter the greateſt dangers, when there is an evident call in the providence of God. This ought to be the grand object of our attention, and at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of every hazardous undertaking. A conſciouſneſs of this animates the ſoul, and makes it riſe above undue fear in the diſcharge of the moſt arduous duties. There is nothing will make perſons more determined to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger and play the man, than a firm perſuaſion that we are on the Lord's ſide, and that the cauſe we eſpouſe is the cauſe of heaven. In ſuch circumſtances ten men will drive an hundred, and an hundred put a thouſand to flight. An army ſo principled goes into the field reſolved upon death or victory.</p>
            <p>WITH what a divine enthuſiaſm were Iſrael led to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage all their enemies, under the animating addreſſes of their Generals, Moſes and Joſhua? <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxi. 6. "Be ſtrong and of a good courage, fear not nor be afraid of them: For the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forſake thee." To the ſame purpoſe, Joſh. i. 9. "Have not I commanded thee? Be ſtrong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou diſmayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoever thou goeſt." With ſuch views, Gentlemen, ought you to go into the field as the moſt ſignal proof of your true courage!</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8"/>
5. TRUE courage manifeſts itſelf in ſuppreſſing anxious and diſtracting fears about what is future. It is enough that he is engaged in the path of duty, and therefore leaves what is future in the hand of God. It is the part of a coward to ſhrink from preſent duty for fear of future ills. The coward often fears where there is no real dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and cries. There is a lion in the ſtreet. He perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es himſelf with imaginary evils, and repreſents real ones much more frightful than they are in themſelves. But the brave ſoldier does not flinch at the proſpect of future hardſhips; he has laid his accounts to endure hardneſs as a good ſoldier, and ſo ſtands ready prepared to meet them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. TRUE Fortitude will diſcover itſelf in a vigorous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to our work, notwithſtanding the ſtated and conſtant difficulties and oppoſitions that ſtand in the way. There is a perſeverance abſolutely neceſſary, and that when we may be foiled once and again. It does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirit the truly magnanimous ſoldier notwithſtanding he may meet with a variety of diſcouragements and repulſes; he perſiſts ſo long as the object appears attainable, and does not ſink under a temporary check. He reſolves not to quit the field until, under God, he puts the armies of the aliens to flight and comes off a complete conqueror. He is encouraged to purſue the cauſe from a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that he fights under Jehovah's banner and that he will be crowned with ſucceſs at laſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. TRUE Fortitude conſiſts in an uniform ſtedfaſtneſs of conduct amidſt all the trials and dangers we meet with. There can be no diſplay of courage when danger is not near; many talk big when dangers are at a diſtance, but let them be called forth to meet them, they will ſlink into a corner and baſely betray the cauſe, when the greateſt need to ſtand forth. But cool courage and real fortitude encreaſes and that in proportion to the danger. He quits not his poſt, flinches not his ground, nor turns his back upon the oppoſing enemy. Though he might have had his fears before the ſcene of action; though he might not have had ſo much falſe confidence as many others; though he might meet danger with a trembling hand, yet if he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014758_0005_0F94DD8F4A2342B8"/>
ſtands his ground in the heat of battle, he gives the moſt unequivocal proof of his real Fortitude. It has often been remarked of ſome of the braveſt ſoldiers, that they have come into the field with a trembling hand, and yet have performed wonders. No puniſhment can be too great for the baſe coward who either deſerts or meanly turns his back in the hour of battle. Upon that moment may hang the fate of an empire; upon that ſingle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement the liberties, both civil and religious, of an whole continent. This, my dear Gentlemen, will be your indiſpenſible duty if called to action. Remember that the liberties of unborn millions may hang ſuſpended on the fate of a ſingle hour—To deſert the cauſe or baſely betray the important truſt, would leave an indelible blot upon your names and your poſterity to the lateſt ages. Thus I have attempted to open up the nature of true Fortitude, and truſt that God will inſpire your ſouls with that noble ſpirit, who are ſingling yourſelves out in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our invaded rights.</p>
            <p>BUT I proceed in the</p>
            <p>II HEAD, To ſhew you by what method we are to judge of God's being on our ſide, to fight our battles.</p>
            <p>AS a rational conviction of this is at the foundation of true courage, ſo it becomes all thoſe who embark in the preſent intereſting diſpute, narrowly to examine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to weigh matters, left they might be found to fight againſt God. As nothing can animate equal to the conſciouſneſs of a good cauſe, ſo on the other hand no thought can be more ſinking, no reflection more chilling, than an apprehenſion that we have all the armed hoſts of Heaven to engage with. We are embarking in a moſt important affair, a matter that will draw after it the moſt intereſting conſequences both to Great-Britain and the Colonies, in uniting to oppoſe the Britiſh arms. It high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns us then ſeriouſly to conſider the matter, ſo as to proceed upon juſt principles. Would to God that each enliſting in the American ſervice, was firſt enliſted under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that whether life or death, eternal glory, as the reward, might be their portion? I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0"/>
fear many embarking in the preſent intereſting diſpute, do not ſufficiently weigh the matter, whether it be a righteous or an unrighteous cauſe—A good cauſe may be very improperly engaged in; there is a curſe pronounced upon thoſe who do the work of the Lord deceitfully, as well as upon ſuch who keep back their ſwords from blood. In order then to aſſiſt you in this important point, let me juſt premiſe, that we are not to expect any extraordinary revelation from Heaven or miraculous interpoſition in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to determine whether God be on our ſide; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Jehovah was wont in former times to reveal to his ſervants the Prophets, the iſſue of certain engagements, and that Iſrael would aſſuredly prevail; yet as the canon of ſacred writ is now cloſed, and the ſpirit of prophecy ceaſed, it would be unwarrantable preſumption to expect ſuch a revelation to mark out the line of our conduct. We are carefully to look into God's word, and mark the ſteps of divine conduct in order to form a judgment and determine whether we have ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that God will go forth and fight our battles. But to proceed—</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt THE cauſe muſt be good. Without this we have no reaſon to expect that God will intereſt himſelf in our favour, that he will go forth with our armies and fight our battles. True, God may ſuffer an unrighteous cauſe to proſper for a while, to ſubſerve the wiſe ends of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The rod of the wicked may lay upon the lot of the righteous for a time, but it will moſt aſſuredly be removed. There is a very material difference between God's permitting an unrighteous cauſe for a ſeaſon to proſper, and his protecting and defending a good one. A bad cauſe will fail at laſt, and God will take glory to himſelf in bringing good out of evil. Now, brethren, may we not appeal to God in the preſent ſtruggle, that our cauſe is good? We are not carried through an haughty and wanton ſpirit to ſeek for larger dominions, or invade the property of others. We only deſire in a quiet and peaceable manner to enjoy the fruits of our own induſtry
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014758_0006_0F94DD9007D6DDD0"/>
and labor, and have ſome little peculium, or ſtock, we can call our own, without being taxed by a corrupt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in which we have no repreſentation, nor from our local diſtance ever can have. We aſked for no additional privileges, but content with the Charter Rights under which we claimed, felt no diſpoſition to break off our connection with Britain, if it could with ſafety be preſerved. We only inſiſted upon, as being our indiſputable right, the privilege we had time imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial enjoyed "of eating every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and to drink every one of his own ciſtern." Is it not the ſimple voice of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that this privilege we ſhould ſtill enjoy? And is it not agreeable to all our Charters and the very genius of the Britiſh Conſtitution, that no money ſhould be filched from us without our own conſent? This is a birthright inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and we are loudly called upon by God and Nature to hand it down to poſterity. Hence then it appears that the attack is unjuſtly made upon our property, and we ſtand acquitted before God and the World to defend it at the expence of blood. As to the antiquated doctrine of paſſive-obedience and non-reſiſtance, it has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently exploded by many eminent writers, both ancient and modern—it is ſuch a wilful attack upon the natural rights of mankind, that it is ſcarcely entitled to a ſerious refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. We neither deſerve the bleſſings of civil nor reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Liberty, if we can ſee them wreſted from us without a ſtruggle.</p>
            <p>BUT perhaps ſome might object and ſay, it is only a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about civil property; the object is not or ſufficient importance to run the riſque of loſs of blood. To this I reply, that time would fail me to enumerate the long and black catalogue of ills that will unavoidably enſue if we tamely give up this one privilege, of being taxed by our own Repreſentatives. Our eſtates, our all that we have for the ſupport of our wives and children, muſt be laid at the feet of a bloody Miniſtry and packed Parliament, for the very purpoſe of enſlaving us more and more, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014758_0007_0F94DD90C69BCD90"/>
porting over ourſelves ſwarms of court ſycophants and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry leeches, who would never be contented until they had drained the laſt penny from our purſes. Add to all this what the Reverend Synod of New-York and Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia juſtly obſerved in their laſt paſtoral letter, "that civil and religious Rights are ſo intimately connected together, that where one is given up the other falls of courſe." Let us for a moment look into the reigns of the Charles's and James's, and we will find that when religious liberties were attacked, the ſource of diſpute at that time, civil property was rendered precarious and inſecure. Nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than ſequeſtrations, confiſcations, impriſonments, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and death itſelf, in all its hideous forms of terror. Thus it will hold vice verſa—I am clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that if we ſubmit in the preſent diſpute, liberty of conſcience will be next invaded by that lordly Court and corrupt Parliament. There is a ſtrong propenſity in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature for ſuch as are in authority to lord it over thoſe beneath them, and to have not only the civil but religious privileges of others ſolely at their diſpoſal.</p>
            <p>THIS renders our diſpute with Great-Britain of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance to all of every denomination; a diſpute worth expending millions upon, and hazarding the lives of thouſands, to tranſmit fair to our poſterity the bleſſings of civil and religious liberty. Is it not agreeable to the divine mind that we ſhould be free, and enjoy the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable bleſſing of worſhipping God according to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of conſcience, without the fear of man, which cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſnare? certainly it is. If ſo, then the cauſe is God's, and embarking in the preſent diſpute, we fight the Lord's battles. Will he not then go before and ſucceed our arms?</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT alſo ſuppoſes that we engage in a good cauſe from juſt motives and right principles. Without this we have not ſufficient ground to expect that God will ſucceed our attempts and crown our arms with ſucceſs, at leaſt for the preſent. This appears agreeable to the general ſeries of the divine conduct in former ages. How often did victory decide on the part of Iſrael's enemies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014758_0007_0F94DD90C69BCD90"/>
they were heathens? There is an actual curſe pronounced upon ſuch as do the work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully. Would to God that in this particular we had ſtill clearer evidence of God's being on our ſide, and that perſons in ſuing for office did not ſo much ſtudy their own things! Undoubtedly the prevalence of vice and neglect of God and religion, both in our armies and elſewhere, is matter of deep lamentation, and is a reaſon why we may expect that God will ſuffer us to meet with ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes in the preſent diſpute, in order that the glory of his power and rich grace may appear the more illuſtrious in finally crowning us with ſucceſs. Yet I cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the fears of ſome are too much awakened upon this conſideration, and are ready to conclude that from the preſent decay of religion and growth of impiety, God deſigns to give us entirely up and render us a prey to the enemy. I am not of that ſentiment, as God in his adorable providence ſuffers a ſtate, or nation, to arrive at a certain pitch both of greatneſs and impiety, before he gives them up to their foes. Now I think it muſt appear evident to every attentive obſerver, that the Colonies are arrived to neither that pitch of greatneſs nor yet impiety that length of time may bring about. Wealth is uſually a fore-runner of vice, and thoſe cities which have been the marts of trade, have generally imported foreign faſhions and ſinful cuſtoms. I truſt that the preſent ſtruggle will ſerve to humble the pride of our Colonies, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever lives will ſee glorious days in America conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this black cloud that now hangs over us. Beſides, there are ſtill ſome favorable ſymptoms that God is with us and that he will fight our battles, if we conſider that we have engaged in this war, not with an entire dependance upon the arm of fleſh, but have been called upon frequently to humble ourſelves before God, with faſting and with prayer, to repent of all our ſins and turn unto the Lord our God. I truſt there are thouſands and tens of thouſands embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the preſent war with the beſt and pureſt of motives, although I doubt not intereſt and honor are the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014758_0008_0F94DD918C899840"/>
motives with many. I ſincerely believe that the praying part both in Great-Britain and America are intereſted on the ſide of American liberty. I doubt not many prayers are this day aſcending up to the throne of grace, which I truſt will enter into the ears of the Lord God of Sabaoth, in our behalf.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. WHEN God intereſts himſelf on any one ſide, the ſchemes and machinations of thoſe in the oppoſition are turned into fooliſhneſs. Thus, Job v. 12. 13. 
  <q>He diſappointeth the devices of the crafty, ſo that their hands cannot perform their enterpriſe. He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs: And the counſel of the froward is carried headlong.</q>
I think it muſt appear plain to the moſt ſuperficial obſerver that many of the counſels of the Britiſh ſenate have been fooliſhneſs, and by no means calculated to anſwer the purpoſe they had in view. This confeſſion is extorted from the Miniſtry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their laſt debates. The very meaſures taken to divide the Colonies have been over ruled to complete their union. Thus it was in the caſe of the ſtamp-act, under the ſpecious name of raiſing a revenue for our own protection. The varniſh was ſoon rubbed off; the horrid enſlaving ſcheme was ſoon detected, and the Colonies from New-Hampſhire to Georgia took the alarm. Here was a chain to bind the whole Colonies, a plan laid to ſweep away the liberties of more than three millions of American ſubjects at once, whereas had they begun with a ſingle Colony the meaſure might have enſured them of an eaſy conqueſt.—The rigorous ſteps taken againſt the colony of Maſſachuſetts, and town of Boſton, laying it under the moſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and unrighteous proſcriptions, deſtroying its trade and blocking up its harbour, enkindled the indignation of every ſon or liberty on the Continent. Had the vindictive ſtatutes been leſs cruel, they would have better anſwered the purpoſe of enſlaving the Colonies. In ſhort, it would greatly exceed the limits of a ſermon to enter into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute detail of the ſeveral ſteps taken by the Miniſtry and Parliament of Great-Britain, which have proved entirely
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014758_0008_0F94DD918C899840"/>
ſubverſive of their favorite ſcheme. Now does not this ſhew very clearly that God is againſt them, and conſequently on our ſide? This argument receives additional weight, if we alſo conſider the many illuſtrious characters God has raiſed up in defence of American liberty both in Great-Britain and the Colonies, together with the remarkable wiſdom and prodigious extent of knowledge manifeſted in all the productions of our Honorable Continental Congreſs. Let the encomium of Earl Chatham, that maſter of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, eloquence and found reaſoning, ſerve to immortalize their names and tranſmit the memory of that illuſtrious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a grateful remembrance to lateſt poſterity. Speaking of their arduous taſk, he ſays, "When your Lordſhips look at the papers tranſmitted us from America, when you conſider their decency, firmneſs and wiſdom, you cannot but reſpect their cauſe, and wiſh to make it your own—For myſelf I muſt declare and avow, that in all my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obſervation, and it has been my favorite ſtudy;—I have read Thucidides, and have ſtudied and admired the maſter ſtates of the world, that for ſolidity of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, force of ſagacity and wiſdom of concluſion, under ſuch a complication of different circumſtances, no nation or body of men can ſtand in preference to the General Continental Congreſs in Philadelphia."—May they long continue to honour the important truſt, to gain the applauſe of the wiſe and the good, and be the conſtant care of an indulgent heaven!</p>
            <p>THUS then it appears from thoſe particulars, as well as the ſignal ſucceſs we have been bleſſed with, that God is on our ſide to fight our battles.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. IT is uſual for the great Jehovah to intereſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the enlargement of young and growing ſtates. Thus we find that he has fought their battles and made them victorious over antient and powerful nations. To this purpoſe let us obſerve the conduct of God towards Iſrael of old, in fighting their battles and ſecuring them in the quiet poſſeſſion of the promiſed land. Thus, Pſal. cvi. 43. 
  <q>Many times did he deliver them, but they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720"/>
  provoked him with their counſel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</q>
—So it was with the Proteſtant States in Germany in Charles the Fifth's time, Emperor of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many and King of Spain—The States of Holland and the Independent Cantons of Switzerland demonſtrate the ſame, that God takes care of a young and forming people.</p>
            <p>IT has been remarkably the caſe with the Iſle of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, until it aroſe to its late glory and opulence. The ſcale ſeems now to be turned, and God ſays of that nation as of Iſrael, 
  <q>Thee only have I known of all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the earth, therefore will I puniſh thee for all thine iniquities.</q>
—Now it is very evident that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are but in their infant ſtate, and are very far from having arrived at all the firmneſs and manhood God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. If we look down thro' time but for half a century, to what a prodigious pitch of wealth and greatneſs will the Continent of North-America have arrived! I am firmly of the ſentiment that its future growth will be much more rapid than the paſt; many reaſons might be offered which I muſt omit here. What countleſs millions of land yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated! What a boundleſs extent of country traverſed only by ſavages and wild beaſts! Now ſurely God did not make ſuch a large ſhare of our globe for nought, or only to be the haunts of wild beaſts, and poſſeſſed by the naked untutored Indians. The Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt has only glanced upon the ſhores of this vaſt Continent, and we may believe that God deſigns the ſettlement of its remoteſt boundaries for the enlargement of his ſon's kingdom; that notable paſſage in Pſal. lxxx. 8. 9. 10. Verſes, has been and will be ſtill more eminently fulfilled in North-America: 
  <q>Thou haſt brought a vine out of Egypt: Thou haſt caſt out the Heathen, and planted it. Thou preparedſt room before it. and didſt cauſe it to take deep root, and it filled the land. The hills were covered with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.—She ſent out her boughs unto the ſea, and her branches unto the river.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:014758_0009_0F94DD9245560720"/>
I BELIEVE our American Continent, as it has not yet been ſtained with the blood of martyrs, will be an aſylum for the perſecuted over all Europe to fly to. America correſponds to the account we have of the wilderneſs to which the Church was driven to ſeek protection from the fury of the Dragon, Rev. xii. 13. 14. 
  <q>And when the dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the earth, he perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the woman which brought forth the man child. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that ſhe might flee into the wilderneſs, into her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time and times and half a time, from the face of the ſerpent.</q>
It is more than probable that this ſcripture had an eminent fulfilment when our anceſtors fled, not from the embraces of the mother, but from the cruelty of the monſter, and took ſanctuary in the wilderneſs of America. Thus it was when a number of precious ſouls landed on the bleak ſhore of Plymouth in the rigid month of December, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions—without houſes; but God, as he deſigned them for a feed to this new world, procured them favour with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who, as I have been told, cheerfully reſigned their huts to entertain the newly arrived emigrants. It appears, therefore, that the Church is not yet arrived to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in America, but will extend wider and wider, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it has reached to the Pacific ocean—Pleaſing proſpect! to ſurvey churches riſing and the goſpel preached, where nothing is now heard but the yells of wild beaſts and nightly orgies of ſavages! Who would not then ſtand forth in defence of our liberties, ſo eſſentially neceſſary for the progreſs of religion and rapid ſettlement of the Colonies? Who would not run the riſk of ſpilling ſome blood for the enlargement of Chriſt's myſtical body the Church, which he purchaſed with his own moſt precious blood? Glorious cauſe, my dear brethren, we are embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, worthy of a ſtruggle! Yea, we ought to rejoice that God is likely to honour us in making a noble ſtand for the defence and enlargement of Chriſt's kingdom.—Thus, then, it appears that it is the cauſe of God we are engaged in, ſo need not be diſpirited, as he will go before and ſight our battles. But this leads me to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410"/>
III THING propoſed, namely, to offer ſome grounds of ſecurity ariſing from God's being on our ſide.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. HIS moſt perfect knowledge of all poſſible events, lays a foundation of encouragement. There is not an hair of our heads but is numbered; his infinite knowledge puts him beyond the poſſibility of a miſtake in the whole of his conduct. He at one clear and intuitive view ſees all things, with all that infinite variety of their connections; there is not a ſingle danger to which we are expoſed, but he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and can counteract. Human wiſdom is not able to guard againſt every occurrence that may turn up to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert their ſchemes; hence we find confuſion and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment frequently attending the wiſeſt human counſels. But Jehovah is unerring, and therefore claims counſel and ſound judgment as his own. This, therefore, muſt afford the moſt ſolid ſatisfaction, that we have one on our ſide of infinite knowledge to diſcern all future events and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect matters ſo as to turn the counſels of our enemies into fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. GOD has not only the moſt perfect knowledge of all perſons and things, but has the ſecret management of all in his own hand. His kingdom ruleth over all, and the hearts of Kings and Princes are in his hand; he rules by a ſecret and irreſiſtible ſway in the armies of heaven and amongſt the inhabitants of the earth. The reins of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal government are in his hand. The wheels of nature, however intricate, are under his direction; ſtorms and thunder obey him; the elements are all ſubſervient to his pleaſure; for thoſe who are fighting for him, he can even ſuſpend the laws of nature, arreſt the ſun in his rapid courſe, until his victories are gained. All creatures are at his nod, ſo that they that are with us, God being on our ſide, are more than thoſe that are againſt us. He can employ all the hoſts of heaven, can give commiſſion to a ſingle deſtroying angel to cut off in one night an hundred and fourſcore thouſand, as in Sennacherib's army. Who then would be afraid to embark in the cauſe of ſuch an illuſtrious leader, who has all power in heaven and on earth in his hand? Nay, who would not ruſh into thickeſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014758_0010_0F94DD930A41A410"/>
dangers, when they are aſſured that the cauſe is the cauſe of God, and that there is not a bullet, as King William uſed to ſay, but has its billet?</p>
            <p n="3">3. HE is bound by his faithfulneſs to ſtand by and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a righteous cauſe.—The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs. Although he may ſuffer a good cauſe to meet with oppoſition, and the deſigns of wicked men for a while to proſper, yet 
  <q>he that ſitteth in the heavens ſhall laugh; the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion; then ſhall he ſpeak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</q>
Thus God promiſes to Joſhua, 
  <q>One man of you ſhall chaſe a thouſand; for the Lord your God, he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promiſed. So ſhall the Lord of hoſts come down to fight for Mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LASTLY, Omnipotence is engaged on our ſide. God is not only unerring in his counſels, but omnipotent to put them into execution. He can caſt the wicked down to hell, and all the nations that forget God. He is, in ſhort, a ſtrong rock for defence; he teaches our hands to war, and our fingers to fight. In one word, he is the Lord ſtrong in battle.</p>
            <p>IMPROVEMENT.—1ſt. This ſubject ſhews us the great neceſſity of perſonal covenanting with God and enliſting under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the glorious Captain of our ſalvation. It would be an affecting thought, that however glorious the cauſe in which we are engaged, and however ready to embark therein from certain conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as being the cauſe of Liberty, yet we ourſelves ſhould be ſervants to ſin and ſlaves to luſt. This is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which every ſoul preſent is concerned; we have, my dear brethren, all of us enemies to conflict with which we cannot avoid, and which by no power or ſkill of our own we can defeat. We have to wreſtle not only with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places. There is a ſpiritual armour we muſt put on to come off conquerors; there is a glorious General we muſt enliſt under, to enſure us of victory. No leader inferior to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700"/>
has himſelf ſpoiled principalities and powers can put Satan under our feet. Here is the greateſt victory we ever can gain; a victory over the world, our own luſts and all the internal hoſts of hell. As the victory is great, ſo the prize to every overcomer is alſo great. 
  <q>To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh,</q>
ſays the Captain of our ſalvation, 
  <q>Will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſit down with my Father in his throne. <bibl>Rev. iii. 21.</bibl>
               </q>
He that overcometh ſhall inherit all things. Shall heroes and generals contend for honors of a day; for the laurel that muſt ſooner or later decay, and ſhall not we fight and ſtrive for an inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and that fadeth not away?</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THIS ſubject ſhews us of what infinite moment it is in the preſent ſtruggle to have God on our ſide to go before us and to fight our battles. The race is not always to the ſwift nor the battle to the ſtrong. If God be for us we need not be diſmayed at all the armed legions that are coming againſt us. At moſt it is but an arm of fleſh; and   
  <q>curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord. <bibl>Jer. xvii 5.</bibl>
               </q>
See how Pharaoh's chariots and his hoſts were caſt into the ſea, 
  <q>
                  <bibl>Exod. xv. 10.</bibl> Thou didſt blow with thy wind, the ſea covered them: they ſank as lead in the mighty waters. The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name.</q>
What a ſignal diſplay of his power in our behalf at the Newfoundland fiſhery, and alſo in the river Thames, when his winds blew and they ſank like lead in the great waters!</p>
            <p n="3">3d. IS it the cauſe of God, as you have heard, that we are engaged in? Hence learn how ready we ought to be to embark therein. Curſed be he that keepeth back his ſword from blood in ſuch a cauſe. There can, ſtrictly ſpeaking, be no neutrality in the preſent caſe—he that is not with us muſt be againſt us. I fear many will ſhrink back, and under ſome pretext deſert the cauſe, when their aſſiſtance will be moſt needed. Be not diſmayed, my dear brethren; if it is the cauſe of God, as you have heard, ſucceſs is certain. What though we ſhould meet with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014758_0011_0F94DD93CBA9D700"/>
many repulſes? The ſtruggle is of ſuch vaſt importance to us and unborn millions, that every lover of God, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and poſterity, ſhould vie one with another who ſhould be foremoſt in action. If we fall in the field, we die as ſecure as if on our knees to God in prayer. If we are prepared to die on our beds, ſo are we in the field. It will be an eaſy tranſlation to go from fighting to wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unfullied crown of glory. Every true chriſtian, having embarked in the preſent cauſe as the cauſe of God and religion, if he dies in the field, will die a martyr for Chriſt and will receive a martyr's crown. Route then, my dear brethren; quit yourſelves like men; ſtand ready to march into the field when God and your country call.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. BUT I muſt addreſs myſelf in a particular manner to you, Gentlemen Officers and Privates, who appear before us to day, engaged in your country's cauſe.</p>
            <p>FIRST, as to the Officers—</p>
            <p>PERMIT me to tell you, Gentlemen, that, under God, much will depend upon your prudent, wiſe and manly behaviour. You have not only to direct your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but the conduct and behaviour of thoſe under your care. You are to conſider that the cauſe you are engaged in is the cauſe of God, and that you are to conduct your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of ſuch a glorious undertaking. Remember that you are not called out to fight the Devil's battles, but the battles of the Lord of hoſts. See to it, then, that you do honour to the cauſe, and not let it ſuffer through your default. As to your private conduct, ſee that it be ſober, decent and reſpectable. Never look upon it as a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for officers fighting the Lord's battles, to curſe and ſwear, and take God's name in vain. Authority will be better ſecured by your manly and religious behaviour, than by all the imprecations you can uſe to your fellow men. Suffer not yourſelves to be governed by appetite, fancy or humour, but by reaſon and conſcience; attend to the diſpoſitions and characters of thoſe under your care, that you may be the better fitted to regulate their conduct; carefully attend to the mode of conduct beſt adapted to the variety of circumſtances you may be in; conſider what
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628"/>
is decorous and what indecorous, and what is uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the moſt wiſe and judicious in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>BE grave and ſedate in oppoſition to a light and frothy temper; let a graceful compoſedneſs appear even in your gayeſt ſeaſons, and make it evident that your minds are under a firm impreſſion of the divine preſence. Be not ſlothful, but diligent in your calling; be reſolute, quit yourſelves like men, and above all be reſolute in religion and determined that for your part, let others do as they will, you will ſerve the Lord. Let it appear that you dare be religious even in a camp. Not that I would have you always gloomy or melancholy; no, the gravity I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend is conſiſtent with chearfulneſs, and even ſuppoſes it. Serve the Lord with gladneſs; thou meeteſt him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth and worketh righteouſneſs. I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as though I meant to cut off innocent and natural mirth, but only to direct it into a proper channel; this, as an inſpired writer obſerves, may do good, but is to be uſed as a medicine. Avoid exceſs either in eating or drinking; deny yourſelves of all irregular and ſenſual gratifications. Seek not the vain applauſe of mortals, but ſtudy to have the teſtimony of a good conſcience. Be valiant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in the hour of battle, if called to it; never flinch from a dangerous poſt, when duty urges you on; play the man for your God and Country; be prepared to meet every event, and try to have God your God and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portion.—It may be the laſt addreſs I ever ſhall make you; I would that it might be remembered. Let me ſum up all in a few words—Endure hardneſs as good ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Jeſus Chriſt; put ye on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to ſtand againſt all the wiles of the Devil; be faithful unto the death, and ye have the promiſe of Chriſt that ye ſhall receive a crown of life.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt ſpeak a word to the Soldiers—Happy conſideration if ye were all enliſted under the Lord Jeſus Chriſt! Let me intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the cauſe you have engaged in; remember as you have heard, that it is the cauſe of God. Be regular
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014758_0012_0F94DD948B521628"/>
in your conduct and ſubmiſſive to thoſe under whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care you are put; aſſume no undue airs of import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor affect to be noticed by thoſe about you; be not arrogant, but let your behaviour manifeſt a proper defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your ſuperiors; never affect to appear above your rank, nor be aſhamed of it; take heed, as you are to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with perſons of every character, not to be tempted by profane fops, to treat the great concerns of religion with contempt. Carry a favour of religion with you wherever you are; take heed of fleſhly luſts that war againſt the ſoul; love not eaſe and ſloth, but endure hardneſs; be not nice or delicate in eating or drinking; guard againſt immodeſt and unchaſte converſation; let no corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceed out of your mouth; fornication and all uncleaneſs, let it not be named amongſt you as becomes Chriſtians; avoid fooliſh talking and filthy jeſting; be valiant for the cauſe you are engaged in; never ſhrink in an hour of battle. And now, my dear Gentlemen Officers and Soldiers, may the divine protection be your ſhield in an hour of danger; may you have ſucceſs equal to the goodneſs of your cauſe; may you have the pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of being improved by the God of heaven for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing liberty both civil and religious to this new world; may the Lord go before you, direct you in all your ways, animate you in every important enterpriſe, guard your heads from the winged meſſengers of death, and bring you at laſt to his heavenly kingdom. I muſt take my leave, and collect my whole ſoul in bidding you an hearty farewel.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt have done with a word to the aſſembly at large. Numbers of you, my dear brethren, are not like to be called into the field of action; But is there nothing incumbent upon you to do? Are not ſuch as are hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives in our common defence entitled to your eſteem, prayers and aſſiſtance? Prayer has done much in ſuch caſes; the fervent prayer of the righteous man avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much: Thus it was in the caſe or Moſes, when Aaron and H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r held up his hands, doubtleſs in a praying poſture Iſrael prevailed. Every one preſent who has liberty
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014758_0013_0F94DD9547422F50"/>
or property to defend, is deeply concerned in the preſent ſtruggle. Liberty or Slavery is to be tranſmitted to our numerous offspring. This Continent will either be the glory of the earth, or a place of more than Egyptian bondage. It is worth while to exert ourſelves, and not ſuffer our land to be over-run with Slavery and Tyranny. Let not poſterity have reaſon to curſe us, when we ſhall be lying in the ſilent grave. Let us imitate the conduct of good Jehoſhaphat,

May the Lord direct our eyes to himſelf; may he go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and fight our battles; may he once more reſtore peace in our land, through Jeſus. AMEN.</p>
