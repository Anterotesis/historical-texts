            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THIS diſcourſe, and thoſe on the <hi>Evidences of Divine Revelation,</hi> which will be publiſhed about the ſame time, being the laſt of my labours in this country, I hope my friends, and the public, will indulge me while I give the reaſon of their <hi>being</hi> the <hi>laſt,</hi> in conſequence of my having at length, after much heſitation, and and now with reluctance, come to a reſolution to leave this kingdom.</p>
                  <p>After the riots in Birmingham, it was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and evidently the wiſh, of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that I ſhould immediately fly to France, or America. But I had no conſciousſneſs of guilt to induce me to fly my country<note n="*" place="bottom">If, inſtead of flying from lawleſs violence, I had been flying from public juſtice, I could not have been purſued with more rancour, nor could my friends have been more anxious for my ſafty. One man, who happened to ſee me on horſeback on one of the nights in which I eſcaped from Birmingham, expreſſed his regret that he had not taken me. expecting probably ſome conſiderable reward, when, as he ſaid, it was ſo eaſy for him to have done it. My friends earneſtly adviſed me to diſguiſe myſelf as I was going to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But all that was done in that way was taking a place for me in the mail coach, which I entered at Worceſter, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name than my own. However, the friend who had the courage to receive me in London had thought it neceſſary to provide a dreſs that ſhould diſguiſe me, and alſo a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of making my eſcape, in caſe the houſe ſhould have been attacked on my account; and for ſome time my friends would not ſuffer me to appear in the ſtreets.</note> On the contrary,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:027559_0004_0FD5350CD2A1E1D8"/>
I came directly to London, and inſtantly, by means of my friend Mr. Ruſſel, ſignified to the king's miniſters, that I <hi>was</hi> there, and ready, if they thought proper, to be interrogated on the ſubject of the riot. But no notice was taken of the meſſage.</p>
                  <p>Ill treated as I thought I had been, not merely by the populace of Birmingham, for they were the mere tools of their ſuperiors, but by the country in general, which evidently exulted in our ſufferings, and afterwards by the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the nation, who refuſed to inquire into the cauſe of them, I own I was not without deliberating upon the ſubject of emigration; and ſeveral flattering propoſals were made me, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from France, which was then at peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in itſelf, and with all the world; and I was at
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:027559_0005_0FD5350CD765A790"/>
one time much inclined to go thither, on account of its nearneſs to England, the agreeableneſs of its climate, and my having many friends there.</p>
                  <p>But I likewiſe conſidered that, If I went thither, I ſhould have no employment of the kind to which I had been accuſtomed; and the ſeaſon of active life not being, according to the courſe of nature, quite over, I wiſhed to make as much uſe of it as I could. I therefore determined to continue in England, expoſed as I was not only to unbounded obloquy and inſult, but to every kind of outrage; and after my invitation to ſucceed my friend Dr Price, I had no heſitation about it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I took up my reſidence where I now am, though ſo prevalent was the idea of my inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, that I was not able to take the houſe in my own name; and when a friend of mine took it in <hi>his,</hi> it was with much difficulty that, after ſome time, the landlord was prevailed upon to transfer the leaſe to me. He expreſſed his apprehenſions, not only of the houſe that I occupied being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed, but alſo a capital houſe in which he himſelf reſides, at the diſtance of no leſs than twenty miles from London, whether he ſuppoſed the rioters would go next, merely for ſuffering me to live in a houſe of <hi>his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:027559_0006_0FD5350FB8DF5B50"/>
But even this does not give ſuch an idea of the danger that not only myſelf, but every perſon, and every thing, that had the ſlighteſt connection with me, were ſuppoſed to be in, as the following. The managers of one of the principal charities among the Diſſenters applied to me to preach their annual ſermon, and I had conſented. But the treaſurer, a man of fortune, who knew nothing more of me than my name, was ſo much alarmed as it, that he declared he could not ſleep. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to his great relief, declined preaching at all.</p>
                  <p>When it was known that I was ſettled where I now am, ſeveral of my friends, who lived near me, were ſeriouſly adviſed to remove their papers, and other moſt valuable effects, to ſome place of greater ſafety in London. On the 14th of July, 1792, it was taken for granted by many of the neighbours, that my houſe was to come down, juſt as at Birmingham the year before. When the Hackney aſſociation was formed, ſeveral ſervants in the neighbourhood actually removed their goods; and when there was ſome political meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the houſe of Mr. Breillat, though about two miles from my houſe, a woman whoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſervant in the houſe contiguous to mine, came to her miſtreſs, to entreat that ſhe might be out of the way; and it was not without much
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:027559_0007_0FD5350E379ECCD0"/>
difficulty that ſhe was, pacified, and prevailed upon to let her continue in the houſe, her miſtreſs ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was as ſafe as herſelf.</p>
                  <p>On ſeveral other occaſions the neighbourhood has been greatly alarmed on account of my being ſo near them. Nor was this without apparent reaſon. I could name a perſon, and to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance a reputable tradeſman, who, in the company of his friends, and in the hearing of one of my late congregation at Birmingham, but without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be ſuch, declared that, in caſe of any diſturbance, they would immediately come to Hackney, evidently for the purpoſe of miſchief. In this ſtate of things, it is not to be wondered at, that of many ſervants who were recommended to me, and ſome that were actually hired, very few could, for a long time, be prevailed upon to live with me.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts not only ſhew how general was the idea of my particular inſecurity in this country; but what is of much more conſequence, and highly intereſting to the country at large, an idea of the general diſpoſition to rioting and violence that prevails in it, and that the Diſſenters are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of it. Mr. Pitt very juſtly obſerved, in his ſpeech on the ſubject of the riots at Birmingham,
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:027559_0008_0FD53511D6CECE60"/>
that it was "the efferveſcence of the public mind." Indeed the efferveſcible matter has exiſted in this country every ſince the civil wars in the time of Charles I. and it was particularly apparent in the reign of Queen Ann. But the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the former princes of the Houſe of Hanover prevented its doing any miſchief. The late events ſhew that this power is no longer exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it uſed to be, but that, on the contrary, there prevails an idea, well or ill founded, that tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary proceedings againſt Diffenters will not receive any effectual diſcouragement. After what has taken place with reſpect to Birmingham, all idea of much hazard for inſulting and abuſing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters is entirely vaniſhed; whereas the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to injure the Catholics was effectually checked by the proceedings of the year 1780. From that time <hi>they</hi> they have been ſafe, and I rejoice in it. But from the year 1791, the Diffenters have been more expoſed to inſult and outrage than over.</p>
                  <p>Having fixed myſelf at Clapton; unhinged as I had been, and having loſt the labour of ſeveral years; yet flattering myſelf that I ſhould end my days here, I took a long leaſe of my houſe, and expended a conſiderable ſum in improving it. I alſo determined, with the aſſiſtance of my friends, to reſume my philoſophical and other purſuits;
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:027559_0009_0FD53514533D2008"/>
and after an interruption amounting to about two years, it was with a pleaſure that I cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, that I entered my new laboratory, and began the moſt common preparatory proceſſes, with a view to ſome original inquiries. With what ſucceſs I have laboured, the public has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in ſome meaſure ſeen, and may ſee more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But though I did not chooſe (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I found myſelf expoſed to continual inſult) to leave my native country, I found it neceſſary to provide for my ſons elſewhere. My eldeſt ſon was ſettled in a buſineſs, which promiſed to be very advantageous, at Mancheſter; but his partner, though a man of liberality himſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, on perceiving the general preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſpirit which produced the riots in Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham, that, owing to his relationſhip to <hi>me,</hi> he was under the neceſſity of propoſing a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which accordingly took place.</p>
                  <p>On this he had an invitation to join another connexion, in a buſineſs in which the ſpirit of party could not have much affected him; but he declined it. And after he had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the aſſizes at Warwick, he conceived ſuch an idea of this country, that I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:027559_0010_0FD53515D0295FF8"/>
that any propoſal, however advantageous, would have induced him to continue in it; ſo much was he affected on perceiving his father treated as I had been.</p>
                  <p>Determining to go to America, where he had no proſpect but that of being a farmer, he wiſhed to ſpend a ſhort time with a perſon who has great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in that way, and one who from his own general principles, and his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for myſelf, would have given him the beſt advice and aſſiſtance in his power. He, however, declined it, and acknowledged ſome time after, that had it been known, as it muſt have been, to his landlord, that he had a ſon of <hi>mine</hi> with him, he feared he ſhould have been turned out of his farm.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond ſon who was preſent both at the riot, and the aſſizes, felt more indignation ſtill, and willingly liſtened to a propoſal to ſettle in France; and there his reception was but too ſlatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. However, on the breaking out of the war with this country, all mercantile proſpects being ſuſpended, he wiſhed to go to America. There his eldeſt and youngeſt brother have joined him, and they are now looking out for a ſettlement, having as yet no fixed views.</p>

The neceſſity I was under of ſending my ſons out of this country, was my principal inducement to ſend the little property that I had out of it too; ſo that I had nothing in England beſides my libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, apparatus, and houſehold goods. By this, I felt myſelf greatly relieved, it being of little conſequence where a man already turned ſixty ends his days. Whatever good or evil I have been capable of, is now chiefly done; and I truſt that the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of integrity, which has ſupported me hitherto, will carry me through any thing that may yet be reſerved for me. Seeing, however, no great proſpect of doing much good, or having much enjoyment, here, I am now preparing to follow my ſons; hoping to be of ſome uſe to them in their preſent unſettled ſtate, and that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may yet, advancing in years as I am, find me ſome ſphere of uſefulneſs along with them.</p>
                  <p>As to the great odium that I have incurred, the charge of <hi>ſedition,</hi> or my being an enemy to the conſtitution or peace of my country, is a mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for it; though it has been ſo much urged, that it is now generally believed, and all attempts to undeceive the public with reſpect to it avail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. The whole courſe of my ſtudies, from early life, ſhews how little <hi>politics</hi> of any kind have been my object. Indeed to have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo much as I have in <hi>theology,</hi> and to have
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:027559_0012_0FD5351FA16A5A10"/>
done ſo much in <hi>experimental philoſophy,</hi> and at the ſame time to have had my mind occupied, as it is ſuppoſed to have been, with factious politics, I muſt have had faculties more than human. Let any perſon only caſt his eye over the long liſt of my publications, and he will ſee that they relate almoſt wholly to theology, philoſophy, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral literature.</p>
                  <p>I did, however, when I was a younger man, and before it was in my power to give much attention to philoſophical purſuits, write a ſmall anonymous political pamphlet, on the <hi>State of Liberty in this Country,</hi> about the time of Mr Wilkes's election for Middleſex, which gained me the acquaintance, and I may ſay the friendſhip, of Sir George Savile, and which I had the happineſs to enjoy as long as he lived.</p>
                  <p>At the requeſt alſo of Dr. Franklin and Dr. Fothergill, I wrote an addreſs to the Diſſenters on the ſubject of the approaching rupture with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, a pamphlet which Sir George Savile, and my other friends, circulated in great numbers, and it was thought with ſome effect.</p>
                  <p>After this I entirely ceaſed to write any thing on the ſubject of politics, except as far as the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:027559_0013_0FD53520F11DC2D0"/>
of the <hi>Teſt Act,</hi> and of <hi>Civil Eſtabliſhments of Religion,</hi> had a connexion with politics. And though, at the recommendation of Doctor Price, I was preſently after this taken into the family of the Marquis of Lanſdowne, and I entered into al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all his views, as thinking them juſt and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. I never wrote a ſingle political pamphler, or even a paragraph in a newſpaper, all the time that I was with him, which was ſeven years.</p>
                  <p>I never preached a political ſermon in my life; unleſs ſuch as, I believe all Diſſenters uſually preach on the fifth of November, in favour of <hi>civil and religious liberty,</hi> may be ſaid to be political. And on theſe occaſions, I am confident, that I never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced any ſentiment but ſuch as, till of late years, would have tended to recommend, rather than render me obnoxious, to theſe who direct the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this country. And the doctrines which I adopted when young, and which were even popular then (except with the clergy, who were at that time generally diſaffected to the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the throne) I cannot abandon, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the times are ſo changed, that they are now become unpopular, and the expreſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of them hazardous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:027559_0014_0FD5352548E04B08"/>
Father, though I by no means diſapprove of ſocieties for political information, ſuch as are now every where diſcountenanced, and generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, I never was a member of any of them; nor, indeed, did I ever attend any public meeting, if I could decently avoid it, owing to habits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ſtudious and retired life.</p>
                  <p>From a miſtake of my talents and diſpoſition, I was invited by many of the departments in France, to repreſent them in the preſent National Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after I had been made a citizen of France, on account of my being conſidered as one who had been perſecuted for my attachment to the cauſe of liberty here. But though the invitation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated with the moſt flattering importunity, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heſitated about declining it.</p>
                  <p>I can farther ſay with reſpect to politics, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which I believe every Engliſhman has ſome opinion or other (and at preſent, owing to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature of the preſent war, it is almoſt the only topic of general converſation) that, except in company, I hardly ever think of the ſubject, my reading, meditation, and writing, being almoſt wholly engroſſed by theology, and philoſophy; and of late, as for many years before the riots in Birmingham, I have ſpent a very great proportion
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:027559_0015_0FD535293338F9E0"/>
of my time, as my friends well know, in my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory.</p>
                  <p>If, then, my real crime has not been <hi>ſedition,</hi> or <hi>treaſon,</hi> what has it been? For every <hi>effect</hi> muſt have ſome adequate <hi>cauſe,</hi> and therefore the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um that I have incurred muſt have been owing to ſomething in my declared ſentiments, or conduct, that has expoſed me to it. In my opinion, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have been any thing but my open hoſtility to the doctrines of the eſtabliſhed church, and more eſpecially to all civil eſtabliſhments of religion whatever. This has brought upon me the impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable reſentment of the great body of the clergy; and they have found other methods of oppoſing me beſides <hi>argument,</hi> and that uſe of the <hi>preſs</hi> which is equally open to us all. They have alſo found an able ally and champion in Mr Burke, who (without any provocation except that of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his book on the French Revolution) has taken ſeveral opportunities of inveighing againſt me, in a place where he knows I cannot reply to him, and from which he alſo knows that his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation will reach every corner of the country, and conſequently thouſands of perſons who will never read any writings of mine<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Burke having ſaid in the Houſe of Commons, that <q>I was made a citizen of France on account of my declared hoſtility to the conſtitution of this country,</q> I, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic papers, denied the charge, and called upon him for the proofs of it. As he made no reply, I ſaid, in the preface to my Faſt Sermon of the laſt year, p.9, that <q>it ſufficiently appeared that he had neither ability to maintain his charge, nor virtue to retract it.</q> A year more of ſilence on his part having now elapſed, this is become more evident than before.</note> They have
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:027559_0016_0FD535307B256B20"/>
had another, and ſtill more effectual vehicle of their abuſe in what are called the <hi>treaſury newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers,</hi> and other popular publications.</p>
                  <p>By theſe and other means, the ſame party ſpirit which was the cauſe of the riots in Birmingham, has been increaſing ever ſince, eſpecially in that neighbourhood. A remarkable inſtance of this may be ſeen in a <hi>Letter</hi> addreſſed, but not ſent, to me from <hi>Mr. Foley, rector of Stourbridge,</hi> who acknowledges the ſatisfaction that he and his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have received from one of the groſſeſt and coarſeſt pieces of abuſe of me that has yet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which, as a curious ſpecimen of the kind, I inſerted in the <hi>Appendix of my Appeal,</hi> and in which I am repreſented as no better than Guy Fawkes, or the devil himſelf. This very Chriſtian divine recommends to the members of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church to decline all commercial dealings with the Diſſenters, as an effectual method of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating them. This method has been actually adopted in many parts of England. Alſo great numbers of the beſt farmers and artizans in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have been diſmiſſed becauſe they would not
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:027559_0017_0FD53553384CC3DB0"/>
go to the eſtabliſhed church. <hi>Defoe's Shorteſt Way with the Diſſenters</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">A tract written in a grave ironical ſtile, adviſing to hang them all.</note> would have taught the friends of the church a more effectual method ſtill. And yet this Mr. Foley, whom I never ſaw, and who could not have had any particular cauſe of enmity to me, had, like Mr. Madan of Birmingham, a character for liberality. What, then, have we to expect from others, when we find ſo much bigotry and rancour in ſuch men as theſe?</p>
                  <p>Many times, by the encouragement of perſons from whom better things might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have been burned in effigy along with Mr. Paine; and numberleſs inſulting and threatening letters have been ſent to me from all parts of the kingdom.<note n="†" place="bottom">In one of theſe I was threatened with being burned alive before a ſlow fire.</note> It is not poſſible for any man to have conducted himſelf more peaceably than I have done all the time that I have lived at Clapton, yet it has not exempted me not only from the worſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, but very groſs inſults. A very friendly and innocent club, which I found in the place, has been conſidered as <hi>Jacobine</hi> chiefly on my account; and at one time there was cauſe of apprehenſion that I ſhould have been brought into danger for lending one of Mr. Paine's books. But with ſome difficulty the neighbourhood was ſatisfied that I was innocent.</p>

As nothing had been paid to me on account of damages in the riot, when I publiſhed the ſecond part of my <hi>Appeal</hi> to the public on the ſubject, it may be proper to ſay, that it was paid ſome time in the beginning of the year 1793, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt only from the firſt of January of the ſame year, though the injury was received in July, 1791; when equity evidently required, that it ought to have been allowed from the time of the riot, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as, in all the caſes, the allowance was far ſhort of the loſs. In my caſe of it fell ſhort, as I have ſhewn, not leſs than two thouſand pounds. And the loſſes ſuſtained by the other ſufferers far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded mine. Public juſtice alſo required that, if the forms of law, local enmity, or any other cauſe, had prevented our receiving full indemnification, it ſhould have been made up to us from the public treaſury; the great end of all civil government being protection from violence, or an indemnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for it. Whatever we might in equity claim, the country owes us, and, if it be juſt, will ſome time or other pay, and with intereſt.</p>
                  <p>I would farther obſerve, that ſince, in a variety of caſes, money is allowed where the injury is not of a pecuniary nature, merely becauſe no other compenſation can be given, the ſame ſhould have been done with reſpect to me, on account of the deſtruction of my manuſcripts, the interruption of
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:027559_0019_0FD53536084D3A98"/>
my purſuits, the loſs of a pleaſing and advantageous ſituation, &amp;c. &amp;c. and had the injury been ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>clergyman,</hi> he would, I doubt not, have claimed, and been allowed, very large damages on this account. So far, however, was there from being any idea of the kind in <hi>my</hi> favour, that my counſel adviſed me to make no mention of my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript <hi>Lectures on the Conſtitution and Laws of England,</hi> a work about as large as that of Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone (as may be ſeen by the ſyllabus of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular lectures, ſixty-three in all, publiſhed in the firſt edition of my <hi>Eſſay on a Courſe of liberal Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for civil and active Life)</hi> becauſe it would be taken for granted that they were of a ſeditious nature, and would therefore have been of diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to me with the jury. Accordingly they were, in the account of my loſſes, included in the article of ſo much <hi>paper.</hi> After theſe loſſes, had I had nothing but the juſtice of my country to look to, I muſt have ſunk under the burden, incapable of any farther exertions. It was the ſeaſonable ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of my friends that prevented this, and put it in my power, though with the unavoidable loſs of near two years, to reſume my former purſuits.</p>

                  <p>I, however, foreſeen what I am now witneſs to, I certainly ſhould not have made any attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place my library or apparatus, and I ſoon repented of having done it. But this being done, I was willing to make ſome uſe of both before another interruption of my purſuits. I began to philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize, and make experiments, rather late in life, being near forty, for want of the neceſſary means of doing any thing in this way; and my purſuits have been much interrupted by removals( never indeed choſen by himſelf, but rendered neceſſary by circumſtances) and my time being now ſhort, I hoped to have had no occaſion for more than one, and that a final, remove. But the circumſtances above mentioned have induced me, though with great and ſincere regret, to undertake another, and to a greater diſtance than any that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto made.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs not to be unmoved by the aſpect of things exhibited in this diſcourſe.

I alſo own that I am not unaffected by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled puniſhments as thoſe of Mr. Muir and my friend M. Palmer, for offences, which, if, in the eye of reaſon, they be any at all, are ſlight, and very inſufficiently proved; a meaſure ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of that freedom of ſpeaking and acting, which has hitherto been the great pride of Britons. But the ſentence of Mr. Winterbotham, for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the pulpit what I am perſuaded he never did deliver, and which, ſimilar evidence might have drawn upon myſelf, or any other diſſenting miniſter, who was an object of general diſlike, has ſomething in it ſtill more alarming.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>I truſt that the friends of liberty, eſpecially among the Diſſenters, will not fail to do every thing in their power to make Mr. Winterbotham's conſinement, and alſo the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Mr Palmer and his companions, as eaſy to them as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Having been aſſiſted in a ſeaſon of perſecution, myſelf, I ſhould be very ill deſerving of the favours I have received, if I was not particularly deſirous of recommending ſuch caſes as their to general conſideration. Here difference in religious ſentiment is leaſt of all to be attended to. On the contrary, let thoſe who in this reſpect differ the moſt from Mr. Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botham, which is my own caſe, exert themſelves the moſt in his favour. When men of unqueſtionable integrity and piety ſuffer in conſequence of acting (as ſuch perſons always will do) from a principle of <hi>conſcience,</hi> they muſt command the reſpect even of their enemies, if they alſo act from principle, though they be thereby led to proceed in an oppoſite direction.</p>
                        <p>The caſe of men of education and reſlection ( and who act from the beſt intentions with reſpect to the community ) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting what only <hi>ſtate policy</hi> requires to be conſidered as <hi>crimes,</hi> but which are allowed on all hands to imply no moral turpitude, ſo as to render them unſit for heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hereafter, is not to be confounded with that of common felons. There was nothing in the conduct of Louis XIV. and his miniſters, that appeared ſo ſhocking, ſo contrary to all ideas of juſtice, humanity and decency, and that has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more to render their memory execrated, than ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch men as Mr. Marolles, and other eminent proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who are now revered as ſaints and martyrs, to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, along with the vileſt miſcreants. Compared with this, the puniſhment of death would be mercy. I truſt that, in time, the Scots in general will think theſe meaſures a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to their country.</p>

 But I truſt that conſcious

But I ſee no occaſion to expoſe myſelf to danger without any proſpect of doing good, or to continue any longer in a country in which I am ſo unjuſtly become the object of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſlike, and not retire to another, where I have reaſon to think I ſhall be better received. And I truſt that the ſame good Providence which has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended me hitherto, and made me happy in my attended and bleſs me in what may ſtill be before me.

I cannot refrain from repeating again, that I leave my native country with real regret, never expecting to find any where elſe ſociety ſo ſuited to my diſpoſition and habits, ſuch friends as I have here (whoſe attachment has been more than a balance to all the abuſe I have met with from others) and eſpecially to replace one particular Chriſtian friend, in whoſe abſence I ſhall, for ſome time at leaſt, find all the world a blank. Still leſs can I expect to reſume my favourite purſuits, with any thing like the advantages I enjoy here. In leaving this country I alſo abandon a ſource of maintenance, which I can but ill bear to loſe. I can, however truly ſay, that I leave it without any reſentment, or ill will. On the contrary, I ſincerely wiſh my countrymen all happineſs; and when the time for reflection (which my abſence may accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate) ſhall come, my countrymen, I am confident, will do me more juſtice. They will be convinced that every ſuſpicion they have been led to entertain to my diſadvantage has been ill founded, and that I have even ſome claim to their gratitude and eſteem. In this caſe, I ſhall look with ſatisfaction to the time when, if my life be prolonged, I may viſit my friends in this country; and perhaps I may, notwithſtanding my removal for the preſent, find a grave (as I believe is naturally the wiſh of every man) in the land that gave me birth.</p>

                  <p>THIS was the great burden of the preaching of both John the Baptiſt and of our Saviour.

                  <p>If we can learn any thing concerning what is before us, from the language of prophecy, great calamities,ſuch as the world has never yet experienced, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede that happy ſtate of things, in which <q>the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</q> and theſe calamities will chiefly affect thoſe nations which have been the ſeat of the great antichriſtian power; or, as all Proteſtants, and I believe juſtly, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, have been ſubject to the ſee of Rome. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me highly probable, as I hinted in my laſt diſcourſe on this occaſtion, that the preſent diſturbances in Europe are the beginning of thoſe very calamitous times. I therefore think there is a call for unuſual ſeriouſneſs, and attention to the courſe of Divine Providence, that when <q>the judgements of God are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants thereof may learn righteouſneſs,</q> ſo as to be prepared for whatever events the now rapid wheels of time may diſcloſe. Let us then, my brethern, make a ſerious pauſe. Let us look back to the antient prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and compare them with the preſent ſlate of things around us, and let us then look to ourſelves, to our own ſentiments and conduct, that we may feel and act as our peculiar circumſtances require.</p>
                  <p>The future happy ſlate of the world, when the Jews ſhall be reſtored to their own country, and be at the head of all the nations of the earth, was ſuit diſtinctly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Iſaiah, and other prophets who were nearly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:027559_0027_0FD5355B79ABB7B8"/>
cotemporary with him; but it was firſt denominated <hi>the kingdom of heaven,</hi> and announced as to be adminiſtered by <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> or <hi>the Meſſiah,</hi> by Daniel. It was, however, by other prophets, given to a deſcendant of David. All Chriſtians conſider Jeſus as this deſcendant of David, or the promiſed Meſſiah. The miſtake which the Jews were under, aroſe from their wholly overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuffering ſtate of the Meſſiah, and imagining that his <hi>firſt</hi> coming would be that mentioned by Daniel, <hi>in the clouds of heaven;</hi> and conſequently that this kingdom would commence on his firſt appearance.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus, knowing himſelf to be the Meſſiah, never denied that, at a proper time, he would appear as a king; nor could there have been a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that time any uncertainty about the meaning of the term <hi>king.</hi> When Pilate aſked Jeſus if he was a king, he acknowledged it, and added that he was ſent to bear witneſs to <hi>that,</hi> as well as to other truths; though, to obivate the jealouſy of Pilate, and the Roman government, he ſaid that his kingdom was <hi>not of this world;</hi> ſo that it did not interfere with the governments which then exiſted in the world, being that <hi>kingdom of heaven</hi> which was to take place hereafter, and to be exerciſed upon maxims very different from thoſe of the then exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus alſo ſaid that, when he ſhould reign, his apoſtles would reign with him, and that they ſhould 'ſit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael.' Paul alſo ſaid, that 'the ſaints ſhall judge the world.' And it is remarkable that, in the original prophecy of Daniel, the adminiſtration of this kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not ſaid to be confined to one perſon, but to be
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027559_0028_0FD5355D0A57FAD0"/>
extended to many, Dan. vii. 18. <q>The ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever;</q> ver.27. <q>And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatneſs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſaints of the Moſt High, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominion ſhall ſerve, and obey him,</q> or rather, 'obey <hi>it.'</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this will be a proper <hi>kingdom,</hi> though a kingdom of righteouſneſs, the object of which will be the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſubjects of it, is farther evident from the other kingdoms which are to be overthrown in order to make way for it. For had it been that purely <hi>ſpiritual kingdom</hi> which ſome ſuppoſe, what occaſion was there for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the other kingdoms; ſince they would not have interfered with it, but might have ſubſiſted at the ſame time?</p>
                  <p>In the firſt viſion of Nebuchadnezzar, interpreted by Daniel, this future, kingdom of heaven is repreſented by 'a little ſtone, cut out of a mountain without hands,' which <hi>ſmote</hi> the image repreſenting the preceding king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Dan. ii. 34. and 'brake it to pieces,' when itſelf 'became a great mountain, filling the whole earth.' In the interpretation of this viſion, ver. 44, it is ſaid, <q>In the days of theſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom which ſhall never be deſtroyed, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand for ever;</q> evidently in the place of the other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. It is, therefore, an inſtitution adapted to anſwer the purpoſe of them, but in a much better manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="unknown:027559_0029_0FD5355F0B1612E0"/>
This kingdom, however, a kingdom of truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, will not be eſtabliſhed without the greateſt convulſions, and the violent overthrow of other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Every deſcription, figurative or otherwiſe, of this great revolution, clearly implies violence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently great calamity. The little ſtone <hi>ſmiling</hi> the image, and <hi>breaking it in pieces,</hi> is far from giving an idea of a peaceable revolution, but one that will be effected with great violence, and in a ſhort time. The following lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is peculiarly emphatical. <q>Then was the iron, the clay, the braſs, the ſilver, and the gold,</q>(all the materials of which the image conſiſted) <q>broken to pieces together, and became as the chaff of the ſummer floor, and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them; and the ſtone that ſmote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</q> In the interpretation it is ſaid, ver. 44. <q>that this new kingdom ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all the other kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame awful concluſion may be drawn from the language uſed in the correſponding viſion of Daniel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the firſt year of Belſhazzar, in which the four great empires, which in Nebuchadnezzar's dream had been repreſented by the <hi>four metals,</hi> of which the image that he ſaw conſiſted, are repreſented by <hi>four beaſts.</hi> and the laſt of them is ſaid (Dan. vii. 11.)not to die a natural death, but <hi>to be ſtain,</hi> and moreover, his <hi>body deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame.</hi> As, in the former viſion, the ten kingdoms, into which the laſt, or the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was to be divided, were repreſented by the ten toes of the image; in this viſion of Daniel they are repreſented
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027559_0030_0FD5356296D6C570"/>
by the ten horns of the laſt beaſt. Theſe are ſaid to be ten kingdoms, or thrones, and theſe thrones are ſaid to be <hi>caſt down,</hi> Dan. vii. 9. clearly implying violence in their diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>In the language of prophecy, great, and eſpecially ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den revolutions, in kingdoms and ſtates, are frequently repreſented by <hi>earthquakes;</hi> and alſo the ſupreme powers on earth by the ſun, moon, and ſtars in heaven. And, in agreement with the preceding view, ſuggeſted by Daniel, the prophet Haggai, who wrote after him, to comfort his countrymen in their low and diſtreſſed circumſtances, and gloomy proſpects, when they were erecting a poor and contemptible temple, compared with that of Solomon, aſſures them, that the glory of the <hi>latter houſe,</hi> (meaning, I am perſuaded, not the houſe they were then building, for that was taken down by Herod; nor yet that of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, but the <hi>laſt</hi> houſe, the glorious temple deſcribed by Ezekiel, as to be built after the return of the Jews to their own country) ſhould be greater than that of the former houſe built by Solomon. Haggai deſcribes the great revolution that is to precede it in the following manner. Hagg. ii. 6. <q>For thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, Yet once it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land, and I will ſhake all nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts. The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than that of the former, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts; and in this place will I give peace, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</q> What can be this <hi>peace,</hi> but the future peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and happy ſtate of the world under the Meſſiah? and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:027559_0031_0FD535675B4A38A8"/>
what can be this <hi>ſhaking of the nations,</hi> that is to precede it, but great convulſions, and ſudden revolutions, ſuch as we ſee now beginning to take place?</p>
                  <p>The laſt great power that is foretold, as to ariſe among the ten kingdoms into which the Roman empire is to be divided, is repreſented by the <hi>little horn,</hi> which is ſaid to ariſe after the ten, ſignifying, I doubt not, the Papal power. It is ſaid, Dan. vii. 20, <q>to have eyes, and a mouth that ſpake very great things, whoſe look was more ſtout than his fellows, which made war with the ſaints, and prevailed againſt them, until the antient of days came, and judgment was given to the ſaints of the Moſt High, and the time came that the ſaints poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the kingdom.</q> This power, in the interpretation of the viſion, is ſaid to be one that ſhould <q>ſpeak great words againſt the Moſt High, and to wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High, and to think to change times and laws.</q> It is added, <q>They ſhall be given into his hand until a time, and times, and the dividing of time,</q> the very period for the duration of the great antichriſtian power in the Revelation.</p>
                  <p>When the termination of this laſt power is deſcribed, it is ſaid, ver. 26, <q>The judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume and to deſtroy it unto the end,</q> which clearly implies nothing of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature, but ſomething exceedingly violent and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous.</p>
                  <p>This is, no doubt, the ſame awful period that is ſpoken of in the laſt chapter of Daniel, ch. xii. ver. 1. <q>And at that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great prince which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:027559_0032_0FD5356DECBE8760"/>
ſtandeth for the children of thy people, and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a nation, even to that ſame time; and at that time thy people ſhall be delivered, every one that ſhall be found written in the book. And many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake.</q> For that the reſurrection, at leaſt in part, will take place at the commencement of this great period, is agreeable to the uniform language of ſcripture on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>All the prophecies in the New Teſtament concerning the fall of antichriſt, and the commencement of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kingdom of heaven, and of Chriſt, exactly correſpond with thoſe which I have quoted from the Old Teſtament. The ſecond coming of Chriſt is repreſented by the apoſtle Paul, 2 Theſ. i. 7, as an event exceedingly awful, and dreadful to the wicked. <q>He will be revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on them that know not God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the great antichriſtian power is to be deſtroyed at this ſecond coming of Chriſt, and not properly before, and therefore that its final deſtruction will be ſudden, is evident from what the ſame apoſtle ſays afterwards, 2 Theſ. ii. 8. <q>Then ſhall that wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming, even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, in them that periſh;</q> characters ſufficiently evident of the church of Rome.</p>

The account that is given, in the book of Revelation, of the commencement of the laſt great period, ſignified by the blowing of the <hi>ſeventh trumpet,</hi> when the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the earth are to become the kingdoms of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Rev. ii. 15, is immediately preceded by the third, and probably far the greateſt of the <hi>three woes,</hi> the firſt of which was occaſioned by the conqueſts of the Saracens, and the ſecond by thoſe of the Turks, as the order of the events deſcribed under the preceding trumpets evidently implies. And the ſtate of things at this time is deſcribed in the following emphatical language of the four and twenty elders, who are ſaid, on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to fall on their faces, and to worſhip God, Rev. xi. 17. <q>We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art, and waſt, and art to come, becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power and haſt reigned. And the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they muſt be judged, and that thou ſhouldeſt give reward to thy ſervants the prophets, and ſhouldeſt deſtroy them that deſtroy the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">On this ſubject I refer my readers to two ſermons lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Rev.

                  </p>
                  <p>We have here a wonderful concurrence of great events, and among theſe is the <hi>anger of the nations,</hi> followed by the <hi>deſtruction of them that have deſtroyed the earth.</hi> Now how has the earth been deſtroyed by the men who <hi>have</hi> deſtroyed it, but by deſolating wars, and the deſtruction that has thereby been made of mankind? In like manner, then, may we conclude that thoſe deſtructive powers will themſelves be deſtroyed, probably by one another, in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027559_0034_0FD535720131F438"/>
thoſe <hi>wars</hi> which the apoſtle James ſays ariſe from <hi>men's luſts,</hi> the luſt of ambition and revenge. And when, my brethren, have we ſeen, or heard of, ſuch anger and range in nations, ſuch violence in carrying on war, and ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of men, as at this very time? It is thought that the laſt campaign only has deſtroyed many more men than all the eight years of the American war, and probably more than the long war before it; and from the increaſed armaments of the belligerent powers, and their increaſing animoſity, it is probable that the approaching campaign will be more bloody than the laſt.</p>
                  <p>What has more eminently contributed to deſtroy the earth, than the antichriſtian and idolatrous eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhments of Chriſtianity, that have ſubſiſted in theſe weſtern parts of the world; many more perſons having been deſtroyed by Chriſtians, as they have called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than by Heathens? And do we not ſee one, and one of the principal, of thoſe eſtabliſhments already, and completely, deſtroyed?</p>
                  <p>A more highly wrought picture of the deſtruction and ſlaughter of men, that will precede this glorious period in which 'God will take to himſelf his great power and reign,' we find in the 19th chapter of the Revelation, which deſcribes the triumph of the ſaints on the occaſion. <q>After theſe things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Alleluia, Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and right are his judgments. For he hath judged the great whoſe, which did corrupt the earth with her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand.</q> That this has a connexion with the ſecond
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027559_0035_0FD535752979D410"/>
coming of Chriſt, appears from what immediately follows, ver. II. <q>And I ſaw heaven opened, and behold a white horſe, and he that ſat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteouſneſs he ſhall judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns, and he had a name written which no man knew but he himſelf. And he was clothed in a veſture dipped in blood, and his name is called THE WORD OF GOD. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horſes, clothed in fine linen, white and clean; and out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the nations; and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron, and he treadeth the wine-preſs of the fierceneſs of the wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his veſture, and on his thigh, a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there will be literally great ſlaughter of men on the occaſion, is clearly indicated in what follows, figurative and hyperbolical as the language is, ver. 17. <q>And I ſaw an angel ſtanding in the ſun, and he cried with a loud voice, ſaying to all the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, Come and gather yourſelves together, unto the ſupper of the great God, that ye may eat the fleſh of kings, and the fleſh of captains; and the fleſh of mighty men, and the fleſh of horſes, and them that ſit on them, and the fleſh of all men, both free and bond, both ſmall and great.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame is evident from the account of the pouring out of the third vial, Rev. xvi. 14, &amp;c. <q>And the third angel poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of water, and they became blood. And I heard the angel
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027559_0036_0FD53576B89A0D20"/>
of the waters, ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, who art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus. For they have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this great ſlaughter will be made on the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the antichriſtian power, called in this book <hi>the beaſt,</hi> ſupported by <hi>the kings of the earth,</hi> is evident from the next verſes, ver. 19. <q>And I ſaw the beaſt, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together, to make war againſt him that ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army. And the beaſt was taken, and with him the falſe prophet, that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beaſt, and them that worſhipped his image. Theſe were both caſt alive into a lake of fire burning with brimſtone. And the remnant were ſtain with the ſword of him that ſat upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth, and all the ſowls were filled with their fleſh.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this follows the deſcription of the millenium, chap. xx. ver. 4. <q>And I ſaw thrones and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark upon their forehead, or in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years. But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed. This is the firſt reſurrection. Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. On ſuch the ſecond death hath no power, but
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027559_0037_0FD5357936A85EE0"/>
they ſhall be prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and they ſhall reign with him a thouſand years.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To me it appears not improbable, that ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in our Saviour's prophecy concerning the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem, and the deſolation of Judea, relate to this great and more diſtant period. For it was delivered in anſwer to a queſtion put to him by his diſciples, which reſpected both the events, on the idea of their being coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. 'Tell us,' ſay they, Matt. xxiv. 3, <q>When ſhall theſe things be, and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the age?</q> In anſwer to this, he ſays, firſt, as it is in Luke, whoſe account in this caſe ſeems to be the moſt orderly and diſtinct of any, chap. xxi. ver. 9. <q>But when ye ſhall hear of wars, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, be not terrified; for theſe things muſt firſt come to paſs, but the end is not by and by. Then ſaid he unto them, Nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom againſt kingdom, and great earthquakes ſhall be in divers places, and famines, and peſtilences, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſights, and great ſigns ſhall there be from heaven. But before all theſe they ſhall lay their hands on you, and perſecute you, delivering you up to the ſynagogues, and into priſons, being brought before kings and rulers for my names ſake.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am the more inclined to think that ſome things in this prediction have this farther reference, becauſe in them Jeſus expreſsly quotes the language of Daniel recited above, which unqueſtionably has this reference; as when he ſays, Mat. xxix. 20. <q>There ſhall be great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world to this time, no nor ever ſhall be: And except thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027559_0038_0FD5357B11610538"/>
days ſhould be ſhortened, there ſhould no fleſh be ſaved, but for the elects ſake thoſe days ſhall be ſhortened.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems ſtill more evident that this prediction admits of this interpretation, from what follows, which exactly correſponds to the more antient prophecies. Mat. xxiv. 29. <q>Immediately after the tribulation of thoſe days ſhall the ſun be darkened, and the moon not give her light, and the ſtars ſhall fall from heaven, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the heavens ſhall be ſhaken;</q> which are almoſt the very words of the prophet Haggai quoted above. <q>And then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then ſhall all the tribes of the earth mourn. And they ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. And he ſhall ſend his angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his elect, from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this great tribulation was a diſtant event, and did not reſpect the Jews, but the Gentiles, is probable from Jeſus calling it, Luke xxi. 25, 'the diſtreſs of nations,' or 'the nations,' i.e. 'Gentiles,' 'men's hearts,' he ſubjoins, <q>failing them for fear, and for looking after thoſe things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken,</q> that is, there will be great convulſions, and violent revolutions, in kingdoms and ſtates; <q>And then ſhall they ſee the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> Man coming in clouds, with power and great glory.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this tribulation is coincident with that which is to precede the reſtoration of the Jews, is probable from his ſaying immediately before, ver. 24. <q>Jeruſalem ſhall
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027559_0039_0FD535810171EF20"/>
be trodden down of the Gentiles, till the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled,</q> that is, till it ſhall come to be their turn to be puniſhed; the deſtruction of the Gentiles, who had oppreſſed the Jews, commencing with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of that highly favoured nation.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus farther ſays, Luke xxi. 22. <q>Theſe be the days of vengeance, that all the things which are written may be fulfilled</q> Now the only days of vengeance particularly announced by the antient prophets, to which Jeſus here alludes, relate to the judgments of God upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles who had ſhewn enmity to the Jews, and eſpecially in their oppoſition to their re-ſettlement in their own country.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more clear in the whole compaſs of prophecy, as I have ſhewn on another occaſion, than that after the deſtined period for the diſperſion and calamities of the Jews, the heavieſt of all the divine judgments will fall upon thoſe nations by whom they ſhall have been op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and this will involve almoſt all the nations of the world, but more eſpecially thoſe of theſe weſtern parts, which have been ſubject firſt to the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and then to the ſee of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Moſes ſays, Dent. xxx. 7. <q>The Lord thy God will put all theſe curſes</q> (thoſe which were threatened to fall upon them) <q>upon thine enemies, and upon them that hate thee, and perſecute thee.</q> Iſa. xliii. 25. <q>I will contend with them that contend with thee, and I will ſave thy children. And I will feed them that oppreſs thee with their own fleſh, and they ſhall be drunken with their own blood, as with ſweet wine, and all fleſh

ſhall know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</q> Zeph. iii. 19. <q>Behold at that time I will undo all that afflict thee.</q> Jer. xxx. 11. <q>Though I make a full end of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whither I have ſcattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee, but I will correct thee in meaſure.</q> Ezekiel, ſpeaking of the happy times that will take place on the reſtoration of the Jews, ſays, chap. xxviiii. ver. 26. <q>Yea they ſhall dwell with confidence, when I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted judgments upon all thoſe that deſpiſe them round about them, and they ſhall know that I am Jehovah their God.</q> Laſtly, Zechariah ſays, chap. xii. ver. 9. <q>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, that I will ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the nations that come againſt Jeruſalem.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is to be a day of viſitation for all the nations in this part of the world (all of whom have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their oppreſſion and maſſacre of the Jews) will now, I preſume, be ſufficiently apparent, if there be any truth in prophecy. You will therefore naturally aſk, whether there be any ground for thinking, that thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <hi>now</hi> about to take place; if ſo, how long they will probably continue, and when will be the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the glorious and happy times that are to follow.</p>
                  <p>That thoſe great troubles, ſo frequently mentioned in the antient prophecies, are now commencing, I do own I ſtrongly ſuſpect, as I intimated the laſt time that I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed you on this occaſion; and the events of the laſt year have contributed to ſtrengthen that ſuſpicion; the ſtorm, however, may ſtill blow over for the preſent, and the great ſcene of calamity be reſerved for ſome future time, though I cannot think it will be deferred long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:027559_0041_0FD53589F295DFF8"/>
As to the preciſe time when the ſcene of calamity will terminate, and the proper kingdom of Chriſt will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, he himſelf did not know, either before his death and reſurrection, or afterwards. When he was queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned on the ſubject, he expreſsly ſaid, Mark xiii. 32, <q>But of that day, and that hour, knoweth no man, no not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</q> When, after his reſurrection, the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples aſked him, ſaying, Acts i. 6, <q>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore again the kingdom to Iſrael?</q> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q>It is not for you to know the times or the ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</q> It is enough for us to know the certainty of theſe great events, that our faith may not fail on the approach of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted calamity, confident that it will have the happieſt iſſue in God's own time. For the ſame Being who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the evil which we ſhall ſee come to paſs, has likewiſe foretold the good that is to follow it.</p>
                  <p>That the ſecond coming of Chriſt will be coincident with the commencement of the millenium, or the future peaceable and happy ſtate of the world (which, according to all the prophecies, will take place after the reſtoration of the Jews) is evident from what Peter ſaid, in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Jews, on the occaſion of his healing the lame man at the gate of the temple, Acts iii. 19. <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye, therefore, and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord. And he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, who before was preached unto you, whom the heavens muſt receive until the times of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets ſince the world began.</q> Now
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027559_0042_0FD5358B79BE0350"/>
nothing is more evident than that the only period that can be called the time of the <hi>reſtitution of all things,</hi> or the paradiſiacal and happy ſtate of the world, foretold by the antient prophets, will follow the reſtoration of the Jews to their own country. This, and nothing elſe, is the great burden of all antient prophecy.</p>
                  <p>That this will be a joyful event to the Jewiſh nation, when they will be convinced, perhaps by his perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance among them, that he is their promiſed Meſſiah, actually coming in the clouds of heaven, appears from what our Saviour himſelf ſays, Mat. xxi. 9. Luke xiii. 35. <q>Verily I ſay unto you, ye ſhall not ſee me until the time come when ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord;</q> the very cry at which the Scribes and Phariſees were ſo much offended in the children, when Jeſus entered Jeruſalem. This very cry would then be that of the whole nation.</p>
                  <p>But though our Saviour could not fix the time of his ſecond coming, or the commencement of his proper king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he ſufficiently forewarned his diſciples of the ſigns of its approach, and of ſome circumſtances that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately precede it, to which it certainly behoves us to be attentive.</p>
                  <p>Before this great event the goſpel is to be preached to all the world. Mat. xxiv. 14. <q>And this goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached through all the world, for a witneſs to all nations, and then ſhall the end come.</q> If by the whole world, we mean the Roman empire, this was accompliſhed before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and therefore may refer to that event. But it may have
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027559_0043_0FD5358D1BDD29D8"/>
a farther reference, and now there is hardly any nation that has not had an opportunity of having the goſpel preached to them; and the late wonderful extenſion of navigation, by which the whole of the habitable world has been explored by Chriſtians (though this was by no means the object of the navigators) will, no doubt, be the means of carrying the knowledge of the goſpel to a greater extent than ever; and the troubles of Europe will greatly contribute to the ſame end. Times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble make men ſerious. With theſe ſerious impreſſions on their minds many will fly to diſtant countries, and carry the knowledge of the goſpel with them; and, it may be hoped, in greater purity, and conſequently more worthy of their acceptance, than it has hitherto appeared to them.</p>
                  <p>Another preceding event, and of a more definite kind, is the great prevalence of infidelity, Luke xviii.8. <q>When the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find faith in the earth.</q> Now the prevalence of infidelity of late years has been very remarkable in all countries in which antichriſtian hierarchies have been eſtabliſhed. And certainly all civil eſtabliſhments of Chriſtianity, in which power is claimed to preſcribe articles of faith, to make laws to bind the conſciences of Chriſtians, and inflict temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the violation of them, are properly antichriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian. For, as Chriſtians, we are commanded to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no man maſter upon earth, ſince one is our maſter, even Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſuch abſurd doctrines have been eſtabliſhed by human authority, and ſuch horrid puniſhments have been inflicted upon men for obeying the dictates of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027559_0044_0FD535900FC68748"/>
under all thoſe hierarchies, proteſtant ones not excepted, that the minds of men have revolted at them; and, ſhocked at ſuch enormities, have thrown off the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and profeſſion of Chriſtianity altogether. This was long ago the caſe in Italy, where the enormities of the court of Rome were the moſt conſpicuous; and many of the cardinals, and ſome of the popes themſelves, are well known to have been unbelivers.</p>
                  <p>That this has long been the caſe in France, is what no perſon acquainted with that country the laſt fifty years will deny. It is now become more generally known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has had a better opportunity of ſhowing itſelf. That, in ſimilar circumſtances, the ſame, or ſomething ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to it, would not appear to be the caſe with <hi>us,</hi> is more than thoſe who are acquainted with the ſtate of things in this reſpect will vouch for.</p>
                  <p>When I was myſelf in France in 1774, I ſaw ſufficient reaſon to believe, that hardly any perſon of eminence, in church or ſtate, and eſpecially in the leaſt degree eminent in philoſophy, or literature, (whoſe opinions in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are, ſooner or later, adopted by others) were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſtianity; and no perſon will ſuppoſe that there has been any change in favour of Chriſtianity the laſt twenty years. A perſon, I believe not living, and one of the beſt informed men in the country, aſſured me, very gravely, that (paying me a compliment) I was the firſt perſon he had ever, met with, of whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had any opinion, who pretended to believe Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianity. To this all the company aſſented. And not only were the philoſophers, and other leading men in France, at that time unbelievers in Chriſtianity, or deiſts, but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:027559_0045_0FD53597542691C0"/>
                     <hi>atheiſts,</hi> denying the being of a God. Nay Voltaire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was then living, was conſidered by them as a weak-minded man, becauſe, though an unbeliever in revelation, he believed in a God.</p>
                  <p>When I aſked theſe gentlemen what it was that appeared to them ſo incredible in Chriſtianity, that they rejected it without farther examination (for they did not pretend to have employed much time on the ſubject) they mentioned the doctrines of tranſubſtantiation, and the trinity, as things too palpably abſurd to require any diſcuſſion. It is, without, doubt, the civil eſtabliſhment of ſuch Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity as this, at which the common ſenſe of mankind will ever revolt, that makes ſo many unbelievers of perſons who will not take the trouble to read the ſcriptures for themſelves, or who have been ſo long put upon them. Theſe ſyſtems, and the blindneſs and obſtinacy in the governing powers, in rejecting every propoſal for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the moſt palpable abuſes, and the moſt manifeſt oppreſſions, make unbelievers much faſter than all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Chriſtians can unmake them.</p>
                  <p>Nothing, however, can ever counteract the fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſuch corrupt Chriſtianity, as is ſupported by theſe hierarchies, which are alſo intolerbaly expenſive and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, but the exhibition of rational Chriſtianity, with its proper evidence, by unitartian Chriſtians. But theſe are yet ſo few, compared with the bulk of Chriſtians, who are trinitarians, that ſuperficial obſervers, as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve's in general who judge by the great maſs are, pay little regard to their repreſentations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:027559_0046_0FD53599306290F0"/>
Happily, this infidelity is, in its turn, deſtroying thoſe antichriſtian eſtabliſhments which gave birth to it; and and when this great revolution ſhall be accompliſhed, genuine unadulterated Chriſtianity, meeting with leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, will not fail to recommend and eſtabliſh itſelf by its own evidence, and become the religion of the whole world. True Chriſtianity ſtands in no need of the aid of civil power.</p>
                  <p>This was the idea of the great Sir Iſaac Newton, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the evidence of the excellent Mr Whiſton, in the following paſſage of his <hi>Eſſay on the Revelation,</hi>2d edition, p.321. <q>Sir Iſaac Newton had a very ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conjecture, which he told Dr. Clarke, from whom I received it, that the overbearing tyranny and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power of the antichriſtian party, which hath ſo long corrupted Chriſtianity, and enſlaved the Chriſtian world, muſt be put a ſtop to, and broken to pieces by the prevalence of infidelity, for ſome time, before pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtianity could be reſtored; which ſeems to be the very means that is now working in Europe, for the ſame good and great end of Providence. Poſſibly he might think that our Saviour's own words implied it: When the Son of Man cometh ſhall he find faith on the earth? Luke xviii.8. See Conſtitut. Ap<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>. vi. 18; vii. view.32; or poſſibly he might think no other way ſo likely to do it in human affairs: it being, I acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, too ſadly evident, that there is not at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion enough in Chriſtendom, to put a ſtop to ſuch antichriſtian tyranny and perſecution, upon any genuine principles of Chriſtianity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="unknown:027559_0047_0FD5359A960F5AA8"/>
The concluding obſervation of Mr. Whiſton appears to me to be very juſt. It ſeems probable that no Chriſtians, not even the freeſt, and boldeſt, would ever have done what was neceſſary to be done, to the overturning of theſe corrupt eſtabliſhments of Chriſtianity, and what unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have lately done in France.</p>
                  <p>This great event of the late revolution in France ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, and many others, to be not improbably the accompliſhment of the following part of the Revelation, chap. xi.3. <q>And the ſame hour, there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were ſlain of men (or literally, <hi>names of men</hi>) ſeven thouſand, and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>An earthquake, as I have obſerved, may ſignify a great convulſion, and revolution, in ſtates; and as the Papal dominions were divided into ten parts, one of which, and one of the principal of them, was France, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi> a tenth part of the city,</hi> or of the myſtical <hi>Babylon.</hi> And if by <hi>names of men,</hi> we underſtand their <hi>titles,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of the nobility, and other hereditary diſtinctions, all of which are now aboliſhed, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the prediction will appear to be wonderfully exact. It is farther remarkable, that this paſſage imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately precedes what I have quoted before concerning the <hi>nations being angry,</hi> and the wrath of God being come, for the <hi>deſtruction of thoſe who have deſtroyed the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no leſs remarkable, that the kings of France were thoſe who gave the Popes their temporalities, and the rank they now hold among the princes of the world.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027559_0048_0FD5359C462935A0"/>
And it is foretold, Rev. xvii. 16, that <q>thoſe kings who gave their power and ſtrength unto the beaſt, ſhall hate the whore, and ſhall make her deſolate and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire. For God has put it in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree to give their kingdoms unto the beaſt, until the words of God ſhall be fulfilled.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>May we not hence conclude it to be highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that what has taken place in France will be done in other countries? But the total deſtruction of this great antichriſtian power ſeems to be reſerved for the ſecond coming of Chriſt in perſon, by the <hi>brightneſs of whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> and not before, he is, according to the apoſtle Paul, to be completely <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> And with this view, as well as others, every Proteſtant Chriſtian ſhould ſay, 'Come, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.' In the mean time, let us attend to the ſolemn admonition in the Revelation, xviii. 4. <q>I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered her iniquities<note n="*" place="bottom">That the opinion here advanced, concerning the danger of the civil powers of Europe, in conſequence of their connexion with antichriſtian eccleſiaſtical ſyſtems, has been long entertained by me, may appear from the following extract from my <hi>Hiſtory of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Chriſtianity,</hi> vol. ii. P. 484. <q>It is nothing but the alliance of the kingdom of Chriſt with the kingdoms of this world (an alliance which our Lord himſelf expreſsly diſclaimed) that ſupports the groſſeſt corruptions of Chriſtianity; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we muſt wait for the fall of the civil powers before this moſt unnatural alliance be broken. Calamitous, no doubt, will that time be. But what convulſion in the political world ought to be ſubject of lamentation, if it be attended with ſo deſirable an event? May the kingdom of God, and of Chriſt, (that which I conceive to be intended in the Lord's Prayer) truly and fully come, though all the kingdoms of the world be removed in order to make way for it.</q>
                        </note>.</q>

As the ſecond coming of Chriſt will be during the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prevalence of inſidelity, ſo it will be ſudden, and moſt unexpected. This is the language of our Saviour himſelf, Mat. xxiv. 37. <q>As the days of Noah were, ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood, they were eating, and drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, unto the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not till the flood came, and took them all away, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of Man be.</q> Luke xvii. 28. <q>Likewiſe, alſo as it was in the days of Lot. They did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded. But the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, he rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all. Even thus ſhall it be when the Son of Man is revealed.</q> The apoſtle Paul alſo ſays, 1 Theſ. v. 2. <q>Yourſelves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night. For when they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety, then ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſudden and unexpected as the coming of Chriſt will be, it will be moſt conſpicuous. Speaking of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he ſays, Mat. xxiv. 26. <q>If they ſhall ſay unto you, Behold he</q> (i.e. the Meſſiah.) <q>is in the deſert, go not forth. Behold he is in the ſecret chambers, believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the weſt, ſo ſhall alſo the coming of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027559_0050_0FD535A3089069D0"/>
the Son of Man be.</q> As the aſcent of Jeſus was conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and probably leiſurely, ſo will be his deſcent. While the diſciples were viewing him as he aſcended, we read, Acts i. 10, <q>two men ſtood by them in white appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, who alſo ſaid, Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? This ſame Jeſus, who is taken from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</q> Here is no figurative language, no ambiguous expreſſion. Neither is there any in what the apoſtle ſays concerning the reſurrection of the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dead, which will take place at the coming of Chriſt, and which, in the Revelation is called <hi>the firſt reſurrection,</hi> 1 Theſ. iv. 14. <q>If we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo who ſleep in Jeſus ſhall God bring with him. For this we ſay unto you, by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall have no advantage over thoſe who are aſleep. For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven, with a ſhout, with the voice of the archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. Then we who are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</q> Again he ſays, 1 Cor. xv. 51. <q>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump. For the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and we ſhall be changed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The certainty of this great cataſtrophe ſhould be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient motive with all Chriſtians, who, as ſuch, entertain no doubt with reſpect to the fact, to keep it conſtantly in view, and to regulate their whole conduct with a view to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027559_0051_0FD535A7ADA43FF8"/>
it. But if we apprehend it to be in a ſtricter ſenſe of the word really <hi>near,</hi> which, from the preſent aſpect of things, I own I am inclined to think may be the caſe, our attention is drawn to it in a moſt forcible manner. Did we really expect to ſee this great event, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the coming of Chriſt in the clouds of heaven, we ſhould hardly think, or ſpeak, of any thing elſe; and the preſent commotions in the political world, extraordinary as they certainly are, would appear as nothing in compariſon with it. What would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be <hi>great,</hi> would, with reſpect to <hi>this,</hi> event ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly <hi>little,</hi> and inſignificant.</p>
                  <p>What then, my brethren, is the practical inference that we ſhould draw from finding, or even ſuſpecting, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in this ſituation, the kingdom of heaven being at hand, but to repent, and by a change of heart and of life to be prepared for it; that <q>when our Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and take an account of his ſervants, we may be found of him without ſpot and blameleſs, and not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before him at his coming?</q> 'Seeing,' as the apoſtle Peter ſays, <q>we look for theſe things, what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſpect of things, it cannot be denied, is, in the higheſt degree, alarming, making life, and every thing in it, peculiarly uncertain. What could have been more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected than the events of any one of the laſt four years, at the beginning of it? What a total revolution in the ideas, and conduct of a whole nation! What a total ſubverſion of principles, what reverſes of fortune, and what a waſte of life! In how bloody and eventful a war are we engaged, how inconſiderable in its beginning, how rapid and wide
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027559_0052_0FD535A8BA8A57E8"/>
in its progreſs, and how dark with reſpect to its termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! At firſt it reſembled Elijah's cloud, appearing no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a <hi>man's hand;</hi> but now it covers, and darkens, the whole European hemiſphere!</p>
                  <p>Now, whatever we may think, as politicians (and with us every man will have his own opinion, on a ſubject ſo intereſting to us all) I would, in this place, admoniſh you not to overlook the hand of God in the great ſcene that is now opening upon us. Nothing can ever come to paſs without his appointment, or permiſſion; and then, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the views of men, we cannot doubt, but that his are always wiſe, righteous, and good. Let us, therefore, exerciſe faith in him, believing that though <q>clouds and darkneſs are round about him, righteouſneſs and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are for ever the habitation of his throne.</q> All thoſe who appear on the theatre of public affairs, in the field, or the cabinet, both thoſe whom we praiſe, and thoſe whom we blame, are equally inſtruments in his hands, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute all his pleaſure. Let this reflection, then, in our cooler moments, (and I hope we ſhall endeavour, in all the tumult of affairs, to make theſe as many as poſſible) lead us to look more to God, and leſs to man; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, in all the troubles in which we may be involved, repoſe the moſt unſhaken confidence in him, and thence 'in patience poſſeſs our own ſouls,' eſpecially when it is evident that it is wholly out of our power to alter the courſe of events. If we be careful ſo to live as to be at all times prepared to die, what have we to fear, even though, as the Pſalmiſt ſays, the <q>earth be removed, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains be carried into the midſt of the ſea?</q> Whatever turn the courſe of things may take, it cannot then be to our diſadvantage. What, then, ſhould hinder our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027559_0053_0FD535AB04B133D0"/>
the great ſcene, that ſeems now to be opening upon us, awful as it is, with tranquillity, and even with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, from our firm perſuaſion, that its termination will be glorious and happy?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the more there are who indulge theſe enlarged and juſt views, who cultivate a ſenſe of piety to God (which will always lead us to ſuppreſs reſentment, and to promote good-will towards men) the more favour, in the righteous adminiſtration of Providence, will be ſhewn to the country in which they ſhall be found. God, we know, would have ſpared even Sodom, if ſo many as ten righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men had been found in it; and our Saviour, alluding, as I am inclined to think, to theſe very times, which ſeem to be approaching, ſays, that <q>for the elect's ſake they will be ſhortened.</q> For our own ſakes, therefore, for the ſake of our friends, of our country, and of every thing that is dear to us in it, let us attend to the admonition of my text, 'to repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' It is 'righteouſneſs that exalteth a nation,' and 'ſin' only is the 'reproach,' and will be the ruin, 'of any people.'</p>

                  <head>APPENDIX.</head>
                  <p>HAVING originally got the leading ideas that are enlarged upon in the preceding diſcourſe from <hi>Dr. Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's Obſervations on Man,</hi> a work publiſhed in 1749, I think it may not be amiſs to ſubjoin to it ſome extracts from that work, as, from his authority, the ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with which I have, ever ſince I read it, been impreſſed, will receive more weight, than they could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from any perſon, who, writing in theſe times, might be ſuppoſed to be particularly influenced by the aſpect of them, and by his own ſituation with reſpect to them. I wiſh likewiſe by this, as well as by every other means, to direct the attention of my readers to that moſt excellent work, to which I am indebted, if I may ſo ſay, for the whole moral conformation of my mind.</p>
                  <p>How near the diſſolution of the preſent governments, generally or particularly, may be, would be great raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to affirm. Chriſt will come in this ſenſe alſo <q>as a thief in the night.</q> Our duty is therefore to watch and to pray; to be faithful ſtewards; to give meat, and all other requiſities, in due ſeaſon, to thoſe under our care; and to endeavour by theſe, and all other lawful means, to preſerve the government, under whoſe protection we live, from diſſolution, ſeeking the peace of it, and ſubmitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake. No pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, no endeavours of this kind can fail of having ſome
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:027559_0055_0FD535AF27048298"/>
good effect, public or private, for the preſervation of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. The great diſpenſations of Providence are conducted by means that are either ſecret, or, if they appear, that are judged feeble and inefficacious.—No man can tell, however private his ſtation may be, but his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer, may avail to the ſalvation of much people. But it is more peculiarly the duty of magiſtrates thus to watch over their ſubjects, to pray for them, and to ſet about the reformation of all matters civil and eccleſiaſtical, to the utmoſt of their power. Good governors may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the welfare and continuance of a ſtate, and wicked ones muſt accelerate its ruin."</p>
                  <p>"The ſacred hiſtory affords us inſtances of both kinds, and they are recorded there for the admonition of kings and princes in all futur times." Vol. ii. p. 368.</p>
                  <p>"There are many prophecies which declare the fall of the eccleſiaſtical powers of the Chriſtian world. And though each church ſeems to ſlatter itſelf with the hopes of being exempted; yet it is very plain that the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical characters belong to all. They have all left the true, pure, ſimple religion, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men. They are all merchants of the earth, and have ſet up a kingdom of this world, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in riches, temporal power, and external pomp. They have all a dogmatizing ſpirit, and perſecute ſuch as do not receive their own mark, and worſhip the image which they have ſet up. They all neglect Chriſt's command of preaching the goſpel to all nations, and even that of going to 'the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael;' there being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitudes in all Chriſtian countries who have never been taught to read, and who are in other reſpects
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:027559_0056_0FD535B20D9E7340"/>
alſo deſtitute of the means of ſaving knowledge. 'Tis very true that the church of Rome is <q>Babylon the great and the mother of harlots,</q> and of the <q>abominations of the earth.</q> But all the reſt have copied her example more or leſs. They have all received money like <hi>Gehazi;</hi> and therefore the leproſy of <hi>Naaman</hi> will cleave to them, and to their ſeed for ever. And this impurity may be conſidered, not only as juſtifying the application of the prophecies to all the Chriſtian churches, but as a natural cauſe for their downfall. The corrupt governors of the ſeveral churches will ever oppoſe the true goſpel, and in ſo doing will bring ruin upon themſelves." P. 371.</p>
                  <p>"As the downfall of the Jewiſh ſtate under Titus was the occaſion of the publication of the goſpel to us Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſo our downfall may contribute to the reſtoration of the Jews, and both together bring on the final publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and prevalence of the true religion. Thus the type and the thing typiſied will coincide. The firſt fruits and the lump are made holy together." P. 375.</p>
                  <p>The downfall of the civil and eccleſiaſtical powers muſt both be attended with ſuch public calamities, as will make men ſerious, and alſo drive them From the countries of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> into the remote parts of the world, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly into the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies; whither, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, they will carry their religion, now puriſied from errors and ſuperſtitions. P. 377.</p>
                  <p>"That worldly-mindedneſs, and neglect of duty in the clergy, muſt haſten our ruin, cannot be doubted, Theſe are 'the ſalt of the earth,' and the 'light of the 'world.' If they loſe their favour, the whole nation,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:027559_0057_0FD535B44EBB7FE8"/>
where this happens, will be converted into one putrid maſs. If their light become darkneſs, the whole body politic muſt be dark alſo. The degeneracy of the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſecular biſhops abroad, are too notorious to be mentioned. They almoſt ceaſe to give offence, as they ſcarce pretend to any function or authority beſides what is temporal. Yet ſtill there is great mockery of God in their external pomp, and proſanation of ſacred titles; which, ſooner or later, will bring down vengeance upon them. And as the court of Rome has been at the head of the great apoſtaſy, and corruption of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church; and ſeems evidently marked out in various places of the ſcriptures, the ſevereſt judgments are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably reſerved for her. But I rather chooſe to ſpeak to what falls under the obſervation of all ſerious, attentive perſons in this kingdom. The ſuperior clergy are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ambitious, and eager in the purſuit of riches; ſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers of the great, and ſubſervient to party intereſt; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent of their own immediate charges, and alſo of the inferior clergy, and their immediate charges. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior clergy imitate their ſuperiors, and in general take little more care of their pariſhes than barely what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to avoid the cenſure of the law. And the clergy of all ranks are, in general, either ignorant, or if they do apply, it is rather to profane learning, to philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or political matters, than to the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, of the Oriental languages, of the fathers, and eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical authors, and of the writings of devout men in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages of the church. I ſay this is in general the caſe; i.e. far the greater part of the clergy of all ranks in this kingdom are of this kind. But there are ſome of a quite different character; men eminent for piety, ſacred learning, and the faithful diſcharge of their duty, and
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027559_0058_0FD535B71B899B38"/>
who, it is not to be doubted, mourn in ſecret for the cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of this and other nations. The clergy, in general, are alſo far more free from open and groſs vices, than any other denomination of men amongſt us, phyſicians, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, merchants, ſoldiers, &amp;c. However, this may be otherwiſe hereafter. For it is ſaid that in ſome foreign countries the ſuperior clergy, in others the inferior, are as corrupt and abandoned, or more ſo, than any other order of men. The clergy in this kingdom ſeem to be what one might expect from the mixture of good and bad influences that affect them. But then, if we make this candid allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for <hi>them,</hi> we muſt alſo make it for perſons in the high ranks of life, for their infidelity, lewdneſs, and fordid ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt. And though it becomes an humble, charitable and impartial man, to make all theſe allowances, yet he cannot but ſee, that the judgments of God are ready to fall upon us all for theſe things; and that they may fall firſt, and with the greateſt weight, upon thoſe, who, having the higheſt office committed to them in the ſpiritual king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, neglect it, and are become mere <q>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of the earth,</q> and <q>ſhepherds that feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not their flocks.</q> P. 450.</p>
                  <p>"Theſe are my real and earneſt ſentiments upon theſe points. It would be great raſhneſs to fix a time for the breaking of the ſtorm that hangs over our heads, as it is blindneſs and inſatuation not to ſee it; nor to be aware, that it may break. And yet this inſatuation has always attended all falling ſtates. The kingdoms of Judah and Iſrael, which are the types of all the reſt, were thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatuated. It may be, that the prophecies concerning Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, Egypt, &amp;c. will become ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to particular kingdoms before their fall, and warn
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:027559_0059_0FD535B9311327F8"/>
the good to flee out of them. And Chriſtendom in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſeems ready to aſſume to itſelf the place and lot of the Jews, after they had rejected their Meſſiah, the Saviour of the world. Let no one deceive himſelf, or others. The preſent circumſtances of the world are extraordinary and critical, beyond what has ever yet happened. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to let Chriſt reign over us, as our Redeemer and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we muſt be ſlain before his face, as enemies, at his ſecond coming." 455.</p>
                  <p>To theſe paſſages from Dr. Hartley, I ſhall add another from an excellent <hi>Sermon preached in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, December</hi> 13, 1793, <hi>the day appointed for the commemoration of the Benefactors that of Society.</hi> P. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>"Nature recoils with horror at the ſpectacle now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by their unfortunate country [France]. Under the guidance, however, of divine revelation, the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind may diſcern the ſigns of theſe times, and the hand of Providence directing the madneſs of the people. The oracles of truth, when foretelling the perſecutions to be endured by Chriſtians, aſſure us, <q>He that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword.</q> 
                     <hi>They have ſhed</hi> (ſaith the angel) <hi>the blood of ſaints and prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</hi> Deſtruction awaits the perſecutor. And it muſt excite our aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee veſtiges of this righteous diſpenſation in what is paſſing before us. Lyons is recorded in early hiſtory, as the ſpot where a company of Martyrs gloriſied God. Lyons is now devoted, and its name eraſed from the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man. Paris once ſtreamed with the blood of the Hugonots: Paris hath ſince been dyed with the ſlaughter

of that court and clergy, which inſtigated the unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deed."</p>
                  <p>"Let us, too, be honeſt in declaring, whether if the maſſacre of Saint Bartholomew, the revocation of the edict of Nantz, or a ſpaniſh act of faith, were dictated by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; the deprivation of the TWO THOUSAND ejected Miniſters; the ſeverities which forced our countrymen to take refuge in the wilds of America, and the two religious conflagrations which have diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our own days, demonſtrated the preſiding influence of a mind like that which was in Jeſus."</p>
                  <p>"One particular in which the prophecy appears to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us, is the fate of the Gallican church. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted city of the apocalypſe is ſuppoſed to repreſent the antichriſtian community eſtabliſhed in the European ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of the weſtern Roman empire, ſtill ſubſiſting in its pollarchical and diſmembered ſtate. Of this city it is written, that the fall of a tenth part would a ſhort time precede that of the reſt; and that its overthrow would be accompanied by an earthquake, and the deſtruction of <hi>ſeven chiliads of the names of men.</hi> As France was one of the ten kingdoms founded on the ruins of the weſtern empire; as violent commotions are now agitating the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical world, from the Boryſthenes to the Atlantic; as ſeven claſſes have lately been deprived of their privileges and titles; the curioſity of the Chriſtian ſcholar is beyond meaſure excited; and will be gratified with the diſcovery of various circumſtances which will confirm his faith; but which a deſire of brevity obliges me to refer to his private conſideration. One queſtion, however, I cannot help propoſing; that if <hi>we</hi> be of that choſen people who

                     <q>The legiſlators of France are Deiſts!

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>HAVING been requeſted to publiſh this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, I have annexed to it my letter of reſignation, for the ſake of introducing the anſwer of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and the addreſſes that have been ſent to me, on occaſion of my leaving this country, from the two united congregations at Birmingham, from the Unitarian Society, and from the young men and women who have attended my private lectures on the ſubject of natural and revealed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. I wiſh to expreſs my gratitude for the affection that has been ſhewn me, by perpetuating, as far as I can, the marks that I have received of it. Theſe addreſſes will alſo ſerve to ſhew that, though calumniated, and execrated, by many, this has been more than compenſated by the warm attachment of others; which may encourage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in ſimilar ſituations to perſevere in what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them to be right, fearleſs of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that may reſult from it. Theſe addreſſes contain ſome expreſſions that are too highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimentary. But, as Dr. Franklin uſed to ſay, <q>undue praiſe may ſerve to balance undue cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:027559_0065_0FD535C6AA260DE8"/>
It is painful, no doubt, to take leave, as I do in this diſcourſe, of ſuch a congregation as that with which I have been ſo happily connected, and which promiſed increaſing ſatisfaction. But ſuch genuine marks of eſteem and affection, as I have received from the members of it, cannot be unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with pleaſure. No joy, or ſorrow, in this life, can be expected to be wholly unmixed. This is a world of trial and diſcipline; and we ſhould be willing to take the painful, as well as the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable ingredients in it. It will be happy if we be improved by them, and be thereby prepared for a ſtate, in which this kind of diſcipline will not be neceſſary; where there will be <q>no more pain,</q> and where <q>all tears will be wiped from our eyes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alſo take this opportunity of expreſſing my ſatisfaction in the candid attention with which I have of late been heard by unuſually crowded au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, conſiſting chiefly of ſtrangers; thinking it to be a ſymptom of abating prejudice, and of the prevalence of better information than has hitherto obtained. The time, I hope, is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when all deluſion will vaniſh; when men and things will be ſeen in their true light; and the prevalence of truth will, no doubt, be attended with an increaſe of general happineſs.</p>

                  <p>BEING now to reſign my paſtoral charge among you, my thoughts are naturally turned to the ſentiments expreſſed by the apoſtle Paul, when he was in a ſimilar ſituation with reſpect to the church of Epheſus. I do not pretend to his zeal or activity; but my wiſhes for your beſt intereſts are ſincere and ardent, and I cannot ſhew it better than by directing your attention to ſentiments moſt intereſting to us all as Chriſtians, and moſt conducive to our common edification.</p>
                  <p>With Paul I commend you to the good providence of God; praying that he would direct you in all your ways, and eſpecially that you may be led to a right knowledge of the goſpel, that you may imbibe the genuine ſpirit, and practiſe the duties of it, as the only way to enſure your preſent and future happineſs. In his own emphatical
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:027559_0067_0FD535CCD15462D8"/>
language, in my text, <q>I commend you to God, and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and and to give you an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</q> By ſecuring the latter, you cannot entertain a doubt of your title to the former. For, as the ſame apoſtle obſerves, <q>all things work together for good to them that love God,</q> the great object of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel being <q>to purify to himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is alſo the great object of all Chriſtian churches. They conſiſt of perſons who form themſelves into ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the purpoſe of promoting their mutual edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with this view they provide themſelves with ſuch <hi>miniſters,</hi> or aſſiſtants (for ſuch is the real meaning and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our office) as they deem beſt calculated to promote that end; giving them proper leiſure for the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, for ſtoring their minds with ſuch knowledge as will beſt qualify them to inſtruct others, and for the acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every other accompliſhment that can enable them to do it to the moſt advantage. An office and employment the moſt truly uſeful, and therefore honourable.</p>
                  <p>The great importance of this object of Chriſtian ſocieties is ſtrongly expreſſed by the apoſtle in my text. It is nothing leſs than to <hi>build up</hi> the members of them, that is, in faith and holineſs, to raiſe and improve their characters, in order <q>to give them an inheritance among them that are ſanctified;</q> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> to prepare them for future happineſs. It is, as it were, to take men out of the world, to wean them from the low purſuits and gratifications of it, and to make them <hi>citizens of heaven;</hi> to raiſe the <hi>ſons of men</hi> to the high character, and honour,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:027559_0068_0FD535CCD65E9FA0"/>
of the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> and make them heirs of a happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. And is not every other object low and mean compared with this? Give it, then, that place in your regards to which it is entitled, and, amidſt all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary cares of this life, never loſe ſight of your great deſtination for another. Suffer not your minds to be faſcinated by any thing that this world can preſent to you; but, as the apoſtle exhorts, holding all other things in deſervedly low eſtimation, <q>walk worthy of God, and be fruitful in every good word and work to do his will.</q> 'Seeing,' as another apoſtle obſerves, <q>that all theſe things muſt be diſſolved,</q> ſince all our connexions here muſt ſoon be broken, at leaſt by death, and an infinitely more important ſtate awaits us beyond the grave, <q>what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and godlineſs?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the connexions we form here, the moſt endearing and important ones, are ſlight and tranſient. We may flatter ourſelves that we are planning our deſtination for a long time to come, and make our arrangements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as I did when I was ſettled at Birmingham, and again with you; but unforeſeen circumſtances occur, and all our plans are deranged, new ones muſt be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a great portion of life is often employed, and in, a manner waſted, in making new arrangements, which may prove to be as temporary, and to as little purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But, my brethren, the goſpel, the ſtudy and practice of which it has been my buſineſs to recommend to you, holds out to us an object as much more fixed and ſtable, as it is in itſelf of more value. On habitations here are periſhable, liable to be deſtroyed by lawleſs violence;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:027559_0069_0FD535D4F3197390"/>
but there are <q>houſes not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</q> Here we have <hi>no continuing city,</hi> no place of abſolute ſecurity, where we can depend upon not being diſturbed. But in heaven is <q>a reſt for the people of God,</q> a place where 'the wicked ceaſe from troubling,' and where thoſe who are weary with their unceaſing perſecution may depend upon being unmoleſted. Let us, then, when we are haraſſed and diſturbed here, and eſpecially when we are expoſed to diſturbance becauſe we ourſelves are diſpoſed to be quiet, wiſhing to live at peace ourſelves, and deſirous of promoting a diſpoſition to peace in others, look forwards to that peaceful and happy ſtate, and cultivate a temper of mind moſt ſuited to it.</p>
                  <p>Permit me to add, that I flatter myſelf our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation may furniſh and additional motive for doing every thing in our power to ſecure a happy meeting, and a more permanent connexion, in a world of greater ſtability than this. On my part, I have thought the connexion a happy one, and was far from having any wiſh ever to change it on this ſide the grave; and ſuch, I would hope, has been your diſpoſition with reſpect to me. And what is it that makes heaven itſelf moſt deſirable, but the ſociety of ſuch friends as we wiſh to live with here? This world, in its preſent ſtate, would be ſufficiently paradiſiacal for men, if they were what they ought to be, and what they are capable of being, if they were as improved in all reſpects as we have reaſon to think they hereafter will be. If, then, our preſent ſeparation be painful, let us be looking, and preparing, for a ſtate in which no event ſo mutually diſagreeable will occur.</p>

Our preſent ſituation, and that of the Diſſenters in general, calls in a particular manner for the exerciſe of Chriſtian principles. The cauſe of the Diſſenters may now be be ſaid to be, what Chriſtianity itſelf originally was, and long continued to be, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <q>a ſect every where ſpoken againſt.</q> We are expoſed to inſult and outrage, though not to open and avowed perſecution, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. But this ſituation, though not to be deſired by us, is moſt favourable to the cultivation of that temper of mind which is moſt eminently Chriſtian, to the virtues of patience, fortitude, meekneſs, forgiveneſs of injuries, and heavenly-mindedneſs; virtues of the moſt exalted kind, contributing moſt to the dignity of human nature, but for which there is comparatively but little call, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in a ſeaſon of proſperity.</p>
                  <p>'Woe unto you,' ſays our Saviour, <q>when all men ſpeak well of you.</q> But, <q>bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my name's ſake.</q> Let us, in the firſt place, then, ſhew that the evil that is ſpoken of us is <hi>falſely</hi> ſpoken, that is, give reaſonable evidence of it; for to ſatisfy the violently prejudiced is impoſſible, and not to be expected of any man. It is what our Saviour himſelf and the apoſtles were unequal to. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, with reſpect to thoſe who are at all candid, and who will hear reaſon, conſcious integrity is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to ſupport a man under any calumny.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, conſcious of our own integrity, we can look down upon our enemies, not with hatred or ill will, but with compaſſion, as beings in a depraved and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027559_0071_0FD535DA33716B18"/>
ſtate, neither qualified to be happy themſelves, nor to communicate happineſs to others.</p>
                  <p>All perſons under the influence of malignant paſſions are neceſſarily, and by the invariable law of our natures, in an uneaſy ſtate. Their habitual feelings, even when gratified, are unpleaſant. But the feelings of thoſe who are merely expoſed to the malignity of others, without feeling any thing of the kind themſelves, are ſerene, and highly pleaſurable; beſides being attended with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of ſuperiority of character, and of greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in intellectual improvement.</p>
                  <p>The man who obeys the firſt impulſe of natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, corporeal or mental, gives no proof of his being even a rational agent; for brutes are governed by appetite. But the man who refrains from gratifying his appetite, and natural deſire, whether that of revenging himſelf upon his enemy, or any other, muſt do it by the help of <hi>reaſon.</hi> He muſt have ſome degree of comprehenſion of mind, which takes in diſtant objects; and this is the thing that manifeſts a ſuperiority of character.</p>
                  <p>The man who can even defer his revenge, and merely reſtrain his paſſion, is ſuperior to him who gives way to the firſt impulſe of it. But he who can ſo far make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance for the hatred of his enemies, as to feel compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and good-will towards them, while he knows the ill will they bear him, is infinitely ſuperior. We are not moved to anger by the anger of a child. Neither, then, ſhould we be by the anger and malignity of thoſe grown perſons, whom, with reſpect to intellectual and moral improvement, we regard in no higher a light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:027559_0072_0FD535DBC2E92DA0"/>
On account of the low rank of every ſentiment border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on anger and reſentment (requiring only particular impreſſions to excite them, and much reflection to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them) ſuch as zeal for any particular cauſe, even that of religion, it is eaſy to excite it, and lead men to act upon it with the greateſt violence, ſo as to hate and perſecute others who differ from them. Men who have no real religion at all can do this, as is evident in all perſecutions, in the hiſtory of the cruſades, when hundreds of thouſands, moved, as they imagined with holy zeal, went to drive the infidels from the Holy Land, and alſo in the riots in Birmingham. Alſo to ſuffer in any cauſe with the ſpirit with which men die in battle, that is, with obſtinacy and hatred, is not very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. Mahometans fight for their religion, and the North American Indians die with the greateſt heroiſm in this reſpect. But to ſuffer and die with meekneſs, with reſignation to God, and good-will to men, not excepting our perſecutors; to die praying with our Saviour, <q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do,</q> is a far more difficult attainment, but by no means uncommon among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Still leſs ſhall we be diſturbed at the malignity of others, when we conſider that our enemies, as well as our friends, are acting the part aſſigned them by the Supreme Ruler of the univerſe, that they are in their proper place as well as we in ours (though, being inſtigated by their own bad diſpoſitions, this is no apology for their conduct) and that the plan of the great drama, in which we are all actors, is ſo arranged, that good will finally reſult from the evil that we experience ourſelves, or ſee in others. 'The wrath of man,' ſays the Pſalmiſt, <q>ſhall praiſe God.</q>
                  </p>

All the oppoſition we meet with makes part of the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary diſcipline of life, and no great character could be formed, or any great good be done, without it. Our Saviour, the apoſtles, the reformers from Popery, and the Puritans and Nonconformiſts, were equally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it. And ſhall we complain? We ought rather to think ourſelves honoured by it, and, with the apoſtles, <q>rejoice that we are counted worthy to ſuffer for the name of the Lord Jeſus;</q> reflecting, that <q>if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him, and be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied together.</q> Of our Lord himſelf it is ſaid, that <q>for the joy that was ſet before him he endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame.</q> Ought we not, then, I will not ſay be diſpleaſed, and complain, but ought we not to rejoice, and be thankful, for every part of that diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Providence, which we cannot doubt is calculated, and intended, to be ſo highly beneficial to us?</p>
                  <p>If we take a calm retroſpect of our own paſt experience, we ſhall all of us, I am perſuaded, be ſatisfied that many events, ſeemingly the moſt diſaſtrous, were, in fact, the moſt beneficial to us; that they were really mercies, though in the diſguiſe of judgments. And ſhall we not then conclude, that every other evil, coming from the ſame hand, equally leads to good, though we may not for the preſent ſee it to be ſo. When Jacob loſt his beloved ſon Joſeph, he ſaid, <q>All theſe things are againſt me;</q> though it appeared afterwards to be eminently <hi>for</hi> him. As the pſalmiſt ſays with reſpect to God, <q>Clouds and darkneſs are round about him, righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus inſtructed by the unerring word of God, and our own experience, as far as it goes, concurring with it,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:027559_0074_0FD535DEC1442090"/>
we may be prepared to adopt the noble language of the prophet Habakkuk; who, after enumerating the loſs of every thing valuable to man, and that not only tended to his comfort, but was ſeemingly neceſſary to his exiſtence in this life, could ſay, <q>Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my ſalvation.</q> With reſpect to the ſociety of friends, and every thing elſe that is moſt dear to us (and many of theſe I ſhall be deprived of in leaving this connexion) we muſt ſay with Job, <q>The Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</q> Something may ariſe our of our afflictions, or even accompany them, that ſhall be an abundant compenſation for them. And if they only reach us patience, fortitude, and truſt in God, it is alone an abundant compenſation, though they ſhould bring nothing elſe along with them.</p>
                  <p>While we are ſenſible that we live under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good Being, we cannot doubt, but that every thing that befals us is intended for our good. We muſt not forget, that it is only by diſcipline, and often very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſcipline too, that great and excellent characters are ever formed; and no man can tell how much, or how ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere diſcipline may be neceſſary for himſelf. David could ſay, that 'before he was afflicted he went aſtray.' And there is a ſource of ſatisfaction even in adverſity, or nearly connected with it, that perſons in proſperity and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have no idea of.</p>
                  <p>Of this I am myſelf not without ſome experience. My violent expulſion from a favourite ſituation at Birming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was, to appearance, ſufficiently diſaſtrous, and I was not without feeling it to be ſo. Yet I have had more
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:027559_0075_0FD535E47324C600"/>
than a recompenſe, internal and external; ſo as to make me conſider it even now as no evil upon the whole; and I am far from wiſhing, if it were poſſible, that it might not have happened.</p>
                  <p>Among other reſources afforded me by a kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, was the ſeaſonable and generous reception I met with among you; an event which I hope you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced I have endeavoured to improve.</p>
                  <p>Having, without any previous expectation, found a ſphere of uſefulneſs, and a ſource of happineſs, here, I ſhall not deſpair of finding a ſimilar ſituation in America. But there is no ſituation in the world, in which they who are diſpoſed to exert themſelves in the ſervice of mankind (which is the moſt proper ſervice of God, our common creator and parent) may not find an opportunity of doing it, to more or leſs advantage; and no man is anſwerable for more than it is in his power to do.</p>
                  <p>But a ſtate of ſuffering is a ſtate of uſefulneſs, no leſs than one of the moſt active exertion; and very frequently it operates in the moſt effectual and diſtinguiſhed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Did not our Saviour effect more by his death, the apoſtles by their ſufferings, and the Proteſtant martyrs by their various perſecutions, than by their preaching? It is commonly, and juſt obſerved, that "example is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore precept." And what is it that demonſtrates the real force of religious principles ſo much as patient ſuffering for them? It is a clear proof of the value that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer ſets upon them, and ſuch as is more likely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs others than any argument. And the experience of ages confirms the obſervation, ſo as to have given riſe to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:027559_0076_0FD535EA106C9318"/>
the proverb, that "the blood of the martyrs is the ſeed of the church."</p>
                  <p>Was the perſecution of the early Chriſtians, of the Proteſtants in France, in the Low Countries, or in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, of any diſſervice to their cauſe? Did the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Puritans by queen Elizabeth, and the Stuarts, diminiſh their numbers, or their zeal? It increaſed both, as appeared at the time of the civil wars. What do we learn on this ſubject from the different treatment that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters have met with in late times? They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly melted away in the ſunſhine of proſperity, and have become numerous and zealous in adverſity. It is even probable that their numbers were diminiſhed one third, if not one half, and the reſt were grown very luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, in the reigns of George I. and II. princes who were friendly to them; but of late their numbers, and their zeal, are greatly increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Shall we heſitate, then, to ſuffer in the cauſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truth, when we ſee it to be ſo greatly promoted by this means? If we have any value for our principles, we ſhall rejoice in the opportunities that are afforded us of ſerving the cauſe of truth in ſeaſons of perſecution (occurring in the courſe of divine Providence, and not ſought by ourſelves, for that would be oſtentation and preſumption) as the only way in which many perſons have it in their power to promote it, to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For all can advance the cauſe by ſuffering, though but few have ſufficient ability to argue for it. But dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly honoured is the man whom Providence enables, and diſpoſes (for all is of God) to ſerve the cauſe of truth in both theſe ways.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="unknown:027559_0077_0FD535EA106C9318"/>
Beſides, ſuch a degree of perſecution as that to which we are expoſed, will tend to purge our ſocieties of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and unworthy members of men who prefer the world, and the things of it, to the cauſe of truth, and a good conſcience; and ſuch are many of the richer ſort among us, and in all ſocieties; men who, by aſſociating with other rich and worldly-minded men, and eſpecially thoſe who are within the influence of a court, and the honours and emoluments derived from it, catch too much of their ſpirit, become aſſimilated to their manners, and adopt their views. Let all ſuch go to their proper place: we want them not. We want not even their wealth. True Chriſtianity does not ſuppoſe, or require it. But in all caſes of perſecution, ſome of the moſt wealthy have proved the moſt zealous.</p>
                  <p>True Chriſtians, devoid of ſuperſtition, will meet for public worſhip, and edify one another, even without the aid, or expence, of regular miniſters. Theſe are, no doubt, a convenience, but by no means neceſſary, even to the adminiſtration of the ordinances of baptiſm, or the Lord's ſupper. And, in ſituations in which miniſters cannot be had, Chriſtian laymen will, I hope, have the good ſenſe to do themſelves every thing that has been uſually done by their miniſters. And at this time, there are helps abundantly ſufficient for the purpoſe, even though Chriſtian ſocieties ſhould be as deſtitute of talents, as of wealth.</p>
                  <p>This excellent leſſon will be taught more effectually in a ſeaſon of adverſity, than of proſperity. And we ought to be thankful for every ſituation in which ſuch valuable inſtruction is beſt inculcated. In the firſt and beſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:027559_0078_0FD535ECF4176748"/>
ages of Chriſtianity, not 'many wiſe men after the fleſh,' and 'not many mighty were choſen.' And our Saviour even thanked his heavenly Father, that the goſpel was hidden from the wiſe and prudent;' not the truly wiſe, but from worldly wiſe men, thoſe who have the world and the things of it for their chief object.</p>
                  <p>When riches and honours are the reward of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, it will be thought by the world, that the profeſſion of it is adopted for the ſake of thoſe riches and honours, and no other reaſon of their conduct will be ſo much as looked for. But when a man's faith is attended with perſecution, and abuſe in every form, it will be evident that it has ſome other foundation, and ſuch as will be thought worth enquiring into. And a diſpaſſionate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry is all that truth, and Chriſtianity, if it be founded on truth, requires. The ſame is the caſe with reſpect to any particular mode or form of Chriſtianity. It diſclaims all connexion with civil power, and worldly emolument.</p>
                  <p>It may juſtly be our pride, that, as Unitarians, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has been ſo far from being befriended, that it has, in all ages, and in all nations, been frowned upon, by the civil magiſtrate; and yet in theſe ſeemingly unfavourable circumſtances, it has conſtantly gained ground, and of late in a tenfold proportion to what it has ever done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with thinking and ſerious men. Can there be a ſurer indication than this, that it will continue to gain ground, till it eſtabliſh itſelf univerſally? But even then, it will, I truſt, be as independent, as it is at preſent, of that civil <hi>power</hi> which is now hoſtile to it. Hereafter, when time ſhall have abated the force of prejudice, it may be recorded to your honour, that you received not myſelf, as an individual, but an Unitarian, ſo obnoxious

to popular odium as I have been, as well as to have had ſuch a man as Dr Price (whoſe eulogium I need not make to you) for your miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Having ſhewn this Chriſtian fortitude, and acted with ſo much true judgment, I hope you will continue to act the ſame part, unmoved by the cenſures of an unthinking world, and promoting the peace and welfare of your country; with being enemies to which we are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly charged.</p>
                  <p>Should thoſe calamitous times, the approach of which, (led, as I conceived, by the light of ſcripture prophecy compared with the preſent aſpect of things,) I expreſſed my apprehenſions of in my late <hi>Faſt Sermon,</hi> ready come, the Chriſtian principles which I have, in this diſcourſe, endeavoured to recommend to you, will be your beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; teaching you both how to <hi>act,</hi> and how to <hi>ſuffer,</hi> as circumſtances may require. In this caſe, though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhall not exult in my ſafety from the ſtorm, but ſympathize with you, and almoſt wiſh to ſuffer along with you. For it is not any dread of this nature, but other circumſtances, as you well know, that induce me to leave you.</p>
                  <p>In all events, our ſeparation, and that from any of our friends, by death, or otherwiſe, is, in the eye of reaſon, of ſhort continuance. For what are the remains of life which ſeparate us from the dead, to any of us? It is, a, the apoſtle ſays, but <q>as a vapour, which appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</q> And then, my Chriſtian friends, you will rejoin your late moſt excellent paſtor, Dr. Price, and all your deceaſed worthy paſtors
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:027559_0080_0FD535F89978DFC0"/>
and friends, where you will not ſtand in need of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, but derive knowledge from purer ſources than ours, by nearer approaches to the great fountain of light.</p>
                  <p>There every cloud of error and prejudice, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe which lead us to miſtake each other's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to think worſe of one another than any of us, I hope, ought to do, will diſappear. And the happy conſequence of this will be many perſons embracing one another as brethren, who were here the moſt hoſtile to each other.</p>
                  <p>Then every truth will be ſeen, not only in its whole evidence, but in its proper importance. Bigotry, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, will be unknown, and no miſtakes but thoſe of the heart will be thought to be of any moment at all.</p>
                  <p>Could we imbibe theſe ſentiments here below, we ſhould make earth itſelf a perfect heaven; and our doing this as well as we are able, will be our beſt preparation for that bliſsful ſtate. To have aſſiſted any of you in this moſt important preparation, for what the apoſtle in my text calls 'the inheritance of the ſaints in light,' would be my greateſt praiſe; as to meet you there would be my greateſt joy.</p>
                  <p>As an evidence of your having imbibed the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity yourſelves, and of your being ſenſible of its importance, you will, each of you, exert yourſelves in your ſeveral ſpheres, to extend the knowledge of it to others, and alſo endeavour to infuſe the ſame ſpirit into them. Do not imagine that this is the buſineſs of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:027559_0081_0FD535FA6F9F3538"/>
only, <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>laity,</hi> in the ſenſe in which the terms are now uſed, are unknown in the ſcriptures. All Chriſtians are there diſtinguiſhed by the phraſe that is now rendered <hi>clergy.</hi> All Chriſtians are there ſaid to be 'kings and prieſts unto God;' and every man who can teach, ſhould be a teacher; and without any ordination, beſides the requeſt of his fellow Chriſtians, adminiſter every Chriſtian ordinance.</p>
                  <p>But independently of this, which may be ſaid to require ſome talents and ability, not poſſed by all, there is a method in which all Chriſtians, without exception, may be teachers of Chriſtianity, and recommend it to others. It is by the open profeſſion of it, and by a life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation conformable to it. This, though a ſilent, is, in many reſpects, the moſt effectual, method of preaching. <q>Let your light ſhine before men, that they, ſeeing your good works, may glorify your father who is in heaven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the mere open profeſſion of Chriſtianity by perſons of reſpectable characters, that is, perſons in general eſteem for their good ſenſe and good conduct, in an age like this, abounding with unbelievers, is of itſelf of great importance. Gladly would unbelievers have it to ſay that all men of ſenſe are with them. On the contrary, I am confident that, whatever may be ſaid with reſpect to good ſenſe, or natural ability, which is often employed to the worſt of purpoſes, men of real knowledge and reflection, as well as men of virtue and integrity, men who have given the moſt ſerious attention to the ſubject, and men of the moſt upright and unbiaſſed minds, without which natural ability will avail but little, are with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:027559_0082_0FD535FC8B650DA0"/>
But to recommend Chriſtianity to men of reaſon and reflection, it muſt be made to appear a rational thing. Men cannot embrace as ſacred truth any thing at which their common ſenſe revolts. Nor can that be conſidered as a truth of revealed religion, which is contrary to the moſt obvious and acknowledged truths of natural religion. And the greateſt part of the unbelief of the preſent age, has evidently ariſen from the groſs abuſes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtianity, eſpecially ſuch as are ſupported by the civil eſtabliſhments of it. Theſe it is the duty of every enlightened Chriſtian, as he values his religion, and wiſhes to extend the knowledge of it, ſtrenuouſly to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And the preſent ſtate of things calls for this in a peculiar manner.</p>
                  <p>Unbelievers muſt be ſhewn that their triumph over ſuch Chriſtianity as is ſupported by the ſtate, will avail them nothing. It is only their triumph over error and ſuperſtition, which are the bane of Chriſtianity. What do they gain by expoſing ſuch doctrines as thoſe of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation, and the trinity? Theſe are not the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the ſcriptures, but the abſurd devices of men; doctrines which, indeed, naturally aroſe in the ſtate of things in which Chriſtianity was embraced by heathens, previouſly tinctured with their peculiar notions, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plaineſt maxims and axioms of the ſcriptures.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of the <hi>unity of God,</hi> is the one great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the whole of the Jewiſh religion, and aſſumed as a fundamental principle in Chriſtianity. The firſt of all the commandments is, 'Thou ſhalt have no other gods beſides me;' and who was the ſpeaker, but Jehovah, the great creator of heaven and earth, the ſame great Being
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027559_0083_0FD53602D9BA1710"/>
who in the New Teſtament is ſtiled the <q>God and the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</q> and ſurely not Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; becauſe then there would be no ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as God the father at all; whereas the apoſtle ſays, <q>To us there is one God, even the Father; and one me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, in all the civil eſtabliſhments of Chriſtianity, the character of the one God and father of all has been greatly debaſed by the idea of his arbitrarily ſelecting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain individuals of the human race, as the objects of his eſpecial favour, while all the reſt are left under an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible ſentence of condemnation; and alſo by the idea of the inexorableneſs of his diſpoſition, in not receiving penitent offenders, till ſatisfaction had been made to his juſtice by the death of Chriſt. Whereas his moſt ſolemn declarations to Moſes, and all the prophets, as a <q>God merciful and gracious,</q> who 'for his name's ſake,' and 'his mercy's ſake' only, pardons offences, though ever ſo great; and all the diſcourſes and parables of our Saviour, eſpecially his moſt inſtructive parable of the prodigal ſon, exhibit him in a very different and much more amiable light, as requiring no atonement, or ſatisfaction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, beſides the repentance, and return, of the worſt of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>If we have any real value for Chriſtianity, we ſhould exert ourſelves to free it from theſe great incumbrances, which have already done it the greateſt injury, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered its very exiſtence. And if other well-meaning perſons, from the fault of their education, and early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, exert themſelves with great zeal in maintaining theſe ſpurious doctrines, we ought to ſhew no leſs zeal
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:027559_0084_0FD5360440F4F6F0"/>
in favour of the great truths of which they are an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If they imagine that they maintain the honour of Chriſt by aſſerting his divinity, are not we maintaining the honour of God, by refuſing to allow any being what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to ſhare with him in thoſe honours, which he has declared that he will not give to another?</p>
                  <p>Let this, however, be done with all due allowance for the innocent prejudices of others; ſo as to think no worſe of the moral characters of men, or their final ſtate, on account of any mere difference of opinion. True piety and benevolence, or the love of God and of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to produce which is the great object of all religion, are not confined to Unitarians; though, thinking more favourably of the character of the Supreme Being, and not thinking any man the object of his diſpleaſure on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his opinions, theſe great virtues, the foundation of all the reſt, may be expected to find an eaſier entrance into our breaſts, than into thoſe of Calviniſts and Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who, thinking thoſe who differ from them to be the objects of the divine abhorrence, may imagine that they cannot do wrong in entertaining the ſame ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; and this is the foundation of all perſecution.</p>
                  <p>It is to the honour of this ſociety, an honour which I hope you will never loſe, to be generally underſtood to hold the Chriſtian faith in the purity that I have deſcribed; having obtained the honourable denomination of an <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Society.</hi> For this implies all the reſt. The opinions of ſingle perſons are often overlooked, or diſregarded; but a <hi>Chriſtian church</hi> is as <hi>a city ſet on an hill, that cannot be hid;</hi> and when theſe churches ſhall become numerous (and they are continually increaſing) they cannot fail to attract uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027559_0085_0FD53605C03BB140"/>
attention. And this cannot but operate in the moſt favourable manner for the intereſt of Chriſtianity in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Indeed, it is ſufficiently obvious at this day, that it cannot ſtand on any other ground.</p>
                  <p>I cannot conclude this Diſcourſe, the laſt that I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably deliver from this pulpit, or in this country, without expreſſing my ſatisfaction in your choice of my ſucceſſor.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Thomas Belſham, Profeſſor of Divinity in the New College, Hackney.</note>. It has been ſuch as cannot fail to do you honour with the truly enlightened part of the community. I would not, and leaſt of all in this place, flatter you, or him. But this I will ſay, that by making choice, as you have done, of a perſon to ſucceed me, who will conduct your devotions, and carry on plans of inſtruction, public and private, as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded he will, on the ſame principles, and in all reſpects as much to the ſatisfaction of the judicious part of the audience, you have greatly leſſened the pain that I ſhall feel from our ſeparation. It will appear to me, as if I were ſtill with you in his perſon.</p>
                  <p>May the connexion be long, and happy. Under his miniſtry, and that of his worthy colleague, may you be built up in the pure faith of the goſpel, inſpiring the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſpirit, and diſcharging all the duties of it, that when the <q>Great Shepherd ſhall appear, and take an account of his ſervants, you may be found of him without ſpot and blameleſs, and not be aſhamed before him at his coming.</q> And then, in the mean time, though abſent from you, I may hear of your welfare, which, next to continuing with you, and promoting the ſame great cauſe myſelf, will make me moſt happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:027559_0086_0FD534F7B5E466E8"/>
Having now cloſed my diſcourſe to the proper congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, I ſhall take the liberty to addreſs a few words to the many ſtrangers, who, as I expected, I perceive to be preſent.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of you, I preſume, are come hither from an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent curioſity to ſee and hear a perſon of whom you have heard much evil, and perhaps ſome good, and whom you do not expect to ſee or hear any more. Others, though I hope not many, may have come for ſome leſs innocent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe, let them have come whenever they pleaſed, muſt have found themſelves diſappointed; and I hope agreeably ſo; as inſtead of finding any occaſion of harm to me, they may have found ſome good to themſelves. Nothing elſe can they have heard here; nothing but what is calculated to confirm the faith of all Chriſtians, and to inculcate thoſe ſentiments of the heart, and that conduct in life, which are the proper fruits of that faith. All the doctrines that have been taught here, are thoſe relating to the being, the attributes, and the providence of God; the divine miſſions of Moſes, and the prophets, of Chriſt and the apoſtles, and that future ſtate of righteous retribution, which they preached. Theſe great articles of faith you have heard not only aſſerted, but, if you have attended frequently, repeatedly proved by rational arguments.</p>
                  <p>This a perſon diſpoſed to cavil will allow; but he may ſay that he has likewiſe heard many things heretical, and offenſive to him. This is very poſſible: for every tenet contrary to that which any particular perſon has been uſed to conſider as true, will, of courſe, be by him <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> falſe, and therefore heretical, and more or leſs offenſive. But are we not at liberty in this country to think and judge
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:027559_0087_0FD5360B46275140"/>
for ourſelves? And as to every reaſonable cauſe of offence, all doctrines are to be judged of by their moral tendency, agreeably to the rule of our Saviour, <q>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, what is the apparent moral tendency of the doctrines concerning God, and his moral government, that have been conſtantly taught in this place, but a life of obedience to his will? And is this moral tendency leſſened by the belief that this God is <hi>one Being;</hi> or is it at all improved, or ſtrengthened, by the belief of there being <hi>three perſons in the Godhead?</hi> On the contrary, is not the underſtanding confounded, and diſtracted, by the very attempt (which, after all, muſt be unavailing) to reconcile the doctrine of <hi>three divine perſons,</hi> with the fundamental doctrine of the ſcriptures, that there is but <hi>one God.</hi> And by what conceivable operation can the temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind be improved by ſuch confuſion of ideas, and ſuch embarraſſment; to ſay nothing of the abſurdity, and impiety, of the doctrine?</p>
                  <p>You have heard great ſtreſs laid upon the doctrine of the <hi>divinity of Chriſt.</hi> But beſides that this is plainly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up another God than the <hi>one</hi> God and Father of Jeſus Chriſt; what is gained by it? Are the doctrines and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the goſpel of leſs force becauſe the perſons who taught them were not themſelves gods? On this principle, the law of Moſes would have no obligation; and every thing taught by the apoſtles, who certainly were not gods, muſt be diſregarded; whereas, it is <hi>the authority</hi> by which doctrines are taught, and not the <hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>inſtruments,</hi> by whom they are taught, that is to be regarded; and this authority we all conſider as properly divine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:027559_0088_0FD5360D548CD958"/>
Laſtly, will the human character ſuſtain any injury with reſpect to his love of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> in conſequence of being taught that God, whom we are to reſemble, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial in his regards to all his creatures of mankind, and ſhews no eſpecial favour to any but for their ſuperior vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue? Or will any man be leſs kind, or merciful, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to be more ſo? Making the Divine Being our pattern, and pray that he would <q>forgive us as we forgive others,</q> ſhall we not be even more diſpoſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain proper ſentiments towards our offending brother, when we are taught that if he only <hi>repent</hi> we muſt forgive him; rather than if we were to be led, in imitation of the ſuppoſed conduct of God, to demand ſome other atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſatisfaction, of him?</p>
                  <p>Theſe, however, are the moſt offenſive doctrines that have ever been heard from this place, or inculcated in any of my writings. Judge then yourſelves of the ground of the offence that has been taken.</p>
                  <p>As to the charge of <hi>ſedition,</hi> nothing that can, by any conſtruction, be ſuppoſed to have that tendency has ever been delivered from this pulpit; unleſs it be ſedition to teach what the apoſtles taught before, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we are 'to obey God rather than man,' and that in what relates to <hi>religion,</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> we diſclaim all human authority, even that of king, lords, and commons. In theſe things we acknowledge only one father, even God, and one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, even Chriſt, the meſſenger, or ambaſſador, of God. If any doctrine be really falſe, being contrary to reaſon and the ſcriptures, it is not an act of parliament that can make it true. Or, if any action be morally wrong, as being contrary to natural juſtice and equity, it is not an act
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:027559_0089_0FD536103680AEB8"/>
of parliament that can make it be right. But while we thus render 'to God the things that are God's,' we render to 'Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's.' We are 'ſubject to every' civil <q>ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake,</q> though not to their ordinances relating to <hi>religion.</hi> And whether we think any particular civil regulations to be wiſe, or not (and with reſpect to things of this nature, as well as others, different men will think differently) we ſubmit to the deciſion of the majority, and are the friends of peace and good order.</p>
                  <p>Learn, then, not to give ear to mere calumny; but, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Engliſh maxim, ſuppoſe every man to be innocent till he be proved to be guilty, and in all matters of <hi>opinion,</hi> allow to others the liberty that you take yourſelves. As to <hi>us,</hi> I truſt that we have learned of Chriſt to <q>bleſs them that curſe us, and to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe, and perſecute us.</q> In the language of the liturgy we pray, that God would <q>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our enemies, perſecutors, and ſlanderers, and turn their hearts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether, then, you come as friends, or as enemies; whether we ſhall ever ſee one another's faces again, or not, may God, whoſe Providence is over all, bleſs, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and keep us. Above all, may we be preſerved in the paths of virtue and piety, that we may have a happy meeting in that world, where error and prejudice will be no more; where all the ground of the party diſtinctions that ſubſiſt here will be taken away; where every miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will be cleared up, and the reign of truth and of virtue will be for ever eſtabliſhed.</p>

                     <p>AFTER ſpending little more than two years with you, I find it expedient to leave you. But you will believe me when I aſſure you, that this reſolution is not occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any complaint that I have to make with reſpect to you. On the contrary, it was ſingularly generous in you to receive me when you did, driven, as I was, by violence from a favourite ſituation, and likely, from the prejudice of the times, to bring ſuſpicion on any congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhould make choice of me.</p>
                     <p>I have been happy to find that, though many (as, on ſeveral accounts, was very natural) objected to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the majority, and left the ſociety, ſome partially, and others altogether, your numbers are not on the whole diminiſhed; and eſpecially that, contrary to the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of moſt, I have found a ſufficiently ample field of uſefulneſs in the claſſes of young perſons who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended my lectures. Theſe I leave with peculiar regret, having had peculiar ſatisfaction in my attention to them, and in their improvement in religious knowledge; many of them, I doubt not, being well qualified to inſtruct others. I hope that, in your choice of a ſucceſſor to me

                     <p>Diſtant as is the country to which I find it expedient to remove, I ſhall always rejoice to hear of your welfare, both as men, and as a Chriſtian ſociety.

                     <p>WE have received with extreme concern the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of your intention to reſign your paſtoral office in this congregation; a connextion, from which we had promiſed ourſelves a great degree of benefit and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:027559_0092_0FD5361908A72A08"/>
and which our ſhort experience has abundantly juſtified.</p>
                     <p>Whatever are the circumſtances which have induced you to think of removing, it is ſome conſolation to find, that it is not owing to any complaint to which we have given occaſion; ſince you are pleaſed to beſtow more praiſe upon our conduct, than is its due.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall always reflect, with the higheſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and with real gratitude, on your public ſervices among us; and on none more than your eſtabliſhment of lectures to the different claſſes of young perſons. Convinced, as we are, that the moſt important advantages are likely to be derived to the riſing generation, from this inſtitution, we ſhall be careful to keep this great point in view, in the choice of your ſucceſſor.</p>
                     <p>In lamenting the ſeparation which is about to take place between us, we feel particularly concerned, that your removal is to be to a country ſo diſtant, as wholly to cut off our perſonal intercourſe with you: but we truſt that Providence intends, by this event, to open to you a ſcene of greater uſefulneſs; and it is this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which better reconciles us to the great loſs, which we ourſelves are about to ſuſtain.</p>
                     <p>Remote as may be the ſituation to which you find it expedient to remove, our hearts will go with you, and our affections embrace you; and nothing will afford us greater comfort, than to hear of your happineſs and increaſing means of doing good. If the attachment of thoſe with whom you are about to live, is at all in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

But it gives us the deepeſt regret, that it was in this country that you ſhould have ſuffered for the freedom of well-intentioned inquiries on ſubjects, reſpecting which every man is bound diligently to ſearch for truth, and on which no man can aſſume a right to think for his neighbour. Without free diſcuſſion, truth cannot be aſcertained, and it is the abſence of free diſcuſſion which alone can perpetuate error.</p>
                     <p>Unable to deny the propriety of your retiring from a ſcene of things, where you can promiſe to yourſelf ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comfort, or perhaps even ſafety, we are at leaſt bound to bear teſtimony to your irreproachable conduct, and to the patience with which you have borne your ſufferings. At the ſame time, we muſt lament the ſtigma which our nation will have brought upon itſelf, both with Europe and with poſterity, for having forced one of the firſt of men, of Chriſtians, and of philoſophers, to ſeek in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign countries an aſylum from the inſults and injuries, which he had experienced in his own in the purſuit of religious truth.</p>

                     <p>YOUR intention of quitting this country being now made known, accept the warmeſt ſentiments of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude from thoſe who, beſides having benefited by your paſtoral ſervices, have alſo profited by your Lectures to young perſons on the ſubject of religion. The merit of this inſtitution, which is all your own, has its beſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the impreſſion it has made on the minds of us your pupils. Through your means we not only feel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in our faith in religion, but better diſpoſed to the performance of our various duties; the knowledge of which you have thus rendered clearer to our judgment, and the practice of which you have enforced to us by new and animating motive exemplary in your own life, and firm under perſecution, you have hereby ſuperadded the ſtrongeſt proof of the ſincerity and the efficacy of your different precepts.</p>

It is not permitted to us to deprecate a ſeparation which is judged neceſſary for your comfort and ſafety, and which Providence has perhaps deſigned, in order to extend your uſefulneſs; but we muſt at leaſt lament, that our own happineſs is no longer to remain ſo intimately connected with yours.</p>
                     <p>It is ſome conſolation, however, that we can at leaſt give you pleaſure, by endeavouring to purſue your pious and wiſe inſtructions, and ſhewing that you have not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain to make us firm Chriſtians and virtuous characters. Among other marks of our attachment, we ſhall hold it as a principal duty to promote at all times, in the congregations to which we belong, the inſtitution of Lectures to young perſons, of which we conſider you as the founder, being firmly perſuaded, from our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, of their religious and moral advantages.</p>
                     <p>Permit us to add our thanks for the preſent you have made to the library, of your valuable works, by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of which, both ourſelves, and thoſe who follow us, muſt endeavour to mitigate the memory of the loſs ſuſtained, by the diſcontinuance of your perſonal inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p>YOUR friends, the members of the Unitarian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, addreſs you on the preſent intereſting occaſion, to expreſs the regret with which they are penetrated, at your approaching departure from this country, and their warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſhes for your happineſs, in the place of your future deſtination.</p>
                     <p>So little as you have at any time interfered in national politics, it is but too obvious that the outrageous violence which you have experienced, and the atrocious calumnies which have been circulated with ſuch unexampled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to injure your character, and to render your reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in your native country unpleaſant, and even unſafe, are entirely owing to that manly ſpirit, with which you have avowed and defended, what you firmly believed to be the pure and rational doctrines of the goſpel; and to that truly Chriſtian zeal, with which you have entered your proteſt againſt thoſe prevailing errors, by which the religion of Jeſus has been corrupted, and debaſed.</p>
                     <p>But you, Sir, have inſtructed us, both by your doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and example, to refer events to a higher cauſe: and while we regard with pity the conduct of men, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cover of religious zeal, are gratifying their own perverſe paſſions, we alſo view them as inſtruments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the direction of a ſuperior power, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of purpoſes, the moſt diſtant from their own inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and we bow with humble acquieſcence to the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:027559_0097_0FD522E823ACFEE0"/>
wiſe diſpoſing will of Heaven. The hiſtory of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church from its firſt origin, through the revolutions of ſucceſſive ages, has taught us this leſſon: that it is the order of Providence, that religious truth ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated and confirmed by the ſufferings of its moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, and moſt zealous advocates. In this part of the world, you, Sir, have kindled a reſplendent light, which no length of time, nor violence of oppoſition, will be able to extinguiſh; and you have been honoured as the inſtrument of diſſuſing religious knowledge, beyond almoſt any individual in later ages: we anticipate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with pleaſing hope, the extenſive ſucceſs of your future labours in America. Favoured as we have been with your riſing, and your meridian luſtre, we ought not to envy our brethren on the weſtern continent, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your evening ſay,</p>
                     <p>Hitherto, Sir, you have been our pattern in every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious exertion in the inveſtigation of religious truth, in every thing open and courageous in the profeſſion of it. And when you are removed to a diſtant region, we truſt that you will occaſionally hear, that your illuſtrious example has not been ſo long exhibited before us in vain. We ſhall think it our duty upon every proper occaſion, and at all hazards, to avow our attachment to the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine truths of the Chriſtian religion; and if, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this duty, we ſhould be expoſed even to ſeverer perſecutions than thoſe which you have encountered, we hope that our conduct will not diſgrace the honourable cauſe in which we may ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>We, Sir, rejoice with you, in the aſſurance of the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate triumph of the kingdom of God, and of Chriſt,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:027559_0098_0FD522E99B326700"/>
and of the univerſal dominion of truth and virtue, of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, liberty, and peace. And though we deplore the probable diſtreſſes of the intervening period, we are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the perſuaſion, that infinite wiſdom will direct and controul the ſtorm, and that all the intermediate calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be as an evaneſcent point, in compariſon with that glorious and happy ſtate of things, of which they are the neceſſary means, and to which they ultimately tend.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, we ſhall regard it as our indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duty, to prepare ourſelves and others for theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting events; not only by the zealous propagation of what we judge to be important truth, by every fair and honourable method, but likewiſe by exemplifying in our whole conduct, the tendency of the principles of the Chriſtian religion, when properly underſtood, to form the human mind to that ſtrength and elevation of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which the true dignity of our nature conſiſts; and by which we may moſt effectually put to ſhame the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of malignity, the prejudices of ignorance, and the ſcoffs of infidelity.</p>
                     <p>That your voyage may be proſperous, that your future lot may be happy, beyond the moſt ſanguine expectations of your warmeſt friends; and that your ſphere of uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be widely extended, and prolonged to the moſt diſtant period of human exertion, is the ardent wiſh, and ſervent prayer, of</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>KNOWING the near approach of your departure from this country, we cannot but think we ſhould be guilty of a culpable neglect, did we not previouſly bid you an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate farewell.</p>
                     <p>We have beheld with mingled indignation and regret, that ſpirit of perſecution which kindled the flames of ninety-one, ſpreading through the realm its baneful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and purſuing into his retreat, the friend and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his country.</p>
                     <p>A ſpirit which was thought, in this country at leaſt, to be for ever extinct, inſpiring its barbarous violence into a lawleſs mob, drove you from this place, and broke thoſe bonds, which form the ſacred connexion of a paſtor with his flock.</p>
                     <p>Wanton in malice, the ſame ſpirit has continued to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute you with private moleſtation, and with public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny. The proſtituted abilities of Mr. Burke have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly ſeized each public occaſion of exciting againſt you the public odium, while the dark aſſaſſinating ſpirit of anonymous abuſe, has been buſy in the public prints, and found means to aſſail and wound the tranquillity of your moſt private retirements.</p>
                     <p>From a country where you have met with injuſtice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reward, with calumny and perſecution inſtead of praiſe and eſteem—we cannot wonder you ſhould depart.</p>

The hope, that in America you will find that aſylum which is here denied you; the confidence, that a free country will receive a veteran ſon of liberty, with all the reſpect that is due to his worth; the belief that thoſe who have fought and bled for their own rights will reverence one who has been deprived of <hi>his;</hi> the certainty, that the implacable enemies of liberty will never permit you, in this country, to enjoy repoſe; and the ſtrong ſuſpicion, that they would gladly ſeize an opportunity, to aim not only at your perſonal freedom, but even at your life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,—reconcile us to the proſpect of your departure, by demonſtrating its neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>Wherever you go, renown will attend you. In Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land alone are you calumniated. In every other land, each grateful ſcience will crowd around, and offer a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to him, whoſe genius has enlarged their ſphere, or added to their ſtability. Liberty will warmly welcome you to any of her dominions. Virtue and Religion will hail, with joyful ſmiles, the arrival of their intrepid cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, their ardent votary.</p>
                     <p>We have, on a former melancholy occaſion, expreſſed our ſenſe of the ſervices you rendered us—we expreſſed leſs than we felt, and we again ſend you our thanks.—While tyranny will rejoice; while bigotry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will clap their hands at your departure—all that have been enlightened by your labours will give, in the tribute of a ſilent tear, more than thoſe powers, with all their boaſted influence, can beſtow on their moſt favourite vaſſals.</p>

Though <hi>you</hi> depart, your <hi>labours</hi> remain. The propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of truth is ſilent, and ſlow, but it is irreſiſtible. The feed that you have ſtrewn around, will not lie buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the earth for ever. It is ariſing, and it will ariſe, till it ripen into a glorious harveſt.</p>
                     <p>To your talents, your integrity, and love of truth, we ſhall, while we live, bear teſtimony. We rejoice, that of theſe no enemy can deprive you. While it will afford conſolation to you to reflect, that no virtuous effort you ever made can poſſibly be loſt, it ſhall be ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, that we have enjoyed, that we do ſtill enjoy, ſo many of their effects.</p>
                     <p>Though the waters of a wide ſea will ſoon roll between us—your example, your precepts, and your principles, ſhall not be abſent. Theſe ſhall continue preſent in our minds, and ſhall inſpire our conduct.</p>
                     <p>May he who curbs the ocean, who ſtills the wild winds, and the tumultuous biliows, grant you a proſperous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and ſafely land you on the ſhores of America.</p>
