            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS this poem is the first of the kind, which has been published in this country, the writer begs leave to introduce it with several observations, which that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance alone may perhaps render necessary.</p>
            <p>He has taken to himself the liberty of altering the real order of the two last battles, because he imagined the illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious events, which attended the battle of Gibeon, would make it appear to be the catastrophe of the poem, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inserted.</p>
            <p>He has varied the story of the embassy from Gibeon, for reasons, which he thinks will be obvious to every read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and which he hopes will be esteemed his sufficient justification.</p>
            <p>To give entire Unity to the Action, he has made Jabin the Canäanitish hero through the whole poem; and has transferred the scene of the battle, between Hazor and Israel, from the shores of the lake Merom to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Ai.</p>
            <p>In the Manners, he has studied a medium between ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute barbarism and modern refinement. In the best cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, he has endeavoured to represent such manners, as are removed from the peculiarities of any age, or country, and might belong to the amiable and virtuous, of every age: such as are elevated without design, refined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceremony, elegant without fashion, and agreeable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are ornamented with sincerity, dignity, and religion, not because they are polished by art and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Of such manners, he hopes he may observe, without impropriety, that they possess the highest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for universal application.</p>
            <p>He has made use of Rhyme, because he believed it would be more generally relished than blank verse, even amongst those who are esteemed persons of tas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be thought the result of inattention or ignorance, that he chose a subject, in which his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen had no national interest. But he remarked that the Iliad and Eneid were as agreeable to modern nations, as to the Greeks and Romans. The reason he suppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to be obvious—the subjects of those poem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> opportunities of exhibiting the agreeable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the novel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moral, the pathetic, and the sublime. If he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="unknown:018996_0004_0FA91561CBC79448"/>
the subject he has chosen possesses, in a degree, the same advantages.</p>
            <p>It will be observed that he has introduced some new words, and annexed to some old ones, a new signification. This liberty, allowed to others, he hopes will not be refused to him: especially as from this source the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and refinement of language have been principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly derived.</p>
            <p>That he wishes to please he frankly confesses. If he fails in the design, it will be a satisfaction that he shall have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jured no person but himself. As the poem is uniform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y friendly to delicacy, and virtue, he hopes his countrymen will so far regard him with candour, as not to impute it to him as a fault, that he has endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to please them, and has thrown in his mite, for the advancement of the refined arts, on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

            <p>Subject proposed. Invocation. After the battle, mentioned in the beginning of the seventh chapter of Joshua, the Israelites, in correspondence with the sacred history<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are represented in circumstances of extreme distress. With this event the poem opens, in the evening. Morning. Scene of war. Story of Zimri, and Aram. Zimri returns to the assembly of Israel, and brings an account of the death of Aram, and of an army, sent by Jabin, king of Hazor, to assist Ai. Distress of the Israelites. Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and oration of Hanniel. After a pathetic address, and rehearsal of their miseries, he attempts to prove the impossibility of succeeding in their present design, because of the strength, skill, and numerous allies of their enemies; foretels their approaching ruin, asserts that <hi>GOD</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them, that they were led out of Egypt to silence their murmurs, and, the end being accomplished, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Panegyric on that country; obviates objections to a return, and informs them that, if they should conquer Canäan, they will be ruined, during the war, by the necessary neglect of arts and agriculture, difficulty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the land, of settling a form of government, and of avoiding tyranny; and concludes with a new exhortation to return to Egypt. Applause. Joshua replies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to explain the dispensations of Providence, is interrupted by Hanniel, who first obliquely, and then open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuses him of aiming at the usurpation of kingly autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and asserts the return to be easy. Joshua vindicates his innocence with severity upon Hanniel; and allowing they can return, paints to them the miseri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Characters of Hezron, Irad, and Selima. Morning. Irad and Selima walk out on the plain, northward of the camp, and hold a conversation on the justice of the War. As they are returning to the camp, they overhear two Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites conversing on a design of returning into Egypt. Irad communicates the discovery to Joshua. The alarm is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and an army percieved, coming from Ai to attack the camp. Joshua goes out to the place of rendezvous, marshals a body of troops, and sends them, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Zimri, to meet the army of Ai. In the mean time the camp is in a general uproar, and a large body of the Israelites assembled, westward of the camp, for the purpose of returning into Egypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After the confusion is in a degree allayed, Tadmor harangues the insurgents, with a list of grievances, and stimulates them to perseverance. Caleb who, with Hezron, had been sent by Joshua, upon Irad's information, to watch the motions of the camp, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to him. Ardan answers him, with impudence, and Hezron him, with severity. Insurgents march. As they are quitting the plain, Joshua comes out, with a body of troops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Armies engage with violence, and equal success; until the chiefs of Ai, influenced by superstitious fears, excited by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a thunder storm, order a retreat. Zimri also retires. Scene of the beauties of an evening after the storm concludes the book.</p>
