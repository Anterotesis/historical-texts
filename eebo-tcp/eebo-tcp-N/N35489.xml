            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IDEAS increaſe and are renewed; error and truth ſucceed each other, and appear by turns, like the faſhions of female dreſs.</p>
            <p>Arts and ſciences, like empires and kingdoms, are deſtined, by Providence, to flouriſh and decay. There is no ſcience, however uſeful, ſublime, or perfect it may appear, but will admit the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing hand of improvement; though time too often ſerves rather to veil, than to diſplay its perfections. Whatever has been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, has been diſcovered by degrees, and, airballoon like, has often been neglected and renewed. Human knowledge preſerves its revolution round the truth, as the terreſtrial globe does round that luminous body, which cheers us with its rays: but, in the propreſs of our knowledge, ignorance ſtill attends, and reigns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, as darkneſs after light. It was many centuries ago, when ſeveral people knew this ſcience, and, without knowing the cauſe, produced many effects; which being ſuppoſed the work of witchcraft, the performers were put to the torture, in thoſe times of ignorance, and, conſequently, the art was loſt. I have, myſelf, been looked upon, by many ignorant people, in <hi>France, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as a magician, by putting ſeveral ladies and gentlemen into <hi>Somnambuliſm,</hi> or <hi>Sleepwalking;</hi> and, in that ſtate, have made them <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink, ſing,</hi> and <hi>play upon the harpſicord,</hi> by telling an unknown perſon their diſeaſes, and preſcribing for them, &amp;c. All theſe things appear to them won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and beyond the power of Nature, or of human art; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they know not the cauſe. If you liſten to many Doctors and Apothecaries, whoſe practice, like their underſtanding, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limited, they will tell you, that "Animal Electricity and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm, Sympathy and Antipathy, &amp;c, <hi>is all a cheat;</hi> there is not ſuch a thing in Nature." The former is afraid of loſing his Fee, and the latter, the advantage to be derived from his Gallipot.</p>
            <p>In my firſt part I ſhall give a philoſophical idea of the theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; in my ſecond part I ſhall explain the different manners of the beſt practitioners of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſcience; particularly that of Dr. <hi>Meſmer,</hi> and thoſe of the Philoſophical, Harmonic Society, in <hi>Paris, Lions, Bourdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Straſbourg,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall neither give the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of thoſe, called the <hi>Illuminated,</hi> at the head of whom is a famous <hi>Hibernian;</hi> nor that, called the <hi>Inſpirated,</hi> of whom

               <hi>Caglioſtro</hi> is the apoſtle and martyr, at <hi>Rome.</hi> I confeſs intirely ignorant of their <hi>religious farces;</hi> neither do I believe in the agency of Spirits, except that, which guided the great Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> the Spirit of Truth. I ſhall only give ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as appear to me philoſophically reaſonable, and on them lay the foundation of that ſcience, in the practice of which I have had a great deal of ſucceſs; and, by encouraging my pupils to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the ſame extenſive field, they may reap the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. It would be too long to recite, thoſe of the Ancients, who have written on this ſubject; I ſhall only mention <hi>Flud,</hi> the <hi>Moſaical Philoſophy, Tengelinus,</hi> the <hi>Art of curing by Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, Paracelſus,</hi> ſo much known by his <hi>Alkaheſtical Tincture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Digby, Friend, Maxwel, Muſgrave, Bacon,</hi> and many more who have treated on that ſubject. Among the many who have cured by Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, or by Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was <hi>Phyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Epirus,</hi> who uſed to touch his patients with his toe; the Emperor <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> who performed many cures by touching. <hi>Edward, the Confeſſor,</hi> uſed to touch for the Scrophula, ſince him called the King's Evil. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Kings in Europe have had that gift. <hi>Louis XVI.</hi> when crowned, touched ſeveral patients, ſaying, "The King toucheth thee, God may cure thee." It is ſince <hi>Philip I. King of France,</hi> that his ſucceſſors have practiſed it. <hi>Valentine Greatreak,</hi> from the county of Waterford, ſo much known, and called, by <hi>Boyle,</hi> "The Stroker," cured many by Touching; particularly the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and ſeveral of the firſt people in <hi>England.</hi> Dr. <hi>Gaſner,</hi> at <hi>Ratiſbone,</hi> in <hi>1774,</hi> made ſeveral cures, <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and moſt part of his pupils did the ſame; and I think it muſt ſoon become as familiar to the mind, as the practice of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, Inoculation, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION. ON THE LAWS OF MOTION, IN WHICH ARE EXPLAINED, ANIMAL ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM, BOTH NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL.</head>
            <head type="sub">Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm.</head>
            <p>THESE words are uſed only to ſhow that ſuch a fluid exiſts in all animated bodies, and acts imperceptably, as in a magnet; for it might alſo be called, a Vital Fluid, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, or Innate Fire, Phlogiſtical, or Univerſal Fluid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is now indiſputably demonſtrated, that all bodies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in ſpace, gravitate towards each other, and attract one another in conſequence of their mutual gravitation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bodies can neither gravitate towards each other, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract one another, in conſequence of their mutual gravitation, unleſs they are immerſed in a medium which tranſmits, from one to the other, the action to which they yield.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That medium is a fluid. A fluid is a body, of which the parts are in motion amongſt each other. A ſolid is a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which the parts are all at reſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is, conſequently, an univerſal fluid, which is the medium of the reciprocal actions of bodies, and which diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, among them, the various motions to which they yield.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The univerſal fluid occupies all ſpace. If it did not, there would be places, in ſpace, in which bodies could not tranſmit action to one another; and, of courſe, the order of the Univerſe would be interrupted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is, then, a kind of plenum throughout all ſpace: If not abſolutely, it is, at leaſt, contiguouſly full.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Bodies, moving in ſpace, have points of introduction, and interſtices, to receive and return the univerſal fluid. If it were otherwiſe, it would be impoſſible to conceive their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gravitation, and the attraction which is the conſequence of it.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:046381_0005_1021513F1D4B92A0"/>
8. The mutual gravitation, and attraction of bodies are produced by the currents, which iſſue from one body, and tend towards another, and ſo reciprocally.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The points of introduction which receive, and thoſe, which return the currents, are called poles and, as all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies gravitate, and attract one another, of courſe, all bodies have poles.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The more ſpace bodies occupy, the more currents they receive and return, and the greater is the quantity of other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which they involve in their motions.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The motions and actions of bodies are, of courſe, in proportion to the ſpace they occupy; therefore, the motions of ſmall bodies are ſubordinate to the motions of great ones; conſequently, the motions of the Moon are ſubordinate to thoſe of the Earth; and, of courſe, the motions of the Moon and Earth are ſubordinate to thoſe of the Sun.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Great motions rectify ſmall ones, in the Univerſe, in the ſame manner as motions, accidentally excited in a river, are rectified by the general motion of that river. Thus, the motions of men, other animals, and plants, which are moved, and exiſt on the ſurface of the Earth, are rectified by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Moon and Sun, which the Earth yields to. The reciprocal motions of the Earth and Moon, and the motions of planets, with reſpect to each other, are rectified by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sun. The motion of our Sun, and of other Suns, which move, like it, in the immenſe Space, are rectified by the general motion of the Univerſe, which is the perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer; and, extending an invariable reflux upon the aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all beings, ſingle and compound, combines them in the moſt unbounded harmony.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It is the nature of all fluids to te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to an equilibrium.</p>
            <p n="14">14. If fluids have a tendency to an equilibrium, all move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gravitation and attraction in the Univerſe, which are made in conſequence of the univerſal fluid, tend, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, to eſtabliſh an equilibrium among all bodies, which receive and return the fluid.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Therefore, all bodies, in the vaſt Space, exert their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to keep up an equilibrium among them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. All bodies, in ſpace, yield, therefore, to a power, or motion, which conſtantly excites them to an equilibrium.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Motion, determining bodies to an equilibrium, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The effort which bodies make, to eſtabliſh an equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium, produces Electricity.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:046381_0006_10215140C8DF54F0"/>
19. Therefore, Magnetiſm is, eſſentially, that equilibrium which takes place, between the inward and outward currents; or, in other words, between the motions to which bodies yield.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Electricity is no more than the phenomenon produced between two bodies, one of which has more motion than the other: A phenomenon proving, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at the body, which has moſt motion, communicates it to the other, until an equilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of motion be eſtabliſhed between them.</p>
            <p n="21">21. With inequality of motion, there is Electricity; with equality and reciprocity of motion, there is Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm.</p>
            <p n="22">22. It is the purpoſe of Nature, that Electricity ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, only to produce Magnetiſm: The former ends, where the latter begins.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Such being our doctrine, we call univerſal Magnetiſm, the general equilibrium of beings, reeſtabliſhed, every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the motion laſt deſcribed: That motion, perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtorative, which involves all other motions, and combines them in a general harmony of the whole.</p>
            <p n="24">24. We call univerſal Electricity, the general effort of all beings, or all bodies moving in ſpace, to form one common equilibrium among them.</p>
            <p n="25">25. We call particular Magnetiſm, an equilibrium between two or more bodies, or between all the parts of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; which takes place in conſequence of a particular motion between the Moon and the Earth, produced in conſequence of a particular motion, to which the Moon and the Earth yield. There is a particular Magnetiſm between all bodies, which move or exiſt on the ſurface of the Earth, or that of the Moon; produced by the particular motion, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules thoſe bodies.</p>
            <p n="26">26. We call particular Electricity, the effort made by two or more bodies to put themſelves, reciprocally, into equilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, in conſequence of a particular motion to which they are liable.</p>
            <p n="27">27. I divide, again, both Magnetiſm and Electricity, into natural and artificial Magnetiſm and Electricity.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Natural Magnetiſm and Electricity proceed from the reciprocal and natural action of bodies, relatively to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in conſequence of the natural motions which overrule them.</p>

               </gap> as, for example, when they accumulate, in a body, more motion than it would have, if it yielded to the ſingle action of Nature.</p>
            <p n="31">31. From what has been ſaid, it is evident, that there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, in all bodies, a peculiar quality that renders them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, both of Electricity and Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p n="32">32. That peculiar quality, found in animated bodies, is called Animal Magnetiſm, or Animal Electricity.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Motion alone produces modification in bodies. Reſt is the ceſſation of all action, and produces no modification.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The great motion, in Nature, is that by which all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are moſt univerſally and intimately modified.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But the greateſt motion, in Nature, is that which, cauſing bodies to gravitate towards each other, produces, equally, their Electricity and Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Motion, which produces both Electricity and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm in bodies, or, in other words, which makes them uſe their efforts to bring themſelves into an equilibrium; is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that which more intimately modifies.</p>
            <p n="37">37. But every modification, every alteration ſuffered by a body, neceſſarily concerns the duration of that body; that is to ſay, ſuch alteration muſt, abſolutely, tend to expand, to preſerve, or deſtroy it.</p>
            <p n="38">38. The motion which produces Electricity and Magnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm is, conſequently, that by which Nature preſerves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands, keeps, and repairs all beings, and makes them go through every period of their time.</p>
            <p n="39">39. On ſuch motion, conſequently, is founded the law, which univerſally preſerves and reſtores all beings.</p>
            <p n="40">40. Electricity is not properly in Nature, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, conſidering it to be a termination of action; but is underſtood to be the mean of arriving at that termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is Magnetiſm.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Nature's mode of preſerving is by Magnetiſm; it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes uſe of Electricity to produce Magnetiſm: or rather, Magnetiſm belongs to Nature, forming the firſt of its laws, and Electricity is the accidental effect of the meeting of two or more bodies, that make reciprocal efforts to yield to Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm.</p>
            <p n="42">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:046381_0008_1021514748440720"/>
42. Thence it follows, that to increaſe, by artificial means, the Electricity of a body; to remove it from Magnetiſm, or, what is the ſame, to prevent the natural effect of its tendency to an equilibrium with all ſurrounding bodies; is to act againſt that law which preſerves all beings: Artificial Electricity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulating bodies in order to concentrate motion in them, is, in conſequence, generally dangerous.</p>
            <p n="43">43. It follows again, that making uſe of artificial means to forward the equilibrium of the various parts of the ſame body among themſelves, and the equilibrium of that body with all ſurrounding bodies; is conformable to the law that preſerves all beings: Artificial Magnetiſm, then, becomes as uſeful as Nature itſelf; imitating its general action, or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining its general action towards particular bodies, in a more accelerated manner.</p>
            <p n="44">44. In few words, Nature gives motion to organized bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, on purpoſe that they may return it to others in the ſame manner as they receive it. It is only by that reciprocal communication of motion, that bodies are united among themſelves to form an immenſe ſociety; and Nature only preſerves them by thoſe laws which conſtitute that phyſical ſociety: To interrupt ſuch a ſociety, to ſeperate a being from it, by any proceedings whatever; is, then, generally doing harm.</p>
            <p>On the other hand; to render that ſociety more intimate; to eſtabliſh, in a being, a quicker and eaſier communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of motion, either between the ſeveral conſtituent parts, or with the ſurrounding bodies; is, conſequently, doing good.</p>
            <p>In the former caſe the modified being is compreſſed; in the latter, it is expanded: and a being ceaſes to live, when its expanſion is ſtopped, and it is no more able to react on other beings, that move with it in the wide Space.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Suppoſing that all beings, moving in ſpace; all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, great and ſmall, were ſuddenly inſulated; the Univerſe would be utterly diſſolved: Its life, then, is the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of motion; its health or harmony is kept up by an equilibrium of parts: Its death is cauſed by interruption of communication.</p>
            <p n="46">46. We have obſerved, that the ſmaller motion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, in the Univerſe, are rectified by the greater, even up to the greateſt, conſidered as a perpetual repairer, which connects and rectifies all motion; and we now add, as a natural conſequence of that propoſition, that the more extenſive motions are, the more regular they are.</p>
            <p n="47">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:046381_0009_102151491C394010"/>
47. We muſt conſider ſmall motions, ſuch as proceed from the action of beings exiſting on the Earth's ſurface, like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions produced in a river by the rolling of a multitude of peb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Each pebble produces its motion, contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral motion, which ſeldom agrees with the motion of a neighbouring pebble; but the general motion of the river tends to regulate, among them, all thoſe motions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects their particular aberrations. Thus, the general motion of the ſtars, or of great bodies which the Earth obeys, tends, continually, to correct the particular aberrations which, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, continually flow from the bodies moving on its ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
            <p n="48">48. It is, therefore, in the aberrations of particular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we are to find the real cauſe of all phyſical evils to which each being is liable. It is, then, in the general moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which corrects thoſe aberrations, that the principal reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all thoſe evils exiſts.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Thence, for all ſenſible beings, is derived the neceſſity of watching, and ſleeping.</p>
            <p n="50">50. In watching, all ſenſible beings are modified, by the general motion which rules the Earth, and the ſpontaneous motions produced in themſelves, or imparted to them by the ſmall bodies they correſpond with. Spontaneous motions are too often contrary to the motion which rules the Earth.</p>
            <p n="51">51. In ſleep, all ſenſible beings obey, only, the general motion, juſt now ſpoken of. That motion is the beneficent miniſter of Nature, and is totally employed, in ſleep, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the errors ariſen during the time of watching.</p>
            <p n="52">52. It is in ſleep, when particular motions are not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the general one, that great expanſions, and great repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions take place; with regard to men, animals, plants, and, generally, all ſenſible beings.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Thus, may a genuine idea be formed of what is meant by Artificial Magnetiſm. It is no more than a theory of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, invented to ſubject, in a more particular manner than the uſual order of Nature, any being, whatever, to the action of the motion that is the preſerver and reſtorer of all beings.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Since it is through Magnetiſm, alone, that beings are both preſerved and reſtored, it muſt be deſirable to know the laws by which univerſal Magnetiſm is practiſed, and the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of the proceedings, by the means of which artificial Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm is produced; as they are the object of the true art of preſerving and curing, or the true, univerſal medecine, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:046381_0010_1021514C7143C160"/>only one which Nature avows; becauſe it does no more than favour its preſerving and reſtoring action upon diſordered or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizations.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Next to the phyſical law, which preſides over organi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zations, exiſts the moral one, governing our intellectual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Since the Univerſe is ruled by one ſingle plan and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the Moral Law, in all intelligent beings, ought to agree with the phyſical one, that rules over all organizations.</p>
            <p n="57">57. As the Phyſical Law, the univerſal preſerver and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of organized beings, tends, continually, to maintain and reſtore the equilibrium or phyſical harmony amongſt all organizations; the Moral Law, the univerſal ruler and reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all intelligent beings, tends to maintain, continually, and reſtore, conſtantly, the equilibrium or moral harmony amongſt all intelligent beings.</p>
            <p n="58">58. As all organizations, involuntarily, endeavour, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally, to arrive at a phyſical equilibrium; ſo, all intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual faculties, reciprocally, try to attain the moral equilibrium among themſelves.</p>
            <p n="59">59. As there is, in all organized beings, a faculty or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which inclines them to an equilibrium; ſo, there exiſts, in intelligent beings, a faculty which prompts them to aim at a moral equilibrium.</p>
            <p n="60">60. The faculty or quality here conſidered, in intelligent beings, is conſcience. From it ariſes all involuntary motion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="63">63. <hi>Moral, Univerſal Electricity</hi> is the univerſal effort, which all conſcience exerts, to arrive at the moral, univerſal equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Moral, particular Magnetiſm is the moral equilibrium between certain intelligent beings, which tends to eſtabliſh the moral, particular law which rules over their conſcience.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Moral, particular Electricity is the involuntary effort, made by all conſcience of certain beings, to eſtabliſh, amongſt them, an equilibrium of the intelligencies and wills of thoſe beings.</p>
            <p n="66">66. There is a moral, particular Magnetiſm, a moral, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Electricity, exiſting between the individuals compoſing

            <p n="67">67. As, in the phyſical world, particular motions are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſalutary, when they agree with the univerſal motion; ſo, in the moral world, particular laws are only good, as far as they agree with the moral, univerſal law.</p>
            <p n="68">68. In continuing to diſplay the analogy ſubſiſting between the phyſical and moral laws, by which the world is governed, one might juſtly aſſert, that there is a moral Magnetiſm in intelligent beings, whenever a harmony and reciprocation, both of affections and habits are found amongſt them.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Likewiſe, that there is a moral Electricity between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent beings, whenever ſuch a harmony and reciprocity are wanting.</p>
            <p n="70">70. Moral, artificial Magnetiſm might be deemed a theory of means, invented to produce, among intelligent beings, a harmony and reciprocation of affections and habits. To that theory belong the political inſtitutions, and the various forms of education adopted by different people, in order to inſure the peace and happineſs of ſociety.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Moral, artificial Electricity might, likewiſe, be called the guilty effort, exerted by one or more individuals, to avert the affections and habits by which they are united to their equals, and accumulate them on themſelves. Thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds egotiſm, which is nothing elſe but a kind of moral inſulation.</p>
            <p n="72">72. As, if you ſuppoſe all bodies, moving in the ſame ſpace, to be ſuddenly inſulated, thence muſt, neceſſarily, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the diſſolution of the phyſical world; ſo, likewiſe, if you imagine all intelligencies, all wills ſuddenly inſulated by egot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, then muſt, abſolutely, enſue the diſſolution of the moral world.</p>
            <p n="73">73. As it is by the effect of phyſical, univerſal Magnetiſm that all beings are, or ought to become found; it is in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of moral, univerſal Magnetiſm, or the moral, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal law which moves all conſcience, that all beings are, or become good.</p>
            <p n="74">74. To know the law after which phyſical, univerſal Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netiſm is practiſed, and the theory of the proceedings which can either unfold or increaſe the energy of that law; is the ſole object of the art of preſerving and curing, or Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: ſo, likewiſe, to know the moral, univerſal law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which is produced the harmony of intelligent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and determine, in all circumſtances, the inſtitutions, the

            <p n="75">75. Since, as I have obſerved, the phyſical and moral laws of the world are ſo ordained and contrived, that, belonging to a ſingle plan, they terminate in a ſingle effect; whatever, in an organized being, prevents or averts the action of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical laws, ought to weaken, or render more difficult the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moral laws.</p>
            <p n="76">76. Man is both an intelligent and organized being; he is, conſequently, governed both by the phyſical and moral laws to which the world is ſubject.</p>

               <p>From Matter, in Motion, proceeds fluidity; and, from Matter, in Reſt, reſults ſolidity.</p>
               <p>If two or more contiguous parts of Matter are at reſt, from that ſtate reſults a combination.</p>
               <p>Combination is a ſtate relative, from reſt, to the motion of Matter.</p>

In ſuch relations alone conſiſts the proportion of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, forms, and qualities.</p>
               <p>Matter being only liable to different combinations, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have concerning numbers, or arithmetical quantities, may ſerve to give us an idea of the immenſity of the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of poſſibilities. Conſidering the various particles of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Matter as ſo many units, it is eaſy to conceive, that theſe units can be combined by 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. and that ſuch combinations may amount to an infinite number.</p>
               <p>The ſeveral reunions of thoſe unities conſtitute the firſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of combination. Then, conſidering theſe original com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations as new unities, we ſhall have as many different kinds of unities as there are poſſible numbers; and we ſhall ſtill be able to conceive the union of theſe unities together. If thoſe unions be compounded of unities of the ſame kind, they conſtitute the homogeneous Matter: If not, the hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous one.</p>
               <p>Every one of theſe new combinations being ſtill liable to be extended, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> we can eaſily conceive the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of poſſible combinations.</p>
               <p>Matter, ſtrictly ſpeaking, having of itſelf no quality, is indifferent to any combination; and the properties which it offers are only the reſult of various combinations.</p>
               <p>A quantity of Matter in a ſtate of combination, conſidered as forming a whole, is what we call a body.</p>
               <p>If, in the combination of the conſtituent parts of a body, there is ſuch an order, that, in conſequence of it, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults new effects or combinations, that whole is an organical body.</p>
               <p>A whole, in which ſuch order is not to be ſeen, is called, an inorganical body; though there is none ſo.</p>
               <p>That order is ſuſceptible of ſeveral degrees of perfection, from which ſpring the different degrees of organizations.</p>
               <p>If, in that order there is obſerved ſuch a perfection, that from it reſults, not only new effects, but even new combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame kind; that perfection of organization is called Mould.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the divers parts of Matter, as exiſting one without the other, we have then the idea of Place.</p>
               <p>A number of imaginary points, which are or can be filled up by Matter, determine the idea of Space.</p>
               <p>Whenever Matter changes place, and, ſucceſſively, occupies different points, that change is called Motion.</p>

               <p>A Tone is that kind or mode of determined motion, which the ſeveral parts have between them.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of oppoſite directions; by the one, the parts come near, and by the other, they draw back: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination is operated by the one; Diſſolution, by the other. All poſſible directions are compounded by thoſe two.</p>
               <p>The equality of motion, in thoſe two directions, prevents the different parts from drawing back, or coming near; they are, of courſe, neither in a ſtate of coheſion, nor in that of diſſolution; which conſtitutes the ſtate of perfect Fluidity.</p>
               <p>Combination or coheſion takes place, when the direction of the parts of motion is oppoſite, or the celerity towards the fame direction is unequal.</p>
               <p>The different ſorts of motion may be conſidered, either in the whole body, or in the conſtituent parts.</p>
               <p>The conſtituent parts of fluid Matter may be combined in all poſſible manners, and receive every kind of poſſible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them.</p>
               <p>All qualities, either of organical or inorganical bodies, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the manner according to which the parts are combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the motion of thoſe parts between them.</p>
               <p>A quantity of fluid put in motion, in one and the ſame direction, is called Current.</p>
               <p>If we ſuppoſe a Current, which, by inſinuating itſelf in a body, is divided into ſeveral ſmall currents, very ſlender, and in the form of a line; thoſe ſubdiviſions are termed, Very ſmall Tubes.</p>
               <p>When the elementary matter, either by oppoſite directions, or unequal celerities, puts itſelf at reſt, and acqures ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion; intervals or interſtices reſult from the manner accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which the ſeveral parts are combined.</p>
               <p>The interſtices of maſſes remain permeable to the currents or pores of ſubtile Matter.</p>
               <p>Every body, dipt in a fluid, yields to the motion of that fluid; whence it follows, that, if a body be in a current, it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:046381_0017_10215160661C60D0"/>is carried away in its direction; what never befalls a body yielding to many confuſed directions.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If a body moves from A to B, and the cauſe of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be in A, it is repulſion; if that cauſe were in B, it would be an attraction: But if, inſtead of being in one or the other, this cauſe is in C, it is an intermediate current in which that body is plunged, and the attraction or repulſion are only apparent.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of the apparent attraction or repulſion lies in the relative direction of the currents coming in and out.</p>
               <p>In a ſpace, where Matter admits of no vacuum, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt a current coming in, without one going out; and <hi>vice verſa.</hi>

               <p>Two particles at reſt form an obſtacle to the two channels of the currents which lead to them; theſe two channels, not being in the way to paſs directly, join the neigbouring channels, the motion of which they haſten; and that accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is in proportion to the ſcarcity and narrowneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſtices.</p>

               <p>Any round body falls off my table, rolls on my chair, falls on the floor. What happens in conſequence of it? Does it ſtand at reſt? No. Its motion meets with an obſtacle; it continues, it always exiſts; or, at leaſt, it loſes the motion of acceleration, to preſerve only that of it own gravitation. It has comunicated the former to the body which it has touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whence it has ſpread in the matter, and ſo far divided as to have become inſenſible.</p>
               <p>If there were no animate beings, it would be, perhaps, very eaſy to calculate the effect of all poſſible motions: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be thoſe of ſublunary bodies, or celeſtial ones, which all tend to a common centre of gravity: But, animate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings have particular motions, in the adopted ſyſtem of our days; that ſyſtem which conſiders Matter only as dead, or, in other words, paſſive.</p>
               <p>Man is not endowed with the power of diſcerning the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential attributes of things, and it is only through exiſtence and privation that we conceive any diſtinct idea of them. It is thus, by the idea of the night, that we conceive any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct idea of the day; and <hi>vice verſa:</hi> For, were we always to perceive the light, that continual perception could not be felt; at leaſt, we could neither be conſcious of it, nor able to give it any proper appellation.</p>
               <p>Through conſequence of this narrowneſs of our faculties, we are acquainted with Motion, only becauſe we know what Reſt is. We have ſeen ſome beings moving, and others at reſt, whence we have infered, that motion did not always exiſt.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that all animated beings which live on the ſurface of the Earth, ſhould knock with their feet at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; would they not produce an additional motion? a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which could not have been foreſeen, in the laws which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:046381_0021_1021516B9702B388"/>natural Philoſophers have laid down? That motion alſo tends towards the centre of the Earth. But where does it ſtop? Where is it to be anihilated?</p>
               <p>If animated matter can produce irregular motions, is not the centre, wherein thoſe motions end, to be animated itſelf; that it may be proportionate to thoſe anomalies, and ſo reſtore the equilibrium and force which are the preſervers of the world.</p>
               <p>I ſay more; it is not neceſſary to have any regard to the motion impreſt upon animate matter, to conclude that which we look upon as dead; for, even the globe of the Earth is animated: All weigh towards the centre of that globe but the gravitation is, in reality, nothing elſe but an impreſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards a determinate direction. Or, of two things, one muſt abſolutely follow; either, thoſe motions muſt be reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with new directions, from the centre of the Earth, or, they muſt be deſtroyed. But, if it be true in the art of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, the analogy or method of ſimplifying the principle, as much as poſſible, is to be conſidered as the ſureſt way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; we ſhall be authorized to think that Nature modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, alters, diſtributes, rather than deſtroys. Thus, as we acknowledge, in all organized bodies, a faculty which divides, diſtributes, and returns all thoſe motions, whoſe impreſſions they receive, or, rather, which are communicated to them; ſince we ſee that thoſe motions are never anihilated; why ſhould we imagine, in Nature, an incomprehenſible proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a ſecret quality, which we are not in want of? Why ſhould we imagine that it does not operate upon ſpheres, as well as upon individuals?</p>
               <p>If the known laws of heavineſs, communication of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. ſolely belong to dead matter, and animated mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can, arbitrarily, act upon it; all animated forces will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be troubleſome ones, and all will be in confuſion, in the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>But, if all matter be confidered as animated, then the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of the whole world will not be more extraordinary, than thoſe of the human body; whoſe beſt phyſiologiſts could not explain, a ſingle moment of exiſtence, if they did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an animated principle, the preſerver of it; and which, by laws unknown to us, compenſates all irregularities of paſſions and impreſſions.</p>
               <p>Now, without proceeding any farther in thoſe relations and analogies, the paths through which it would be a difficult taſk to purſue, let us only obſerve, that whatever can be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the centre of the action; as performing the function of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:046381_0022_1021516D2D1E6A40"/>receiving, diſtributing, and ſending back the motion; always ſeems to be productive of a more ſubtile matter, more elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, more unlike dead matter, more near to that which we conceive by animated matter.</p>
               <p>Let us, for example, only mention ſpermatic liquors, and the ſpirits which ſeem to come out of them to perfect the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, tranſpiration, emanations, thoſe currents eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the beings which lead us to imitation, and make us yield to ſtrange motions; ſuch as deſires, paſſions, fympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, antipathies, &amp;c. even Animal Electricity and Magnet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; which ſeem to be the great ocean from which ſprings out truly the animated matter.</p>
               <p>Nature thus leads us to a way of thinking which prevents us from believing, that the interior part of the globe is a grand receptacle of motion, and, conſequently, a grand centre of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. Since, in our principles, there are no anihilated mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what hinders us from thinking that both Electricity and Magnetiſm are the produce of that elaboration, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſecretions of the globe, the principles of that vaſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual's life, its correſpondence with all the world?</p>
               <p>Suppoſing that general correſpondence of motions well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, kept up by a ſubtile matter, more or leſs animated; ſhould we not, then, more eaſily explain the duration and equality of celeſtial motions? For, on one hand, it is a little repugnant to reaſon, to imagine an abſolute vacuum; and, on the other, every matter, however cloſely it may be kept, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the idea of a friction, and diminution of motion. Hence we ſhall find ourſelves greatly comforted, by an hypotheſis which ſhall ſhow the very cauſe of motion in the fluids, which ought to ſtop it; and the difference would proceed from this principle alone, that, inſtead of conſidering the ſpace as filled up with a dead and paſſive matter, we ſuppoſe it conſtantly traverſed by currents, which both keep up and preſerve the motion.</p>
               <p>The decompoſition of different parts of matter, extended through all ſpace, gives room to the unfolding and increaſing of that matter; which, being originally endowed with the faculty of receiving, is aſſimulated in conſequence of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive law; the molecules bearing analogy to them; and even Nature, herſelf, however extenſive, is but an immenſe laboratory, in which all operations ſucceed one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption.</p>
               <p>Every motion may be communicated to ſome parts of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and increaſe that which is proper to them; in conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:046381_0023_1021516FBB80CDA8"/>however, to the law given to it by the particular ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the body which receives it. Thence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that a motion is never given in the ſame manner it is received.</p>
               <p>Three blows, ſucceſſively given with a hammer, on a bell, a ſtone, or a mattraſs, will certainly produce three different effects; though the ſame inſtrument and the ſame ſtrength be employed on each of the bodies.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſolvent, employed to reduce too equal parts of different matter, will produce upon one a conſiderable effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence, whilſt the diviſion of the other operates with ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any appearance of motion; in conſequence of the difference that exiſts in the configuration of their parts.</p>
               <p>Therefore, the increaſing of motion, communicated by a man to a tree, in order to become a centre of motion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his phyſical aberrations, will be received by the tree, in its way, and returned from the tree to the man, who will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo return it in his own manner; on account of the particular properties of their different organs.</p>
               <p>Of all the magnetic actions (which, conſidered attentively, may be looked upon alſo as belonging to Electricity, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, but eſſentially univerſal) nothing repreſents a chain of motion more calm and gentle, and more relative to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the animal economy, than a healthy tree, in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time; becauſe, being continually placed in the ſphere of activity, which has operated its gradual growth, alimented by the ſame ground, and formed in the ſame manner, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral currents of the world operate upon it with equal efforts; ſo that it exiſts without any ſeeming perturbation. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects produced carry with them a ſtamp of the ſame character and criſis by which the diſcovery of illneſs is produced; by that mean it ſeldom extends beyond ſleeping; ſo that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are deprived of their other faculties, only yielding to the repairing action of Nature.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to conceive, that the action which ſhall proceed from this tree, being added to that which man is poſſeſſed of, will reeſtabliſh, in his being, the equilibrium; which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver interrupted, but by the decreaſing of motion, occaſioned by divers aberrations; and which, being attacked in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of their formations, ſhall be the more eaſily reſolved, and ſhall oppoſe leſs reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>After having demonſtrated, that from the combination of the different parts of matter proceeds a tone of motion, ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the animal economy, it is neceſſary to ſhow how
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:046381_0024_10215173230CC358"/>man is compoſed; a being ſo extenſive in his primitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, that he ſeems to have been born, merely to preſide over the other beings, which are all ſubmitted to him, who is edowed with the faculty of thinking, judging, &amp;c. and in whom are connected, as in a common centre, all motions of ſurrounding bodies; who acts again, in his turr, on the ſame bodies, with more or leſs energy, in conſequence of his will, and the natural tone of his organs.</p>
               <p>It is a long time ſince the law of the ſtrongeſt has been looked upon as the ſafeſt; though it is not always the moſt juſt: But it is now time to explain it according to the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the exception.</p>
               <p>Man, in a ſtate merely phyſical, like all other parts of matter, has the motion proper to his organization, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the general motion which he obeys in the ſtate of his ſuſpenſive intellectual faculties. Like them, he unfolds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, increaſes, declines; and finiſhes, by being reſtored to the general maſs, in order to be decompoſed: But, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his exiſtence depends on the harmonic parts forming his body, ſome of which may be vitiated. In that ſtate of illneſs he ſinds himſelf deprived of a proper portion of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which renders him inferior to man in health; he is not in equal affinity with all that ſurround him, nor acceſſable to the ſame external quantity of animal fluid.</p>
               <p>The more he advances, the more his equality of motion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes; his currents weaken; his humours increaſe; coheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is eſtabliſhed; want of harmony immediately takes place; and he dies.</p>
               <p>If the decreaſe of motion has produced that havoc, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of motion, analogous, communicated in time, might have overcome the firſt obſtacle; and the return of health might have been undoubtedly obtained.</p>
               <p>Of all the repairing motions of man, in a ſtate of illneſs, none ſeems to be more appropriated, than that which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from his like, in a ſtate of health; becauſe, coming from the focus communicated to him, it takes a proper direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the analogous character neceſſary for its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>The motion of man, in a ſtate of health, will be then powerful in conſequence of the other's weakneſs; but, that empire of ſtrength being only employed to eradicate illneſs, inſtead of oppreſſing the individual, that great function of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſhall be a ſituation more adapted for ſociety; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:046381_0025_10215174AE81BB30"/>men muſt be better by poſſeſſing the means to render themſelves happy.</p>
               <p>In order the better to unfold thoſe proceedings, I muſt be permitted to employ ſome compariſons, which perhaps may appear ſtrange, but which will tend to elucidate, phyſically, thoſe proceedings; by the exiſtence of a doubtleſs fluid, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly denied by many, becauſe they do not ſee it.</p>
               <p>The feruginous matters of the magnetic currents of the world, will acquire a property they had not before, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Magnets, or Loadſtones, by the mere operation of Nature.</p>
               <p>In many caſes, art can imitate Nature, and even ſurpaſs it. (As an authentication) an artificial Magnet is, ſpecifically, more active than a natural one.</p>
               <p>Nature, conſtant in her proceedings, by giving a magnetic virtue to a quantity of iron, does not determine its poles, but in the points which are diametrically oppoſite, and in the right line.</p>
               <p>It is natural to conclude, hence, that Nature has a uniform manner of acting; but, directed by the knowledge of man, ſhe is ſuſceptible of increaſing that power, and of concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by her ſtrength in a determined point.</p>
               <p>That there exiſts an inviſible fluid, from its action upon iron, is well demonſtrated. Is it to be ſuppoſed, that the Great and Supreme Architect of the world, in his ſhining and profound views, would have created the general currents which apparently rule the Univerſe, only to put in activity a part of Matter, called Iron; to form artificial Magnets, which, in their turn, ſhould be only empowered to inſtruct us how the tendency and reciprocity of the action of bodies, one towards the other are exerciſed; as has been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated?</p>
               <p>In that great hypotheſis, let us ſee if the parts of Matter are not formed in ſuch a manner, as to participate of the ſame advantages.</p>
               <p>Of metallic matters, united in a maſs in ſome places, or ſpread abroad therein, none is ſo much diffuſed as iron: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all bodies, ſubmitted to analogies, furniſh a quantity, more or leſs conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Vegetables contain ſome alſo; and it may be eſtabliſhed as a principle in animal fluid: A proof of which appears, in a certain quantity of it being extracted from blood. Iron en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the compoſition of man, and is combined in ſuch a
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:046381_0026_102151768494C678"/>manner, that ſome<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. II—, an Iriſh lady, in London, did, in 1786. before many ladies and gentlemen, move the needle of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Thence it is eaſy to conclude, that the general currents poſſeſs the quality of putting iron into action.</p>
               <p>Man, by his conſtitution, will be ſtrongly ſaturated with that matter, expoſed, in a regular manner, to the action of thoſe ſame currents; and ought to acquire more magnetic faculty, and, conſequently, more means to prevail over his like.</p>
               <p>In that circumſtance, the will of him who gives muſt be abſolute. It is that which more particularly determines the fluid to be directed, with vehemence, towards the extremities, whence it eſcapes; becauſe, in a motion which tends to make a vacuum, all contiguous parts are forced to accumulate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ear the place where it operates.</p>
               <p>From that principle, a ſick man may be in a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, compared to a ſteel bar; and is in that ſtate of imperfection, becauſe he has not received the magnetic ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And a wholeſome man, able to magnetiſe, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles an artificial magnet, the harmony being completely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; becauſe the regularity of its fibres, in which the magnetic effluvia is always accumulating, has determined the action upon it. Conſequently, to magnetiſe a man, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate a piece of ſteel with a magnetic power, is very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, in communicating the action of the ſame fluid; received according to the law of the different modifications of two different bodies.</p>
               <p>It will happen, for a time, that bodies acting will ceaſe to produce their effects upon the receiving one. That point of time, in the ſteel bar, is the period of the abſolute regularity of its fibres or pores, which ſhall produce the reciprocal equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>This circumſtance, being more or leſs diſtant, partakes of the nature of obſtacles in the place they occupy, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the antiquity of their exiſtence. Two wholeſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,

               <p>The ſame phenomenon takes place between two bars, weakly impregnated with a magnetic power. By ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening them, alternately, one by the other, their power is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly increaſed.</p>
               <p>There exiſt many ways of magnetiſing, which ought all to be ſubordina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Experience alone can enable us to make a juſt application of them; and I repeat it, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence is very dangerous<note n="*" place="bottom">I would never adviſe a trial to put people, who are in good health, into a criſis, to pleaſe others; for you my put them into a ſtate of catalepſy, and they may never be cured.</note>. In ſuch a caſe, power united with ignorance may be truly compared to a loaded piſtol in the hands of a child.</p>
               <p>Action and reaction are commonly more ſenſible at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſtance, than in too near a poſition; becauſe that reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal ſenſations are confounded, and have no diſtinctive cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, whilſt paſſing through the medium of the ſurrounding fluid, of which all the molecules are elaſtic: Thoſe ſerving as conductors to actions, act again in proportion to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles intended to be overcome.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes happens, that though the exiſtence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be evidently demonſtrated, by certain, unequivocal ſigns; yet the action of the univerſal agent, in its immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, is inſenſible to the patient.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a caſe we ought to think, that this fluid impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly paſſes on the local vice; becauſe of the obſtacles being too ancient, and, conſequently, in a ſtate of too conſiderable coheſion: That the maſs of the fluid molecules, exiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the patient and the magnetiſer, is not ſtrong enough, in proprtion to the reſiſtance of coheſion to be overcome. Then, after having been in communication with the patient, by touching, one directs the extermities of the hands over the parts which are ſuppoſed to be affected.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation, with ſome degree of attention to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſenſations, one muſt feel, at the extremities of his fingers, a reaction of heat, or cold, or ſupineneſs; which ſhall give
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:046381_0028_1021517D5D952690"/>notice, to the operator, of the effect produced, of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſeat of reaction, and diſtance he muſt be at, to operate with the greateſt effect; by drawing back, as he feels the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of action, and advancing near the point of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or effort, when he feels the diminution of the action. This phenomenon is produced, merely becauſe at that diſtance there exiſts, between the magnetiſed and magnetiſer, a ſufficient co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of fluid, put into vibration by the combination of the action and the abſolute <hi>will</hi> of the magnetiſer; which, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting and accumulating all fluid molecules in the ſame point, determines, in this circumſtance, all the patient's ſenſations. This mode of operating ſtill reunites the advantages of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, and changing, at pleaſure, the centre of activity, when it is peceptible that, by mean of reaction, it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſtronger perturbation; which it is always material to avoid. A compariſon will form an ample elucidation, on the diverſity of diſtances.</p>
               <p>A gun, loaded with a ball, fired, within twenty yards, at a piece of timber of a certain thickneſs (this is only an <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical datum,</hi> which is to be conſidered as a mere relative) ſhall not, at ſuch a diſtance, produce the ſame effect, as at the ſpace of, or within fifty; becauſe the ball ſhall not have acquired, in the former caſe, the degree of celerity impreſt on it by the reſiſtance of the column of air, which it, as with velocity, paſſed in the fifty yards: But, beſides, after the diſtance wherein is produced the greateſt effort of the ball, whatever it paſſes over diminiſhes the more its celerity; and its effects have a certain term, and will, in the end, equal that of the former diſtance.</p>
               <p>From all that has been ſaid, I muſt conclude, that motion is the principle of the permanent exiſtence of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>From the combination of many partial motions, the reſult is a more conſiderable one.</p>
               <p>Animated bodies are particular centres of motion; but ſome of them, like vegetable ones, are dependant on gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions.</p>
               <p>That man may, according to his pleaſure, contradict, or appropriate to himſelf thoſe different kinds of motion, to a certain degree: That he may, legally, either increaſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them in a determined point. That bodies act and react upon each other.

               <p>The pupil muſt not think, from what has been ſuperficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, that it follows, he may, without danger, yield to the practice of this ſcience. That matter is too extenſive, not to require a deep diſcernment, and ſound ſtudy.</p>
               <p>The honeſt man, actuated with the deſire of relieving his fellowcreature, will be ſenſible, that, previous to his yielding to the impulſe of his own heart, he muſt dedicate ſome time to obſerve, with patience, the effects of the fluid which he is poſſeſſed of; and ſtill more, the method of tempering its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in difficult occurrences.

            <p>THERE is an univerſal fluid, which fills all ſpace. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body is endowed with a certain quantity of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric fluid. There exiſts an attraction or ſympathy, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between animated bodies. The univerſal currents of the univerſal fluid, are the cauſe and exiſtence of bodies. One may accelerate thoſe currents in a body, and produce <hi>Criſes</hi> and <hi>Somnambuliſm;</hi> which is done by acting reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon one another, by increaſing the currents going acroſs their interſtices or pores: in conſequence of the <hi>abſolute will</hi> of the operator.</p>
            <p>As there exiſts a general, and reciprocal gravitation of all celeſtial bodies towards each other; ſo there exiſts a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and reciprocal gravitation of the conſtituent parts of the Earth towards the whole, and of that whole towards each of its parts.</p>
            <p>That reciprocal action of all thoſe bodies is operated by an imperceptible <hi>vapour,</hi> flowing in and out, as you ſee in a Loadſtone, or artincial Magnet, forming an outſide atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere: It alſo produces currents, in a more or leſs direct manner, according to the analogy of bodies. That body, which can act moſt effectuall; on a ſickly man, is one, who is in a good ſtate of health, and of a ſimilar conſtitution. The power of man in a good ſtate of health will then be greater, in conſequence of the other's weakneſs; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more than he gives. It will increaſe the circulation, and produce beneficial effects.</p>

The reſpective poſition of two beings, acting on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is not indifferent. To judge what that poſition ſhould be, we ought to conſider each being as a whole, compounded of different parts; of which each poſſeſſes a form, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tonical movement. It is, of courſe, by that mean eaſily underſtood, that two beings have over each other the greateſt influence poſſible, when they are ſo placed that their analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gous parts act, on one another, in the moſt harmonical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is neceſſary that the perſon who ſubmits to be treated is willing, as well as that the operator's mind <hi>muſt be abſolute,</hi> and think of nothing but the different ſenſations he then ſeels. <hi>Credite, and V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, in order that two perſons may act on each other in the ſtrongeſt manner poſſible, they muſt be placed oppoſite each other. From <hi>north</hi> to <hi>ſouth</hi> is the beſt. You may treat in other directions, according to your <hi>idea</hi> and circumſtances. In that oppoſite poſition your <hi>atmoſpheres</hi> are joining; and you may be conſidered as forming but one whole, acting in an harmonic manner. When man ſuffers, all the action of life is directed towards him, in order to deſtroy the cauſe of ſuffering; likewiſe, when two perſons are acting on each other, the whole power of that union acts on the diſordered parts, with a force proportioned to the increaſe of the maſs. It may, therefore, be in general aſſerted, that the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, &amp;c. increaſes in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the maſſes.</p>
            <p>It is poſſible to direct the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, &amp;c. more particularly on any individual part, by fixing your <hi>idea,</hi> and directing the fluid upon the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our arms may be conſidered as conductors to the animal fluid, and ſerve to attract or repel, according to our <hi>will,</hi> and eſtabliſh a kind of continuity between bodies. It follows, from what has been ſaid on the moſt advantageous poſition of two beings, acting on each other in order to maintain the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many of the whole; that one ought to touch the right part with the left arm, and the right foot in contact with the left, &amp;c. In that poſition you are in affinity with your patient; your two <hi>atmoſpheres</hi> are joined: It ſhows the oppoſition of poles in the human body, which are nearly the ſame as thoſe which may be obſerved in the Loadſtone, or Artificial Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.</p>
            <p>Paracelſus, as well as many other anatomiſts, have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted poles in man. Mr. George Adams, in his Treatiſe on
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:046381_0032_1021518992909040"/>Magnetiſm, juſtly ſays, <q>In ſome future period it may be diſcovered, that moſt bodies are poſſeſſed of a polarity, as well as one direction relative to the various affinity of the elements of which they are compounded.</q> The better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man as divided into two parts, by a line drawn from the top to the <hi>pubis.</hi> All the joints of the left part may be conſidered as poles, oppoſite to thoſe correſponding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. The fluid paſſes out more ſenſibly, and in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance from the extremities; as thoſe extremities are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as poles oppoſite to the right, and are the beſt conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the animal fluid.</p>
            <p>You may give polarity to animate and inanimate bodies; that is to ſay, to increaſe an action to a degree which they had not before, only by a friction, very nearly reſembling that which you give to a piece of ſteel, before it becomes a Magnet; except that it will not be ſo palpable. You may alſo change the poles in the human body, pretty nearly the ſame as you change thoſe of a Magnet. You may alſo ſtrengthen or increaſe the action of Animal Electricity and Magnetiſm, by animate and inanimate bodies, as you increaſe the action of an artificial Magnet, by adding more Magnets; provided the poles are contrary: Therefore, every thing is filled in the Univerſe by means of an univerſal fluid, in which all bodies are immerſed; and, conſequently, all beings touch one another, in conſequence of the continual circulation by which the currents of the magnetic fluid flow out and paſs in. In conſequence of this, you may affect a perſon at a diſtance; provided he be of a weak habit of body, and has been in a <hi>criſis</hi> before you put the column of air into vibration, which exiſts between the perſon you treat and yourſelf: That will affect him, as is ſeen at a concert in Weſtminſter Abbey, or other places.</p>
            <p>In order to be in affinity or harmony with your patients you muſt touch him by the hand. As there is a circulation which forms itſelf between you and him, and tends to an equilibrium, it is generally, by that mean, eaſier to take your patient out of his <hi>criſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You next hold up both your hands parallel to the <hi>bead,</hi> and bring them gently down as far as the <hi>pubis:</hi> You may follow the direction of the nerves. Then ſix you hands upon the <hi>diaphragm</hi> or <hi>ſtomach,</hi> where lies the greateſt abundance of nerves. You may put your thumbs upon the <hi>plexus,</hi> and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:046381_0033_1021518B549B0258"/>put the nerves in motion. You may alſo ſix one hand upon the ſtomach, and draw the other towards you: By that mean you attract, or repel at pleaſure. There are various ways of manipulation, which the operator makes uſe of according to circumſtances. If you wiſh to procure <hi>ſleep,</hi> ſoon change your poſition; get either to the right or left ſide of your patient. In that poſition, you ſix one of your hands <hi>before</hi> the head, and the other, <hi>behind.</hi> Keep them there, with all your might, till you ſeel ſome heat in the palms. If the perſon is not inclined to ſleep, you muſt charge the head in different direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by ſhutting your hands, as if you were boxing; then you open them quick; and this you repeat often. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then ſeels a drowſineſs. You muſt keep your hands in oppoſition, as before. By thoſe means the animal fluid gets into the abſorbent veſſels; acts alſo upon the nerves; which ſtimulates the body, and produces a <hi>criſis.</hi> If you ſee the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient too much agitated, get oppoſite to him, and bring both your hands downwards, from head to foot, or, as if you were to fan a perſon; and, getting backwards, it will compoſe him.</p>
            <p>Then you ſeek for the cauſe and place of the illneſs; or, you hold the perſon's hand, and aſk him where he ſeels pain; as it is increaſed by treating. If he does not anſwer your queſtions properly, it is a ſign he is not in a perfect ſtate of <hi>Somnambuliſm.</hi> You muſt keep him aſleep longer, without ſpeaking to him.</p>
            <p>You then ſeek for the ſeat of the diſeaſe, by extending your hands at a little diſtance from his body, beginning from head to foot. If your ſenſations are good, you may, with a little attention, ſeel within yourſelf, pains, in the ſame part in which the patient is affected: Or you may ſeel, at the ends of your fingers, a heat, if it is an inflamation, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. If you feel a coldneſs, it is in the lymphatic veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. If billious, you ſeel a numbneſs; and many other ways, which different conſtitutions ſeel.</p>
            <p>Either of theſe circumſtances will inform you where the diſeaſe lies: But, by touching, which is the ſureſt way, you ſoon become certain of the ſeat and cauſe of the diſeaſe; which ſometimes lies in the ſide oppoſite to the pain, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in nervous affections, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>You may touch, if you like, the cauſe of the diſeaſe, or charge it, as you do the head: by thoſe means you keep up the ſymptomatical pain, till you have rendered it critical;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:046381_0034_1021518D4E0222C8"/>you ſecond the effort of Nature againſt the cauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and act like a ſtimulus; which will produce a ſalutary <hi>criſis,</hi> by putting the whole frame in action; which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any diſeaſe proceeding from obſtruction, &amp;c. After this the patient finds himſelf compoſed, and the cauſe of the diſorder diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>When the patient is aſleep, you aſk him if it is time to take him out of it. If he anſwer, Yes; draw your hands towards his head, down to the feet, and rub the eyes with your thumbs ſeveral times; and wave your hands, as if fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a perſon who is too hot. You get, by degrees, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, till he is recovered.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The ſeat of thoſe diſeaſes is generally in the <hi>viſcera;</hi> as, the <hi>inteſtines,</hi> the <hi>ſpleen,</hi> the <hi>liver,</hi> the <hi>epiploon, meſentery,</hi> the <hi>loins,</hi> &amp;c. In women, the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> the <hi>womb,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or obſtructions are an impediment in the circulation of one part, which preſſes on the blood or lymphatic veſſels, and on the nerves; which produces thoſe ſpaſms, becauſe the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id circulates ſlowly. For that reaſon, thoſe perſons are the ſooneſt affected, and put into a <hi>criſis,</hi> when they are labouring under thoſe maladies. If thoſe veſſels preſs upon the root of a nerve, the motion and ſenſibility of the correſponding parts are quite ſuppreſſed; as in an apoplexy, palſy, &amp;c. There are no better conductors for the animal fluid, than the nerves; as they are ſpread all over the body. They abound more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the diaphragm, ſtomatical and ombelical <hi>plexus;</hi> where lie the roots of the nerves, which extend their branches (as a tree does its branches and roots in the Earth) all over the body.</p>
            <p>Many philoſophers have thought, that in them the ſoul lies. It is through them that the <hi>Somnambules</hi> ſee in the dark, when their eyes are ſhut. When you treat a perſon, you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as much as poſſible, the direction of the nerves. You may treat at a ſmall diſtance, and fix your hand upon the part affected; and, by motion, you put the column of air (exiſting between you and the patient) into vibration; which will cauſe an irritation, and produce a <hi>criſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many profeſſors make uſe of conductors, either glaſs, ſteel, ſilver, or gold, about eight inches long. They have a good
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046381_0035_10215193CD332680"/>effect in ſome caſes. All this proceeds from the idea of the operator. Mr. Meſmer tells us, <q>When you make uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conductors, you muſt magnetiſe from right to right;</q> that is, the poles are changed. I have repeatedly produced the ſame effect, by treating from left to left; except when I have put a perſon into ſleep, without a conductor. If, while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep, I magnetiſed them from right to right, ſome have gone into a <hi>criſis;</hi> others have awaked. If you touch the forehead with your right hand, you muſt put your left in oppoſition behind; and in the ſame manner to any other part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; becauſe there is a reaction of fluid, from one pole to the other. like a Magnet. As Dr. Meſmer repreſents the human body as a Magnet; if you eſtabliſh the north to the right the left becomes the fourth, and the middle, like the equator which is without predominant action. I repeat it; It is moſt advantageous to be oppoſite the perſon you want to treat, it order to cure him effectually.</p>
            <p>Curing conſiſts in reeſtabliſhing the diſturbed harmony. The general remedy is the application of the animal fluid, which ſerves to reeſtabliſh the equilibrium which is loſt in ſome part of the body.</p>
            <p>As there is but one diſeaſe, there is but one remedy. If motion is diminiſhed, it ought to be increaſed: If there is too great irritability, it ought to be decreaſed. As it is on ſolid bodies that this fluid operates, particularly on our <hi>viſcera,</hi> in order to rectify them; as they are deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by Nature, to prepare, to diſſolve, and aſſimulate ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are few remedies, taken internally, which are good; becauſe, when received into the ſtomach and the firſt paſſages, they experience the ſame elaboration as our aliments; the parts of which, analogous to our humours, are aſſimulated there by chylification; and the heterogeneous particles are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the means of excretions. Thoſe remedies, which may be given, will often prove to have effects contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>If treating is not ſufficient to produce vomiting, in the caſe of a perſon who has too much putridity, or abundance of bile which has been too long ſtanding; then a gentle eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic is to be given; or magneſia, if there is too much acid. If alkali is predominant, order a ſolution of ſoluble tartar, or other acid which you think will agree with your patient. In caſe of a violent cholic and coſtiveneſs, or ſore throat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are the beſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the general remedies which ought to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to the patients; as I am ſure that all thoſe preparations of minerals, &amp;c. which we ſee in an apothecary's ſhop, were never intended by Nature for the human body. Modern phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have, from an interreſted view, neglected the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the vegetable kingdom, more adapted by Providence for the human body.</p>
            <p>The diet of the patient is whatever Nature points out to him. She dictates what every man ought to follow; becauſe ſhe ſeldom deceives us in our manner of living. It is not what we eat, nor the quantity, which does good: It is what we digeſt.</p>
            <p>Animals, by inſtinct, will never touch any thing, but what Nature has dictated to them. In this, their inſtinct is far ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to our reaſon.</p>
            <p>Spirituous liquors are forbidden; ſtrong, green tea, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out milk; coffee; hot aliments, and the uſe of ſnuff; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it irritates the pituirary membranes in the throat, the ſtomach, and the head; and will produce criſpation, and irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>The uſual drink may be, water with a bit of toaſt in it; wine and water, or good, rich wine; old ſmallbeer; good porter; lemonade, or different ſyrups: All theſe may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, according to the caſe of the patient.</p>
            <p>The eating may be, good broth, either of beef, mutton, or veal; chicken, boiled; and roaſted meat. Avoid any ſalt or fat meat. Make uſe of any fallads, good, ripe fruits, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Gentle exerciſe in an open air, either riding or walking; and cold or warm baths are moſt excellent. The drinking of ſome mineral waters is good.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, gather round him as many healthy perſons as you can: Make them rub their hands well; then make them hold one another, and communicate to the patient. This is what I call, Forming a chain. By that you communicate to him the animal fluid, which will vivify him, if he is too much debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated. You may ſeat him upon an inſulated ſtool, as when you electrify a perſon. You may ſeat him upon a chair, and make a healthy perſon ſit upon the ſame chair; back to back. You may magnetiſe a tree in a garden: You may have one in your room, or a ſmall reſervoir. There are various ways, which depend upon the idea of the magnetiſer.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral ways of treating and curing. For that effect, much attention and prudence is required; and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, willing to do good to his fellowereatures who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under any infirmities, will never treat his patients in public, nor make them walk in their ſleep, or do many other things. Theſe things may convince many incredulous people of the effects; but cannot do good to the patient. I will ſay alſo, that a perſon cannot treat more than two or three pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in a day, to do them juſtice; and thoſe who do treat more, ſeldom cure by magnetiſing alone. The patients may fancy they have been cured; but, if they had not been ſo treated, they might alſo have been well. As their treatments are long, Nature operates and is a better doctreſs.</p>
            <p>There are ſome who will firmly aſſure you, that they have cured people at the diſtance of two or three hundred miles off, without ever having ſeen the patients, or putting them into <hi>criſes.</hi> I will anſwer them. They are either fools or mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Their imaginations being heated with this idea, they are like viſionaries.</p>
            <p>I knew an ingenious phyſician, who ſaw every body with the yellow jaundice; and another, who thought every body had a <hi>virus</hi> in the blood, and treated all his patients, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>gallicus morbis;</hi> and another, who pretended to cure every body, only by looking at them: All theſe are ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of inſanity.</p>
            <p>I knew ſeveral perſons, who ſuppoſed I had been treating them after I had left their houſes. They fell aſleep, ſome twenty miles off; and they have related this, as a fact, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their friends; while I was amuſing myſelf, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:046381_0038_10215198E80D4BC0"/>thought of them. And ſuppoſe I had been treating them, and they, by chance, had fallen aſleep, I could not, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, relate the ſtory as a fact; becauſe, to hold good, it muſt be often repeated.</p>
            <p>I never reſt my judgement upon a ſingle experiment. In experimental philoſophy facts are ſtubborn, and no one can contradict them when repeated.</p>
            <div type="section">

               <p>IF you have a patient who has a headach; you ſeat him in a chair, the back towards the north, or otherwiſe; you ſit oppoſite to him; you put yourſelf in affinity with him, as I have before obſerved; you draw the general cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, following the direction of the nerves; you hold your hands the ſame as if you were to hold a pen; and you ſeek for the cauſe of the pain, which may be in different parts. Perhaps the patient will tell you, if you cannot find it. If it is a <hi>Hemicrania,</hi> which is owing to the foulneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ach, you fix your eyes upon your left hand, which you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect towards the ſtomach with your right hand, and do the ſame as if you were to turn a pancacke. This you repeat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times; which ſtirs the atmoſphere, relaxes the ſtomach, and makes him vomit. You may give a little warm water to promote your operation. You may alſo treat the head, by drawing the fluid downwards. If the pain has been of long ſtanding, you may order a vomit, or a gentle purge; treat him every day; and afterward order bitters to ſtrengthen the ſtomach.</p>
               <p>There are different headachs; as, the <hi>Cephalagia,</hi> when the head is affected ſlightly in one part. <hi>Cephaloea</hi> is when the whole head is affected: One ſide only is called, <hi>Hemicrania;</hi> and a ſmall ſpot affected is called, <hi>Clavis Hiſtericus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe various headachs ariſe from different cauſes. If it proceeds from obſtructions, a <hi>Criſis</hi> is very ſalutary; as it puts the whole body into motion, and will remove the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Treating the part which you think affected is very neceſſary. You do this with one hand or both, by drawing your hands towards you ſeveral times, as before. To treat the head, you may apply your hands upon the temples, and put your thumbs upon the frontal <hi>Sinus;</hi> which will often remove it.</p>

               <p>IF the want of hearing proceed from a fault in the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ear, there is no cure. If it proceed from cold, ſever, hard wax, or dryneſs, you may magnetiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my principles. You keep yourſelf within a yard or two, according as you feel a reaction. <hi>[Vide the firſt part.]</hi> You then fix you left hand toward the ear, and move your right, open, and bring it towards the left hand; and do the ſame as if you were to clap your hands. By that mean you put the air into vibration; and, guided by your left hand as a conductor, you apply the palm of the hand upon the ear; or you may put your thumb in the ear, and, with your other finger, as you hold a pinch of ſnuff, preſs the thumb toward the ear; by which you accelerate the fluid into it. You may make uſe of a conductor, either glaſs or artificial magnet, and put it into the ear, and preſs, with two fingers, from the baſis towards the ear. You may magnetiſe the head, by drawing the fluid towards you.</p>
               <p>All theſe means you are to make uſe of, according to your ſenſations and judgment.</p>
               <p>Sometimes an injection, made of Caſtile ſoap, warm bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and water, will aſſiſt your operation.</p>

You treat the cauſe, alſo the eyes, by fixing your thumbs oppoſite; with the index you preſs the ſluid into the eyes; you move your thumb oppoſite to you, and may rub the eyes gently; and drop magnetiſed water into them with a quill.

               <p>I ſhall explain the beſt manner of treating. You muſt firſt know the cauſe which you treat; afterwards, applying your thumbs gently on the eyes, you rub them often. You then fix your thumb, with the next finger, at a diſtance from the eye. But I have bad ſucceſs, in ſome caſes of this kind, by making uſe of an artificial Magnet, fixing it at the diſtance of half an inch from the eye: It has, by that mean, remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Spots,</hi> and <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> proceeding from the compreſſion of the nerves by ſuperfluous humours.

               <p>In thoſe caſes you treat according to the rules; then you touch the head on the top.

               <p>To magnetiſe, or treat a perſon at a diſtance is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The manners which ſeveral profeſſors make uſe of are different.

               <p>The famous <hi>Bleton,</hi> called the <hi>Sourcier,</hi> or <hi>Spring finder,</hi> whenever he walked upon ground where there was a vein of water, felt, within himſelf, a certain ſenſation which gave him notice thereof. I knew another countryman, who ſhook whereever there was water; in conſequence of the elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, electric, or magnetic fire paſſing through the pores of the Earth; which gave him that ſenſation.</p>

               <head>Of the Criſes.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Criſes</hi> are an effort of Nature againſt the diſorder, endeavouring to diſſipate the obſtacles which are in the circulation, and to reſtore harmony or equilibrium to all parts of the body. Few diſeaſes can be cured without a <hi>Criſis,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when they proceed from obſtructions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of <hi>Criſes.</hi> The <hi>natural,</hi> which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Nature alone, gets rid of what offends her, by an increaſe of movement, producing <hi>vomitting, motion, perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the moſt ſalutary, as Nature acts ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without violence, and expels the obſtacles which impede circulation; by moving gently the <hi>molecules</hi> which form thoſe impediments, and go off by perſpiration, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>forced,</hi> is ſometimes ſalutary in <hi>obſtructions, windy,</hi> and <hi>bilious complaints.</hi> Theſe are produced, when Nature is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to expel what offends her. The uſe of Animal Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity and Magnetiſm puts the whole body in action, and, in conjunction with her, acts efficiouſly on the patient, who receives benefit and eaſe; particularly if it has produced eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, &amp;c. There are various means of producing them, according to the ſubject, and the cauſe of his diſeaſe. Some ſay there are ſix degrees of <hi>Criſes.</hi> I ſay there are as many, as there are different conſtitutions to treat. Some, will alſo call it <hi>luminous Criſis,</hi> from that new ſect called the <hi>Illuminated.</hi> All theſe are imaginary.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe you have a patient on whom you would wiſh to produce a gentle <hi>Criſis;</hi> you muſt put yourſelf in affinity; then put one hand behind the head, and the other before, till the perſon is aſleep. If he be agitated, calm him, by drawing the fluid downwards from the head. If you treat the cauſe by touching, it will increaſe the pain. If you put your thumb upon the <hi>frontal ſinus,</hi> he will fall into a <hi>Criſis.</hi> You may magnetiſe your watch, and ſhow him the time of day, he will go into it. Magnetiſe a flower, and give him a ſmell, he will fall in. Magnetiſe a harpſicord, as ſoon as you play on it he will go in. Magnetiſe a perſon between you and the patient, which will put him in. Magnetiſe a pond, make the patient ſtand on the ſide oppoſite to you, and hold a ſtick in his hand to touch the water; you muſt alſo touch the water with your magnetiſed conductor: the perſon will go into a <hi>Criſis</hi> immediately. Have ſomebody behind him, to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:046381_0051_102151BC027FFFD8"/>prevent his falling into the water: it is the beſt conductor of animal fluid. Make a perſon read, be behind him, and magnetiſe the lines as he reads, he will go in. Place the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient behind you, oppoſite a lookingglaſs, that you may ſee him, and magnetiſe, with a conductor, the figure in the glaſs. The reaction of the fluid will produce a <hi>Criſis.</hi> Magnetiſe a tree in a walk, as ſoon as the patient comes near it, he will fall into a <hi>Criſis.</hi> A perſon may be put in a <hi>Criſis,</hi> through a door, from one room to another; and in fact, an ingenious obſerver may, by what I have related, make a great many curious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments; provided he has <hi>proper ſubjects.</hi>

               <head>Of Somnambuliſm.</head>
               <p>IN my little eſſay on <hi>Somnambuliſm,</hi> I have ſaid, that it was a ſtate between ſleeping and waking, partaking of both. The patient is a <hi>Somnambule,</hi> when he can do the ſame as if he were awake. Theſe natural <hi>Somnambules,</hi> who get up at night, and do many wonderful things, are well demonſtrated. They are diſeaſes, and may be cured by treating. The <hi>magnetic Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambules,</hi> are thoſe, whom art has found out a mean of obſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing or ſuſpending ſome of the external ſenſes of for a while; and the patient eats, and drinks; goes up and down; plays upon the harpſicord; and does many things which you deſire him; provided he be willing. The firſt I ſaw was at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de <hi>Puyſegur</hi>'s, in the year 1784: and all thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to it, in this country before, were impoſtors, and none of them had yet dreamt of it; and for all this, we are indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Dr. <hi>Meſmer.</hi> Whenever any perſon has a real <hi>Somnambule,</hi> which is very eaſy, by care he has a treaſure. They are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, <hi>Malades Medecins;</hi> or ſick Phyſicians. Theſe beings ſee in the dark, and go through an external atmoſphere, the ſame as a glow worm. They have, beſides, an internal atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, which they make uſe of to perceive objects preſent, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, viſible, and inviſible. I have had ſeveral who related to me, what they could perceive. All of them differ, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects, according to their conſtitutions. One muſt not always depend upon what they ſay, on account of their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes. You may make them move in any direction, <hi>by your will</hi> alone; or by moving your conductor any way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the floor, they will follow its directions. You may make them play on any inſtrument they can; they will read, write,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:046381_0052_102151BE194EA340"/>and work: all theſe they will do better than if awake. Being deprived of their other faculties, they become ſtronger. No phyſician can tell the diſeaſe of a perſon better than a real <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nambule.</hi> They ſeldom fail to tell unknown perſons their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and preſcribe for them.</p>
               <p>At a future time, when the Science is better eſtabliſhed, I ſhall publiſh a full account of the theory of <hi>Somnambuliſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some will accuſe me of having ſaid too much; but thoſe who know me perſonally, will never accuſe me of relating any thing which I cannot demonſtrate; and thoſe who repeat theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous narrations, hurt themſelves and the ſcience, in the eyes of really learned men. Thoſe ſtories, like traditions, which are handed down from generation to generation, and become improbable; like antiquity, loſe their former luſtre. I would adviſe my pupils to try thoſe experiments I have ſhewn them firſt, and try the others afterward.</p>

               <head>To make an electric, or magnetical Apparatus.</head>
               <p>I SHALL not give you a full account of the <hi>Apparatus</hi> of our ſociety in <hi>Paris.</hi> It is more like a grove. Mine, which I had in <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> is a large oak tub, eight feet in diameter, well pitched in the inſide, about an inch thick, (that belonging to our ſociety, has lookingglaſſes all round it), in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulated upon four glaſs feet, bottles of water well corked; you magnetiſe the bottles, and lay them down, the neck of one in the bottom of the other all round; ſo that the laſt comes to the centre. You may fill up the ſpace with broken bottles, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifiable matter, brimſtone, or reſinous matter, minerals, &amp;c. Fill it up all but ſix inches; put ſome loadſtones and artificial magnets in different directions; then cover the whole, to the edge, with fine, dry, river ſand—put the lead over; place in the middle a poliſhed iron bar about eight feet high, with ſprigs to it, to attract the univerſal fluid which concentres itſelf in the reſervoir. At the far corner place an <hi>Arbor Vitoe</hi> in a box; and place under it a ſtrong magnet; the north pole upwards; the ſouth pole is fixed in a hole upon the cover; by that mean you increaſe the motion of the tree, and, becoming vegetaliſed, it will grow without water. You make holes all round about, eighteen inches diſtant, put iron or braſs conductors behind, ſo as to touch the patients who come next to it. Connect a chain of an electric machine; inſulate your patients, and make them hold hands; it will increaſe the action in them. You may treat
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:046381_0053_102151C367528740"/>them in that manner; you will the ſooner put them into <hi>Criſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I have had all my patients, round my reſervoir, in a <hi>Criſis</hi> at a time. I could not attend them. You may have a tree in a box, upon inſulated feet; have a ſmall box, filled with vitriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able matter, and fill it with water; you may make uſe of a large bottle, filled with water only, and connect a chain to it. All this apparatus may be made differently, according to your idea.</p>
               <p>To magnetiſe a tree, you muſt ſtand facing the north; you muſt have a conductor, which you have magnetiſed. You muſt point it from the top of the higheſt branches to the roots; do the ſame from the other branches. If the tree is ſo large that you cannot ſee the branches on the other ſide, change your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, from ſouth to north, and do the ſame. Then approach the tree, claſp your hands round it, and ſtay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> that poſition five minutes: your tree becomes magnetiſed. Any patient, who has been in a <hi>Criſis,</hi> or <hi>Somnambuliſm,</hi> will diſtinguiſh it. Some will go into a <hi>Criſis</hi> as ſoon as they come near it; others, if they are in <hi>Somnambuliſm,</hi> will diſcover it among the reſt.</p>
               <p>You may magnetiſe a myrtle, or any other ſhrub: it will appear luminous in the dark. You may magnetiſe a flower, by putting your thumbs in the middle, and eſtabliſhing an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; then, drawing your thumbs to the extremities, you preſs your thumb with the next finger, and you throw the fluid upon the flower. It will appear luminous in the dark. By giving it to a perſon to ſmell, who has been in a <hi>Criſis</hi> before, he will go into one again.</p>
               <p>To magnetiſe a conductor or a cane, put your hands in the middle of it; ſlide your hands to the extremities; your thumbs at the top, and rub the extremities with them. By theſe means you will impregnate it with an electrical fluid, that ſeems lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous in the dark, and as ſulphurous as the electric rubbing.</p>
               <p>To magnetiſe a ſhilling, or a guinea, put your thumbs in the middle, and draw them to the extremities: it will appear as a ball of fire. A watch is magnetiſed in the ſame manner, by drawing your two thumbs at the top, and your index under it. Eſtabliſh an equator, and draw your fingers to the two poles. By ſhewing it to a perſon who has already been in a <hi>Criſis,</hi> he will fall into one again. They can tell you what o'clock it is in the dark. If aſleep, they can tell you the ſame, by ſhewing a watch.</p>
               <p>To magnetiſe a harpſicord, fix your hands ſpread on the middle, and draw them towards the extremities: then rub the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:046381_0054_102151C5C437BE10"/>end you touch the ſtrings with, one after another, in the ſame manner. By that mean you will impregnate it with an electric fluid. As ſoon as a perſon plays upon the harpſicord, make your patient touch it with his hand or finger: he will fall into a <hi>Criſis</hi> immediately.</p>
               <p>To magnetiſe a room, or a bed is the ſame. Set it to the north, facing the ſouth; point your conductor up to the ceiling; bring it down towards you. Point it to the weſt and eaſt, and bring it alſo to your feet: the room will appear all luminons, and the bed alſo.</p>
               <p>A pond may be magnetiſed in the ſame manner. By point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your conductor over the ſurface of the water, from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal points. Touch the water with it, and make your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent do the ſame. He will have a ſhock in falling in, and it may be of ſervice to him.</p>
               <p>From theſe few experiments it is eaſy to conceive, that any inanimate body may be electrified, or magnetiſed, which you pleaſe to call it. I have lately received information from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> that a perſon may kill a dog, a horſe, or a man; by fixing his eyes upon the heart, it will ſtop the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and kill them in an inſtant. My correſpondant, who has as little ſaith as myſelf in theſe ſtories, informs me, "That in a buſtle in the place Louis XV. an huſſar came full gallop towards him, ſword in hand: he treated the man and horſe, but could not ſtop him. Having his gun loaded, he killed the man, and thruſt the bayonet into the breaſt of the horſe. He treated them both effectually." Others pretend to ſink a ſhip at ſea. This would be a good thing for an admiral! All thoſe pretended experiments do no honour to thoſe who relate them.</p>
               <p>To treat one's ſelf is as eaſy as to make our arms, feet, and other parts of the body, move in any direction we pleaſe. You may make yourſelf ſick in your ſtomach by your <hi>abſolute will,</hi> as well as to cauſe motion, perſpiration, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now take leave of my pupils, and beg of them never to relate any thing but what they have repeated often; and hope, they will excuſe my Engliſh, as I have not employed any clerks.</p>
