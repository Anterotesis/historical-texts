            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RUE Sobriety of Mind aims at ſeeing God and his Glories, in the whole Frame and Courſe of Nature, as well as in the Wonders of his Grace. It leads Individuals to ſanctify their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Buſineſs, by ever conſidering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as his Servants; and Numbers combined in any Profeſſion, to recognize their Dependance on him, at the more ſolemn Periods of their exerting, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and artificial Improvements in ſuch Profeſſions, by accompanying them with Acts of Devotion.</p>
            <p>THE ſacred Offices we are now engaged in, are therefore founded in Wiſdom, in that <hi>Fear of the Lord</hi> which <hi>is the Beginning of Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY are the religious Reflections relative to the Occaſion of this Day, of which Times of Tranquillity give us a Choice indifferently; but when we are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with all the Horrors of War, and dejected by a Train of paſt ill Succeſſes in it; when we are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently at the Eve of thoſe important Events, whereon our Peace, our Liberty our Being depend: We have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008079_0004_102FD18F88190368"/>
Need to arm our ſelves with thoſe divine Principles, which ſhall prevent an anxious Gloom of Mind from degenerating into repining Doubts of the Rectitude or Kindneſs of the Adminiſtrations of Heaven, and ſhall chear our Spirits with the Hopes of happier Days, and fix our Truſt on a ſure Foundation.</p>
            <p>TO this End I have choſen the Part of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture now read; wherein the Prophet rapt into future Time, comforts the People he wrote to, yea and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, ſubjected to various Miſeries through Ignorance and Vice; repreſented as an undutiful Wife, removed from the Bed and Board of her Lord, <hi>deſerted, afflicted, toſſed with Tempeſts,</hi> &amp;c. as in our Context, afterward reſtored to Favour, becoming the Mother of a numerous Offspring, having the Pleaſure of ſeeing them eſtabliſhed in a noble Habitation, ſurrounded with every Bleſſing which can render Life comfortable or deſirable. Under which Allegory is deſigned, the unhappy State of Mankind in general for many Ages, and the glorious Effect of the Advent of the Son of God, and of the Propagation of his Religion.</p>
            <p>TO confirm Faith, and inſpire Hope of theſe happy Futurities, it was needful that Men ſhould renounce the abſurd Principle, which anciently much prevailed, and ſeems to be divers Times pointed at by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, viz. Of two independent Principles, or firſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of Good and Evil in the Fates of Men. Which the Prophet here does, when he aſſerts the ſupreme Dominion of God, in thoſe Events, which uſed to be attributed to the evil Power. <hi>Behold I have created,</hi> &amp;c.
<q>Inſtruments of War, their Fabric, Uſe and Succeſs, and the Hands they are put into, are all under my Inſpection and Direction, you may therefore confide in my Promiſe of Deliverance from Evil, and of every Bleſſing in due Time.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008079_0005_102FD19211F06070"/>OUR Text then may be eſteemed a Deſcription of the Adminiſtrations of Him, whoſe <hi>Throne is eſtabliſhed in the Heavens, and whoſe Kingdom ruleth over All;</hi> and in Conſequence a Vindication of the Ways of God to Men, and an Intimation of that extenſive Plan of the moſt High, the Parts of which ſhall gradually take Place, improving in or tending toward Perfection, 'till the Conſummation of all Things; after which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, the Review of them, ſhall fix the Attention, and raiſe the Admiration and Praiſes of Saints and Angels in that bleſt State, where they ſhall <hi>ſing the Song of Moſes the Servant of God and the Song of the Lamb; ſaying, Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy Ways, thou King of Saints; Who ſhall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify thy Name, for Thou only art Holy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the following Diſcourſe we may,
<list>
                  <item>I. REFLECT upon the preſent State of Mankind reſpecting Wars, by itſelf conſidered.</item>
                  <item>II. AS Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the divine Proceedure, tending gradually to a Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy of its Author.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST, Let us conſider the preſent Condition of Mankind reſpecting Wars, by itſelf conſidered, as of the Conſtitution of God, anſwering Purpoſes worthy of his Government.</p>
            <p>I SAY by itſelf conſidered; becauſe we are not to ſuppoſe that infinite Power and Wiſdom, can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a Neceſſity of uſing Means, unjuſt or cruel in their Nature, to bring about Ends of Good. <hi>The Judge of all the Earth will do Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008079_0006_102FD19599E1C350"/>THERE have been in all Ages, thoſe who deſired to be Atheiſts. Men, who when the Terrors of divine Juſtice attacked them, have applyed to Infidelity, to get rid of the Fears of the Reward due to their evil Deeds. In St. Peter's Days there were <hi>Scoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their own Luſts, who tauntingly ſaid, Where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> Others ſince that Time, have from the ſame Motive, viewed the Works of God in an untoward Light, and inſolently ſaid,
<q>Where is the righteous and good Government of God? while Man his Creature, his Offspring, is doomed from a weak and helpleſs Infancy, to a Series of Vexation, to all the Miſeries which unhallowed Violence can inflict? Is this his World? this Aceldama, covered with Garments rolled in Blood, filled with the Cries of murdered Innocents, the Plaints of raviſhed Virgins.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OR if ſuch Charges have been too unpopular for Reputation, or too hard of Digeſtion even for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſame Motives have put them upon Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to confound their own and others Conceptions of God and his Attributes; for if this can be done, the ſame End is anſwered. That God, whoſe Attributes Men have no Idea of, is neither an Object of their Hopes nor Fears. Hence adopting the abovementioned exaggerated Deſcriptions, they have ſaid,
<q>Diſorder and Miſery are propagated thro' all the Creation; and yet, <hi>All that is, is Right.</hi> God governs the World. The Inference therefore is, That Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, are quite different Properties when attributed to God, from what they are in Men. We know not what to expect from him, <hi>Soul take thine Eaſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>VICIOUS Men make the moſt of theſe Difficulties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſober Minds have been perplexed about them, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008079_0007_102FD197D6D17DE0"/>
ready to ſay with one of the Ancients, <hi>When I tho't to know this, it was too hard for me,</hi> but as he adds, <hi>till I went into the Sanctuary of God,</hi> ſo they have found Retirement for religious Meditation and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Word of God, the beſt Relief.</p>
            <p>INDEED that future World which the human Soul perceives itſelf to be made for, and in which the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Truth aſſure us, all preſent Inequalities ſhall be adjuſted, the Sufferings of the innocent and pious infinitely more than made up, vindicates the Character of Equity and Goodneſs in the Supreme. But yet as we are to judge, that all his Perfections are exerted in a Conſiſtency with each other at all Times, 'tis a noble Improvement of the Mind, tending to the Honour of God, and our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to examine, what Proportion appears to us in the divine Conduct here, what Ends worthy of him are anſwered in the Courſe of Things, how falſe the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions abovementioned are.</p>
            <p>A SHORT Anſwer has been given to them by ſome: that the firſt Man by his firſt Sin, put himſelf out of the Protection of God, ſo that the World was juſtly de<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ted by him, to be a confuſed State of Woe, which beginning here, ſhall be continued for ever, except ſo far as Grace relieves a happy few.</p>
            <p>BUT Others have thought this to be rather a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Knot than untying it. For beſides the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of Language, in ſpeaking of Beings coming into Exiſtence in a State of Puniſhment, which State implies previous Ill-deſert, and to which Condition of Ill-deſert none can be reduced by Cauſes with Reſpect to which they are purely paſſive, (ſo that all Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of that Sort muſt have a liberal Conſtruction;) beſides this I ſay they obſerve that it is more agreable
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008079_0008_102FD19A14261C90"/>
to the Word of God, as they think it more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him to conceive of him as the univerſal Father, who in this World tempers the Severity of a Judge, with the Tenderneſs of a Parent.</p>
            <p>AND in ſuch a Light, however vain Men may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that this Part of the Syſtem of the Univerſe, is not arranged in ſuch a Manner as they ſhould have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of it; yet humble Obſervers will ſee enough to glorify and adore him, who is <hi>glorious in Holineſs, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Praiſes, doing Wonders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT Men are free and voluntary Agents, conſcious of Right and Wrong in their Temper and Conduct, the Subjects of moral Government, our own Experience and inward Senſation ſo convince us, that all metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Arguments to the contrary, muſt appear to the Tho'tful, but idle and ridiculous Sophiſms. Now 'tis incident to ſuch Beings of limited Capacities, to fall into Imprudence and Vice. What then is it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, will be the Courſe of the Care and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God reſpecting ſuch? Surely that while faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, they ſhall in general enjoy his Smiles. (I ſay in general, becauſe there may be Exceptions, among other wiſe Reaſons, to convince us of the Certainty of the future World) Such, Revelation informs us, was the State of Innocence in the Garden of Eden, and ſuch ſhall be that of the <hi>heavenly Jeruſalem, the City of the great King.</hi> And on the other Hand, that when they offend, they ſhall find it an <hi>evil Thing and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> That Departure from God, is Departure from all Good.</p>
            <p>IN ſuch a State of Things, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, illuſtriouſly appear. If the Effect of different Conduct be proportionable, if Miſery follow Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008079_0009_102FD19BA5A1ED28"/>
as its Shadow, or rather as it's evil Genius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if the <hi>Work of Righteouſneſs be Peace, and the Effect of Righteouſneſs, Quietneſs and Aſſurance for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Almighty Poſſeſſor of theſe Perfections, is yet more glorious, if theſe Troubles, theſe natural Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which end in the Ruin of the obſtinate and abandoned, prove the Medicine and Cure of thoſe who are meet for ſuch a Favour, moving them to return to due Obedience; and ſo all Events of the natural and moral Kind unite in a Tendency to Good, by Way of Motive or Example.</p>
            <p>See here then the Finger of God in the Fate of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, (for I ſhall confine myſelf to them, though the Caſe of particular Perſons be nearly the ſame) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Conduct.</p>
            <p>WHEN a Community in general, forſakes God and Virtue, they fall into thoſe Errors and Sins, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw upon them the juſt Reſentments of their Neighbours, or invite ſome hardy Invader to attack them. The Alarm is given, but what is to be expected, from a People enervated by Luxury, or drenched in ſenſual Defilements, equally loſt to publick Spirit and the Fear of God? What I ſay is to be expected but— baſe Terror—Feebleneſs and Diſunion in public Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils—ſordid Venality in thoſe entruſted with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them—In the Camp abandoned Profligacy, which takes away the Heart—in the Field daſtardly Cowardice? Deſpairing of themſelves, not daring to look up to God; <hi>if they call, who will anſwer them, and to which of the Saints will they turn?</hi> They muſt ſhamefully diſgorge ill-gotten Poſſeſſions, or bow their Necks to the Yoke. The ſame evil Temper which affronts God, diſregards the Rights of Men. If what

they feel amends them not, they go on to new Acts of Injuſtice, Breaches of Treaties or other Outrages, which provoke their Neighbours to the utmoſt Extremities, the moſt ſhocking Deſolations follow, 'till their Names be no more on Earth.</p>
            <p>HERE is the righteous Severity of God. For who will blame Heaven for thoſe Sufferings, which Men by forſaking the natural Means of Proſperity, bring on themſelves? God is glorified, when all about them are delivered from the Contagion of their evil Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and warned by their Fate to abandon Iniquity; thus <hi>Sin is the Reproach</hi> and Ruin of <hi>any People.</hi> And if wiſe Ends are ſerved by ſuch general Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, the few innocent Individuals may be ſafely left in his Hands, moſt able to cauſe them ſoon to forget the Troubles, of this ſmall Part of their Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>THIS is one Iſſue of ſuch Diſtreſſes. Let us take another View.</p>
            <p>IF a People thus viſited, <hi>open</hi> their Eyes and <hi>Ears to Diſcipline,</hi> if they <hi>return to him that ſmiteth them;</hi> every Step of their Return to Virtue, furniſhes them with Principles of ſucceſsful Reſiſtance; human and divine Aids flow in, for the Reſtoration of their Tranquillity.</p>
            <p>For a religious Nation, have their Portion in this World of Imperfection and Sin, are ſometimes called to defend themſelves againſt the Sons of Violence, or ward off their ill Deſigns. The <hi>Fear of the Lord</hi> will <hi>be their ſtrong Tower.</hi> The Spirit of Piety will ſpread its Influence, on all Orders and Degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:008079_0011_102FD1A020DA2030"/>THE governing Part of ſuch a Society, conſidering themſelves as under the Inſpection of the one Judge, and his <hi>Miniſters for Good</hi> to the People, will not wantonly or unjuſtly ruſh into Quarrels. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned having Confidence in their Rulers, and their common Senſe approving their Conduct, will with a chearful and vigorous Spirit, render their neceſſary Meaſures of this Sort effectual, by contributing freely of their Eſtates, or by perſonal Services. Public Meaſures will be founded in Juſtice, and be the Reſult of Deliberation, ſuch as they can commend to God, and their Dependance on God will limit them to ſuch as will in the long Run be moſt effectual.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY will ſuch a People, have a high Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as the ſame Spirit of Religion will poſſeſs their Soldiery.</p>
            <p>THE religious Soldier, is inſpired to Diligence in accompliſhing himſelf in the Art of War, not by the Hope of a Plume of Feathers, not by the tinſel Ambition of wearing a Commiſſion; much leſs by the ſordid Proſpect of ſix Pence a Day, or the brutal Love of Plunder and Blood: But that he may be an Inſtrument in the Hand of God, of <hi>breaking the Teeth of the Oppreſſor, and plucking the Spoil out of his Mouth,</hi> of maintaining Right, reſtoring Peace and ſpreading Happineſs all around him.</p>
            <p>THIS Spirit of Religion will render a Camp, a well ordered Family, a Houſe of God formed for his Praiſe. Officers will imitate the ſupreme Ruler in Juſtice tempered with Meekneſs and Benignity, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the Love and Confidence of all under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo that they will <hi>dare</hi> and chooſe to die with them, and for them. Councils of War, will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008079_0012_102FD1A358B977C0"/>
with Dependance on the Source of Wiſdom and Courage, at whoſe Tribunal every Vote is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. Neither their Troops nor Country, will be ſacrificed to the gay Humours of a Bottle; much leſs will they waſt away the Property, and ſell the Lives and Liberties of their Brethren, for the paltry Conſideration of keeping themſelves in Pay; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which will be, ſlow Motions—inactive Campaigns—Surprizes and Diſgrace. The Ancients placed Men of ſuch a Caſt, deep in Hell. <hi>Vendidit hic Auro Patriam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PRIVATE Men, under the Influence of a Spirit of Piety, will be ſubmiſſive to Superiors, not only for Wrath, but Conſcience Sake; they will apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every Part of Duty, as called thereto by God; they will amidſt the Duty of their Place, ſtill remember that there is One <hi>higher than the Higheſt</hi> on Earth, to whom they are at the ſame Time to be faithful; and therefore by devout Meditation, and living as under the Inſpection of Heaven, they will be ſpirited to Care and Diligence, and when ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Arms will have no dead Weight to depreſs them. Religious Temperance ſtrings the Nerves; gives Strength and Firmneſs to the Body, and maintains an equal uniform Preſence of Mind, in every Emergency.</p>
            <p>BUT never is this divine Principle of all that is good, more neceſſary or more advantageous, than in the Field of Battle, when Death preſents itſelf in all its Terrors; then to be able to ſay, my Cauſe is good, approved of Heaven; in hazarding my Life for the preſent Happineſs of my Friends and Country, I follow him, who gave up his precious Life for the future Happineſs of all Mankind: Nor am I going to contend with giddy Chance or ſullen Fate; the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008079_0013_102FD1A533343338"/>
Ruler of the World is the Arbiter, he preſides over the Field of Battle; <hi>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the Earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in Behalf of them whoſe Heart is perfect toward him;</hi> the Fate of Armies is decided by infinite Wiſdom; if I die, 'tis to lie down in the Bed of Honour, and <hi>my Fleſh ſhall reſt in Hope;</hi> And what is Death, but a Step into the calm Regions of everlaſting Peace? God is my Friend, Jeſus my Saviour was <hi>made perfect through Sufferings,</hi> and I preſs on with Confidence, that if I breath my laſt in the Field, <hi>this Day</hi> my Soul <hi>ſhall be with</hi> him <hi>in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH what a different Spirit will ſuch an One fight, from thoſe abandoned Souls, who ſhall be alarmed, in the Revels of a drunken Debauch; ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned from the unmanly Pollutions of a Harlot's Lap; or while blaſphemous Oaths are on their Tongues; to face an Enemy, yea the laſt Enemy; with what Stupidity, or Dread of falling into the Hands of the living God?</p>
            <p>NOR am I deſcribing an imaginary Influence, but what the Experience of all Ages may teſtify. For if Enthuſiaſm, a ſuppoſed Cauſe of God, or feigned Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Intercourſe with him, have rendered Armies, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible; if vague and unmeaning Prodigies, fancied Symptoms of divine Diſpleaſure, have palled the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: How much more ſhall ſubſtantial Guilt, diſarm the Soul, and Hope toward God, raiſe the Spirits, and pave the Way to Victory?</p>
            <p>THUS the Spirit of Religion and Virtue, in its Effects, naturally tends to Succeſs; to make a People reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and feared; and ſo to ſettle their Security on a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Foundation, except Imprudence, Raſhneſs or Want
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008079_0014_102FD1A770AC4FD8"/>
of Care, (which natural Infirmities of Men, even Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion does not entirely cure,) prevent.</p>
            <p>THERE is one Caſe more remains to be conſidered; and that is, where contending Parties are in moral Regards on a Par, alike earthly, ſenſual, deſtitute of the Principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>AND who ſhall find Fault, if a righteous God has ſo ordered Things, as that by ungodly Paſſions, they plague and harraſs each other; and <hi>bite and devour</hi> 'till they waſte their Treaſures and Strength, mutually ſpreading Poverty and Deſolation, 'till they <hi>be conſumed of one another,</hi> and become public Examples, of the deſtructive Tendency of ungoverned Paſſions, or being worn out, at laſt give Peace, to the quiet in the Earth, or are by Diſtreſſes led to a better Mind. Or if one Party ſhould much prevail, yet the Spirit of Impiety will carry them on, either to thoſe Acts of Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which might ſtir up a conquered Enemy, to that Rage of Deſpair, which ſometimes carries all before it; or Power, Plenty and Peace will lead them to that Licentiouſneſs and vicious Indulgence, which prepares them for a Reverſe of Condition, and carries them on ſwift to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Such as I have pointed out, is in general the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of human Affairs, as the wiſe God has been pleaſed to eſtabliſh the Series of Cauſes and Effects. And if to this be added, that ſpecial Interpoſition of his Providence in great Exigencies, which Reaſon and Revelation teach us to expect, and which many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Events of paſt Times are hardly otherwiſe to be accounted for; in bringing formidable deep-laid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to nought, in Ways unlooked for; in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Succeſſes of Handfulls of Men, when contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008079_0015_102FD1AA5EA41DC0"/>
under his Auſpices, and animated by the Principles of Godlineſs; if a careful Obſerver ſhould collect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Sort, from the Conqueſt of Canaan, to Facts of a recent Date; I ſay if we take ſuch ſpecial Appearances into the Account; we ſhall ſee Reaſon to <hi>praiſe, extol and honour the King of Heaven, all whoſe Works are Truth, and his Ways Judgment; and thoſe that walk in Pride he is able to abaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN therefore ſuch is the State of Things, that in the general, Vice ſhall bring its own Puniſhment, Virtue its own Reward; Afflictions ſhall ſoften the Heart, and mend the Manners, or obſtinate Wickedneſs ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate itſelf, and free the World from its Contagion; when Examples ſhall be ſet up from Time to Time, of theſe different Kinds, for the Caution or Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoſe that come after; every one muſt own that the preſent Condition of Men is ſo proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as to be productive of Good and Happineſs on the Whole: Nor could any Man ſay, were he not taught it from above, that this Diſcipline, theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of a heavenly Father, theſe Sentences of a righteous Judge thus executed, were not formed to produce the higheſt poſſible Good.</p>
            <p>BUT how glorious does the Fountain of Wiſdom and Benevolence appear, if the preſent State of Things be but one Step in the progreſſive Scheme of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for which he has deſigned this World, in its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ages? And to this we proceed now to apply our Thoughts. I ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE are to reflect on the preſent State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind reſpecting War, as Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the Adminiſtrations of God, tending gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to a Perfection, worthy of its Author.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008079_0016_102FD1AC9C78AE58"/>A THOUGHTFUL Mind will have a proper Senſe of his own Imperfection, eſpecially how ſoon and utterly he is loſt, when he contemplates Infinity, and the Works of the incomprehenſible God. And yet as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Whoſo is wiſe</hi> and obſervant, will ſee the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, tho' he cannot comprehend them. When the Queſtion is ſtarted, Why if God be infinitely Good, are there Degrees of Perfection in his Works? Why did not omnipotent Benevolence make all his Works, in the moſt perfect State of Happineſs, and at all Times invariably fixed in it? Beyond the Anſwer, which Modeſty and Humility are content with, viz. That the Wiſdom of God is unſearchable; beſides this it may not be irreverent to obſerve, That we may be miſtaken in ſuppoſing that the greateſt Quantity of Happineſs, would be enjoyed in the Univerſe collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, if the Creatures of God were ſo created and confirmed.</p>
            <p>FOR as to the divers Ranks of created Beings, our Speculations may be in ſome Meaſure juſt, when we conceive, that as in Philoſophy, one infinite Solid is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater than another; ſo the whole Sum of Happineſs, communicated to Angels, Men and all the Creatures of God, is infinitely greater, than could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have been poſſeſſed, by an infinite Number of the higheſt Seraphim which ſurround the Throne of God, had all Degrees of Perfection below them been left a Blank. This Tho't abſtruſe indeed and inconcluſive, I mention, only for the Sake of inferring, that when Men give themſelves Licence, to accuſe the Creator of penuriouſly diſpenſing Happineſs, they go upon uncertain Grounds, and are very incompetent Judges, in the Matter.</p>
            <p>IN like Manner, if curious Minds, when they hear of a Gradation of the ſame Species of Works of God,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008079_0017_102FD1AE53CF03B0"/>
at different Times toward Perfection, of the ſame or different Individuals, wonder why immenſe Love did not put them (Men for Inſtance) at once into that State of Happineſs which they hope to arrive to: Tis ſufficient to ſay, that we cannot tell that the whole Sum of the Happineſs of our Race had been encreaſed thereby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor can we affirm, but that every finite reaſonable Nature, is made happy, by Activity, and that Activity preſerved by having Objects in View to purſue, by Hope, by the Approach of joyful Scenes, by ſurmounting Difficulties, by eſcaping Dangers, by poſſeſſing Happineſs as the Prize of Labour, by compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their different Situations at different Times, and the Conſciouſneſs that they have ſomething further to attain.</p>
            <p>THESE Things being premiſed, let it be obſerved, That from what was ſaid under the former Head, it may appear, that there is a Tendency in Religion (tho' there may be accidental Obſtructions) to Succeſs in Wars, by Means of that public Spirit, Union in Councils, due Subordination and its Duties, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Prudence, Courage, which it lays the Foundation of. Now if ſuch a righteous Nation in their neceſſary Self-defence, ſhould conquer and extend themſelves, obſtinate Enemies would be exterminated, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous Victories would attract the Eyes of all around them, convince them that God was with them; lead them thro' Fear or Love to be at Peace with them. Their Moderation in Succeſſes, their Juſtice and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, would conciliate Friends, ſtrengthen Alliances, and propagate the Spirit of Religion. I with Pleaſure add here the Words of one of the greateſt Divines, and trueſt Thinkers of the preſent Age, the late Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi>
               <q>View this Earth our Habitation, ſays he, <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Butler's</hi> Analogy, p. 93.</note> and we ſhall ſee this happy Tendency of Virtue, by imagining an Inſtance not ſo vaſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote;
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008079_0018_102FD1B08E004A20"/>
by ſuppoſing a Kingdom or Society of Men upon it, perfectly virtuous, for a Succeſſion of many Ages; to which, if you pleaſe, may be given a Situation advantageous for univerſal Monarchy. In ſuch a State, there would be no ſuch Thing as Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but Men of the greateſt Capacity would of Courſe, all along, have the chief Direction of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs willingly yielded unto them; and they would ſhare it among themſelves without Envy. Each of theſe would have the Part aſſigned him, to which his Genius was peculiarly adapted: and others, who had not any diſtinguiſhed Genius, would be ſafe, and think themſelves very happy, by being under the Protection and Guidance of thoſe who had. Public Determinations would be really the Reſult of the united Wiſdom of the Community: and they would faithfully be executed by the united Strength of it. Some would in an higher Way contribute, but all would in ſome Way contribute, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Proſperity: and in it, each would enjoy the Fruits of his own Virtue. And as Injuſtice, whether by Fraud or Force, would be unknown among themſelves; ſo they would be ſufficiently ſecured from it in their Neighbours. For Cunning and falſe Self-intereſt, Confederacies in Injuſtice, ever ſlight, and accompanied with Faction and inteſtine Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; theſe on one Hand would be found mere childiſh Folly and Wickedneſs, when ſet in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt Wiſdom, publick Spirit, Union inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Fidelity, on the other: allowing both a ſufficient Length of Years to try their Force. Add the general Influence, which ſuch a Kingdom would have over the Face of the Earth, by Way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample particularly, and the Reverence which would be paid it. It would plainly be ſuperior to all others, and the World muſt gradually come under its Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008079_0019_102FD1B3B82C9D80"/>
not by Means of lawleſs Violence; but partly by what muſt be allowed to be juſt Conqueſt; and partly by other Kingdoms ſubmitting themſelves voluntarily to it, throughout a Courſe of Ages, and claiming its Protection, one after another, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Exigencies. The Head of it would be an univerſal Monarch, in another Senſe than any Mortal has yet been; and the eaſtern Style would be literally applicable to him, <hi>that all People, Nations and Languages ſhould ſerve him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>DIVINE Revelation, deſigned to inſpire the beſt Hopes, teaches us, that what is the genuine Tendency of Religion ſhall be in due Time, its Effect. That true Goodneſs ſhall prevail, and triumph, and eſtabliſh it ſelf, and bring with it the amiable Train of Bleſſings, which are its Offspring, its Attendants.</p>
            <p>FROM the unhappy Time, when the World became corrupt and wicked, Hopes were given by the Father of Mercies, to thoſe who mourned their Fall, of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, from the preſent as well as future, evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Sin. As the preſent Sufferings of Life, Contentions and Wars in particular, are not only the natural Puniſhment, but Remedy and Cure of Vice, ſo every Interpoſition of God, in the Way of granting Knowledge of Truth or Motives to Goodneſs, have been ſupernatural Methods, of leſſening theſe Evils, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on happier Scenes. The Son of God from Heaven eſpecially, bro't to Light ſuch a Syſtem of practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in all its Parts, as if lived up to, would eſtabliſh univerſal Peace on Earth, and Good-will among Men. And to the Times of his Appearance, above all the Times, when his Goſpel ſhall be generally known, and embraced, 'tis probable many ſublime Parts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, both of the old and new Teſtament belong; which carry us forward to the Days, when the Son of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008079_0020_102FD1B62486CCB0"/>
God <hi>ſhall judge among the Nations, and rebuke many People, and they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, Nation ſhall not riſe againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi> When <hi>the Wolf and the Lamb ſhall feed together, and the Lion ſhall eat Straw</hi> like the Bullock. When <hi>the Kingdom and Dominion, and the Greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven, ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt High: whoſe Kingdom is an everlaſting Kingdom, and all Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Rulers ſhall ſerve and obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Men, who have perhaps too haſtily concluded, that the Conſummation of all Things is at Hand, and therefore that if ſuch a tranquil State ſhould arrive, its Continuance would be ſhort, and no Way proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Length of Time, ſpent in introducing it; to ſuch, the Proſpect may not appear, very intereſting and important. But to thoſe, who think, that the Oracles of Truth intimate to us, a long Tract of Time, wherein the Inhabitants of that <hi>Earth wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhall enjoy the ſubſtantial Pleaſures of Peace and Love, ariſing from Truth and Sanctity; ſuch a Length of Time, as the preparatory Scene ſhall bear no more Proportion to, than three or four Years to a Thouſand: What a Relief does ſuch a View give under preſent Darkneſs! What a reviving Proſpect of the Happineſs of Poſterity! what an amiable Image of divine Benevolence!</p>
            <p>BUT as to the Queſtions How and When; <hi>It is not for us to know the Times and Seaſons, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has put in his own Power.</hi> That Chriſtianity has had in ſome Degree ſuch an Effect, hiſtoric Truth might juſtify. It might I believe be affirmed, that thoſe who have <hi>changed the Truth of God into a Lye,</hi> buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of Chriſt, under a Load of deteſtable
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008079_0021_102FD1B7F4C28BC8"/>
Superſtitions, have abundantly moſt often, been unjuſt Aggreſſors, in the Wars of Chriſtendom. By ſpiriting to and ſupporting in cruel Perſecutions, by ſtirring up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt lawful Rulers, by forging Wills of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by Plots, by Murders and Maſſacres. But ſcarce any of theſe, much leſs of reformed Princes, have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Wars, without at leaſt avowing juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Cauſes; always excepting the late <hi>Louis</hi> the XIVth of <hi>France,</hi> who could Robber like, in Time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Peace, over-run whole Provinces which owed him no Subjection, and fill them with Blood and Ruin, and his Motive, forſooth, was his Glory; Tyrant, what was thy Idea of Glory! Tho' the Dictates of Religion are not always obſerved, yet flagrant Breaches of them are ſo juſtly odious, as that thoſe are reſtrained in ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by Senſe of Reputation, and Fear of general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, whom the Ties of Conſcience will not hold. And tho' it has been often ſaid by Libertines, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion has occaſioned more Bloodſhed, than any other Cauſe, yet ſober Minds will always examine the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch undiſtinguiſhing Aſſertions. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Juſtice, Truth, Love, certainly lead to Victory, Proſperity, and general Peace; but great Oppreſſors have never wanted Pretences to gain Abettors in their Deſigns. The Corruptions of Chriſtianity eſpecially, have been called in Aid of villainous Purpoſes. The Founder of our Religion who knew what was in Man, was aware it would be ſo; and therefore ſaid, he came not to <hi>ſend Peace, but a Sword;</hi> but it is nevertheleſs true, that <hi>the Wiſdom which is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits;</hi> and Societies as well as Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, partake of its benign Influence, in Proportion as they poſſeſs its Spirit.</p>
            <p>AND when it ſhall pleaſe God, by ſuch Means as are always in his Hand, whether the triumphant Arms,

            </p>
            <p>PARTICULARLY; when we think of the Nation, which has been our ancient and conſtant Enemy, no ſooner ratifying a Treaty of Peace, but inſidiouſly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to elude and break it, invading our Territories, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating our Deſtruction, hemming us in with Fortreſſes, pouring the barbarous Salvages on the innocent and defenceleſs: And not only aiming at theſe compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively little Things, but diſturbing the Peace of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, threatning to ſwallow up all that ſhould dare to maintain the common Rights of Society: After theſe mighty Strides yet gaining Advantages, but ſmall, when ſet againſt their immenſe Expence of Blood and Treaſure, ingloriouſly quitting a Country they had treated as conquered; baffled, purſued, threatned on all Sides, nearly reduced to the defenſive.—We may eſteem the next Cauſes, of ſuch Events to be, The
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008079_0024_102FD1BFF01F80F8"/>
immeaſurable Graſp of Ambition, which ſometimes over-reaches itſelf—That Unſteadineſs in Deſign, and Feebleneſs in Execution, which the Want of Juſtice tends to produce—The Weakneſs or Wickedneſs of Commanders, or want of Spirit in an Army of Slaves; but all theſe are Means, which ſupreme Wiſdom for the Peace and Welfare of the World, has ordained to lead to ſuch Events. Religion teaches us ſo to eſteem them, and on the View of them, to adore and glorify him, <hi>who maketh a Way in the Sea, and a Path in the mighty Waters, which bringeth forth the Chariot and Horſe, the Army and the Power; when he pleaſes they ſhall lie down together, they ſhall not riſe, they are extinct, they are quenched as Tow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN it pleaſes God to raiſe up a Hero, at the very Criſis of the Fate of the public Liberty, capable of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating the Receſſes of the Conclaves of Oppreſſion, of Wiſdom and Reſolution ſufficient to defeat its beſt laid Meaſures; If we follow him with his faithful Troops traverſing whole Countries like <hi>the Lightning, which cometh from the Eaſt and ſhineth even unto the Weſt,</hi> or ruſhing on theſe Banditti, like an impetuous Torrent; we admire the Man, but we adore the God, in <hi>whoſe Hands the Hearts of Kings are;</hi> we as it were hear his Voice, as he uttered it of old, <hi>I have raiſed up One from the North and he ſhall come, from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sun he ſhall call upon my Name; and he ſhall come upon Princes as upon Mortar, and as the Potter treadeth Clay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF we return Home, however we may reſolve the calamitous Events our Nation and Land have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, into the Effects of Cowardice, Negligence, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity or worſe Cauſes; however we may wonder at the Conduct of Men in important Truſts; yet Religion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008079_0025_102FD1C217B88E38"/>
teaches us to look higher, to eſteem theſe but Means and Inſtruments of divine Chaſtiſements; to the End that we may be led to Amendment, or if we are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, be plagued till our Place <hi>be left to us deſolate.</hi> Future Events remain with God. A Series of ſuch as we have ſeen and felt, would reduce us to ſuch a Situation, as is painful even to imagine. But ſuppoſe this Year's Campaign to be as ſucceſsful as the moſt ſanguine Hopes can paint it out; yet if we have left God and his Ways, ſuch Succeſſes may be in the End the greateſt Misfortunes, giving Scope to all Vice, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off all Reſtraint, and ſo only ſerving to the putting off the evil Day, which will come in its Time with ſeven-fold Vengeance. For in the Nature of Things, <hi>The Proſperity of Fools will deſtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE proper Uſe of ſuch Meditations, on the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Providence of God, is, to engage us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him for every Bleſſing by fervent Prayer, to caſt our Cares upon him, and eſpecially to engage us to our beſt Endeavours, that We, the Land and Nation we are Part of, may become a People prepared for divine Mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">II. UPON what has been ſaid, I would remark, that every one ought carefully to perform preſent Duty.</p>
            <p>IN common Life, Men's fixing their Attention on viſionary Proſpects, ſo as to neglect the ordinary Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Day, is imprudent and ruinous. So would it be, for us to adopt Maxims of Conduct, ſuited only to the golden Age of Truth and Peace. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples therefore of that meek Sect among us, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not of Self-defence, as they are not the Principles of Revelation, ſo neither are they agreable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Things; and were they generally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008079_0026_102FD1C3A5709070"/>
their Abſurdity would be ſoon felt, or Nature would rebel againſt Principle.</p>
            <p>WITH Reverence and Gratitude, we think of the Conſtitution of God, in which natural Evil leſſens the Quantity of moral, Adverſity purges away Sin. With joy we receive the glad Tidings of what ſhall be. We hope that the Calamities of this Day, ſhall bring on happier Times. But our Lot is not caſt in thoſe calm Seaſons. We have Injuſtice, Fraud and Violence to conflict with. The divine Bleſſing on the vaſt Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now entring on Action, may indeed open to us more pleaſing Proſpects. But it ſeems as tho' America was deſtined to be the Seat of frequent Wars. This at laſt is a Day of Darkneſs. What is Wiſdom? What is Duty? 'Tis to employ every Meaſure wherein we may depend on God for the Settlement of our Safety.</p>
            <p>A MILITARY Spirit ought to be cultivated. Our Rulers are ſenſible of it. They have amended our Laws in this Reſpect. If Perſons of Weight and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure would countenance Exerciſes of this Sort, they would be much better attended to, and eſteemed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Buſineſs. Whereas while our Militia conſiſts chiefly of Children, Apprentices, and Men of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Rank, as in ſome Towns it does, and every one, who can pay a ſmall Fine, thinks it beneath him to appear on a Muſter, we ſhall never make a reſpectable Figure, in that Way.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY ſhould we take Care, to educate our Youth in Temperance and Virtue, to inſpire them with public Spirit, with that Fear of God and Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is the only ſolid Principle of Obedience, Patience, Courage, Moderation, Compaſſion, Honour, and every Quality, becoming of a Soldier, a Defender of his Country, a Chaſtiſer of Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:008079_0027_102FD1C74E6FC148"/>THESE are general Duties; every Order of Men have their own, are called of God to the Offices of their reſpective Departments.</p>
            <p>HOW does the Heart of a Briton, glow with grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſentment, when he ſees our venerable Sovereign the Father of his People, burdened with the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Age, yet ſupporting himſelf under the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Burthen of repeated Diſappointments, ariſing from —I know not what—ſteadily oppoſing the common Enemy on every Quarter; anxious for the Welfare of the moſt diſtant Corners of his Dominions, vigilant, reſolute. God grant he may live to ſee the happy Effect of his paternal Care and vigorous Meaſures, that his People being reſtored to their Rights and Quiet, he may ſay, <hi>Now Lord, letteſt thou thy Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in Peace, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Excellency</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">His Excellency THOMAS POWNALL, Eſq.</note> will permit me, according to the Cuſtom of this Day, to ſay on this firſt Occaſion, of properly addreſſing you from the Deſk, in your Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Captain General of this Province, that tho' God be Lord of all, yet ſuch is his Appointment, that the Fate of Societies, much depends on the Conduct of ſubordinate Rulers. You have been entruſted with the Government of this Province, at a Time when your Attention, is to be peculiarly fixed on military Affairs, and all your Wiſdom and Fidelity needed. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as an Omen of Good, what has been heard with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Doors, of your <hi>Excellency</hi>'s Zeal for the Perfection and due Execution of our military Laws; your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Maxim of giving none Commiſſions in the Service of this Year's Campaign, but thoſe who could be recommended by Men of Worth; the Quiet and Silence with which ſo very large a Body of Troops
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008079_0028_102FD1C9865988B8"/>
has been raiſed in the Government, under your Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, this Seaſon. Your public Speeches ſhew your juſt and extenſive Views of the evil Deſigns of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enemies, and your Reſolution to do your Part, and direct us to ours, for our Protection and Defence.</p>
            <p>MAY you ſee a happy Effect of theſe Firſt-fruits of your Care for the Public, here. Whatever be the Event now, yet you are, Sir, in the prime of Life, and ſhould God continue you in this Poſt, till old Age, till you ſhall ſee another Generation riſen, formed by your civil as well as military Influence, to that manly Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which you yourſelf feel the Benefit of; to that Virtue and Piety, which even bad Rulers find the Neceſſity of cultivating as an Engine of Policy, and which we are convinced you will promote, from an inward Senſe of its Operation on the preſent and future Good of the People you govern; you will then reſign your Truſt, with that Pleaſure, which a benevolent Heart feels, on having done great and laſting Good, ſure that in theſe Attempts for promoting permanent Happineſs, in your Sphere, you will meet with the Approbation of that gracious Being, who <hi>is good to all, and whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains, that you <hi>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</hi> be exhorted to profit by the Doctrine of our Text. In aiming at ſuperior military Accompliſhments, you act a Part ſuitable to the preſent State of the World, and wherein you may be Workers together with God, whoſe Judgments are a great Deep, for the bringing on, a better. It has been ſuggeſted, that our Enemies have of late been ſupplyed with gallant Officers, by Means of their Academies of War, and ſuch other Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as have excited them by every Motive of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Profit, to be expert in their Profeſſion. So far
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008079_0029_102FD1CB12A0BCE0"/>
as your Example and Influence extend, we follow them. It were to be wiſhed, a Spirit of Emulation more prevailed, and that in every Town, ſmall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Men of ſuch a Genius were formed, and your Pattern followed. For if <hi>New-England</hi> would be ſafe, her Children muſt be a Band of hardy Soldiors, for Generations to come, till the Nations of the World ſhall learn War no more. The Scene too, is changed ſince the laſt Age, and indeed ſince the laſt War. Tis no longer the only Thing needful to ferret out a ſkulking Enemy from their Receſſes; We have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with diſciplined Troops, and cannot be always ſure of Aſſiſtance from Abroad.</p>
            <p>Go on then and proſper, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> only add to every other Qualification, that moſt important one of ſolid Religion, the Influence of which I have attempted to deſcribe. Let me add, that as you are Gentlemen of ſuperiour Figure, ſhould you be called to active Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, you will probably be honoured with Commiſſions; and here your Sobriety and Virtue, will have an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you can ſcarcely now conceive of, on thoſe under your Command. The Manners of Superiors have been found ſo to deſcend. Real Religion will not only qualify you for perſonal Service, but give you Weight, attract Reſpect and Obedience, and if it infuſe not the ſame Spirit into all who behold it, yet awes them to that outward Decorum, which is a high Advantage in an Army. Above all it will carry <hi>You</hi> above the Fear of Death, and Armies have ſeldom been beat, under intrepid Officers.</p>
            <p>TO CONCLUDE, Let us all be inſpired to preſent Duty, by a firm Perſuaſion that right Conduct, true Goodneſs eſpecially, always tends to the general Good, and that the more the Spirit of Religion prevails, the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008079_0030_102FD1CD4D67A7E8"/>
nearer we are to thoſe happy Days, when God ſhall dwell with Men. Every private Man, who <hi>fears God and works Righteouſneſs,</hi> leſſens the Proportion of Sin, encreaſes and diffuſes that Temper which is productive of all Good. Men in diſtinguiſhed Stations, whether civil or military, do ſo yet more, by the Conſpicuity and happy Influence of their Virtues. Princes are indeed the <hi>Sons of the moſt High,</hi> when they follow God, in exerting their Power, for the reſiſting the proud, and promoting the Peace and Proſperity of their Subjects. <hi>Angels which are greater in Power and Might, rejoice to do God's Will</hi> even when they deſtroy Thouſands in a Night, for the Peace and Safety of thoſe whom God delights to bleſs. Jeſus the Mediator who is higher than the Kings of the Earth, ſits enthroned on the right Hand of God, there exerting his exalted Power, in ſubduing his and our Enemies, by <hi>the Sword of the Spirit the Word of Truth,</hi> accompanied with his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Energy; promoting that inward Diſpoſition to Love and Peace, which eſtabliſhes theſe Bleſſings on a better Foundation than Terror or Policy. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he will carry on, till he has made all his <hi>Enemies his Footſtool. The laſt Enemy that is to be deſtroyed is Death.</hi> This he ſuffers to remain, and this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in due Time to be <hi>ſwallowed up in Victory,</hi> at that ſolemn Period, when the Purpoſes of God having been anſwered, by all the Viciſſitudes of earthly Things, a yet more ſtable State of Bleſſedneſs ſhall be the Portion of thoſe who have overcome in the Chriſtian Conflict; then <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator ſhall alſo <hi>deliver up the Kingdom</hi> to him that appointed him; that <hi>God may be all, and in all.</hi>
