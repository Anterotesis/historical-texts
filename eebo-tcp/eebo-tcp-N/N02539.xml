            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SINGULAR in the <hi>Old World</hi> was the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and the <hi>Thing</hi> here ſpoken of; the holy <hi>Life</hi> and the happy <hi>End</hi> of bleſſed <hi>Enoch.</hi> He was the moſt remarkable and diſtinguiſhed among the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood; for his eminent Godlineſs &amp; excelling Piety; for his ſhort and fervent Life, and God's taking him to Heaven without ſeeing Death. He was a Man of God, a zealous Prophet of the Lord, and preach'd earneſtly to the ſinners in his day of the Coming of Chriſt to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Jude v.</hi> 14, 15.</note>. And God rewarded his excelling ſaith, ſanctity &amp; labours, with a diſtinguiſhing <hi>Exit,</hi> or departure hence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003011_0004_0FEF9EDA8A68F678"/>
MY <hi>Text</hi> ſpeaks <hi>three</hi> things of him, That he <hi>walked with GOD,</hi> that he <hi>was not,</hi> that <hi>God took him.</hi> It is a ſhort Record of three very great and copious things; of his heavenly life on earth and of his glorious removal to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter World.</p>
            <p>THAT he <hi>was not</hi> means not that <hi>he died;</hi> but the contrary, that he <hi>died not.</hi> The Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us how God took him, Heb. 11.5. <hi>By faith Enoch was tranſlated that he ſhould not ſee death, and was not found becauſe God had tranſlated him: for before his tranſlation he had this teſtimony that he pleaſed God.</hi> Walking with God is the thing that <hi>pleaſes</hi> him. This is the fruit and evidence of the <hi>Faith</hi> of God's Elect. They that <hi>walk</hi> with God in this world, he will in a little while <hi>take</hi> to himſelf in a better life.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Enochs</hi> walk with God was in ſuch a ſingular manner, and was ſo ſingularly pleaſing to Him, that God diſtinguiſhed him from the reſt of Mortals, and the <hi>Angels</hi> of God took him up in the body, as they did <hi>Elias</hi> afterward, and as they do the Souls of other Believers now, and carried him to the Preſence and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of God.</p>
            <p>THIS muſt be reſolved into the Good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, his wiſe and Sovereign will; and to be ſure it was not for any Merit or deſert in <hi>Enochs</hi> holy walking with God. <hi>Enoch</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to have died for his Sins, as well as any before or after him. He was born in ſin as well as other Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and cou'd never ſay I am pure from ſin till his glorious Change
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003011_0005_0FEF9EDC45FD0520"/>paſs'd on him, as he was caught up. <hi>Elias</hi> was a Man of like <hi>paſſions</hi> with others, and ask'd to <hi>die;</hi> yet he was tranſlated as well as <hi>Enoch.</hi> It was not due to the Righteouſneſs of either that they were taken without ſeeing Death. Before that God formed them in the belly, he deſign'd them their <hi>Tranſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never the leſs God doubtleſs meant hereby to put eminent honour on ſingular Piety, and to excite others to labour after Eminence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So God crowns his own Work, his own Gift. <hi>The Lord is well pleaſed in his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> in his Saints, and for his own Names ſake magnifies and honours it. Singular Zeal, Diligence and Devotion in degenerate times ſhall receive a diſtinguiſhing Reward. As <hi>Elias</hi> was <hi>alone</hi> in the cauſe of God in a moſt corrupt time, ſo in <hi>Enochs</hi> day the flood of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity &amp; Impiety begun to break in upon the old World.</p>
            <p>THEN God ſaw it a fit time to give Mankind an <hi>Ocular</hi> Teſtimony of that Eternal Life which he has prepared for them that love and pleaſe him. <hi>Adam</hi> was but juſt dead, as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tranſlation of <hi>Enoch;</hi> and ſome think that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf was the firſt Inſtance of a <hi>natural</hi> death; (for as to <hi>Abel</hi> he died a <hi>violent</hi> one) and the World by reaſon of the rarity of Death and the long life of Mankind might grow into a ſtrange degree of unbelief, profaneſs, ſenſuality &amp; injuſtice before the death of <hi>Adam.</hi> Now I take <hi>Enochs</hi> tranſlation to have been meant and order'd by God as a Teſtimony to the very Senſes and common Underſtanding of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003011_0006_0FEF9EE324072118"/>the Men of the <hi>Old World, Firſt,</hi> that there is a bleſſed <hi>Immortality</hi> for pious and holy Perſons in an unſeen and eternal World; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they ſhall live and be bleſſed there both in <hi>body and ſoul</hi> united; and conſequently <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that there ſhall certainly be a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the Bodies of <hi>Saints</hi> to a bleſſed Life and glorious Immortality.</p>
            <p>NOT that I think the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before <hi>Enoch</hi> were without the Doctrine and Hope of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the body: I believe much the contrary, namely, that God revealed this to <hi>Adam,</hi> and that <hi>Enoch</hi> had walked in <hi>this</hi> Faith, Others before him, But the World, now a thouſand year <hi>old</hi> in ſin, began to languiſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a miſerable decay of <hi>Faith,</hi> and needed ſome remarkable <hi>Testimony</hi> from Heaven to the Doctrine of a future Life and the Reſurrection of the Body.</p>
            <p>AND as to <hi>Enoch's</hi> being taken <hi>ſo ſoon</hi> from his holy walk on earth to the heavenly World; for he lived not <hi>half</hi> the days of <hi>Adam,</hi> or his other gracious <hi>Progenitors,</hi> I might ſuggeſt,</p>
            <p>THAT God hereby teſtified his <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>early</hi> Piety, diligence and proficiency; That he poured <hi>contempt</hi> upon <hi>long</hi> life on earth, in compariſon of the Eternal Glory; That he let the other <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and holy Men ſee that eight or nine hundred years here was not the <hi>right,</hi> the privilege not reward of their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Piety; and that they ſhould by no means <hi>depend</hi> on it or <hi>take up</hi> with it. In a word, <hi>Enochs</hi> tranſlation was the more like to be taken notice of in the Age that then was, by
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003011_0007_0FEF9EE06F56BA88"/>his being tranſlated <hi>young.</hi> If he had liv'd his nine hundred years it is likely the thing had been leſs obſerved and talked of and laid to heart.</p>
            <p>SOME <note n="‖" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. <hi>Boys</hi> of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </note> have obſerved that as <hi>Enoch</hi> was the <hi>ſeventh</hi> from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>five</hi> more were ſubjected to natural death, but He the ſeventh was tranſlated, to point out to us the <hi>Time</hi> when the bleſſed Reſurrection of the Juſt might be expected: Soil. That as Death ſhould reign over the race of <hi>Adam</hi> for <hi>ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> years, ſo the <hi>ſeventh</hi> would reſtore all the <hi>ſpiritual ſeed</hi> of the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> to a ſtate of glorious Immortality.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> obſerves, That <hi>Enoch</hi> liv'd juſt a <hi>Year of years,</hi> which as Men liv'd then was to go in the <hi>midst</hi> of his days; for the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Flood did more than <hi>double</hi> that Age; and God took them ſo ſoon becauſe the World was grown corrupt and was unworthy of him; or becauſe he was ſo much above the World and weary of it, and deſirous of a ſpeedy removal out of it: Or becauſe his Work was done, and done the ſooner for his minding it ſo cloſely. God often takes them ſooneſt whom he loves beſt, and the time they loſe on earth is gained in heaven, to their unſpeakable advantage.</p>
            <p>I have held you too long it may be on the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> the Patriarch <hi>Enoch</hi> and his glorious <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> The plain <hi>Doctrinal Obſervation</hi> I ſhall now ſpeak to is this,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003011_0008_0FEF9EE5F161A9A0"/>
DOCT. <hi>THAT God will undoubtedly take thoſe to Himſelf in another and better World, that walk with Him in this World.</hi> As he did by <hi>Enoch</hi> who propheſied of the Coming of CHRIST in the great Day, ſo he will by all others that look and wait for his Appearing. In <hi>Enochs</hi> character and reward, all Men may learn their duty, and Saints their property &amp; priviledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HE walked with God:</hi> He ſet God always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; kept his eye continually upon God, and conſider'd himſelf always under the eye of God; obſerv'd by him and accountable to him. He was a follower and imitator of the bleſſed God, ſtudied his glorious Nature &amp; Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and his holy Will, and conform'd his heart and life to both, as far as he could attain. He made it his conſtant care and buſineſs to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God, for can two <hi>walk</hi> together except they are agreed? He was wholly devoted to the Service of God, and the Felicity he propoſed to himſelf was Communion with God here and the Enjoyment of him for ever. He did not walk after the courſe of this world, with the men of that wicked age; No, but contrary to them; his fellowſhip was with the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> in whom was all his delight, and among whom he ſhone a burning light. He preach'd againſt the wickedneſs that then began to prevail over the earth with great zeal and courage, and warn'd them of the <hi>Day</hi> when God wou'd judge 'em for their <hi>ungodly deeds.</hi> Thus he <hi>walked</hi> with God, exerciſing himſelf unto Godlineſs, and making Religion the buſineſs and joy of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003011_0009_0FEF9EE8738F0150"/>his life, God's glory his ruling End, and his own Salvation his great and chief care.</p>
            <p>IN all this <hi>we</hi> muſt take him for our <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to walk even as he walked; in the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the ſame <hi>Stops.</hi> — We muſt walk by <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, by which the Juſt do live, and without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. So <hi>Abraham</hi> walked <hi>before</hi> God and was perfect, and ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> walked as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that is Inviſible, and having reſpect to the Recompence of Reward. —</p>
            <p>BY <hi>Repentance</hi> we muſt return to God, and walk humbly with him, the wicked and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent are walking contrary to God, and he walks <hi>contrary</hi> to them. But how did the <hi>Son of God</hi> on earth ſeek out humble <hi>Penitents,</hi> walk and converſe with them, and joy in them?—To walk as <hi>Chriſt</hi> walked is indeed to walk with God. He always did thoſe things that pleaſed the <hi>Father,</hi> whoſe Soul was ever highly pleaſed in him. He has given us an Example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. —We muſt walk with God in the daily and continual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> in all ſtated and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Exerciſes of religious <hi>Worſhip,</hi> ſolitary and ſocial, private and publick.

               </note> 
               <hi>the Waters I am with thee.</hi> It is good having God with us when our way is cloudy and dark, and in the night of afflictions, going before us, holding us up, leading us on, and keeping us ſafe. When the three <hi>Worthies</hi> were thrown into the flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furnace the Son of God came down and walked there with them. — Indeed to walk with God is a Phraſe that ſpeaks <hi>Eminence</hi> in Religion; but it eſpecially &amp; ſtrongly implies <hi>Progreſs,</hi> proficiency and perſeverance in every thing that is holy juſt and good. To <hi>walk</hi> is not to take a <hi>ſtep</hi> or too, nor is it for a <hi>day</hi> or a year, but for the whole life, <hi>all</hi> our days. We muſt walk and work while the day laſts; the light is given for this. The way is but ſhort, a few ſteps up-hill, in a ſtrait &amp; narrow path, that leads to eternal life. We read of <hi>Walking in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.25. That is to walk with God: <q>A <hi>Spiritual</hi> life; the moſt excellent and <hi>noble</hi> kind of life, under the continual vital Influence of the <hi>Holy Spirit?</hi>
               </q> This <hi>walking</hi> (ſays the Rev. Mr. <hi>How</hi> on that <hi>Text</hi>) doth more directly and formally denote a <hi>ſelf-motion,</hi> a <hi>voluntary</hi> motion, an <hi>orderly</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a <hi>pleaſurable</hi> motion, a <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive</hi> motion. This can only be in the <hi>light</hi> of the Spirit, and in his <hi>power.</hi> Hence in the progreſs in <hi>Spirituality</hi> Thus How.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003011_0011_0FEF9EF1170DE6B8"/>
AND now let us conſider, What an <hi>honnara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> thing this is, to walk with God! What an honour ſhould we account it, if our earthly <hi>Prince</hi> would allow us to walk after him in his Garden? Only a few ſelect and favourite <hi>Nobles</hi> have the honour done them. What the is <hi>Man,</hi> that God magnifies him in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>his</hi> walking with <hi>the King Eternal, Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, Inviſible!</hi> Will God in very deed walk with <hi>us</hi> on earth? Behold Heaven, and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain him?</p>
            <p>How <hi>peaſant</hi> muſt this be, to walk with GOD? Such was <hi>Eden,</hi> the Garden of God, in man's firſt ſtare; and ſuch is the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of God above. Such are all the ways of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Holineſs, <hi>ways of pleaſantneſs &amp; paths of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>ſafe</hi> and ſecure muſt they be that walk with God? guarded by his Power, cover'd with his Wing, protected by his Providence, and deſended by his Angels: As <hi>Jacob</hi> on his way when God's <hi>Hoſts</hi> met him. O the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Serenity of this way! living &amp; dying ſuch are ſafe.</p>
            <p>YEA everlaſtingly happy and <hi>bleſſed</hi> are all ſuch in the World to come. They are going to God, to be with him, and bleſſed in him, for ever and ever: Going where <hi>Enoch</hi> is, and to be as <hi>be</hi> is: Not indeed as he went, without dying, but it is all one in the end, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: <hi>Gohriel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> there walk together. In the preſence of CHRIST; and are one in Line, Glory and Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003011_0012_0FEF9EF306D83280"/>
BUT this leads me into the <hi>Proof</hi> of the Doctrine, That if we do walk with God here in this life, <hi>he will take as to himſelf for ever.</hi> As truly as he took <hi>Enoch,</hi> ſo will he all them that walk in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s faith and piety. It will be ſhortly ſaid of every one of them, <hi>He is not, for God took him.</hi> Took him! whither? why where he took <hi>Enoch,</hi> up to himſelf in heaven. As truly as <hi>Enoch</hi> is there, you ſhall be ſhortly there alſo if you walk with God.</p>
            <p>To ſtate this eaſy <hi>Truth</hi> it muſt be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>NOT bodily</hi> and alive to heaven, without ſeeing and taſting death, as <hi>Enoch</hi> was taken. No ſuch matter; and it matters not much. The Godly die as well as others. <hi>Two</hi> only of the Saints have been tranſlated, one before the Flood, and one under the Law; and for Goſpel days the Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> may abundantly ſuffice, to ſtrengthen and uphold the faith of Saints. That glorious <hi>Son of man</hi> became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death for the ſake of his Elect, to teach them to expect a diſſolution, and how to paſs comfortably as well as holily thro' it, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſting of it taken away by his dying. He died not to purchaſe for them a Tranſlation; no, but a Reſurrection. Every Saint may take up <hi>Jobs</hi> words, and ſay to God with holy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; Job. 30 23. <hi>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, the houſe appointed for all the living.</hi> But altho' no Saint looks to be taken bodily to heaven, as <hi>Enoch</hi> was without ſeeing death, yet</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:003011_0013_0FEF9EF751E9A5C8"/>
2. GOD takes the <hi>Souls</hi> of them to himſelf at death, who have walked with him in this life. The <hi>Soul</hi> is the Perſon; if that be taken up to God it matters not tho' the body be laid for a time in the earth, Eccl. 12.7. <hi>The body returns to the earth as it was, but the ſpirit returns to God that gave it.</hi> The <hi>Spirits of the juſt made perfect</hi> are in the ſame Heaven, the ſame Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, where <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are in their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bodies. Thither the Angels carried the Soul of the gracious beggar, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he died at the rich man's <hi>gate:</hi> And thither they carried the happy Spirit of the penitent <hi>thief,</hi> when it left the body upon a <hi>croſs;</hi> And thither the holy Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi> went for the three days that he left his body in the <hi>grave:</hi> To his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Intothy hand I commit my Spirit.</hi>— So God took <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> from the Mount in the day they were uncloath'd and buried; and ſo <hi>Jeſus</hi> took the Soul of <hi>Stephen</hi> while the bruiſed fleſh fell under the cruel ſtones. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour men took up the precious remains &amp; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them, with great lamentation.</p>
            <p>GOD as truly takes the <hi>Soul</hi> by dying and at death, as he took <hi>Enoch</hi> without ſeeing death. If the <hi>Soul</hi> be but taken to the Regions of the Bleſſed all is well, wherever the <hi>body</hi> be dropt, in the ſea, or on the dry land. God ſhews the Soul the path of life, and the <hi>fleſh</hi> reſts in hope. The ſoul is abſent from the body to be preſent with the Lord: it departs and is with Chriſt: To whom elſe ſhould it go? whither elſe would it be taken? When the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf was going, he thus comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003011_0014_0FEF9EFA264BD928"/>his ſorrowing <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Joh. 14. init. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you and I will take you thither, that where I am there you may be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Godly</hi> that are found <hi>alive</hi> at the coming of Chriſt ſhall be <hi>changed</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> was, and <hi>raiſed</hi> Saints ſhall be <hi>caught</hi> up with them to meet the Lord in the air. So we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly taught, and a ſpecial attention to the thing is required of us; 1 Cor. 15.51, &amp;c. <hi>Behold I ſhew you a mystery; we ſhall not all ſleep but we ſhall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last Trump; for the trumpet ſhall ſound &amp; the dead ſhall be raiſed, and we ſhall be changed: For this Corruptible must put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality.</hi> This myſtery relates to the <hi>Godly</hi> that ſhall be found alive at Chriſt's coming; They will not undergo the pains or change of <hi>death,</hi> a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Soul and body; No, but the eaſie and happy Change of <hi>Enoch.</hi> Their bodies by the power of Chriſt will be render'd ſpiritual and incorruptible in a moment of time in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their aſcending up into the air, to meet their deſcending Lord. And becauſe of the Certainty and Importance of this Truth it is repeated to us, 1 Theſ. 4.15, 17. <hi>For this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the Coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep: For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-angel and of the trump of God, and the dead in Christ ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003011_0015_0FEF9EFD28AB6850"/>Compare here the ſtate and privilege of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Saints in the Reſurrection day: Some will have the ſingular privilege of not dying, not ſleeping: The reſt have all fallen aſleep in Chriſt, and have undergone the change of death. Now one would be ready to think the advantage much on their ſide who do not die at all. But that it may not ſeem too much ſo, thoſe that are to ſleep in <hi>Jeſus</hi> are informed and made to know, "That the <hi>Redeemers</hi> firſt care will be about his dead Saints". They that are found alive at the coming of Chriſt ſhall not prevent them that ſleep; No, the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Chriſt will raiſe his dead Servants before the great Change paſſes on them whom he ſhall find alive. So that if theſe laſt ſeem in one reſpect to have the advantage, the other will have it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect, that there may be at laſt an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; For the one being changed into ſpititual and glorious Bodies in the inſtant after that the Dead in Chriſt are ſo raiſed, they will both together be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. As bleſſed and joyful a moment to them all, as the Change and Tranſlation of <hi>Enoch</hi> was to him! and as true and real a <hi>Tranſlation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. WHEN the <hi>Judgment</hi> is over Chriſt will return to the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> the eternal Seat of the Bleſſed, with all his Elect and Redeemed, glorified in ſoul and body, <hi>to walk with him in white</hi> for ever more. So we read in the place laſt cited, 1 Theſ. 4.18. <hi>And ſo ſhall we be ever with the Lord.</hi> Now where will <hi>He</hi> be after the Judgment day? He will return to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003011_0016_0FEF9EFFD740DD98"/>his <hi>Throne</hi> at the right hand of God in the higheſt Heaven, and his <hi>Redeemed</hi> will be there with him about his Throne for ever and ever, 1 Cor. 15.23, 24. <hi>Every man in his own order; Christ the firſt-fruits, afterward they that are Chriſt's at his coming: Then cometh the End, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; having deſtroyed the last Enemy death.</hi> He will therefore carry up his redeemed with Him, and will preſent them unto God his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to be bleſſed by Him and in Him to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>So he has <hi>prayed</hi> for them, and his Prayer is granted, Joh. 17.23. <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> And this he has alſo <hi>promiſed</hi> to 'em. Joh. 12.26. <hi>If any man ſerve me let him follow me, and where I am there ſhall my ſervant be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end our Lord both died and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, even to purchaſe and to receive this power, to take up all Believers into Glory with him: Joh. 17.3. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life unto as many as thou haſt given to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Eternal bleſſedneſs is deſcribed by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in thoſe words, Rev. 2.4. <hi>And they ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> The walk is begun on earth in the life and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Grace, but it continues and is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the light of Life and Glory for ever. Holineſs and Joy is that glorious <hi>White</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Saints walk with Chriſt in Heaven. They are conform'd to Him, both as to Soul
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003011_0017_0FEF9F046D1E3B60"/>and Body, in purity and ſplendour; <hi>faſhion'd according to his glorious</hi> Body and Soul. This <hi>white</hi> is the righteouſneſs of the Saints; their prieſtly and kingly Attire before the Throne of God; for they are <hi>made Kings &amp; Prieſts unto God.</hi> Such a garment of Glory was put upon Chriſt in the day of his <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> when his raiment became white and ſhining as the light, and ſuch a <hi>Robe</hi> he will put upon his Saints at their <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and they ſhall walk with him therein for ever more. — In this <hi>white Enoch</hi> has been walking before the Throne of God from the Day wherein he was tranſlated; and in the ſame will all Believers walk and ſhine to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>BUT this for the <hi>Proof</hi> &amp; Illuſtration of the Doctrine. That God will take all ſuch to Himſelf in another and better World, that walk with him in this World.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>How much does it concern us then to <hi>ask</hi> our ſelves, Whether we have indeed <hi>begun</hi> this walk with God and to him? Whither are we <hi>going?</hi> what are we <hi>doing?</hi> how do we <hi>live</hi> and act? and what will become of us a few days hence?

               <p>O let it be a loud call to Sinners, to walk no more in the counſel of the ungodly, nor go any further aſtray from God; but to return ſpeedily to God with ſincere and deep repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and go in the way of good men and the bleſſed paths of the righteous; <hi>for the way of the ungodly ſhall periſh, and their stops take hold of hall;</hi> They are going down to the pit, the pit of devils, and God will <hi>cast</hi> them from his face for ever, unleſs they repent.

               <p n="2">2. OF <hi>Comfort, Support</hi> and great <hi>Conſolation</hi> to all them that have begun and are going on in a holy Walk with God. The <hi>Chariots</hi> of God are before them, even thoſe that took <hi>Enoch</hi> up, to carry them to the <hi>Manſions in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe.</hi> This ſhould carry them above the <hi>fears</hi> of Death, and comfort them in the <hi>death</hi> of their godly Friends.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WALK on with God, and <hi>be carried above the fears of death.</hi> It is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of mortal Man to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>prepare</hi> for his dying hour; and it is the true <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Man here in the body to be <hi>ready</hi> for death and live <hi>above</hi> the fear of it. A walk with God is the way to <hi>both</hi> theſe. And tho' many of thoſe that walk humbly with him, are <hi>all their life time ſubject to bondage thro' fear of death,</hi> yet it is their weakneſs and infirmity; and the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Lord would ſay to ſuch, as he once did to the <hi>Women, Fear not ye, for I know that ye ſeek Jeſus</hi> that is riſen from the dead.—Why was <hi>Enoch</hi> taken up, and why is <hi>Chriſt</hi> riſer and aſcended, but to <hi>rebuke</hi> ſuch fears? You may face Death, while you are walking with God, and ſee in it <hi>the face of on Angel,</hi> coming to take you to God for ever. You may walk on with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003011_0022_0FEF9F10DFB11538"/>God <hi>down</hi> into the valley of the ſhadow of Death, and ſay, <hi>I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</hi> While you walk with God you may ſay with <hi>Chriſt, I walk to day and to morrow, and on the third day I ſhall be perfected.</hi> — Do you think that God will leave him at the hour of death, that has been walking with him thro' this life? No, the <hi>Angel</hi> of God, whoſe thou art, and whom thou ſerveſt, will ſtand by thee in that hour of darkneſs; the Angels of <hi>Jeſus</hi> will gather about thee and bear thee up in their Arms. — Or if thy Friend &amp; Father ſhould withdraw from thee for a moment, as he did from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thy Faith has him ſtill to look and cry to, <hi>My God, my God.</hi> — Allowance muſt be made for timerous Saints, yea the ſtrongeſt Saints, both while they live and when they come to die. What a mighty <hi>Prince</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God was <hi>Hezekiah?</hi> and how did his Faith and prayer prevail? yet when he came to die he remember'd how he <hi>had walk'd with God and wept ſore,</hi> Iſai. 38.3. Well, let the holy <hi>Tears</hi> run, they will be ſoon <hi>wip'd</hi> away for ever. Some are thus taken up weeping to the pleaſures for ever more. — Let the fearing Saint conſider, that <hi>Dying</hi> after a holy walk with God is in a manner as good as <hi>Enoch's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>taken up.</hi> Where is the difference between the <hi>Chariots</hi> and horſes of light that took up <hi>Elijah,</hi> and the <hi>Angels</hi> that carried the <hi>beggars</hi> Soul to the boſom of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Should God leave it to a Saints own choice, which way he would be taken, me thinks he would reſign the matter back again into the pleaſure and will
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003011_0023_0FEF9F12E37EC2F0"/>of God; "Lord, as thou pleaſeſt, and mayſt be moſt glorified, one way or the other: they come to one and the ſame End.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhould yield us the higheſt <hi>Conſolation in the death of our Godly friends,</hi> that they have walked with God, and are not, for God has taken them. Had <hi>Enoch</hi> any mourners? think you: Or how could they weep for him? or for themſelves? Surely only for themſelves As when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> aſcend up into Heaven, <hi>they returned</hi> home <hi>with great joy.</hi> Or as the <hi>Sons</hi> of the Prophets that foreſaw the Aſcenſion of <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſpake of it with admiration and delight as to his part in it, and not with grief. Truly ſo there's abundant <hi>Comfort</hi> to affectionate Survivors in the <hi>way</hi> and in the <hi>end</hi> of every godly Perſon: They have <hi>walked</hi> with God and He has <hi>taken</hi> them to his Glory. Thus to live is Chriſt and to die is Gain. Whether to chuſe we know not; let God do it. <hi>Enochs</hi> honour have all the Saints; praiſe ye the Lord. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> rebukes immoderate ſorrow over a <hi>Saints</hi> grave, 1 Theſ. 4.13. <hi>I would not have you ignorant, Brethren, concerning them that are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not as thoſe that have no hope: For if we believe that Jeſus died, &amp; roſe again even ſo alſo them that ſleep in Jeſus God will bring with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE muſt remember the <hi>holy walk</hi> of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Friends and comfort our ſelves. We muſt remember where they now are: They are gone from us; God has taken 'em; they are <hi>with Chriſt which is far better;</hi> and <hi>when Christ
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003011_0024_0FEF9F15E01AB830"/>ſhall appear</hi> they <hi>ſhall appear with him in glory,</hi>— What would any Believer have or wiſh more concerning thoſe he loves, while they live or when they are dead? As our <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to his ſorrowing <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Joh. 14.28. <hi>If ye loved me ye would rejoyce, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go not <hi>to the grave to weep there:</hi> Why ſhould you <hi>ſeek the Living among the dead?</hi> Lift up your head and eyes, look up to Heaven &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: Thither the precious Soul is taken, and there it is for ever comforted.</p>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Elijah</hi> was taken up, there were ſome of his Friends and <hi>Sons</hi> that would go ſeek his body; <hi>It may be</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>the Spirit of the Lord has dropt</hi> it here or there: No, ſaid <hi>Eliſha;</hi> Indulge no ſuch fear or care about One whom God hath taken. Yet they went and ſought in vain. So you may mourn and afflict your ſelves needleſly about ſuch as God has taken up by Death, after a holy life and walk; But you ought rather to <hi>realize their Tranſlation,</hi> by a <hi>Faith</hi> which is <hi>the Subſtance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things unſeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is one way of following our Godly Friends to Heaven; which ſhould be our mournful care; that we may <hi>walk</hi> with God as they did, and that when we have finiſhed our Courſe God may <hi>take</hi> us up to be with them; where they are beholding his Face for ever.</p>
               <p>

AND now all that are here preſent very well apprehend the Reaſon and Occaſion of this <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> God has this Week taken up from us ONE whom he enabled by his Grace in a ſingular manner to <hi>walk with him.</hi> We mourn the <hi>Deceaſe</hi> from us (not his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> to God) of the <hi>firſt Miniſter in the Town,</hi> the firſt in Age, in Gifts and in Grace; as all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren very readily own. I might add (it may be without offence to any) the <hi>firſt</hi> in the whole <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Literature; and extenſive Services. Yea it may be among all the <hi>Fathers</hi> in theſe <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> from the beginning of the <hi>Country</hi> to this day, of whom many have done worthily and <hi>greatly;</hi> yet none of them amaſs'd together ſo vaſt a <hi>Treaſure</hi> of Learning, and made ſo much <hi>uſe</hi> of it, to a variety of pious Intentions, as this our Rev. Brother and Father, Dr. COTTON MATHER.</p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Name</hi> is like to live a great while among us in his <hi>printed Works;</hi> but yet <hi>theſe</hi> will not convey to Poſterity, nor give to Strangers, a juſt Idea of the real <hi>Worth</hi> and great <hi>Learning</hi> of the <hi>Man.</hi> His <hi>Works</hi> will indeed inform all that read them of his great Knowledge, and ſingular Piety, his Zeal for God, and Holineſs and Truth; and his deſire of the Salvation of precious Souls; but it was <hi>Converſation</hi> and Acquaintance with him, in his familiar and occaſional Diſcourſes and private Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that diſcovered the vaſt compaſs of his Knowledge and the Projections of his Piety;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003011_0026_0FEF9F1C27A3D3C0"/>more I have ſometimes thought than all his <hi>Pulpit</hi> Exerciſes. Here he excell'd, here he ſhone; being exceeding communicative, and bringing out of his <hi>Treaſury</hi> things new &amp; old, without meaſure. Here it was ſeen how his Wit, and Fancy, his Invention, his Quickneſs of thought, and ready Apprehenſion were all conſecrated to God, as well as his Heart Will and Affections; and out of his Abundance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his <hi>ups</hi> overflow'd, <hi>dropt as the honey-comb, f;ed</hi> all that came near him, and were as the <hi>choice ſilver,</hi> for richneſs and brightneſs, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit.</p>
               <p>BUT here Love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Servant</hi> commands me to draw a <hi>Veil</hi> over every <hi>Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> For <hi>who</hi> is without them? Not Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elijah</hi> Himſelf; who was <hi>a man of like Paſſions</hi> with his Brethren the Prophets; and we have his <hi>Mantle</hi> left us wherewith to cover the Defects and Infirmities of <hi>Others</hi> after their <hi>Tranſlation in Spirit.</hi> Theſe God <hi>remembers no more,</hi> and why ſhould we? and He <hi>blots out none of their good Deeds,</hi> and no more ſhould we.</p>
               <p>I truſt therefore we may go on freely to ſay, That my <hi>Text</hi> was happily Exemplified in <hi>Him,</hi> even in his <hi>Walk with God</hi> from his Youth up: In his <hi>Cloſet</hi> the witneſs of his Prayers and Vigils and Tears; in his hard and conſtant <hi>Studies</hi> and preparations for the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and for the <hi>Preſs:</hi> in his <hi>Family,</hi> where the daily Sacrifices of Praiſe and Prayer were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003011_0027_0FEF9F1F138E0AE0"/>with much of God and Chriſt &amp; Heaven, in an edifying and pleaſant Converſation. His <hi>Viſits</hi> to his Friends, and theirs to him, bear witneſs for him how much the Love of Chriſt was in his Heart and on his Tongue. Much more his more religious Viſits to the <hi>Sick</hi> and Afflicted, to the Bereaved and to <hi>Mourners,</hi> to the <hi>Tempted</hi> and wounded in Spirit, or theirs to Him, may be ſuppos'd to bear witneſs for him. Not to omit his many charitable Viſits to <hi>Priſoners</hi> under the Sentence of death, and his <hi>Labours</hi> with them, to ſave their Souls from the ſecond Death.</p>
               <p>IF we follow him to his <hi>public</hi> Labours, ſtated and occaſional, on <hi>Lord's Days &amp; Lectures;</hi> how ſervent was he and unwearied, in Prayer and Preaching, in Interceſſions and Exhortations? Here he ſhow'd a flaming Love to <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Souls,</hi> and a vehement zeal againſt <hi>Sin</hi> and for <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> Among the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in all their Meetings, he was very much the Mouth of <hi>God</hi> to them as well as <hi>theirs</hi> to God. The whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, his Cauſe and Intereſt in a wicked World, lay always much upon his heart, and ſo did the <hi>Proteſtant Succeſſion,</hi> the Civil and Religious Liberties of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and thoſe of his own <hi>Country.</hi> He truly lov'd his <hi>People,</hi> and had juſt notions of their true Intereſts. He was in the <hi>Gap</hi> for them on all Occaſions, and wreſtled in Prayer. He was a zealous Adorer and Aſſertor of the <hi>God-head of Christ;</hi> all his <hi>hope</hi> of Salvation ſtanding on it, and the whole <hi>Myſtery of Godlineſs.</hi>—
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003011_0028_0FEF9F2209F74500"/>His <hi>Reſignations</hi> to the Will of God were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful under great Trials; and it ſeem'd one of the chief Aſpirations of his Soul to honour God by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and to have his own <hi>Will</hi> ſwallowed up entirely in the Will of God. This he preſs'd vehemently on others in an evil and <hi>dying</hi> World, and this he practic'd himſelf. One of the <hi>laſt</hi> Words I heard him ſpeak was in Admiration of the Grace of God in ſome of his near <hi>Relatives,</hi> in their exemplary Patience, Reſignation and Devotion, under a great and ſore <hi>Bereavement:</hi> He lift up his feeble Hand, and rais'd his ſunk Voice, and earneſtly ſaid with a faultring Tongue, <hi>"O they do gloriouſly, they do gloriouſly, to honour God as they do with ſuch a ſacrificing Spirit".</hi> He ſought not this <hi>World,</hi> but was very <hi>liberal</hi> of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in uſes of Piety and Charity. His heart was too good and big for <hi>earthly</hi> things, and too ſpiritual not to be ſet on <hi>higher</hi> and better; namely <hi>a more enduring Subſtance, a Treaſure in Heaven that faileth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOTHING was more familiar and frequent with him than <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Eternity.</hi> Theſe he was ever ſpeaking of with <hi>pleaſure</hi> and deſire, as one always <hi>ready</hi> and willing to be offer'd. And agreably he entertain'd all his <hi>Sickneſſes</hi> with Conſtancy and Serenity, Tranquility and Peace; not ſhaken in mind nor afraid to die. He told me on the laſt <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with what a <hi>ſingular Satisfaction</hi> he had received the notice of Deaths approach that <hi>Morning,</hi> hoping to have been with Chriſt that <hi>Sacrament-day.</hi>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:003011_0029_0FEF9F25AA0E1148"/>
I ſhall only add, That according to the beſt Judgment I am able to make from mary years Obſervation and Converſation with him, he has ſeem'd to enjoy a fixed <hi>Peace</hi> and full <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of Faith, as to his Intereſt in Chriſt and a better Life; And <hi>this</hi> continu'd with him to his laſt breath.</p>
               <p>I leave it to <hi>Others</hi> to relate the holy <hi>Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and abundant gracious <hi>Words</hi> that flow'd from Him to every one that came about him, all the time of his Sickneſs and in his <hi>laſt</hi> Day and Hours; which whenever we ſee or hear they will be (it may be) one of the brighteſt Accounts we yet ever had of <hi>Grace and Peace,</hi> and living Comforts in dying Moments.</p>
               <p>THUS <hi>he walked with God,</hi> and now <hi>he is not,</hi> as my Text ſays of <hi>Enoch.</hi> That is to ſay, He is no longer <hi>with us.</hi> Your eyes that have ſo often ſeen him in this <hi>Desk</hi> ſhall ſee him here no more, and this <hi>Place</hi> that has known him, and ſhown ſo much of him, ſhall <hi>know him no more.</hi> No more ſhall he be heard again in this <hi>Lecture,</hi> where he has ran ſo long and ſhining a <hi>Courſe:</hi> No more will he here <hi>weep</hi> over periſhing Souls in <hi>Prayer;</hi> no more ſcatter the <hi>thunders &amp; lightnings</hi> of God in flaming <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi> no more like another <hi>Enoch</hi> warn the ungodly of the <hi>Lord's coming and judgment:</hi> No more is he to <hi>weary</hi> and ſpend himſelf, as we have often ſeen him wearied and <hi>ſpent</hi> for your Souls; "never weary of his work, but often wearied in it.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:003011_0030_0FEF9F2775481B30"/>
WHEN he ſtood laſt in <hi>this</hi> Place he was in weakneſs made ſtrong; feeble in body but fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit; he ſpar'd not himſelf nor us; profuſe of his own life for the lives of our Souls.</p>
               <p>WE have no reaſon to doubt but God has taken him to Himſelf, where he long'd to be; taken him to the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> his laſt deſire. He would not be <hi>bere</hi> again, unleſs for your <hi>Souls;</hi> And ſo <hi>Angels</hi> come down gladly, and for ought I know ſo may a <hi>Seperate</hi> Soul too.</p>
               <p>HE is reaping (we believe) a glorious <hi>Harveſt</hi> of all that he here ſow'd: He <hi>ſowed bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> and we believe <hi>reaps</hi> bountifully; appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have had an <hi>abundant Entrance into the Joy of his Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND if ſo, then He is as much taken up as <hi>Elias</hi> was, tho' not in the <hi>body.</hi> He <hi>freely</hi> went at God's Call, was not taken away by <hi>force,</hi> was willing to go, went <hi>placid</hi> and <hi>ſerene; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> himſelf could ſcarce do more. And to me it ſeems a greater thing to <hi>die gladly</hi> and aſcend only in <hi>Spirit,</hi> than to ſtep joyfully, without dying, into <hi>Enochs Car.</hi> For who could do other than willingly <hi>mount the Chariot of light</hi> if he ſaw it come down for him with his bodily eyes? but to <hi>meet gastly Death,</hi> when he comes to take us out of the Body, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly go with him, leaving the body behind us to duſt and worms; is ſomething greater. To be able to walk down <hi>chearfully</hi> to a Grave,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003011_0031_0FEF9F29135F59C0"/>is a greater thing than to go up <hi>joyfully</hi> in the Body. — The Saints that ſhall <hi>never die</hi> may ſeem to come ſhort of ſome of their <hi>Brethren</hi> in this; that while they are only <hi>caught up</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air to their Lord, their Brethren have paſs'd <hi>thro' Death</hi> to go to him.

            <p>THE Learned <hi>Monſieur SAURIN</hi> in his <hi>Diſſertations upon the Old Teſtament</hi> ſays, "That this only Expreſſion is the moſt beautiful of all Elogies, <hi>Enoch pleaſed God.</hi>—He adds, That we have a very ſtrong Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this <hi>Fact,</hi> that <hi>Enoch was indeed tranſlated and did not ſee Death,</hi> becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> at the End of the Lives of thoſe <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> that both preceeded and followed <hi>Enoch</hi> hath this Expreſſion, <hi>that he died.</hi> He does as it were affect this Style; and it may be preſumed that he would not have altered it juſt upon mentioning <hi>Enoch,</hi> if that holy Man had the ſame Deſtiny. Beſides, the manner in which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of the Aſſumption of <hi>Enoch</hi> makes it appear as a favour granted to his great Endeavours of pleaſing God: <hi>Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was a more ſingular thing in that <hi>Firſt Age</hi> of the World, that a Man of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Piety ſhould live but 365 years, while the greateſt part of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> came nearer to a thouſand. This made ſo
<pb facs="unknown:003011_0035_0FEF9F36EC60DED0"/>great an Impreſſion upon a <hi>Robin</hi> who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desſtood it to mean no more than an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Death, that he choſe rather to blaſt the Memory of this <hi>Patriarch</hi> than to ſuppoſe that God would take a good Man ſo in the midſt of his days, in that Age of the World. <hi>"Enochs Righteouſneſs</hi> (ſays the <hi>Robin</hi>) <hi>was but ambulatory and fleeting, and this was the Reaſon that God precipitated his Death".</hi> An ignorant and baſe Reflection.</p>
            <p>IN each of the <hi>three</hi> great Periods of the Church, there has been an <hi>Inſtance</hi> of a Man taken up to Heaven in Body and Soul; for the ſupporting the Hopes conceived by all the Faithful, of arriving at the ſame happineſs: <hi>Enoch</hi> before the <hi>Law, Elijah</hi> under it, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Oeconomy. 'Twas a favourable <hi>Prejudice</hi> for the Faithful of the <hi>Firſt</hi> World, to ſee <hi>a good Man</hi> vaniſh away, and after his ſojourning upon the Earth to be lodged in ſome other place than a Tomb.
