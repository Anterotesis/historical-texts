            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A Vindication,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. THE <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> of our Bleſſed SAVIOUR, ev'ry where charge us, to treat the Miniſters of Religion with a becoming Eſteem &amp; Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The APOSTLE, <hi>beſeeches us to know them, that labour among us, and are over us, in the Lord, and admoniſh us, and eſteem them very highly for their Works ſake.</hi> Nor is this inculcated upon us, as a <hi>Duty</hi> only; but recommended to us, as our <hi>Intereſt.</hi> And the reverſe is, a ſure Method to bring the Bleſſed <hi>Truths,</hi> which they deliver, into Contempt and Ridicule; and baniſh all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion out of the World. A finiſh'd <hi>Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of the Devil</hi>! To this purpoſe one of our very Reverend DIVINES well expreſſes himſelf! <q>As a corrupt, ignorant &amp; vicious Clergy, is one of the darkeſt &amp; moſt comprehenſive Infelicities, under which the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, hold it putrifying, yea, the grand cauſe of all the <hi>Corruption,</hi> in which Mankind lye gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally languiſhing and periſhing: And it is not for nothing, that when the <hi>Kingdom of our GOD</hi> comes on, this muſt be one Introduction or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant of it; <hi>Thus ſays the Lord God, behold I am againſt the Shepherds, and I will cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the Flocks, for I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002396_0003_0FDB39888E9980C8"/>my Flock from their mouth.</hi> So the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of this, is, a ſet of <hi>Good Men</hi> inſpired with an holy <hi>Zeal</hi> to do good, who like <hi>Angels, flying thro' the midſt of Heaven,</hi> Preach nothing but the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> with the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of it unto them <hi>who dwell upon the Earth</hi>: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch Men are the <hi>Stars</hi> whom GOD <hi>calls by their Names,</hi> they <hi>ſhine as Lights</hi> in the World, in their benign Influences; the Bleſſings of the People that enjoy them are wonderful! are wonderful!</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. BOSTON may boaſt of almoſt an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel'd Happineſs in their MINISTERS; ſome of us, have travel'd to other, and diverſe parts of the World; and we ſincerely proſeſs, we never ſaw the Place that excelled BOSTON in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. GOD has indulged to this People a very <hi>Candid, Learned</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> ſet of Men, who in all things unbiaſſedly conſult the good of their reſpective Flocks; nor do they intermeddle with <hi>other Men's Affairs</hi> more than what is proper to their Function. 'Tis this endears them unto us, and makes us rejoyce in them; and offer our thanks to GOD for the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> that ſhine ſo viſibly in them. And we thought our <hi>Neighbours</hi> were all ſenſible of the <hi>invaluable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of</hi> GOD to us, in this Regard: But to our Aſtoniſhment, we ſee <hi>ſome</hi> in this Place ſo <hi>daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Frofane,</hi> as to Libel and Lampoon <hi>theſe holy Servants</hi> of our Bleſſed JESUS; and <hi>others</hi> ſo fooliſhly fond of their <hi>Invectives,</hi> as to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and promote them; and this, among <hi>ſober</hi> Perſons, and <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002396_0004_0FDB398A38F83A80"/>§ 3. OF late, there has been Publiſhed, (it may be ſpoken to our diſhonour) ſeveral <hi>detracting</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous Pamphlets,</hi> tending to render the MINISTRY <hi>Vain</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous.</hi> In theſe, this <hi>Sacred Order of Men</hi> has been <hi>Strangely</hi> repreſented, and <hi>horribly</hi> animaverted upon. Many things have been charged on them, of which they been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <hi>Innocent,</hi> and many things that <hi>it is their Glory they have ſpoke them,</hi> have been moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly perverted and equivocated. And now, who ſhould the Authors of theſe be, but STRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GERS OF ABJECTS, which inhances their <hi>Folly,</hi> and makes their <hi>Impudence</hi> the more brazen and flagitious. Above all, we wonder at a <hi>Weekly Paper,</hi> which has been, and is now, Publiſhed, either <hi>deſignedly,</hi> to affront our Miniſters, and render them Odious; or elſe, it has hitherto, wretchedly deviated from it's <hi>ultimate Intent,</hi> and been notoriouſly proſtituted to that <hi>Helliſh Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi> We know no <hi>Nation</hi> under the Sun, that has ſo openly and aſſiduouſly inſulted the MINIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS of their GOD; and been ſo ſtrenuous, in their Endeavours, to make them deſpicable and deteſtable to their <hi>People,</hi> as the <hi>Authors</hi> of this ſcandalous <hi>Libel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. THAT the World may ſee this Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is juſt, we will recite a few Paſſages (as a Specimen) from their Writings, paſſing over the many indirect and ſcandalous Glances at them. In the Writings of <hi>John Williams</hi> (Tobacconiſt)
<q>The Miniſters have generally revolted from the good old way, and have ſet up a way that their Fathers know not of, neither entered it into their hearts, to allude unto <hi>Jr.</hi> 5.23. They are <hi>revolted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002396_0005_0FDB398B8D737758"/>and gone.</hi> Again, <hi>Defective in morals,</hi> — The <hi>cauſes of Diviſions.</hi> — People are afraid the Miniſters do affect to Rule over them, in <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> does <hi>Temporally</hi> as well as <hi>Spiritually</hi> rule and determine things —.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Learned <hi>Taliacotius,</hi> 
               <q>The Infatuations in this Country ſeem always to have proceeded from ſome of thoſe who call themſelves the Sons of <hi>Levi.</hi> They are repreſented as Men of WICKED DESIRES — and <hi>impious, ignorant</hi> &amp; <hi>braſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced. Prob Fides! Oh Impiety! Oh Braſs! In the Reflections on the Town Meeting, Aug.</hi> 11. 1721. It is <hi>thought by three parts of this Town</hi> that its better they were a-foot with a good pair of Shoes on their Feet, and a Staff in their hands.— In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries of Strife &amp; Diviſion. In the <hi>Courant,</hi> No. 23. <hi>Moſt of the Miniſters are for it &amp; that induces me to think, it is from the Devil.</hi> No. 25. <hi>The Inſtruments of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief &amp; trouble both in Church &amp; State, from the Witchcraft to Inoculation —. Formerly there were many grave &amp; wiſe Miniſters, but now there are few.</hi> ***</q> But 'tis needleſs and endleſs to quote, the Paſſages are ſo notorious and numerous.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. THESE <hi>Reflections</hi> upon and <hi>Abuſes</hi> of this <hi>Sacred Order of Men,</hi> are ſufficient, to make the moſt profeſſed <hi>Libertine</hi> bluſh. Who is there that can ſee all this, the MINISTERS, by whom they expect to be brought home to CHRIST, thus auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly inſulted, thus vilely trampled upon, and impiouſly buffoon'd, by the profane Sons of <hi>Corah,</hi> and tamely &amp; ſilently bear it. 'Tis this amazes, &amp; alarms us, and we think it a <hi>Duty</hi> indiſpenſibly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002396_0006_0FDB398D00312608"/>incumbent upon us, more thoroughly to <hi>enquire into the Characters of our</hi> MINISTERS, whether they are worthy of theſe <hi>Barbarous Reflections,</hi> yea or no? We cannot anſwer the neglect of this; if we ſhould, our <hi>Conſciences</hi> would one Day, as a <hi>Flaming Witneſs</hi> fluſh our <hi>Guilt</hi> in our Faces. We are their <hi>People,</hi> and hope by their precious <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry</hi> to be brought home to GOD, &amp; Everlaſting Life; and therefore we are bound to appear in their <hi>Juſt Vindication</hi>; and reſcue our Children, and our Neighbours from the deadly <hi>Poiſon,</hi> which theſe <hi>Children</hi> of the Old <hi>Serpent</hi> would infuſe into them. And here firſt, We cannot but admire the Moderation, and conſummate Patience of our PASTORS, amidſt theſe outragious and provoking Abuſes &amp; Scandals. They ſhine with an <hi>Unſhaken Conſtancy,</hi> and ſtill go on to <hi>Miniſter</hi> in thoſe very parts of their <hi>Office,</hi> that ten Thouſand difficulties have conſpired to obſtruct them in. Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their <hi>Publick Miniſtry</hi> is too well known, to need a Report of ours, and their <hi>Prayers</hi> &amp; <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> proclaim them, to be <hi>Workmen</hi> that need not be aſhamed. Their <hi>Printed Labours</hi> are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Teſtimonies of their <hi>Abilities</hi>; and ſpeak an <hi>excellent Spirit</hi> breathing in them. Their nine <hi>Lectures</hi> upon <hi>Early Piety,</hi> Preached in ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Time, that it plainly ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their <hi>Paſtoral Viſits</hi> are wiſely, painfully &amp; faithfully manag'd; and if we enquire into their more <hi>private Converſation,</hi> we find them <hi>ſhining Inſtances,</hi> of the moſt <hi>refined
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002396_0007_0FDB398F8A775240"/>Virtue</hi> &amp; <hi>Religion.</hi> They are always ready <hi>to do Good,</hi> and <hi>Rejoice</hi> in all <hi>Opportunities</hi> for it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are they addreſſed by any in Affliction, but they adminiſter Comfort, and the <hi>Afflicted</hi> find the <hi>Bowels</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> in them; and their <hi>Liberalities</hi> are alſo truly extraordinary. We never enjoy their <hi>Company,</hi> but their Savoury &amp; Entertaining <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> evidently diſcovers an Internal <hi>Source</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in them; and the <hi>Blame</hi> centers upon ourſelves, if we grow not <hi>better</hi> &amp; <hi>wiſer</hi> by it. Some of them have <hi>great names</hi> in diſtant Lands; and <hi>foreign Countries</hi> have a great <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> for them. But to conclude their <hi>Praiſes,</hi> they are <hi>more precious than the fine gold; than the golden wedge of Ophir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. BUT now, what is there can juſtify the <hi>virulent</hi> and <hi>unwearied</hi> Endeavours of theſe <hi>Wicked Men</hi> to make them Odious? The only <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text</hi> they have is, That the MINISTERS have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedled with <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs, and <hi>gone out of their Line</hi>; and the only Inſtance they can give of this, (for the others are only groundleſs Surmiſes, or open Calumnies) is this, When the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> was firſt breaking into the Town, and every one fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw and feared a dreadful Mortality; theſe <hi>good Men</hi> were appriſed of a ſafe Method, which they by the ordinary Bleſſing of GOD, hoped might be an Inſtrument of ſaving many <hi>Lives.</hi> This <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> came to them with very authentic Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations; nor was ever, any <hi>Remedy</hi> attended with a more uninterrupted, &amp; remarkable <hi>Succeſs</hi> than this. This they communicated to the PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICIANS; urging them, (not to put it into practice, as the <hi>News-Letter</hi> declares, but) to <hi>meet together,</hi>

And to do ſome juſtice by the way to that <hi>eminent Perſon,</hi> the <hi>Learned</hi> Dr. COTTON MATHER, <hi>Fellow of the Royal Society</hi> (who to his <hi>honour</hi>) was the principal <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this <hi>Method</hi> among us: (and who now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to draw his <hi>generous Pen</hi> for his own <hi>Vindication,</hi> againſt the many fooliſh <hi>Pamphlets</hi> that are pointed at him; and who changes not his <hi>Temper</hi> for all their inviduous Calumnies;) we will here tranſcribe the <hi>Words</hi> with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his <hi>Addreſs</hi> to the <hi>Phyſicians</hi>; Dated, <hi>June</hi> 6. 1721. <q>I will only ſay, (writes the DOCTOR) that inaſmuch as the Practice of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and preventing the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> in the way of <hi>Inoculation</hi> has never yet, (as far as I have heard) been introduced into our <hi>Nation</hi>; where there are ſo many that would give <hi>great Sums,</hi> to have their Lives inſur'd, from the <hi>dangers</hi> of this dreadful <hi>Diſtemper,</hi> nor has ever any one in all <hi>America</hi> ever yet, made the tryal of it (tho' we have ſeveral <hi>Africans</hi> among us, as I now find, who tryed it in their own <hi>Country</hi>) I cannot but move it be WARILY proceeded in. I durſt not yet engage, that the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the tryal here will be the ſame, as has hitherto been in the other <hi>Hemiſphere.</hi> But I am very confident, no perſon would miſcarry in it, but what muſt moſt certainly have miſcarried upon taking it the <hi>Common way.</hi> And I would humbly <hi>adviſe,</hi> that it be never made, but under the management, of a <hi>Skilful Phyſician,</hi> who will wiſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002396_0009_0FDB399484632370"/>the Body for it before he performs the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. <hi>Gentleman,</hi> My <hi>requeſt</hi> is, that you would <hi>meet for a Conſultation</hi> upon this Occaſion, and to <hi>deliberate</hi> upon it, that whoever firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins this practiſe, (<hi>if you approve that it ſhould be begun at all</hi>) may have the concurrence of his <hi>worthy Brethren</hi> to fortify him in it —.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Doctor.</p>
            <p>WE appeal to the whole World, whether this <hi>Gentleman went out of his line,</hi> or did any thing, but what became a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,</hi> in his addreſs. And this is all the blame, they do with any <hi>Colour</hi> charge upon him, &amp; which has given <hi>Life</hi> to ſo many monſtrous, and bitter <hi>Invectives</hi> againſt him. But to return from this Excurſion. The <hi>Phyſicians</hi> never met, nor conſulted about this <hi>Method,</hi> according to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> of the MINISTERS, till one of them began the Experiment upon his <hi>Family.</hi> He had juſt reaſon to apprehend them in danger of being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the <hi>Common way</hi>: and here, I cannot omit to obſerve the <hi>happy juncture</hi> of <hi>Affairs</hi> that <hi>united,</hi> to render this his Attempt <hi>Innocent</hi> &amp; <hi>Blameleſs</hi> The worthy TOWNSMEN had taken the <hi>Guards</hi> off the <hi>Infected houſes,</hi> and in effect proclaim'd the <hi>Infection</hi> ſo prevalent, that 'twould be in vain, to ſtrive to ſuppreſs it. By this <hi>act</hi> the <hi>Nurſes</hi> were commiſſioned, to air themſelves, who had been ſtifled, for a conſiderable Time, by a cloſe Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the <hi>Sick: Liberty</hi> was declared to them to walk the Streets; and now as the <hi>neceſſities</hi> of the <hi>Sick</hi> urged, theſe <hi>Infected perſons</hi> might go to our <hi>Doctors</hi> upon any occaſion; and any heedleſs or head-ſtrong <hi>Neighbours</hi> run in to viſit their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002396_0010_0FDB399600E96600"/>
               <hi>Friends</hi>; which muſt neceſſarily render their <hi>Families</hi> very obnoxtious to the diſtemper. This clearly evinces the <hi>eminency</hi> of the <hi>danger</hi> his Family was in; and in a great meaſure vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates his procedure. But notwithſtanding, a <hi>mighty Storm</hi> was raiſed, &amp; a ſaucy <hi>Libel</hi> publiſhed, which among other things demanded an anſwer to a <hi>Caſe of Conſcience.</hi> Six MINISTERS of BOSTON under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to give a proper anſwer to the Demand, wherein they did ſome juſtice to the <hi>Gentleman</hi> that <hi>that Paper</hi> had <hi>unjuſtly</hi> reproached. After this, the MINISTERS were ſilent for ſeveral Months, till at length the conſtant <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment encouraged <hi>Some</hi> of them to publiſh their <hi>Sentiments</hi> on this ſubject, eſpecially what related <hi>to the caſe of Conſcience.</hi> And here, we think it very ſtrange &amp; rediculous, to ſee the <hi>Satyriſts</hi> play the Divine, and deny that it falls under the Cognizance of our MINISTERS, when ſo many People pretend CONSCIENCE in the matter. This is to <hi>boaſt</hi> of their own Divinity, as if they were the only proper <hi>judges</hi> of what is the part of a <hi>Divine,</hi> and to <hi>Counterpoint</hi> their own <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> to that of our famous <hi>Profeſſors.</hi> But we will not ask who <hi>go out of their line now</hi>? This is a full Hiſtory of the <hi>crimes</hi> charged on the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> wherein they have <hi>gone out of their line</hi>: That is to ſay, When they ſaw their <hi>People</hi> dying about them, and their deareſt <hi>Friends</hi> they had, <hi>Gaſping for their Breath,</hi> they did not caſt off all <hi>bowels</hi> of <hi>compaſſion,</hi> and be <hi>content</hi> that no further tryal ſhould be made of a <hi>Method,</hi> that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended would deliver them from their <hi>danger.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002396_0011_0FDB39978A1511E8"/>§ 7. WE will not on this occaſion enquire, how far our <hi>Practitioners</hi> &amp; late <hi>Libellers</hi> have <hi>gone out of their line.</hi> But this we remark, that if any <hi>Perſon,</hi> of any Profeſſion, had been appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a <hi>ſafe Method</hi> to preſerve his <hi>Neighbour's</hi> Life, in a Time of common danger, and had not <hi>communicated</hi> it to him, he had approved himſelf to be of a very un-natural, and un-chriſtian <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> And our MINISTERS eſpecially, who are <hi>Sluring Patterns</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> would have appear'd with a <hi>diſtinguiſht Blackneſs,</hi> had they neglected this good Office to the <hi>Flocks</hi> intruſted with them. How very unjuſt and wicked then are the <hi>Obloquies</hi> and <hi>Outrages</hi> which have been for this Cauſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon them. The famous Mr. <hi>Thomas Thacher</hi> was not reviled, for <hi>going out of his line,</hi> when he Publiſhed a Sheet of Directions, relating to the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> Forty three Years ſince. And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eminent MINISTERS in the <hi>Country,</hi> have practiſed <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and ſeveral do ſo at this Day, and we could never hear them revil'd for <hi>going out of their line</hi>: And poſſibly, there are among the MINISTERS of BOSTON, ſuch as the beſt <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in the Land, need not be aſhamed to <hi>advice</hi> withal.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. AFTER all, We have often heard that Maxim, <hi>That a Power to do Good not only gives a right, to the doing of it, but makes the doing it a Duty.</hi> And we humbly conceive, if it were more regarded, the <hi>World</hi> would many ways <hi>reap</hi> the <hi>Benefit</hi> of it. And to us it is very evident, that he that ſees his <hi>Neighbour</hi> expoſed to any great danger, and can relieve him; not only has a <hi>Right,</hi> but ſhould look on it as his <hi>Duty,</hi> to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002396_0012_0FDB399B13D360E0"/>§ 9. Now this being all the <hi>Crime,</hi> that is with any <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> charged upon our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> we cannot but look upon it, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>inhumanity</hi> and blacken <hi>ingratitude</hi> to treat them in ſuch a manner as they have been. We ought rather to value &amp; eſteem them; love and thank them, for their Goodneſs; and bleſs GOD for making them the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of ſo much Good to us, and to our Families. We are ſure the great <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the <hi>Practice,</hi> which they hoped ſo well of, has cauſed many among us to wiſh, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſuch baſe Methods, as have been taken to oppoſe it, a <hi>regular management</hi> of it had been agreed upon; and ſome are of Opinion, that our <hi>Miniſters</hi> may ſay to their waſted People, what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did upon the <hi>Shipwreck, Sirs, You ſhould have hearkned unto me, and not have gained this Harm and Loſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">§ 10. BUT we will not enter into the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, what we obſerve is, that according to this <hi>way</hi> of treating the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> which is now in <hi>Faſhion,</hi> it will come to this; If in a Time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſtreſs, they with great Modeſty offer their <hi>Opinion</hi> for the <hi>Common good,</hi> they ſhall be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, for <hi>going out of their line.</hi> If on a Day of <hi>Publick Thanksgiving,</hi> they mention Publick Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as thoſe of a <hi>good Government,</hi> &amp;c. or if they rebuke the growing <hi>Sins</hi> of the Times, and put any <hi>notorious Transgreſſors</hi> in mind of the awful Threatnings, pronounced <hi>in the Holy Writings</hi> againſt them; it ſhall be deem'd <hi>going out of their line</hi>; yea, their <hi>Warning</hi> of the <hi>wicked</hi> ſhall be ridiculouſly called, a <hi>Curſing of them.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002396_0013_0FDB399BFA3B5170"/>If this <hi>impious</hi> &amp; Satanic Cuſtom prevail, we ſhall involve our ſelves into a thouſand pernicious <hi>Evils.</hi> Our <hi>Children</hi> will imbibe the <hi>Poiſon,</hi> and periſh like the <hi>Children of Bethel</hi>; and our Elder People will <hi>pine away in their Iniquities.</hi> Our <hi>Reprovers</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> being Silenced, <hi>Iniquity</hi> and every <hi>Abomination</hi> will break in among us, and bear down like an irreſiſtable Torrent, all <hi>Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> before it. And what is moſtly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated, all manner of <hi>Spiritual Plagues</hi> will follow this our degeneracy; and the <hi>Town</hi> grow ripe for a <hi>Wrath unto the Uttermoſt.</hi> We read, <hi>They mocked the Meſſengers of GOD, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the Wrath of the Lord aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his People, and there was no Remedy.</hi> In what a deplorable Condition ſhould we be, if <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> ſhould pronounce this direful <hi>fate</hi> upon us; or, if the intolerable <hi>invectives</hi> read among us, againſt our Holy <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſhould provoke GOD to deprive us of theſe <hi>Invaluable Bleſſings,</hi> and puniſh us with a <hi>Clergy,</hi> that ſhould be <hi>Salt without Savour,</hi> and <hi>Clouds without Rain,</hi> as we have ſeen in other Places.</p>
            <p n="11">§ 11. IN the mean time, we commiſerate the deplorable <hi>State</hi> of thoſe, who ſignalize themſelves by their <hi>Malice</hi> &amp; Miſchief againſt theſe faithful <hi>Servants</hi> of GOD. We have ſeen a Conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>blaſt</hi> from Heaven attending ſuch, and GOD has ſo remarkably revenged the Iniquity, that none but ſuch as are given over to a <hi>penal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart,</hi> can hide their Fear and Trembling. And when we conſider, the <hi>meekneſs</hi> of our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> under theſe <hi>Abuſes,</hi> imitating their <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>

            <p n="12">§ 12.
