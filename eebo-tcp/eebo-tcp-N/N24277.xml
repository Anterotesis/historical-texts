            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>THE charge of blaſphemy, which is put upon the record againſt the printer of this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not an accuſation of the ſervants of the crown, but comes before you ſanctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It ſtood for trial upon a former day; but it happening, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a ſufficient number did not appear to conſtitute a full ſpecial jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cauſe from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addreſſing myſelf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I purſued this courſe, however, from no jealouſy of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary ſervice of the court, ſince my whole life has been one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued experience of their virtues; but becauſe I thought it of great importance, that thoſe who were
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032093_0003_0FF11AFF99368F30"/>
to decide upon a cauſe ſo very momentous to the public, ſhould have the higheſt poſſible qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the deciſion: that they ſhould not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but that their ſituations ſhould be ſuch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened country, to which, in character and in eſtimation, they were in their own turns to be reſponſible.</p>
                           <p>Not having the honour, Gentlemen, to be ſworn for the king as one of his counſel, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, than to aſſiſt in the proſecution of them. But I feel no embarraſſment from that recollection; ſince I ſhall not be found to-day to expreſs a ſentiment, or to utter an expreſſion, inconſiſtent with thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable principles for which I have uniformly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever ſaid, either profeſſionally or perſonally, for the liberty of the preſs, do I mean to-day to contradict or counteract. On the contrary, I deſire to preface the very ſhort diſcourſe I have to make to you with reminding you, that it is your moſt ſolemn duty to take care that it ſuffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicenſed preſs <hi>(in the juſt and legal ſenſe of the expreſſion)</hi> has led to all the bleſſings both of religion and government, which Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated ſtill farther to advance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happineſs. But this freedom, like every other, muſt be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human advantage, may be defeated by its abuſe.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen! the defendant ſtands indicted for having publiſhed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profeſſional duty, and which I roſe from the reading of with aſtoniſhment and diſguſt. Standing here with all the privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the higheſt counſel for the crown, I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032093_0004_0FF11B02786EBF30"/>
be entitled to reply to any defence that ſhall be made for the publication. I ſhall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by anticipation the learned counſel who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the proſecutors in the courſe of the proceedings, I have to expect, that, inſtead of a defence conducted according to the rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Engliſh law and juſtice, the foundation of all our laws, and the ſanctions of all our juſtice, are to be ſtruck at and inſulted. What is the force of that juriſdiction which enables the court to ſit in judgment? What but the oath which his Lordſhip, as well as yourſelves, have ſworn upon the goſpel to fulfil? Yet in the king's court, where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is himſelf alſo ſworn to adminiſter the juſtice of England—in the king's court—who receives his high authority under a ſolemn oath to maintain the Chriſtian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am nevertheleſs called upon as counſel for the proſecution, to produce a certain book deſcribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man deſerves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to ſuch a notice. It is an inſult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; ſince it ſeems to call in queſtion the very foundations of its juriſdiction. If this is to be the ſpirit and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the defence; if, as I collect from that array of books which are ſpread upon the benches behind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the Chriſtian religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that ſuch an argument was neither ſuggeſted nor juſtified by any thing ſaid by me on the part of the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>In this ſtage of the proceedings,</hi> I ſhall call for reverence to the Sacred Scriptures, not from their merits, unbounded as they are, but from their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032093_0005_0FF0D3EDCC74C438"/>
in a Chriſtian country—not from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conſcience, but from the rules of law. For my own part, Gentlemen, I have been ever deeply devoted to the truths of Chriſtianity; and my firm belief in the Holy Goſpel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education (though I was religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly educated by the beſt of parents), but ariſes from the fulleſt and moſt continued reflections of my riper years and underſtanding. It forms at this moment the great conſolation of a life, which, as a ſhadow, muſt paſs away; and without it, indeed, I ſhould conſider my long courſe of health and proſperity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the duſt which the wind ſcatters, and rather as a ſnare than as a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Much, however, as I wiſh to ſupport the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture from a reaſoned conſideration of it, I ſhall repreſs that ſubject for the preſent. But if the defence ſhall be as I have ſuſpected, to bring them at all into argument or queſtion, I ſhall then fulfil a duty which I owe not only to the court, as counſel for the proſecution, but to the public, to ſtate what I feel and know concerning the evidences of that religion which is reviled without being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and denied without being underſtood.</p>
                           <p>I am well aware that by the communications of a free preſs, all the errors of mankind, from age to age, have been diſſipated and diſpelled; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the world, under the banners of reformed Chriſtianity, has ſtruggled through perſecution to the noble eminence on which it ſtands at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhedding the bleſſings of humanity and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the nations of the earth. It may be aſked, by what means the reformation would have been effected, if the books of the reformers had been ſuppreſſed, and the errors of condemned and exploded ſuperſtitions had been ſupported as unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable by the ſtate, founded upon thoſe very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions formerly, as it is at preſent upon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032093_0006_0FF11B07AB828108"/>
of the eſtabliſhed church? Or how, upon ſuch principles, any reformation, civil or religious can in future be effected? The ſolution is eaſy:— Let us examine what are the genuine principles of the liberty of the preſs, as they regard writings upon general ſubjects, unconnected with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal reputations of private men, which are wholly foreign to the preſent inquiry. They are full of ſimplicity, and are brought as near perfection, by the law of England, as, perhaps, is conſiſtent with any of the frail inſtitutions of mankind.</p>
                           <p>Although every community muſt eſtabliſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authorities, founded upon fixed principles, and muſt give high powers to magiſtrates to adminiſter laws for the preſervation of the government itſelf, and for the ſecurity of thoſe who are to be protected by it: yet, as infallibility and perfection belong neither to human eſtabliſhments nor to human indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, it ought to be the policy of all free eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments, as it is moſt peculiarly the principle of our own conſtitution, to permit the moſt unbounded freedom of diſcuſſion, even by detecting errors in the conſtitution or adminiſtration of the very govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf, ſo as that decorum is obſerved, which every ſtate muſt exact from its ſubjects, and which impoſes no reſtraint upon any intellectual compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fairly, honeſtly, and decently addreſſed to the conſciences and underſtandings of men. Upon this principle, I have an unqueſtionable right (a right which the beſt ſubjects have exerciſed) to examine the principles and ſtructure of the conſtitution, and by fair, manly reaſoning, to queſtion the practice of its adminiſtrators. I have a right to conſider and to point out errors in the one or in the other; and not merely to reaſon upon their exiſtence, but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of their reformation. By ſuch free, well-intentioned, modeſt, and dignified communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſentiments and opinions, all nations have been gradually improved, and milder laws and purer
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032093_0007_0FF11B0A8B018528"/>
religions have been eſtabliſhed. The ſame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which vindicate civil contentions honeſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, extend their protection to the ſharpeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies on religious faiths. This rational and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal courſe of improvement was recognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he looked back with gratitude to the labours of the reformers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil bleſſings that followed in their train. The Engliſh conſtitution, indeed, does not ſtop ſhort in the toleration of religious <hi>opinions,</hi> but liberally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to <hi>practice.</hi> It permits every man, EVEN PUBLICLY to worſhip God according to his own conſcience, though in marked diſſent from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional eſtabliſhment, ſo as he profeſſes the general faith, which is the ſanction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our ſubmiſſion to the ſyſtem which conſtitutes a ſtate. Is not this ſyſtem of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of controverſy, and freedom of worſhip, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all the purpoſes of human happineſs and improvement? And can it be neceſſary for either, that the law ſhould hold out indemnity to thoſe who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it reſts for its foundation? I expect to hear, in anſwer to what I am now ſaying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his ſituation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very ſincerely, may be driven to advance propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ction that freedom. But will not the ends of juſtice be completely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by that right, to point out the errors of his diſcourſe in terms that are decent, and calculated to expoſe its defects; or will any argument ſuffer, or will public juſtice be impeded, becauſe neither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate honour and juſtice, nor public decorum, would endure my telling my very learned friend, that he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032093_0008_0FF11B0EB45E9208"/>
was a fool, a liar, and a ſcoundrel, in the face of the court, becauſe I differed from him in argument or opinion? This is juſt the diſtinction between a book of free legal controverſy and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inveſtigate, with modeſty and decency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſial points of the Chriſtian religion; but no man, conſiſtently with a law, which only exiſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its ſanctions, has a right not only broadly to deny its very exiſtence, but to pour forth a ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſulting invective, which the loweſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments in the gradations of civil authority ought not to be permitted to ſuffer, and which ſoon would be borne down by inſolence and diſobedience, if they did.</p>
                           <p>The ſame principle pervades the whole ſyſtem of the law, not merely in its abſtract theory, but in its daily and moſt applauded practice.—The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the ſexes, and which, properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, not only continues, but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thouſand romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every virtuous principle; others, though with the ſame profeſſion, addreſs the imagination in a manner to lead the paſſions into dangerous exceſſes. But though the law does not nicely diſcriminate the various ſhades which diſtinguiſh theſe works from one another, ſo as that it ſuffers many to paſs, through its liberal ſpirit, that upon principle might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, would it or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to paſs by unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, libels of the moſt ſhameleſs obſcenity, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly pointed to debauch innocence, and to blaſt and poiſon the morals of the riſing generation? This is only another illuſtration to demonſtrate the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſtinction between the work of an author, who fairly exerciſes the powers of his mind, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigating doctrinal points in the religion of any

country, and him who attacks the rational exiſtence of every religion, and brands with abſurdity and folly the ſtate which ſanctions, and the obedient tools who cheriſh the deluſion. But this publication appears to me to be as miſchievous and cruel in its probable effects, as it is manifeſtly illegal in its principles; becauſe it ſtrikes at the beſt, ſometimes, alas! the only refuge and conſolation amidſt the diſtreſſes and afflictions of the world. The poor and humble, whom it affects to pity, may be ſtabbed to the heart by it. They have more occaſion for firm hopes beyond the grave, than thoſe who have greater comforts to render life delightful. I can conceive a diſtreſſed but virtuous man, ſurrounded by children, looking up to him for bread when he has none to give them, ſinking under the laſt day's labour, and unequal to the next, yet ſtill looking up with confidence to the hour when all tears ſhall be wiped from the eyes of affliction, bearing the burden laid upon him by a myſterious Providence which he adores, and looking forward with exultation to the revealed promiſes of his Creator, when he ſhall be greater than the greateſt, and happier than the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of mankind. What a change in ſuch a mind might not be wrought by ſuch a mercileſs publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Gentlemen! whether theſe remarks are the overcharged declamations of an accuſing counſel, or the juſt reflections of a man anxious for the public freedom, which is beſt ſecured by the morals of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will be beſt ſettled by an appeal to the paſſages in the work, that are ſelected by the indictment for your conſideration and judgment.

the publication of ſuch a book, in a country where the Chriſtian religion is the very foundation of the law of the land, I am totally at a loſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and have no ideas for the diſcuſſion of. How is a tribunal, whoſe whole juriſdiction is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſolemn belief and practice of what is denied as falſehood, and reprobated as impiety, to deal with ſuch an anomalous defence? Upon what principle is it even offered to the court, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is contemned and mocked at? If the religion propoſed to be called in queſtion, is not previouſly adopted in belief and ſolemnly acted upon, what authority has the court to paſs any judgment at all of acquittal or condemnation? Why am I now, or upon any other occaſion, to ſubmit to your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's authority? Why am I now, or at any time, to addreſs twelve of my equals, as I am now addreſſing you, with reverence and ſubmiſſion? Under what ſanction are the witneſſes to give their evidence, without which there can be no trial? Under what obligations can I call upon you, the jury repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your country, to adminiſter juſtice? Surely upon no other than that you are ſworn to adminiſter it under the oaths you have taken. The whole judicial fabric, from the king's ſovereign authority to the loweſt office of magiſtracy, has no other foundation. The whole is built, both in form and ſubſtance, upon the ſame oath of every one of its miniſters to do juſtice AS GOD SHALL HELP THEM HEREAFTER. What God? And what hereafter? That God, undoubtedly, who has commanded kings to rule, and judges to decree with juſtice; who has ſaid to witneſſes, not by the voice of nature, but in revealed commandments—THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE TESTIMONY AGAINST THY NEIGHBOUR; and who has enforced obedience to them by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the unutterable bleſſings which ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their obſervance, and the awful puniſhments which ſhall await upon their tranſgreſſion. But it

ſeems, this is an age of reaſon, and the time and the perſon are at laſt arrived, that are to diſſipate the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors which have overſpread the paſt generations of ignorance. The believers in Chriſtianity are many, but it belongs to the few that are wiſe to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of reaſon, and ſuperior reaſon may, therefore, dictate to the weak. In run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the mind along the long liſt of ſincere and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians, I cannot help lamenting, that New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had not lived to this day, to have had his ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs filled up with this new flood of light.—But the ſubject is too awful for irony. I will ſpeak plainly and directly. Newton was a Chriſtian! Newton, whoſe mind burſt forth from the fetters caſt by nature upon our finite conceptions—Newton, whoſe ſcience was truth, and the foundation of whoſe knowledge of it was philoſophy—not thoſe viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and arrogant preſumptions, which too often uſurp its name, but philoſophy reſting upon the baſis of mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie—Newton, who carried the line and rule to the uttermoſt barriers of creation, and explored the principles by which, no doubt, all created matter is held together and exiſts. But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a minuter inveſtigation of the created things on this earth might have taught him, of the eſſence of his Creator. What ſhall then be ſaid of the great Mr. Boyle, who looked into the organic ſtructure of all matter, even to the brute inanimate ſubſtances which the foot treads on? Such a man may be ſuppoſed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine to look up through nature to nature's God. Yet the reſult of all his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>on was the moſt confirmed and devout belief in all which the other holds in contempt, as deſpicable and drivelling ſuperſtition.—But this error might, perhaps, ariſe from a want of due attention to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032093_0012_0FF11B17132590C8"/>
foundations of human judgment, and the ſtructure of that underſtanding which God has given us for the inveſtigation of truth.—Let that queſtion be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Mr. Locke, who was, to the higheſt pitch of devotion and adoration, a Chriſtian—Mr. Locke, whoſe office was to detect the errors of thinking, by going up to the fountains of thought, and to direct into the proper track of reaſoning, the devious mind of man, by ſhewing him its whole proceſs, from the firſt perceptions of ſenſe to the laſt concluſions of ratiocination, putting a rein beſides upon falſe opinion, by practical rules for the conduct of human judgment. But theſe men were only deep thinkers, and lived in their cloſets, unaccuſtomed to the traffic of the world, and to the laws which practically regulate mankind.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen! in the place were we now ſit to adminiſter the juſtice of this great country, above a century ago, the never-to-be-forgotten Sir Matthew Hale preſided; whoſe faith in Chriſtianity is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted commentary upon its truth and reaſon, and whoſe life was a glorious example of its fruits in man, adminiſtering human juſtice with a wiſdom and purity drawn from the pure fountain of the Chriſtian diſpenſation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a ſubject of the higheſt reverence and admiration. But it is ſaid by the author, that the Chriſtian fable is but the tale of the more ancient ſuperſtitions of the world, and may be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by a proper underſtanding of the mythologies of the Heathens. Did Milton underſtand thoſe mythologies? Was <hi>he</hi> leſs verſed than Mr. Paine in the ſuperſtitions of the world? No, they were the ſubject of his immortal ſong; and though ſhut out from all recurrence to them, he poured them forth from the ſtores of a memory rich with all that man ever knew, and laid them in their order as the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of that real and exalted faith, the unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

The reſult of his thinking was nevertheleſs not the ſame as the author's. The myſterious incarnation of our bleſſed Saviour (which this work blaſphemes in words ſo wholly unfit for the mouth of a Chriſtian, or for the ear of a court of juſtice, that I dare not, and will not, give them utterance) Milton made the grand concluſion of the <hi>Paradiſe Lost,</hi> the reſt from his finiſhed labours, and the ultimate hope, expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and glory of the world.</p>

                           <p>Againſt all this concurring teſtimony, we find ſuddenly, from the author of this book, that the Bible teaches nothing but "lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice." Has he ever read our Saviour's ſermon on the Mount, in which the great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our faith and duty are ſummed up?—Let us all but read and practiſe it; and lies, obſcenity, cruelty, and injuſtice, and all human wickedneſs, will be baniſhed from the world!"</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen! there is but one conſideration more, which I cannot poſſibly omit, becauſe I confeſs it affects me very deeply. The author of this book has written largely on public liberty and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this laſt performance has, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, been more widely circulated, and principally among thoſe who attached themſelves from principle to his former works. This circumſtance renders a public attack <hi>upon all revealed religion</hi> from ſuch a writer infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral ſenſe of the people of Great Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the veſſel of the ſtate amidſt the ſtorms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the maſs of the people were to be debauched from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion, which forms the true baſis of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been ſo long the national characteriſtic, inſtead of mixing myſelf, as I ſometimes have done, in political refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, I would rather retire to the uttermoſt
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032093_0015_0FF11B1F88F891E0"/>
corners of the earth, to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abuſes complained of in our own wiſe eſtabliſhment, but even the worſt government that ever exiſted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude ſet free from all the charities of Chriſtianity, who had no ſenſe of God's exiſtence, but from Mr. Paine's obſervation of nature, which the maſs of mankind have no leiſure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puniſhments, to animate the good in the glorious purſuit of human happineſs, nor to deter the wicked from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England better. They are a religious people, and, with the bleſſing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them ſo. I have no objections to the freeſt and moſt extended diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions upon doctrinal points of the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>though the law of England does not permit it,</hi> I do not dread the reaſoned arguments of Deiſts againſt the exiſtence of Chriſtianity itſelf, becauſe, as was ſaid by its divine Author, if it is of God it will ſtand. An intellectual book, however erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, addreſſed to the intellectual world upon ſo profound and complicated a ſubject, can never work the miſchief which this indictment is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to repreſs. Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by ſtudy, to a deeper inveſtigation of a ſubject well worthy of their deepeſt and continued contemplation. The powers of the mind are given for human improvement in the progreſs of human exiſtence. The changes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſuch reciprocations of lights and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences are certain in their progreſſions, and make their way imperceptibly, as conviction comes upon the world, by the final and irreſiſtible power of truth. If Chriſtianity be founded in falſehood, let us become Deiſts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no ſuch object, and no ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032093_0016_0FF11B211C3E1658"/>
capacity: it preſents no arguments to the wiſe and enlightened. On the contrary, it treats the faith and opinions of the wiſeſt with the moſt ſhocking contempt, and ſtirs up men, without the advantages of learning, or ſober thinking, to a total diſbelief of every thing hitherto held ſacred; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to a rejection of all the laws and ordinances of the ſtate, which ſtand only upon the aſſumption of their truth. Gentlemen, I cannot conclude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſſing the deepeſt regret at all attacks upon the Chriſtian religion by authors who profeſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the civil liberties of the world. For under what other auſpices than Chriſtianity have the loſt and ſubverted liberties of mankind in former ages been re-aſſerted? By what zeal, but the warm zeal of devout Chriſtians, have Engliſh liberties been redeemed and conſecrated? Under what other ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even in our own days, have liberty and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs been extending and ſpreading to the uttermoſt corners of the earth? What work of civilization, what commonwealth of greatneſs, has this bald religion of nature ever eſtabliſhed? We ſee, on the contrary, the nations that have no other light than that of nature to direct them, ſunk in barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, or ſlaves to arbitrary governments; whilſt, ſince the Chriſtian aera, the great career of the world has been ſlowly, but clearly advancing, lighter at every ſtep, from the awful prophecies of the Goſpel, and leading, I truſt, in the end to univerſal and eternal happineſs. Each generation of mankind can ſee but a few revolving links of this mighty and myſterious chain; but by doing our ſeveral duties in our allotted ſtations, we are ſure that we are fulfilling the purpoſes of our exiſtence. YOU, I truſt, will fulfil yours this day!</p>

            <p>A Mr. <hi>Fleming,</hi> one of the clerks of the Bank, was the only witneſs called on the part of the proſecution. He ſaid, he purchaſed the book in queſtion of the defendant, at his ſhop, on the 7th of February laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032093_0017_0FF11B22D186E0A0"/>The NOTICE which Mr. ERSKINE mentioned in his ſpeech was here read, and Mr. JOHN MARTIN, the attorney for the defendant, readily admitted that he had ſent it to thoſe who were concerned for the proſecution.</p>
            <p>Mr. KYD made a very learned and ingenious ſpeech for the defendant. He ſaid he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſcharge the important duty which he owed to his client, in a manner that was conſiſtent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and ſolemnity which, he felt, belonged to the ſubject. The queſtion was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expreſſed himſelf as he felt. He humbly ſubmitted, that the inferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, were ſuch as he might have drawn with a fair and honeſt intention. Whether thoſe inferences were juſt or not, was totally a different queſtion. But, if his lordſhip and the gentlemen of the jury could diſcover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puniſh a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked intention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely protected under the right which he and every other man had to exerciſe the powers of his mind in diſcuſſing any controverſial points of religion. Suppoſing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general propoſition, that it was alſo publiſhed with an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intention. At the ſame time he admitted, that what was ſo written, might be publiſhed from a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious motive, for which the publiſher would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned counſel next ſelected ſeveral paſſages from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, to ſhew, that the author felt the moſt profound reverence and veneration for the Supreme Being, and denied the truth of revelation only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not reconcile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was ſtated in that publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032093_0018_0FF11B26884FF9B8"/>
that the law of nature was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his Creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavoured to juſtify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of paſſages which he ſelected, but which, at the deſire of his lordſhip and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if thoſe paſſages were found in any other book, they would be conſidered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Dr. Lardner, Dr. Bentley, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent divines, in ſupport of the right of free diſcuſſion upon all ſubjects of a controverſial nature. He then ſpoke in ſevere terms of this proſecution, which, he ſaid, would never have been inſtituted, had it not been for Biſhop WATSON's APOLOGY, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to read the book, to which it was an anſwer; and to gratify that public curioſity, it was, that this book, which, he believed, had been firſt publiſhed at Paris, was afterwards publiſhed in this country. Mr. Kyd inſiſted, at great length, upon the freedom of inquiry, and a free preſs, and gave the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and revolution as two inſtances of the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable bleſſings which had reſulted from them to this country.</p>
            <p>Mr. ERSKINE made a moſt eloquent reply. He ſaid, he was bound, in reſpect to his learned friend, as a member of a moſt honourable profeſſion, to ſuppoſe, that he was placed in a very irkſome ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be called on for a defence ſo exceedingly difficult to make, and ſo extremely delicate to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, without violating that common decency that was due to a court of juſtice. He could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore help conſidering him as entitled to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of indulgence. Mr. Erſkine here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to ſeveral of the paſſages ſelected from the Old Teſtament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032093_0019_0FF11B291B6002C8"/>
reaſon of their introduction into the ſacred writings. The hiſtory of man he ſaid, was the hiſtory of man's vices and paſſions, which could not be cenſured without adverting to their exiſtence; and many of the inſtances that had been referred to, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as memorable warnings and examples for the inſtruction of mankind. Mr. E. next entered moſt forcibly and deeply into the evidences of Chriſtianity, particularly thoſe that were founded on that ſtupendous ſcheme of prophecy, which formed one of the moſt unanſwerable arguments for the truth of the Chriſtian religion. "It was not," he ſaid, "the purpoſe of God to deſtroy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irreſiſtible light and conviction of revelation, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illuſtrated in the accompliſhment of the divine promiſes of the Goſpel. Bred as he was to the conſideration of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he declared he conſidered the prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction of the Jewiſh nation, if there was nothing elſe to ſupport Chriſtianity, abſolutely irreſiſtible. The diviſion of the Jews into tribes, to preſerve the genealogy of Chriſt, the diſtinction of the tribe of Judah, from which he was to come; the loſs of that diſtinction when that end was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; the predicted departure of the ſceptre from Iſrael; the deſtruction of the temple of Jeruſalem, which imperial munificence in vain attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build to diſgrace the prophecy; the diſperſion of this nation over the face of the whole earth, the ſpreading of the Goſpel throughout the world; the perſecutions of its true miniſters, and the foretold ſuperſtitions which for ages had defiled its worſhip—theſe were topics upon which Mr. Erſkine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a moſt powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this proſecution. He ſaid, they were men of the higheſt character and greater conſideration in the country. Many of them

were charged with the offices of religion; others of them were clothed with the robes of magiſtracy; moſt of them were men of deep learning and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all of them juſtly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cauſe of religion and virtue.</p>

                        <p>"BEING now in poſſeſſion of all the facts of this caſe, and convinced, in my own mind, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ought to be drawn from them, I am not ſure, that it is neceſſary to ſay any thing at all to you upon the ſubject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on the merits of this or any other cauſe, it is proper to ſee whether the parties litigating ſtand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned counſel for the defendant thought fit to ſtate to you, with very conſiderable emphaſis, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous proſecution. I cannot help wiſhing that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had not been uttered. Who commenced this proſecution I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learned counſel who has juſt ſat down, I am inclined to ſuppoſe it proceeded from a ſociety of gentlemen inſtituted for the moſt important of all purpoſes, for preſerving the morals of the people; a ſociety compoſed of clergymen, and laymen of the moſt reſpectable character in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedneſs, which boldly raiſe their heads in defiance of the law of the land, were determined to ſee whether, in the firſt place, by admonition and advice, they could not ſtop the torrent of vice and immorality; and ſecondly, if that ſhould fail, to try what could be done by puniſhment. If people with the very beſt intentions carry on proſecutions that are oppreſſive, the end may not always perhaps

ſanctify the means. But the manner in which this proſecution has been conducted, is certainly not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive; for inſtead of proceeding in the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive mode, the proſecutors went before a grand jury of the country: and it was neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the opinion of that grand jury before the party could be put in proceſs.—Gentlemen! we ſit here in a Chriſtian aſſembly to adminiſter the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been ſanctioned by a great variety of legal deciſions. I am bound to ſtate to you what my predeceſſors in Mr. Woolſton's caſe (2 Strange, 834) ſtated half a century ago in this court, of which I am an humble member, namely, that the Chriſtian religion is part of the law of the land. Chriſtianity from its earlieſt inſtitution met with its oppoſers. Its profeſſors were very ſoon called upon to publiſh their apologies for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, and whether they had the advantage of their adverſaries, or ſunk under the ſuperiority of their arguments, mankind for near two thouſand years have had an opportunity of judging. They have ſeen what Julian, Juſtin Martyr, and other apologiſts have written, and have been of opinion the argument was in favour of thoſe very publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The world has been lately favoured with another apology from a moſt learned and reſpectable prelate, who calls his work <hi>An Apology for the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> I ſhall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications themſelves are in the hands of the world; and I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wiſh, in the concluding language of the work to which I have juſt referred (I do not affect to uſe the very words), I ſincerely wiſh that the author of the work in queſtion may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has ſo groſsly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that diſorder which he has endeavoured

to the utmoſt of his power to introduce into ſociety. We have heard to-day, that the light of nature, and the contemplation of the works of creation, are ſufficient, without any other revelation of the divine will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tully—each of them in their turns profeſſed they wanted other lights; and knowing and confeſſing that God was good, they took it for granted the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hoped their poſterity would almoſt ſee God face to face. This condition of mankind has met with reprehenſion to-day. But I ſhall not purſue this argument; fully impreſſed with the great truths of religion, which, thank God, I was taught in my early years to believe, and which the hour of reflection and inquiry, inſtead of producing any doubt, has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned counſel for the defendant would have differed the caſe of the publiſher from that of the author of this work; that he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publiſher. He has, however, to my utter ſurpriſe, exactly reverſed the caſe. He tells you it was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally publiſhed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great meaſure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publiſher, who has brought forth a ſtill-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured, in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works, to ſend it forth among the inhabitants of this country. Unleſs it was for the moſt malignant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I cannot conceive how it was publiſhed. It is however for you to judge of it, and to do juſtice between the public and defendant."</p>
