            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <p>THE charge of bla≈øphemy, which is put upon the record again≈øt the printer of this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not an accu≈øation of the ≈øervants of the crown, but comes before you ≈øanctioned by the oaths of a grand jury of the country. It ≈øtood for trial upon a former day; but it happening, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does, without any imputation upon the gentlemen named in the pannel, that a ≈øufficient number did not appear to con≈øtitute a full ≈øpecial jury, I thought it my duty to withdraw the cau≈øe from trial, till I could have the opportunity which is now open to me of addre≈ø≈øing my≈øelf to you, who were originally appointed to try it. I pur≈øued this cour≈øe, however, from no jealou≈øy of the common juries appointed by the laws for the ordinary ≈øervice of the court, ≈øince my whole life has been one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued experience of their virtues; but becau≈øe I thought it of great importance, that tho≈øe who were
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032093_0003_0FF11AFF99368F30"/>
to decide upon a cau≈øe ≈øo very momentous to the public, ≈øhould have the highe≈øt po≈ø≈øible qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the deci≈øion: that they ≈øhould not only be men capable from their educations of forming an enlightened judgment, but that their ≈øituations ≈øhould be ≈øuch as to bring them within the full view of their enlightened country, to which, in character and in e≈øtimation, they were in their own turns to be re≈øpon≈øible.</p>
                           <p>Not having the honour, Gentlemen, to be ≈øworn for the king as one of his coun≈øel, it has fallen much oftener to my lot to defend indictments for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, than to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the pro≈øecution of them. But I feel no embarra≈ø≈øment from that recollection; ≈øince I ≈øhall not be found to-day to expre≈øs a ≈øentiment, or to utter an expre≈ø≈øion, incon≈øi≈øtent with tho≈øe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable principles for which I have uniformly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the defence of others. Nothing that I have ever ≈øaid, either profe≈ø≈øionally or per≈øonally, for the liberty of the pre≈øs, do I mean to-day to contradict or counteract. On the contrary, I de≈øire to preface the very ≈øhort di≈øcour≈øe I have to make to you with reminding you, that it is your mo≈øt ≈øolemn duty to take care that it ≈øuffers no injury in your hands. A free and unlicen≈øed pre≈øs <hi>(in the ju≈øt and legal ≈øen≈øe of the expre≈ø≈øion)</hi> has led to all the ble≈ø≈øings both of religion and government, which Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or any part of the world at this moment enjoys, and is calculated ≈øtill farther to advance mankind to higher degrees of civilization and happine≈øs. But this freedom, like every other, mu≈øt be limited to be enjoyed, and like every human advantage, may be defeated by its abu≈øe.</p>
                           <p>Gentlemen! the defendant ≈øtands indicted for having publi≈øhed this book, which I have only read from the obligations of profe≈ø≈øional duty, and which I ro≈øe from the reading of with a≈øtoni≈øhment and di≈øgu≈øt. Standing here with all the privileges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the highe≈øt coun≈øel for the crown, I ≈øhall
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032093_0004_0FF11B02786EBF30"/>
be entitled to reply to any defence that ≈øhall be made for the publication. I ≈øhall wait with patience till I hear it. Indeed, if I were to anticipate the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which I hear and read of, it would be defaming by anticipation the learned coun≈øel who is to make it. For if I am to collect it, even from a formal notice given to the pro≈øecutors in the cour≈øe of the proceedings, I have to expect, that, in≈øtead of a defence conducted according to the rules and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Engli≈øh law and ju≈øtice, the foundation of all our laws, and the ≈øanctions of all our ju≈øtice, are to be ≈øtruck at and in≈øulted. What is the force of that juri≈ødiction which enables the court to ≈øit in judgment? What but the oath which his Lord≈øhip, as well as your≈øelves, have ≈øworn upon the go≈øpel to fulfil? Yet in the king's court, where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty is him≈øelf al≈øo ≈øworn to admini≈øter the ju≈øtice of England‚Äîin the king's court‚Äîwho receives his high authority under a ≈øolemn oath to maintain the Chri≈øtian religion, as it is promulgated by God in the Holy Scriptures, I am neverthele≈øs called upon as coun≈øel for the pro≈øecution, to produce a certain book de≈øcribed in the indictment to be the Holy Bible. No man de≈øerves to be upon the rolls of the court, who dares, as an attorney, to put his name to ≈øuch a notice. It is an in≈øult to the authority and dignity of the court of which he is an officer; ≈øince it ≈øeems to call in que≈øtion the very foundations of its juri≈ødiction. If this is to be the ≈øpirit and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the defence; if, as I collect from that array of books which are ≈øpread upon the benches behind me, this publication is to be vindicated by an attack of all the truths which the Chri≈øtian religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgates to mankind, let it be remembered that ≈øuch an argument was neither ≈øugge≈øted nor ju≈øtified by any thing ≈øaid by me on the part of the pro≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>In this ≈øtage of the proceedings,</hi> I ≈øhall call for reverence to the Sacred Scriptures, not from their merits, unbounded as they are, but from their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032093_0005_0FF0D3EDCC74C438"/>
in a Chri≈øtian country‚Äînot from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of con≈øcience, but from the rules of law. For my own part, Gentlemen, I have been ever deeply devoted to the truths of Chri≈øtianity; and my firm belief in the Holy Go≈øpel is by no means owing to the prejudices of education (though I was religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly educated by the be≈øt of parents), but ari≈øes from the fulle≈øt and mo≈øt continued reflections of my riper years and under≈øtanding. It forms at this moment the great con≈øolation of a life, which, as a ≈øhadow, mu≈øt pa≈øs away; and without it, indeed, I ≈øhould con≈øider my long cour≈øe of health and pro≈øperity (perhaps too long and too uninterrupted to be good for any man) only as the du≈øt which the wind ≈øcatters, and rather as a ≈ønare than as a ble≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Much, however, as I wi≈øh to ≈øupport the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture from a rea≈øoned con≈øideration of it, I ≈øhall repre≈øs that ≈øubject for the pre≈øent. But if the defence ≈øhall be as I have ≈øu≈øpected, to bring them at all into argument or que≈øtion, I ≈øhall then fulfil a duty which I owe not only to the court, as coun≈øel for the pro≈øecution, but to the public, to ≈øtate what I feel and know concerning the evidences of that religion which is reviled without being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and denied without being under≈øtood.</p>
                           <p>I am well aware that by the communications of a free pre≈øs, all the errors of mankind, from age to age, have been di≈ø≈øipated and di≈øpelled; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the world, under the banners of reformed Chri≈øtianity, has ≈øtruggled through per≈øecution to the noble eminence on which it ≈øtands at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ≈øhedding the ble≈ø≈øings of humanity and ≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the nations of the earth. It may be a≈øked, by what means the reformation would have been effected, if the books of the reformers had been ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, and the errors of condemned and exploded ≈øuper≈øtitions had been ≈øupported as unque≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable by the ≈øtate, founded upon tho≈øe very ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtitions formerly, as it is at pre≈øent upon the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032093_0006_0FF11B07AB828108"/>
of the e≈øtabli≈øhed church? Or how, upon ≈øuch principles, any reformation, civil or religious can in future be effected? The ≈øolution is ea≈øy:‚Äî Let us examine what are the genuine principles of the liberty of the pre≈øs, as they regard writings upon general ≈øubjects, unconnected with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonal reputations of private men, which are wholly foreign to the pre≈øent inquiry. They are full of ≈øimplicity, and are brought as near perfection, by the law of England, as, perhaps, is con≈øi≈øtent with any of the frail in≈øtitutions of mankind.</p>
                           <p>Although every community mu≈øt e≈øtabli≈øh ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authorities, founded upon fixed principles, and mu≈øt give high powers to magi≈øtrates to admini≈øter laws for the pre≈øervation of the government it≈øelf, and for the ≈øecurity of tho≈øe who are to be protected by it: yet, as infallibility and perfection belong neither to human e≈øtabli≈øhments nor to human indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, it ought to be the policy of all free e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhments, as it is mo≈øt peculiarly the principle of our own con≈øtitution, to permit the mo≈øt unbounded freedom of di≈øcu≈ø≈øion, even by detecting errors in the con≈øtitution or admini≈øtration of the very govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it≈øelf, ≈øo as that decorum is ob≈øerved, which every ≈øtate mu≈øt exact from its ≈øubjects, and which impo≈øes no re≈øtraint upon any intellectual compo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fairly, hone≈øtly, and decently addre≈ø≈øed to the con≈øciences and under≈øtandings of men. Upon this principle, I have an unque≈øtionable right (a right which the be≈øt ≈øubjects have exerci≈øed) to examine the principles and ≈øtructure of the con≈øtitution, and by fair, manly rea≈øoning, to que≈øtion the practice of its admini≈øtrators. I have a right to con≈øider and to point out errors in the one or in the other; and not merely to rea≈øon upon their exi≈øtence, but to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the means of their reformation. By ≈øuch free, well-intentioned, mode≈øt, and dignified communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ≈øentiments and opinions, all nations have been gradually improved, and milder laws and purer
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032093_0007_0FF11B0A8B018528"/>
religions have been e≈øtabli≈øhed. The ≈øame princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which vindicate civil contentions hone≈øtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, extend their protection to the ≈øharpe≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øies on religious faiths. This rational and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal cour≈øe of improvement was recognized and ratified by Lord Kenyon, as the law of England, in a late trial at Guildhall, when he looked back with gratitude to the labours of the reformers, as the fountains of our religious emancipation, and of the civil ble≈ø≈øings that followed in their train. The Engli≈øh con≈øtitution, indeed, does not ≈øtop ≈øhort in the toleration of religious <hi>opinions,</hi> but liberally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it to <hi>practice.</hi> It permits every man, EVEN PUBLICLY to wor≈øhip God according to his own con≈øcience, though in marked di≈ø≈øent from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional e≈øtabli≈øhment, ≈øo as he profe≈ø≈øes the general faith, which is the ≈øanction of all our moral duties, and the only pledge of our ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to the ≈øy≈øtem which con≈øtitutes a ≈øtate. Is not this ≈øy≈øtem of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of controver≈øy, and freedom of wor≈øhip, ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for all the purpo≈øes of human happine≈øs and improvement? And can it be nece≈ø≈øary for either, that the law ≈øhould hold out indemnity to tho≈øe who wholly abjure and revile the government of their country, or the religion on which it re≈øts for its foundation? I expect to hear, in an≈øwer to what I am now ≈øaying, much that will offend me. My learned friend, from the difficulties of his ≈øituation, which I know, from experience, how to feel for very ≈øincerely, may be driven to advance propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which it may be my duty, with much freedom, to reply to; and the law will ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This is ju≈øt the di≈øtinction between a book of free legal controver≈øy and the book which I am arraigning before you. Every man has a legal right to inve≈øtigate, with mode≈øty and decency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øial points of the Chri≈øtian religion; but no man, con≈øi≈øtently with a law, which only exi≈øts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its ≈øanctions, has a right not only broadly to deny its very exi≈øtence, but to pour forth a ≈øhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and in≈øulting invective, which the lowe≈øt e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhments in the gradations of civil authority ought not to be permitted to ≈øuffer, and which ≈øoon would be borne down by in≈øolence and di≈øobedience, if they did.</p>
                           <p>The ≈øame principle pervades the whole ≈øy≈øtem of the law, not merely in its ab≈øtract theory, but in its daily and mo≈øt applauded practice.‚ÄîThe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe between the ≈øexes, and which, properly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, not only continues, but humanizes and adorns our natures, is the foundation of all the thou≈øand romances, plays, and novels, which are in the hands of every body. Some of them lead to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every virtuous principle; others, though with the ≈øame profe≈ø≈øion, addre≈øs the imagination in a manner to lead the pa≈ø≈øions into dangerous exce≈ø≈øes. But though the law does not nicely di≈øcriminate the various ≈øhades which di≈øtingui≈øh the≈øe works from one another, ≈øo as that it ≈øuffers many to pa≈øs, through its liberal ≈øpirit, that upon principle might be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed, would it or does it tolerate, or does any decent man contend that it ought to pa≈øs by unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed, libels of the mo≈øt ≈øhamele≈øs ob≈øcenity, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly pointed to debauch innocence, and to bla≈øt and poi≈øon the morals of the ri≈øing generation?

This circum≈øtance renders a public attack <hi>upon all revealed religion</hi> from ≈øuch a writer infinitely more dangerous. The religious and moral ≈øen≈øe of the people of Great Britain, is the great anchor which alone can hold the ve≈ø≈øel of the ≈øtate amid≈øt the ≈øtorms which agitate the world; and if I could believe for a moment, that the ma≈øs of the people were to be debauched from the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of religion, which forms the true ba≈øis of that humanity, charity, and benevolence, that has been ≈øo long the national characteri≈øtic, in≈øtead of mixing my≈øelf, as I ≈øometimes have done, in political refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, I would rather retire to the uttermo≈øt

corners of the earth, to avoid their agitation; and would bear, not only the imperfections and abu≈øes complained of in our own wi≈øe e≈øtabli≈øhment, but even the wor≈øt government that ever exi≈øted in the world, rather than go to the work of reformation with a multitude ≈øet free from all the charities of Chri≈øtianity, who had no ≈øen≈øe of God's exi≈øtence, but from Mr. Paine's ob≈øervation of nature, which the ma≈øs of mankind have no lei≈øure to contemplate; nor any belief of future rewards and puni≈øhments, to animate the good in the glorious pur≈øuit of human happine≈øs, nor to deter the wicked from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroying it even in its birth. But I know the people of England better. They are a religious people, and, with the ble≈ø≈øing of God, as far as it is in my power, I will lend my aid to keep them ≈øo. I have no objections to the free≈øt and mo≈øt extended di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈ø≈øions upon doctrinal points of the Chri≈øtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>though the law of England does not permit it,</hi> I do not dread the rea≈øoned arguments of Dei≈øts again≈øt the exi≈øtence of Chri≈øtianity it≈øelf, becau≈øe, as was ≈øaid by its divine Author, if it is of God it will ≈øtand. An intellectual book, however erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, addre≈ø≈øed to the intellectual world upon ≈øo profound and complicated a ≈øubject, can never work the mi≈øchief which this indictment is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to repre≈øs. Such works will only employ the minds of men enlightened by ≈øtudy, to a deeper inve≈øtigation of a ≈øubject well worthy of their deepe≈øt and continued contemplation.

If Chri≈øtianity be founded in fal≈øehood, let us become Dei≈øts in this manner, and I am contented. But this book has no ≈øuch object, and no ≈øuch

He ≈øaid he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to di≈øcharge the important duty which he owed to his client, in a manner that was con≈øi≈øtent with the dignity of that court, and with that decency and ≈øolemnity which, he felt, belonged to the ≈øubject. The que≈øtion was, whether the author, when he wrote this book, felt as he wrote, and expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf as he felt. He humbly ≈øubmitted, that the inferences which Mr. Paine had drawn from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, were ≈øuch as he might have drawn with a fair and hone≈øt intention. Whether tho≈øe inferences were ju≈øt or not, was totally a different que≈øtion. But, if his lord≈øhip and the gentlemen of the jury could di≈øcover no wicked or malicious intent, they would not puni≈øh a man for a mere error in judgment. If the jury could collect no wicked intention in the author from reading the whole of this performance, he contended he was completely protected under the right which he and every other man had to exerci≈øe the powers of his mind in di≈øcu≈ø≈øing any controver≈øial points of religion. Suppo≈øing then the book had been written innocently, he might infer, as a general propo≈øition, that it was al≈øo publi≈øhed with an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intention. At the ≈øame time he admitted, that what was ≈øo written, might be publi≈øhed from a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious motive, for which the publi≈øher would be amenable to the laws of his country. The learned coun≈øel next ≈øelected ≈øeveral pa≈ø≈øages from this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, to ≈øhew, that the author felt the mo≈øt profound reverence and veneration for the Supreme Being, and denied the truth of revelation only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he could not reconcile it to the character and attributes of the Deity. It was ≈øtated in that publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032093_0018_0FF11B26884FF9B8"/>
that the law of nature was engraven on every man's heart, and that he might clearly collect the knowledge of that duty which he owed to his Creator from a contemplation of his works. Mr. Kyd next endeavoured to ju≈øtify the charges made upon the Bible by the author, by a variety of pa≈ø≈øages which he ≈øelected, but which, at the de≈øire of his lord≈øhip and the jury, he did not read, but only referred to them, and contended, that if tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øages were found in any other book, they would be con≈øidered as indecent and immoral. He appealed to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Dr. Lardner, Dr. Bentley, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent divines, in ≈øupport of the right of free di≈øcu≈ø≈øion upon all ≈øubjects of a controver≈øial nature. He then ≈øpoke in ≈øevere terms of this pro≈øecution, which, he ≈øaid, would never have been in≈øtituted, had it not been for Bi≈øhop WATSON's APOLOGY, which had been very widely circulated, and had excited a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio≈øity to read the book, to which it was an an≈øwer; and to gratify that public curio≈øity, it was, that this book, which, he believed, had been fir≈øt publi≈øhed at Paris, was afterwards publi≈øhed in this country. Mr. Kyd in≈øi≈øted, at great length, upon the freedom of inquiry, and a free pre≈øs, and gave the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and revolution as two in≈øtances of the ine≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable ble≈ø≈øings which had re≈øulted from them to this country.</p>
            <p>Mr. ERSKINE made a mo≈øt eloquent reply. He ≈øaid, he was bound, in re≈øpect to his learned friend, as a member of a mo≈øt honourable profe≈ø≈øion, to ≈øuppo≈øe, that he was placed in a very irk≈øome ≈øitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be called on for a defence ≈øo exceedingly difficult to make, and ≈øo extremely delicate to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, without violating that common decency that was due to a court of ju≈øtice. He could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore help con≈øidering him as entitled to a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of indulgence. Mr. Er≈økine here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to ≈øeveral of the pa≈ø≈øages ≈øelected from the Old Te≈øtament by Mr. Kyd, and explained the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032093_0019_0FF11B291B6002C8"/>
rea≈øon of their introduction into the ≈øacred writings. The hi≈øtory of man he ≈øaid, was the hi≈øtory of man's vices and pa≈ø≈øions, which could not be cen≈øured without adverting to their exi≈øtence; and many of the in≈øtances that had been referred to, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded as memorable warnings and examples for the in≈øtruction of mankind. Mr. E. next entered mo≈øt forcibly and deeply into the evidences of Chri≈øtianity, particularly tho≈øe that were founded on that ≈øtupendous ≈øcheme of prophecy, which formed one of the mo≈øt unan≈øwerable arguments for the truth of the Chri≈øtian religion. "It was not," he ≈øaid, "the purpo≈øe of God to de≈øtroy free agency by overpowering the human mind with the irre≈øi≈øtible light and conviction of revelation, but to leave men to collect its truths, as they were gradually illu≈øtrated in the accompli≈øhment of the divine promi≈øes of the Go≈øpel. Bred as he was to the con≈øideration of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he declared he con≈øidered the prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the de≈øtruction of the Jewi≈øh nation, if there was nothing el≈øe to ≈øupport Chri≈øtianity, ab≈øolutely irre≈øi≈øtible. The divi≈øion of the Jews into tribes, to pre≈øerve the genealogy of Chri≈øt, the di≈øtinction of the tribe of Judah, from which he was to come; the lo≈øs of that di≈øtinction when that end was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed; the predicted departure of the ≈øceptre from I≈ørael; the de≈øtruction of the temple of Jeru≈øalem, which imperial munificence in vain attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build to di≈øgrace the prophecy; the di≈øper≈øion of this nation over the face of the whole earth, the ≈øpreading of the Go≈øpel throughout the world; the per≈øecutions of its true mini≈øters, and the foretold ≈øuper≈øtitions which for ages had defiled its wor≈øhip‚Äîthe≈øe were topics upon which Mr. Er≈økine expatiated with great eloquence, and produced a mo≈øt powerful effect on every part of the audience. He concluded with a vindication of the authors of this pro≈øecution. He ≈øaid, they were men of the highe≈øt character and greater con≈øideration in the country. Many of them
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032093_0020_0FF11B2AB48B10A8"/>
were charged with the offices of religion; others of them were clothed with the robes of magi≈øtracy; mo≈øt of them were men of deep learning and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all of them ju≈øtly entitled to the thanks of the public for their noble exertions in the cau≈øe of religion and virtue.</p>

                        <p>"BEING now in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all the facts of this ca≈øe, and convinced, in my own mind, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion ought to be drawn from them, I am not ≈øure, that it is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øay any thing at all to you upon the ≈øubject. Gentlemen, before you proceed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on the merits of this or any other cau≈øe, it is proper to ≈øee whether the parties litigating ≈øtand in a fair light before you. I was extremely hurt when the learned coun≈øel for the defendant thought fit to ≈øtate to you, with very con≈øiderable empha≈øis, and a very determined tone of voice, that this was a ≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous pro≈øecution. I cannot help wi≈øhing that ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had not been uttered. Who commenced this pro≈øecution I certainly know not. But from what fell from the very learned coun≈øel who has ju≈øt ≈øat down, I am inclined to ≈øuppo≈øe it proceeded from a ≈øociety of gentlemen in≈øtituted for the mo≈øt important of all purpo≈øes, for pre≈øerving the morals of the people; a ≈øociety compo≈øed of clergymen, and laymen of the mo≈øt re≈øpectable character in the kingdom, who, feeling how the country is overrun with profligacy and wickedne≈øs, which boldly rai≈øe their heads in defiance of the law of the land, were determined to ≈øee whether, in the fir≈øt place, by admonition and advice, they could not ≈øtop the torrent of vice and immorality; and ≈øecondly, if that ≈øhould fail, to try what could be done by puni≈øhment. If people with the very be≈øt intentions carry on pro≈øecutions that are oppre≈ø≈øive, the end may not always perhaps
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032093_0021_0FF11B2C6B70E150"/>
≈øanctify the means. But the manner in which this pro≈øecution has been conducted, is certainly not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive; for in≈øtead of proceeding in the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øive mode, the pro≈øecutors went before a grand jury of the country: and it was nece≈ø≈øary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the opinion of that grand jury before the party could be put in proce≈øs.‚ÄîGentlemen! we ≈øit here in a Chri≈øtian a≈ø≈øembly to admini≈øter the laws of the land, and I am to take my knowledge of what the law is from that which has been ≈øanctioned by a great variety of legal deci≈øions. I am bound to ≈øtate to you what my predece≈ø≈øors in Mr. Wool≈øton's ca≈øe (2 Strange, 834) ≈øtated half a century ago in this court, of which I am an humble member, namely, that the Chri≈øtian religion is part of the law of the land. Chri≈øtianity from its earlie≈øt in≈øtitution met with its oppo≈øers. Its profe≈ø≈øors were very ≈øoon called upon to publi≈øh their apologies for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they had embraced. In what manner they did that, and whether they had the advantage of their adver≈øaries, or ≈øunk under the ≈øuperiority of their arguments, mankind for near two thou≈øand years have had an opportunity of judging. They have ≈øeen what Julian, Ju≈øtin Martyr, and other apologi≈øts have written, and have been of opinion the argument was in favour of tho≈øe very publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The world has been lately favoured with another apology from a mo≈øt learned and re≈øpectable prelate, who calls his work <hi>An Apology for the Chri≈øtian Religion.</hi> I ≈øhall not decide between the merits of the one and the other. The publications them≈øelves are in the hands of the world; and I ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely wi≈øh, in the concluding language of the work to which I have ju≈øt referred (I do not affect to u≈øe the very words), I ≈øincerely wi≈øh that the author of the work in que≈øtion may become a partaker of that faith in revealed religion, which he has ≈øo gro≈øsly defamed, and may be enabled to make his peace with God for that di≈øorder which he has endeavoured

to the utmo≈øt of his power to introduce into ≈øociety. We have heard to-day, that the light of nature, and the contemplation of the works of creation, are ≈øufficient, without any other revelation of the divine will. Socrates, Plato, Xenophon, Tully‚Äîeach of them in their turns profe≈ø≈øed they wanted other lights; and knowing and confe≈ø≈øing that God was good, they took it for granted the time would come when he would impart a farther revelation of his will to mankind. Though they walked as it were through a cloud, darkly, they hoped their po≈øterity would almo≈øt ≈øee God face to face. This condition of mankind has met with reprehen≈øion to-day. But I ≈øhall not pur≈øue this argument; fully impre≈ø≈øed with the great truths of religion, which, thank God, I was taught in my early years to believe, and which the hour of reflection and inquiry, in≈øtead of producing any doubt, has fully confirmed me in. I expected the learned coun≈øel for the defendant would have differed the ca≈øe of the publi≈øher from that of the author of this work; that he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince you that whatever guilt might belong to the author, nothing was imputable to the publi≈øher. He has, however, to my utter ≈øurpri≈øe, exactly rever≈øed the ca≈øe. He tells you it was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally publi≈øhed at Paris in 1794; that the feelings of the author's friends were wounded by this work, which I call a nefarious publication, and that it was in a great mea≈øure forgotten; and you are now called upon to judge of the merits or demerits of the publi≈øher, who has brought forth a ≈øtill-born work, forgotten by every body, till he ventured, in defiance of the verdicts of mankind on the author's political works, to ≈øend it forth among the inhabitants of this country. Unle≈øs it was for the mo≈øt malignant pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes, I cannot conceive how it was publi≈øhed. It is however for you to judge of it, and to do ju≈øtice between the public and defendant."</p>
