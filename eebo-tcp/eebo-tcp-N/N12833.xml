         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the peruſal of the following pages thou wilt receive a pious man's plain account of his beginning in the weighty work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his progreſs in a life devoted to promote the cauſe of righteouſneſs, and the real happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>Having experienced the Spiritual baptiſm which is eſſential to ſalvation, and abiding in a ſtate of watchfulneſs and humility, he became, under the Lord's Anointing, a well qualified inſtrument for the inſtruction and edification of others in the way of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and by attending to the gift of Goſpel miniſtry committed to his truſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duties required of him, he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed a growth from ſtature to ſtature, and attained to be an upright elder and father in the church, <hi>being an example to the believers in word in converſation, in ſpirit, in faith, and charity.</hi>

premiſed reſpecting the deceaſed; but as the enſuing narrative will be likely to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the obſervation of many to whom he was either little known, or wholly a ſtranger, it ſeems neceſſary for the information of ſuch enquirers, to make known the eſtimation in which he was held by his brethren with whom he was connected in religious ſociety, who have given full declaration of their chriſtian unity and fellowſhip with him, and that his life and conduct adorned the doctrine of the Goſpel, which he was concerned to publiſh.</p>
            <p>The monthly and quarterly-meetings of which he was a member from their firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and who were many years partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his pious example and labours, after recounting divers of his viſits abroad, which are fully related by himſelf, teſtify, that</p>

               <p>Altho' he was of a weakly conſtitution, and often infirm, eſpecially in the latter part of his life, yet he appeared to be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the ſervice of Truth and the good of mankind, and gave up his time for that purpoſe, when he apprehended it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, being favoured with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of outward things, and we believe he ſtood looſe from the world, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, not ſeeking, but refraining op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities he might have had to get out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward riches; he viſited neighbouring year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, quarterly, and other meetings of friends at times to his laſt year, and was truly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

in the diſcipline of the church, having a valuable gift in that reſpect, and was a good example in a diligent care to attend all the meetings both for worſhip and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to which he belonged, cautious of being forward in his public appearances, and for the moſt part exampled us to ſilence in our meetings at home, eſpecially in the latter part of his time; yet when he did appear in teſtimony we think it may be truly ſaid his doctrine dropt as the dew, being lively, and edifying to the honeſt hearted, tho' cloſe, and ſearching to the careleſs profeſſors, as well as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and hypocritical.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Was born in the Townſhip of Nottingham, in the County of Cheſter, and Province of Pennſylvania, on the Fourth Day of the Sixth Month, 1705, and was tenderly brought up in profeſſion of the Truth by my parents, JOHN and HANNAH CHURCHMAN, who were diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Religious Meetings, both on the firſt, and other days of the week, and encouragers of their children in that practice, which is certainly a duty
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:016223_0008_0F9BD435B022D488"/>
in parents ſo to do, and often owned by the reaches of Divine Love, even to thoſe who are very young in years, of which I am a living Witneſs; for tho' I early felt reproof for bad words and actions, yet knew not whence it came, until about the age of eight years, as I ſat in a ſmall meeting, the Lord by the reaches of his heavenly love, and goodneſs, ſo overcame and tendered my heart, and by his glorious light diſcovered to me the knowledge of himſelf, that I ſaw myſelf, and what I had been doing, and what it was which had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved me for evil, and was made in the ſecret of my heart to confeſs that, childhood and youth, and the fooliſh actions and words, to which they are propenſe, are truly vanity; yet bleſſed for ever be the name of the Lord! who in his infinite mercy and goodneſs clearly informed me, that if I would mind the diſcoveries of his Truth, and pure Light for the future, what I had done in the time of my ignorance, he would wink at and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; and Oh! the ſtream of Love which filled my heart with ſolid Joy at that time, and laſted for many days, is beyond all expreſſion; indeed I was early taught to think different from ſuch who hold the perdition of infants, and am ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in fully believing that the ſin of our firſt parents is not imputed to us, (tho' as their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring we are by nature prone to evil, which brings wrath) until by the diſcovery of light and grace, we are taught to diſtinguiſh between good and evil, and in the ſeed and inward principle that ſheweth the evil, we feel the enmity placed againſt the evil, and the author thereof, the devil, or wicked one; if we afterwards commit thoſe things which we ſaw to be evil, we then fall under condemnation, and wrath, and here every ſoul that ſins muſt die to the ſin he hath committed, and witneſs the being
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:016223_0009_0F9BD43651354600"/>
raiſed again by the power of God, into newneſs of life in CHRIST JESUS, not to live to himſelf, to fulfil the will of the fleſh; but to live unto him, who died to take away ſin.</p>
               <p>I may not forget to relate this one thing; my father ſent me about three miles on an errand; I rode a mare which had a colt perhaps half a year old; on my return home, the colt ran-away from the mare to a company of wild horſes, which were feeding not far from the path I was in, ſo I went home without the colt; my father aſked me where the colt was, I told him where it went from me; he bid me go to the place with ſpeed, that it might follow the mare home; I went, and found the wild horſes feeding on a piece of ground where the timber trees had been killed perhaps about two, or three years; but before I went among the dead trees, a mighty wind aroſe, which blew ſome down, and many limbs flew about; I ſtood ſtill with my mind turned inward to the Lord, who I believed was able to preſerve me from hurt; ſo I paſſed among the trees without fear, ſave the fear of the Lord, which fills the hearts of his humble depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children, with love that is ſtronger than death; I found the colt, which readily followed the mare, and I returned home with great bowedneſs of heart, and thankfulneſs to the Lord, for his mercy and goodneſs to me on this occaſion.</p>
               <p>It was my practice when I went to bed, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how I had ſpent the paſt day, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to feel the preſence of the Lord near, which I did for ſome conſiderable time prefer to all other things, and I found this practice a great help to ſleep ſweetly, and by long experience I can recommend it to children, and thoſe alſo of riper age.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe that no one living knew my condition; for I delighted to keep hidden, yet quick to obſerve

the conduct of others; I remember that a perſon once at my father's who ſpake about religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with an affected tone, as if he was a good man; when he went away, I was near him, and when he mounted his horſe, taking a diſlike to ſome of his motions, he called him an ugly dumb beaſt, with ſuch an accent, as beſpake great diſpleaſure, and grieved me much; for I did believe, that a man whoſe mind was ſweetened with divine love truly, would not ſpeak wrathfully, or diminutively, even of the beaſts of the field, which were given to man for his uſe, he did not make them himſelf; I relate this inſtance, that it may be a warning to all, that they be careful of giving offence to the little ones.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding I had been favoured as before mentioned; yet as I grew in years, I was much given to play, and began to delight again in ſeveral things, for which I had before been reproved, and ſtill by the divine witneſs in my mind, was brought under judgment for; but having loſt my innocence and covering of the pure bleſſed ſpirit, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured through fear to fly from the voice of the holy ſpirit in my own heart; the enemy perſuaded me, that I could never be reſtored to my former ſtate, becauſe I had ſinned againſt ſo great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or if I was, the judgment through which I muſt paſs, would be intolerable to bear, ſo that I had better be chearful, and take my eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; but when I was about nine years old, my father ſent me to ſchool to learn to read, (having been taught to know my letters, and ſpell a little at home) in which I took great delight, and thereby diverted myſelf from feeling my pain of mind, for the great loſs of my innocence which I had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and altho' the man, by whom I was taught, was poor, and ſat in his loom, being a weaver, while the children read to him, I improved very

faſt, and he ſoon put me to writing, and finding my capacity full as ripe as is common in boys of that age, he began to teach me Arithmetic; yet gracious goodneſs ſtill favored me with conviction, and by his ſpirit was witneſs againſt me, and in mercy the Lord viſited me with a ſore fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by his rod of correction brought me a little more to myſelf; this was in the forepart of the winter, when I was between nine, and ten years of age, and being pretty well recovered for ſome weeks, I had in the following ſpring a relapſe of the ſame diſorder, (the pleuriſy) in which, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward correction with ſickneſs, and inward judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was pleaſed to draw me to himſelf, which cauſed me to renew my covenant with him, and I did hope never more to ſtray from him, to follow lying vanities, whoſe ſweets I had experienced to be bitter, yea exceeding bitterneſs in the end. I had taken great delight from a child to play with whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and pipes, made of the bark of ſmall branches of trees, and of ſtraws of wheat and rye; but now it grieved me to obſerve children delight therein, and I ventured to tell my mind to ſome of them concerning ſuch things</p>
               <p>Man is diſtinguiſhed from other creatures not only by his voice; but by varying the breath toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the orderly motion of tongue and lips; that voice is made to convey the ideas of the mind, and thoughts of the heart to his fellow-creatures, and as he was created to glorify his maker, the end and intention of his voice ſhould be directed to promote his glory among men; whether in things natural, or ſpiritual, that is of this life, or that to come; muſic as now commonly uſed, and whiſtling and ſinging, have no ſuch tendency; but are rather diverſions of the mind from what it ought to be employed about, and therefore a baſe comſumption
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016223_0012_0F9BD43D5D40EC10"/>
of precious time, which man muſt be accountable for, which if enough regarded, inſtead of muſic, whiſtling, and ſinging merry, fooliſh, and prophane ſongs, many would have occaſion to lament and weep for their miſpent time. I leave it as a caution to parents, to beware of indulging their dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in any thing, which may impreſs their tender minds with a deſire after muſic, or ſuch diverſion when they grow in years; but that inſtead thereof, by living in the pure fear of the Lord, and near the ſpirit of truth in their own hearts, they may be furniſhed with example, and precept to direct the minds of their offspring, to attend to the voice of him who called to Samuel in days of old, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be the ſame teacher to his people in this age; may his holy name be magnifyed for ever, and ever!</p>
               <p>I retained my care, and circumſpection for ſome time; but through unwatchfulneſs, and a deſire for play which led into lightneſs, and forgetfulneſs, I loſt this ſtate before I was twelve years of age, and tho' the Lord was near, and followed me by his reproof, in order to bring me under judgment, I fled from it as much as I could; having let in a belief, that as I had been favoured to taſte in ſo wonderful a manner, "of the good word of Life, and power of the world to come, and had ſo ſhamefully fallen away, there remained for me, no more ſacrifice for ſin; but a fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation," which as I thought ſeemed to burn in me to that degree, that I was afraid to be alone, for it ſeemed to be loudly proclaimed in me, that whether I eat, or drank, waked, or ſlept I was accurſed, and when alone I abhorred myſelf; but when in company uſed my utmoſt endeavors to hide my condition, by being chearful and arch in my diſcourſe, and was thought by moſt young people to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016223_0013_0F9BD43E6B37C820"/>
have a knack as they called it, at jeſting and witty turns; yet even in this time, I entertained ſuch a value for religion, that I was not willing to reveal my ſituation; leſt I ſhould be a reproach thereto, or diſcourage others from ſeeking happineſs; but when night came, and I went to bed, no tongue can expreſs the anguiſh I felt, afraid to lay awake, and afraid to deſire ſleep, leſt I ſhould be cut off from the land of the living, and my portion appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in utter darkneſs; I ſo far neglected my learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that when about thirteen years old, I could not read but in a poor manner, tho' once noted to be a ready reader; I was not willing that good friends ſhould take notice of me, or look me ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in the face; for I thought they would diſcern my wickedneſs, and it would be a trouble to them, or by their reproving me, add to my diſtreſs; I ſeemed to be left without any power to reſiſt what I knew to be evil, and being aſhamed that I had ſo loſt my little learning, I ſought to divert myſelf by endeavouring to regain it; my former genius, and delight ſo returned, that when I was about fifteen years of age, I had made great improvement, not only in reading, but in writing, and arithmetick, and ſeveral branches of the mathematicks, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to value myſelf in ſome degree thereon, and ſo got over the convictions of the divine witneſs, which ſpoke trouble in me; nevertheleſs during this time I kept cloſe in attending meetings, hoping at ſeaſons, that perhaps the Lord would condeſcend once more to viſit me; for a ſaying of an eminent pious man was revived in my remembrance
<q>That if there remained a deſire in the heart after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, as it was kept to, the Lord would again aſſuredly viſit ſuch in his own time.</q>
So that I was fearful of neglecting meetings, if my parents had not forwarded me, leſt I might miſs of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016223_0014_0F9BD43E82DECD60"/>
the good intended for me; yet the ſubtle working of the power of darkneſs was at times very great, ſuggeſting to me that all things came by nature, and that there was no God, no heaven, no devil; no puniſhment for evil, religion a jeſt, and painful care about futurity a ſilly whim, propagated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive people of pleaſure; but bleſſed be the Lord! he preſerved me from that ſnare, for while I felt his judgment for ſin, I believed in his Being, and holineſs, and I am indeed fully of the mind, that no man can be an Atheiſt before he acts contrary to knowledge, when to allay the horror, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of mind, he feels for the commiſſion of ſin, he cloſes in with this temptation. At other times, the ſame ſubtle power would tempt me to diſpair of mercy, which if given way to, would lead to diſtraction; but the hand of the Lord was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, tho' for my diſobedience he ſuffered me to remain in the wilderneſs, and to dwell among fiery ſerpents, until he had waſted that in me, which luſted after forbidden things.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate I continued until I was about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age, and as I was walking one day to meeting, thinking on my forlorn condition, and remembring the bread in my heavenly Father's houſe, when I was a dutiful child, and that by ſtraying from him, and ſpending my portion, I had been eight years in grievous want, I inwardly cried, if thou art pleaſed again to viſit me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee Oh Lord! viſit my body with ſickneſs, or pain, or whatever thou may pleaſe, ſo that the will of the old man may be ſlain with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and every thing in me, that thy contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy is againſt, that I may be made a ſanctified veſſel by thy power; ſpare only my life, until my redemption is wrought, and my peace made with thee!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016223_0015_0F9BD43F41AE57F8"/>About this time my father died in the tenth month, 1724, which was a great loſs to our whole family, and as he had allotted me to live with, and take care of my mother, it became my duty to keep moſtly at home; I ſpent near a year much in the condition above mentioned; often out of hope of ever attaining to that ſtate, I had witneſſed when very young; but in the fall of the year after I had arrived to the age of 20 years; it pleaſed the Lord to remember me, who had been an Exile, in cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity under the old taſkmaſter in Egypt ſpiritually, and by his righteous judgments mixed with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercies, to make way for my deliverance; I was viſited with a ſore fit of ſickneſs, which in a few days ſo fully awakened me, that I had no hope of ever being again intruſted with health; my miſpent time, and all my tranſgreſſions were brought to my remembrance, and heavy judgment was upon me for them; I was met with in this narrow path, and could no longer fly from God and his ſpirit in my conſcience, whoſe ſore diſpleaſure I had juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. I had heard of men who had been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders, and fled from the juſtice of the common law, until they became out-lawed; ſuch in a ſpiritual ſenſe my caſe appeared to be; I thought I had as it were heard an act of grace and free pardon repeatedly proclaimed, if I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and live uprightly for the future; but in the time of ſuch viſitations, I concluded it was only to bring me under judgment to take me from my pleaſure, for that mine offences would never be pardoned, and ſo I had withſtood, or neglected thoſe viſitations; I now ſaw clearly, that herein I had followed the lying ſuggeſtions of ſatan mine enemy: At this time my old will in the fallen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gave up it's life, and I cryed, "<hi>I am not worthy to live or enjoy favour, yet Oh Lord! if thou wilt be pleaſed to look on me with an eye of pitty, do

what thou wilt with me, magnify thy own name, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me by thy judgments and power that thy mercy may be ſhewn in and by me, whether thou cut the thread of my life, or ſhall grant me more days, which is only in thy power;</hi>" now my heart was made exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tender, I wept much, and an evidence was given me, that the Lord had heard my cry, and in mercy looked down on me from his holy habitation, and a willing heart and patience was given me to bear his chaſtiſements and the working of his eternal word of power, which created all things at the beginning, and by which poor fallen man only is created a new in the heavenly Image, and prepared to praiſe him with acceptance, who lives for ever, and ever.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I lay in this condition, perhaps I was thought by thoſe who watched with me to be near expiring; but tho' I ſaid little or nothing, I believe I was quite ſenſible, yet exceedingly weakened, having for about twenty-four hours felt more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and inexpreſſible anguiſh, than outward pain, which was no doubt great; I take it to be toward the morning of the fifth day and night of my illneſs, that I felt the incomes and owning of divine love in a greater degree than ever; for the proſpect I had of ſo great forgiveneſs made me love the more; for love is ever reciprocal. I remember, that I ſaw the morning light, and thought all things looked new and ſweet; I lay where the ſun ſhone near, or on my bed, and have ſometimes ſince thought, that being weak, the ſtrength of the light and too much company hurt me; I leave this hint to excite nurſes and thoſe who have the care of very weak indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people to beware of letting over much light come upon them, or many viſitors, except they be ſuch who are ſenſible of the weak by being inward and quiet, waiting to feel the ſympathy which truth gives, the company of ſuch being truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:016223_0017_0F9BD4424C6B9C78"/>It pleaſed the Lord ſo to reſtore me, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered my uſual ſtrength, and was frequently humbled under a ſenſe of the tender dealings of a merciful God, whoſe goodneſs and owning love I felt to be very near; I then loved retirement and inwardly to feel after the incomes of life, and was often fearful leſt I ſhould again fall away. In this time it was manifeſted to me, that if in patience I ſtood faithful, I ſhould be called to the work of the miniſtry; I loved to attend religious meetings, eſpecially thoſe for diſcipline, and it was clearly ſhewn me, that all who attend thoſe meetings ſhould inwardly wait in great awfulneſs, to know the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate preſence of Chriſt the head of the Church, to give them an underſtanding what their ſeveral ſervices are, and for ability to anſwer the requirings of truth, for it is by the light, and ſpirit thereof, that the Lord's work is done with acceptance, and none ſhould preſume to ſpeak, or act without its motion, and direction; for they who act and ſpeak without it, do often darken counſel, miſlead the weak, and expoſe their own folly, to the burthen, and grief of ſenſible friends; it was in great fear, that I attempted to ſpeak in theſe meetings, and as I kept low with an eye ſingle to the honour of truth, I felt peace, and inward ſtrength to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe from time to time, and it is good for all who are concerned to ſpeak to matters in meetings for diſcipline, in the firſt place to take heed that their own ſpirits do not prompt thereto, and to mind the time when to ſpeak fitly; for a word in ſeaſon from a pure heart, is precious, and frequently prevents debates inſtead of miniſtring contention, and when they have ſpoken to buſineſs, they ſhould turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to feel whether the pure truth owns them, and in that reſt, without an over anxious care whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſucceeds at that time, or not, ſo friends will be preſerved from being lifted up, becauſe their

ſervice is immediately owned; or if it ſhould be rejected, or ſlighted, in this inward humble ſtate the labour is felt, and ſeen to be the Lord's.</p>
               <p>It is a great favour from the Lord, that he is pleaſed to cover his children with his pure fear, and array their ſouls with the garment of humility, that they may ſtand in his preſence with acceptance, waiting to be taught of his ways, in meekneſs to be guided in judgment; theſe only feel the neceſſity of minding that excellent exhortation
<q>Be ye ſtedfaſt, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</q>
In a degree of reverent thankfulneſs, I bleſs the name of the Lord through his beloved Son, that I then according to my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure knew what I now write, it was a time of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me, I rarely paſſed a day without feeling the incomes of divine life, and was favoured ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſire "The ſincere milk of the holy word," that in humility I might grow thereby in ſubſtance; but afterwards I was left, and withdrawn from, ſo that for days, yea many days together, I was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward refreſhment, and ready to fear that I had offended my gracious Redeemer, and being thoughtful, and inwardly engaged to know the cauſe, I had to conſider, that children tho' they may be thriving, and darlings of their natural pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, are not fit for much buſineſs, until they are weaned, and altho' they grow finely, they are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually taught to wait the appointed time between meals, before they have much care of their father's buſineſs, and are further prepared, ſo as to miſs a ſet meal, or be a longer time without outward food, before they are ſit for a journey, and with theſe thoughts, (leaving the reader to judge from whence they came) a hope began to revive in me, that I was not forſaken, which indeed, as I kept patient, I was abundantly ſenſible of at times, even thoſe times which are in the Lord's hand; for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016223_0019_0F9BD44A5C460598"/>
experience that the times of refreſhment come from him, who when he hath exerciſed and proved them in his infinite kindneſs is pleaſed to cauſe them to ſit down, and condeſcends himſelf to ſerve them. Bleſſed for ever be the name of the Lord who knows how to prepare his ſoldiers to remain faithful, and to indure with patience (what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man would account) hardneſs!</p>
               <p>I had ſtrong deſires that elderly friends ſhould be good examples to the youth, not only in word, and converſation, but in meetings for the worſhip of God, and it grieved me exceedingly to ſee any of them overcome with ſleep, and my concern for one friend on that account, was ſo great, that I knew not what was beſt to do, and reaſoned after this manner, Lord! thou knoweſt that I am young, and he an elderly man, he will not take it well, that I ſhould ſpeak to him, and perhaps I may yet fall; and if ſo the more I take upon me, the greater my fall will be; beſides, tho' I have ſpoken in meetings for diſcipline, when truth hath been ſtrong upon me, yet out of meetings, I am not fit to reprove, or ſpeak to particulars: For I was cautious indeed in thoſe days, of talking about religion, or good things, from a fear of getting a habit thereof, and ſo not know the true motion; which I thought I had obſerved to be the failing of ſome. In this ſtreight it came into my mind to go to the perſon in the night, as the moſt private time, and manner; for if I took him aſide before, or after a meeting, others might wonder for what, and I might betray my weakneſs, and reproach the good cauſe, and do no good, and if the friend ſhould be diſpleaſed with me, he might publicly ſhew, what otherwiſe he would conceal after a private deliberation; ſo in the evening I went, deſiring the Lord to go with me, and guide me, if it was a motion from him; when I came to the houſe it was dark, I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016223_0020_0F9BD44CC1BA2380"/>
and the friend came out to ſee who was there, and invited me in, I told him I was in haſte to go home; but wanted to ſpeak with him if he pleaſed, and ſo paſſed quietly toward home, to draw him from the door, and then told him my concern for him in a cloſe, honeſt, plain manner, and without ſtaying to reaſon much, left him in a tender loving diſpoſition, as I believe; I returned home with great inward peace; when thou doeſt, or giveſt alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right doth, was an excellent precept; that left hand of ſelf ſhould not act in ſuch things, no matter how privately they are done, they often anſwer the end better; neither is it a fault to lay things low, and familiar, the truth will have its own weight, and accompany what it dictates with its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. My intention in writing this, is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the humbled careful traveller in the way of his duty. At ſome times, it appeared to be likely to do moſt good to write my mind to ſome, which I did with ſucceſs, as I aimed only at a diſcharge of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the moſt private manner, and the good of thoſe to whom I wrote.</p>
               <p>When I had entered the twenty fifth year of my age, I accompliſhed marriage with Margaret Brown a virtuous young woman, whom I had loved as a ſiſter for ſeveral years, becauſe I believed ſhe loved religion; I think I may ſay ſafely, it was in a good degree of the Lord's pure fear, and a ſenſe of the pointings of truth, on both ſides, that we took each other on the 27<hi>th</hi> day of the eleventh month 1729, (old ſtile) in an appointed meeting at Eaſt Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and I thought that our Heavenly Father owned us with his preſence at that time. The Covenants made in marriage are exceeding great, and I think they never can be rightly kept, and truly performed without Divine aſſiſtance; and am convinced, if all who enter into a marriage ſtate would in the Lord's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016223_0021_0F9BD44CE4F7AB38"/>
fear truly ſeek his aſſiſtance, they would know their own tempers kept down, and inſtead of jarring, and diſcord, unity of ſpirit, harmony of conduct, and a concern to be examplary to their offspring would increaſe, and be maintained.</p>
               <p>The Summer following, in the year 1730, a Monthly-meeting was ſettled at Nottingham, (being before a branch of New-Garden monthly-meeting) by the advice, and appointment of the quarterly-meeting; this brought a fear, and weighty concern upon me, and many others, that the affairs of Truth might be managed to the honour thereof; for we had but few ſubſtantial elderly friends. In a ſenſe of our weakneſs, it was the breathing deſire of my ſoul, that the Lord would be pleaſed for his own ſake, and the honour of his great Name, to be near to his children, and inſpire them with wiſdom, and judgment for his own work; and bleſſed forever be his holy Name! I believe he heard our cry, and in meaſure anſwered our prayers; being kept low, and humble, it was a growing time to ſeveral. My af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to friends of New-Garden monthly-meeting was ſo great, that for many months after we parted from them, I ſeldom miſſed attending it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had great ſatisfaction, and ſome of their members frequently attended ours, for our love towards each other was mutual.</p>
               <p>When I was about twenty-ſix years of age, ſome friends were appointed to perform a family viſit, and being deſirous of my company, I joined with them, and therein felt the ownings of Truth in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but notwithſtanding I ſaw at times the ſtates of families, and particulars, yet not in ſo clear a manner as I thought neceſſary to become my duty to open my mouth in the ſervice, ſave now and then, in a private way to particulars, of which none knew except thoſe to whom I ſpake. At one houſe the friends on the ſervice had a good opportunity, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016223_0022_0F9BD44E339B5D60"/>
young folks, ſome of whom were not of the family being preſent; I felt the Divine preſence to be very near, and a motion to conclude that ſitting in ſupplication, and thankſgiving to the Lord, but was not haſty, for fear of doing what was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, ſo omitted it, and afterwards aſked an experienced worthy miniſter, if he had ever known any friend appear in a meeting in public prayer, before they had ever appeared in public teſtimony; which enquiry I made in ſuch a manner as to give him no miſtruſt of me; he anſwered "nay, I believe it would be very uncommon," it ſtruck me pretty cloſely, but I kept my condition very private; having been exceedingly fearful of deception, and now began to doubt whether it was not a deluſion for me, to entertain an apprehenſion, that I ſhould be called to the work of the miniſtry; the concern whereof had been at times very heavy upon me; tho', no motion that felt like a gentle command to break ſilence, until at the houſe before mentioned; now I let in reaſoning, and ſo departed for a time from my inward guide and ſafeſt counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, as all aſſuredly will, who place their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on man for inſtruction, to perform duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them; or who forbear, or reaſon againſt the humbling, gentle motions, and leadings of the ſpirit of truth: Much ſafer it is to attend ſteadily thereunto for inſtruction, and ability to perform religious ſervices, which when ſo performed in meekneſs, we ought to be tender of the ſentiments of our brethren concerning them, and not over confident of our call, and commiſſion; for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have a meaſure of the ſame ſpirit by which we are taught, and have a ſenſe and right thereby given to judge of our ſervice; a becoming diſſidence of ourſelves, and a readineſs to attend to the advice of ſuch, is ever the badge of true diſcipleſhip; humbling Divine Love teaches to eſteem others, rather than ourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:016223_0023_0F9BD44E4B61AA70"/>This was an exerciſing time to me, but I did not diſcover it to any one; I ſeemed to be forſaken, tho' not ſenſible of much judgment for my omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of duty, for I could with ſincerity appeal to him who knoweth all things, that it did not proceed from willful diſobedience, but a fear of following a wrong ſpirit, and a ſecret hope revived that my gracious Lord and maſter would not quite caſt me off, and bleſſed be his holy name! he did not leave me very long before I was favoured as uſual, but had no motion of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>When this viſit was over, I kept much at home, yet was careful to attend meetings on the firſt and other days of the week, and found work enough to watch againſt a lukewarm, indolent Spirit, which would come over me when I ſat down to wait upon God; tho' I came to the meeting in a lively warm en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of mind, I found the warfare againſt luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, ſleepineſs, and a roving mind, muſt be ſteadily maintained, and if none of theſe hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances were given way to, the Lord when he had proved his children, would ariſe for their help, and ſcatter his and their enemies, which my ſoul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced many times beyond expreſſion: The Lord alone is all-powerful, and worthy to be waited upon and worſhipped in humility and reverent adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul for ever. Indolence and lukewarmneſs bring darkneſs, and death over a meeting, and when generally given way to, occaſion hard work for even the moſt livingly exerciſed friends to get from under the burthen and weight thereof; it was a mercy that I was preſerved ſeeking, and could not be ſatisfied without feeling the renewings of Divine favour, by which I rather grew in the root of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tho' I thought very flow, but had hope it would be laſting.</p>
               <p>The love of truth, I believe it was, and a deſire that the diſcipline, and good order of the church

might be maintained, made me willing to take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable pains to attend neighbouring monthly meetings, which I think was a bleſſing to me in ſome good degree, being thereby often inſtructed; and I have often admired at the ſlackneſs of ſome, that ſuffer trifling things to keep them from their meetings for worſhip on week days, and firſt days; for tho' curioſity brings ſuch to monthly meetings, they are ſeldom of any real ſervice when they come, not being ſenſible of that pure Divine Love, in which the Church through its ſeveral members edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth itſelf, and as any one becomes truly ſenſible thereof, they will delight to wait upon God, with their brethren and ſiſters, who is the fountain of pure Love, and ſo fills the hearts of his humble, depending children therewith, that by it, they are known to be his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>In the year 1731, our antient and worthy friend William Brown, who had been in the ſtation of an elder many years, growing feeble, and incapable to to attend the Quarterly-meeting of miniſters and elders, Friends of our particular meeting propoſed me to the Monthly-meeting for that ſervice, which brought a cloſe exerciſe upon me, conſidering my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a youth, and the weight of the ſervice; but after a ſolid conſideration, I found moſt peace in ſubmitting to the meeting, with fervent inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that the Lord would be pleaſed to be with me therein, to preſerve me from acting, or judging in my own will and ſpirit, knowing that the ſervice could not be performed but by wiſdom, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ability from him; when I attended thoſe large and weighty meetings of miniſters and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the care and fear that was upon me is not eaſily expreſſed; and may I never forget the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous condeſcenſion of kind providence, who was pleaſed to own me, by the ſhedding abroad of his love in my heart, that I verily thought, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016223_0025_0F9BD4502B9A75D8"/>
the ſchool of the prophets, the High Prieſt, great Prophet, and Biſhop of Souls, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt being preſident among them.</p>
               <p>An apprehenſion that I ſhould be called to the miniſtry, and a concern on that account, had been, at times, for ſeveral years, weightily on my mind; but I now again thought I was miſtaken in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and that it was only a preparative to qualify me for the ſtation of an elder, and thereby my exerciſe became ſomewhat lighter for a time; the tenderneſs and love I felt to thoſe engaged in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic miniſtry, was very great, and I believe I was made helpful to ſome by giving private hints, when and to whom I thought there was occaſion, in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſimplicity and fear, which often afforded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to myſelf as well as to them.</p>
               <p>In 1733, I accompanied friends on another viſit to families, wherein, at times, I felt the opening of truth in the love of it, and a few words to ſpeak to the ſtates of ſome, tho' in great fear, leſt I ſhould put my hand to that weighty work without the real requiring of duty; and at one family, on a morning pretty early, being the firſt we went to on that day, I thought it would be better for the whole family, in a religious ſenſe, if the heads of it were more zealous in attending meetings: I ſaw the neceſſity of being examples to children and ſervants, by a careful attendance of meetings for worſhip on the firſt, and other days of the week; but I was ſo weak and poor, that I doubted whether it was my duty to mention any thing thereof to them, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to omit it; by which I hoped to judge of what I had been about before, and ſo grew eaſy in my mind, and as we were on the way to the next houſe, I began to judge, that I had no real buſineſs to have ſaid any thing at any houſe; and having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne in my own will, I was now left to my own judgment for a time, At the next houſe, friends were
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016223_0026_0F9BD450D4ABFE00"/>
particularly opened, and tenderly concerned to ſpeak to ſeveral ſtates, and of ſeveral matters which I thought inſtructive; but I ſat dry and poor, and ſo remained during our paſſage to the next houſe; where I fared no better, but worſe; my feeling and judgment being quite gone, as to the ſervice in which we were engaged; and tho' I did not ſay any thing to the other friends how it fared with me, yet they were affected therewith as I apprehended; I was in great darkneſs and diſtreſs, and ſometimes thought of leaving the company privately, and go home, but again concluded, that would not only be a diſappointment to my friends, but diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to truth, which made me determine to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and endure my own pain, as much undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered as poſſible; my companions, as I before obſerved, were affected, and all ſave one ſeemed cloſed up from doing the ſervice, and in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame day at the laſt houſe, all of them were ſilent. There was a ſchool-houſe near, the maſter being a friend, and the children moſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to friends, whom ſome of our company appeared willing to viſit, but others being doubtful, we omitted it, which now ſome thought was not right, and therefore this cloud of darkneſs and diſtreſs came upon us, and were willing to meet at the ſchool-houſe next morning, to try if we could recover our former ſtrength in the ownings of truth, which being agreed to, each took our way home, it being now night, and I alone, I rode ſlow, under a deep exerciſe of mind, and humble inquiry into the cauſe of my own diſtreſs, and after ſome time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favored with great calmneſs and quietude of mind, I was inwardly inſtructed after this manner, <hi>Thou ſaweſt what was wanting in a family this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would not exhort to more diligence, or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that reſpect, and therefore if they continue to do wrong, it ſhall be required of thee;</hi> on which I
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016223_0027_0F9BD456416BFBB0"/>
became broken in ſpirit, and cried in ſecret, may I not perform it yet, and be reſtored to thy favour? Oh Lord! I am now willing to do whatſoever thou requires of me, if thou wilt be pleaſed to be with me; and bleſſed be his name, in mercy he heard my ſupplication, and I was fully perſwaded that I muſt go to the houſe again; which I concluded to do next morning, and went home with a degree of comfort, and being weary in body and mind, ſlept ſweetly, and awoke in the morning quiet and eaſy in ſpirit, and now began to conclude, that I might meet my company, and be excuſed; but my cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of going was brought to my remembrance, and I was given to believe, that peace was reſtored on condition of my performance; therefore I went to the houſe, tho' ſeveral miles diſtant, before ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, the man of the houſe was up, he invited me in, and I followed him, and ſitting down by the fire (being cool weather,) with my mind retired, I felt that I muſt not ſpeak before the reſt of the family, but rather in private, yet was fearful of calling him out, being unwilling to diſcover any thing to them; in the mean time, he went out, and walked the way I was to go, I followed, and told him how I felt when we were at his houſe the morning before, and could not be eaſy without exhorting him to be more careful in ſeveral reſpects, and a better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to his family in his attendance of meetings; he ſeemed affected, and ſaid, he hoped he ſhould mind my advice; I then left him, and met my companions at the ſchool houſe, and enjoyed great peace. I leave this remark, to excite all to dwell in meekneſs and fear, and to beware of the will of the creature, and the reaſonings of fleſh and blood, which lead into doubting and diſobedience; they who are faithful in ſmall things, ſhall truly know an increaſe in that wiſdom and knowledge which is from above.</p>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016223_0028_0F9BD4574C200100"/>Before we had gone through this viſit, I attended the quarterly meeting of miniſters and elders at Concord, and as I ſat therein, the unwearied ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary renewed a former charge againſt me, by ſuggeſting to my mind, that I might know I had been wrong and under a deluſion, in entertaining a belief I ſhould be called to the work of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; for that all who had ever been rightly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged therein, it was in a croſs greatly to the will of the creature, which was not my caſe, for I was willing; this I felt to be true, and was therefore now exceedingly diſtreſſed, not conſidering that I was made willing by the weight of the excerciſe, which had been ſeveral years at times very heavy upon me, until it ſeemed as a ſire in my bones, and as tho' <hi>I was dumb with ſilence, I held my peace even from good, and my ſorrow was ſtirred, my heart was hot within me, while I was muſing the fire burned,</hi> Pſal. xxxix. 2, 3. While under this conflict, a friend ſtood up with theſe words, <hi>Alſo I heard the voice of the Lord, ſaying, whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?

<q>to them whoſe will was rightly ſubjected to the Lord, it became their meat and drink, to do the will of him, who had ſubjected them by his divine power, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced their hearts with his love to mankind;</q>
by which I was relieved, and my ſpirit humbled and made thankful. Next morning being the firſt day of the week; I went to Kennet meeting, and toward the cloſe thereof, ſomething appeared to my mind to offer, but was fearful, that the motion for ſpeaking was not enough powerful, and had like to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, but remembring what I had ſuffered by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting a weak motion in a family viſit, as already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, I ſtood up, and ſpake a few ſentences in great fear and brokenneſs of ſpirit, and had ſolid ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I attended the Quarterly-meeting of buſineſs at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016223_0029_0F9BD4599D72B628"/>
Concord on ſecond day; on my return from whence home, I let in the old reaſoner, who ſuggeſted to me, that if I was called to the public miniſtry, I had not waited for a ſufficient commiſſion to ſpeak; for ſome had been raiſed up with great power, and authority they could not withſtand, but that I might have been ſtill and quiet, the motion was ſo gentle and low, and that I muſt not think to ſpeak in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic teſtimony in great meetings with ſo ſmall a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in ſo doing, I had committed a ſin that would not be readily forgiven, perhaps a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; my exerciſe was great, but as I endeavoured to be quiet in my mind, ſeeking to know the Truth of my preſent condition, I was ſecretly drawn to follow and attend to ſomething, that ſpoke inwardly after this manner "if thou waſt to take a lad, an entire ſtranger to thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and buſineſs, however likely he appeared for ſervice, thou muſt ſpeak loud and diſtinctly to him, and perhaps with an accent or tone, that might ſhew thee to be in earneſt, to engage his attention, and point out the buſineſs; but thou wouldſt expect it ſhould be otherwiſe with a child brought up in thine houſe, who knew thy language, and with whom thou hadſt been familiar; thou would expect him to wait by thee, and watch thy motions, ſo as to be inſtructed by thine eye looking upon him, or point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy finger, and wouldſt rebuke, or correct ſuch an one, if he did not obey thy will on ſuch a ſmall intelligent information." I was inſtantly relieved thereby, and leave my reader to judge from whence this intimation came; believing it would be no crime in me, to judge it to be from the Spirit of Truth, that was to lead and guide into all Truth.</p>
               <p>When this meeting was over, being in the ninth month 1733, we proceeded to finiſh our family viſit, the part which remained was on the weſt ſide of Suſquehanna, at Buſh river, and a few families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016223_0030_0F9BD45A433AE780"/>
to ſettle near Deer creek; we were remarkably favoured with the preſence of our great and good Maſter, who opened the ſtates of families to us, and gave ability to ſpeak thereto; may his holy name be praiſed: The viſit being finiſhed, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, and in a ſhort time after; as I ſat in a week day meeting, I had a few words freſh before me, with a gentle motion to deliver them, which I feared to omit, ſtill remembring what followed a former neglect, ſo I expreſſed what was on my mind, and therein had peace, and afterwards was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for ſeveral weeks, in which time I let in a fear, I was forſaken by my dear Lord and Maſter, whom I loved above all things, for I had no openings in heavenly things, as I thought, but was left poor and needy, yet I loved friends, and remembring a ſaying of a miniſter formerly; <hi>We know that we have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe we love the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 1 John iii. 14. I hoped, that I was not quite forgotten; ſome remarkable ſentences had fixed in my mind ſometime before, which I now began to underſtand more ſenſibly, "miniſtry ſhould be of neceſſity, and not of choice, and there is no living by ſilence, or by preaching merely;" for ſomething in me was ready to wiſh to be employed, that I might have bread, for when I found a motion to ſpeak, I had the owning love of the heavenly Father; which is and ever will be bread to his children; the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely will, would chooſe and would be buſy with queſtioning, is it not, or may it not be ſo and ſo; this is that womaniſh part, which is not permitted to ſpeak in the church, it runs firſt into tranſgreſſion, for want of learning of the huſband at home, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſubjection to him, which if Eve had literally done, in ſtead of reaſoning with the ſerpent that tempted, me might have been preſerved from being a tempter. Our ſtrength, preſervation, health, and peace ſtand in our entire ſubjection to the will of the

Lord, whether in ſilence or ſpeaking, ſuffering, or reigning, ſtill dwelling with the ſeed (Chriſt) in our own hearts; humbly waiting for, and feeling after, his power to ariſe, who is the Reſurrection and the Life, and when he is pleaſed to appear, his children partake in meaſure of his glory!</p>
               <p>I continued in the ſtation of an Elder, and ſome times delivered a few ſentences in public Teſtimony, which occaſioned me to apprehend I ſhould not be in my proper place, except I requeſted to be releaſed from my elderſhip; after a time of weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I modeſtly requeſted, that friends would conſider my caſe, for inſtead of taking care of the miniſtry of others, I ſtood in need of the care of others, and that it would be relieving to my mind, if they would nominate an elder in my room, which was taken into conſideration for a time; friends waiting I ſuppoſe to ſee what proof I ſhould make of my miniſtry. I attended the winter quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders, and had to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the miniſtry at our meeting, the elders being called to anſwer one after another in order, according to the ſettlement of the meetings they belonged to, a fear ſtruck me leſt a form of words was too much in general obſerved, particularly, "that the miniſtry was well received." When my turn came, I could not be eaſy without varying that part, and inſtead of ſaying, the miniſtry of the miniſters is well received, I ſaid, that I believed the miniſtry of the public friends was generally approved of, and added, that I did wiſh, that the miniſtry of all the miniſtring friends was better received than I conceived it was; whereupon I was aſked, what I meant, and under the weight I felt on my mind, I replied, it was not from a thought of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard on the ſervice of the public friends; but from the difference between approving thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they believed it to be right, and attending no
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016223_0032_0F9BD45BD68B35B0"/>
further, which would not do the work, but to put in practice what they heard recommended, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well receiving of it, and if that was really the caſe, our ſociety would appear more beautiful than at preſent; thus the matter cloſed, and I had peace in the remark. I think this was the laſt meeting I attended as an elder; before the next quarterly meeting in the ſecond month 1734, another was recommended in my place.</p>
               <p>About this time as I ſat in one of our own meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I felt a flow of affection to the people, for many not of our ſociety came there, perhaps out of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, ſeveral young miniſters having come forth in public teſtimony, in which extraordinary flow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I had a very bright opening as I thought, and expected to ſtand up with it very ſoon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to weigh it carefully was not very forward, viewing its decreaſing brightneſs, until ſomething ſaid as it were within me, "is the woe in it," is neceſſity laid upon thee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 16. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore woe if thou preach not the goſpel. This put me to a ſtand, and made me feel after the living preſence of him, in whoſe name and power I deſired to ſpeak, if I appeared in teſtimony; and not feeling the pure life and power of Truth, ſo as to ſtand up, the brightneſs of the Viſion faded, and left me quiet, humble, and thankful for this preſervation; the drawing ſtrength and luſting deſire of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, who centre not to the pure gift in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are as the many waters, or ſea of Myſtery Babylon, for her merchants to ſail their ſhips and trade upon. This was a time of inward growing to me, the welfare of the churches was ſtrongly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and the extendings of the love of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, I felt at times to reach over ſea and land, to my great admiration; but however my heart was enlarged, I believed it was my duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire inward, and wait with patience until my friends
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016223_0033_0F9BD462B86915F8"/>
ſhould ſo approve of my miniſtry, as to recommend me as a miniſter, before I made any requeſt to go much abroad, though I went to ſome neighbouring meetings, ſuch as I could go to in a morning, and return home at night, but not without acquainting ſome elderly friends therewith, and deſiring their company, which I generally had.</p>
               <p>In the winter 1735-6, William Brown my brother in law, my ſiſter Dinah Brown (then a widow,) and myſelf, were all recommended to the meeting of Miniſters and Elders, as miniſters, and at this meeting I let a certain friend know, that for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time I had a deſire to viſit friends at Newtown, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dletown, Goſhen, Caln, and Bradford meetings, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would go with me, for without ſome ſuitable companion I was not eaſy to go, becauſe it would be neceſſary, that notice ſhould be given to anſwer the end of a viſit, which he alſo thought neceſſary, and let me know that he would take the needful care, which I ſuppoſed was previouſly to inform ſome friends of each meeting, in order that they might acquaint their neighbours if they had freedom, and I was eaſy, not knowing but he would bear me company: On third day I was at the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meeting of worſhip held at Providence, and at the breaking up thereof, the friend whom I had ſpoken to, ſtood up and gave public notice, that I intended to ſit with friends at the meetings aforeſaid, and named the days in order, and requeſted friends would take proper care to give notice; at which I was exceedingly ſurprized, and repented that I had ſpoken thereof; I would have gladly ran home but for fear of bringing a reproach, and to me it ſeemed likely it would be the caſe if I purſued the tract laid out for me; in this ſtrait I was humbled even to weeping; a ſympathizing experienced friend came to me, and ſpake affectionately, bidding me not to be caſt down, for it was heard with gladneſs, that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016223_0034_0F9BD463D280D100"/>
it was in my heart to viſit thoſe meetings, and that if I lived, and did well, I muſt meet with greater trials. I ſuppoſe friends of thoſe meetings knew more of me than I expected, for I had carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended meetings of diſcipline ſeveral years, and had been ſometimes active therein; the meetings were generally pretty full, and I believe truth owned my ſervice, which was to me great cauſe of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In this little journey friends were very kind to me, and I was afraid too free in manifeſting of it; indeed there are many indulgent nurſes, many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inſtructors, but too few fathers in the church, who having been acquainted with him the great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha in their tender beginning, and by dwelling in his holy counſel and fear, have the care of the members at heart, and in the Wiſdom of Truth know how to inſtruct, adviſe, and conduct themſelves towards ſuch who are called to the Lord's work according to their ſeveral diſpoſitions, growths, and gifts receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order that they might be preſerved growing in and by him, the Alpha, experiencing him, their beginning, to be with them, and to be the Omega in their concluſion the Firſt and the Laſt, all in all, the Lord God over all, Bleſſed in himſelf and the Son of his love, our holy high Prieſt and Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For want of proper caution herein, ſome have valued themſelves above what they ought, and thereby reduced their credit with others.</p>
               <p>In the ſummer following I felt a ſecret gentle draft to viſit the meetings in the back parts of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Philadelphia and Bucks Counties, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with me, and my brother in law William Brown having the like concern, we acquainted friends at our monthly meeting, late in the fall of the year, and had their concurrence, and I believe their good wiſhes for us; ſo in the tenth month 1736, we proceeded, and went to Goſhen, Radnor, and to a general meeting at Haverford, and to an
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016223_0035_0F9BD464053B9598"/>
evening meeting at a ſchool-houſe in upper Merion, and over Schuylkill to Plymouth; we had good ſatisfaction moſtly. I could ſee that my brother grew in his gift, and after one of the meetings a wellmeaning friend told me, that I was a ſeer, and knew the ſtates of people better than they could inform me at which I felt ſome ſecret pleaſure, yet not without (as I thought) a humble fear, knowing that flattery or unguarded commendation, if liſtned to, is a kind of poiſon to young miniſters, and ſometimes makes them ſwell beyond the proper ſize. At Plymouth, I had an open meeting, and it ſeemed to me, as if what I had to ſay was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived freely by the people, and after meeting I was filled with joy to ſuch a degree, that I wept, and dropped behind my company, (to keep undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,) in our going to a friends houſe, inwardly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it might be taken from me, for I feared, that by the natural part in me, it was taken to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Next day we had a ſmall meeting in Job Pugh's houſe, where I thought I ſaw the ſtates of particulars very clear, and had ſomething to ſay, which perhaps I delivered in too ſtrong terms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering my age and experience in the miniſtry; a becoming fear, and modeſty in expreſſion is very ornamental and ſafe for miniſters, both young and old; after meeting, we went home with Evan Evans to North Wales, who converſed but little with us, but was grave and ſolid, and therein a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to me; for ſometimes young miniſters hurt themſelves by too much talking, and draw from others of like freedom, things not convenient for them to hear. The next day we were at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales meeting, which was large, being firſt day, my brother W. B. appeared in the forepart and had good ſervice, afterwards I ſtood up with a large and good opening as I thought, but found hard work and ſoon ſat down again without much relief,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016223_0036_0F9BD464C722E398"/>
which being a little unuſual, I ventured to ſtand up again, and with a zeal that exceeded my childiſh knowledge, laid on ſome ſtrokes with the ſtrength of the mans part more than with the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling power of Truth; for if we deliver hard things to the people, we ſhould ever remember, that we are fleſh and blood, and by nature ſubject to the ſame frailties; this would lead us cloſely to attend to the power, and to miniſter only in the ability of Truth, in the meekneſs, gentleneſs and wiſdom which it inſpires; I ſoon ſat down again, and in a moment felt myſelf left in great darkneſs, and friends broke up the meeting in a minute or two af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I ſoon thought was rather unkind, as it ſeemed to ſhew a public diſlike, when a private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, which I believed was my due, would have anſwered the end better; but when I knew they held an afternoon meeting, I judged that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed on the time, and the weight of the trial ſettled ſtill deeper on my mind; in the afternoon I ſate ſilent, and was very much dejected, and my good friend Evan Evans, an experienced miniſter and father in the church, bid me be ſteady and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, looking to the Lord who knew how to deal with his children, and gently correct, as well when they went too faſt, as too ſlow; this fatherly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hint fully opened my eyes; for before I was in ſome doubt wherein I had miſſed; I now believed he ſaw I was too zealous and forward, and believed alſo that he had the judgment of Truth; this was enough for me; I abhorred myſelf, and was in great fear that I ſhould not be forgiven. Another friend told me that I only felt an oppoſing ſpirit in ſome, whoſe ſtates had been remarkably ſpoken to by me, and deſired me not to be too much caſt down, for I had the mind of Truth; this inſtead of relieving, rather added to my affliction, for I ſaw it would have a tendency, if heeded, to take me from under
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016223_0037_0F9BD4677007BB08"/>
the hand of the Lord, which was heavy upon me, and ſomething in me ſaid, "Let God be true and every man a lyar, keep to the witneſs in thine own heart, attend to the Spirit of Truth there, and mind its reproof:" Man through natural affection and ſympathy may err, and adminiſter falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but the other proceeds from the God of Truth. I would have given all that I had to have been at home, for I greatly feared that I ſhould bring a reproach on the truth, the honour whereof was dear to me; I hid my diſtreſs as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and proceeded to attend meetings with my brother, whom I greatly preferrred, and was afraid to diſcourage by my complaints.</p>
               <p>We were at a meeting at Skippack, and at another at Perkioming or New-Providence, in each whereof I had ſo much light and underſtanding as to offer a few words, but the ſervice lay chiefly on my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; from thence we went to Oley, where I had a few things to deliver in a friends houſe in an even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſitting with his family, which was large; the friend in great tenderneſs obſerved afterward, that revelation was not ceaſed, for their ſtates were very exactly ſpoken to, at which I marvelled, for I was greatly reduced, and thought myſelf one of the pooreſt and moſt unqualified that ever travelled in that great ſervice, in which we were now engaged; this diſpenſation though ſorrowful to wade through, was very humbling and profitable for me, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but a little before was ready to think I knew ſomething about preaching, but now knew nothing, that I might more fully underſtand that he who thinketh of himſelf "he knoweth any thing, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth nothing as he ought to know," to wit, that all pure knowledge is ſealed up in him who is the Fountain of Wiſdom and Knowledge, to be only opened by himſelf to his dependant children, by the revelation of his own Spirit, when and to whom he pleaſes.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:016223_0038_0F9BD467C4C85998"/>From hence we went to Maiden Creek, and to Richland in Bucks County, being ſtill low in my mind, yet favoured for a few minutes in meetings, in which I had a few ſentences, and then was cloſed up again: I was like one who having learned a few things, or rules in literal knowledge, was again turned back to his beginning.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to Plumſtead in Bucks County; here I was rather more enlarged, and to Buckingham, Wrightstown, Falls, Middletown, Briſtol, and over on the ice to Burlington in New-Jerſey, the weather being exceeding cold, and came back again on the ice over Delaware the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Briſtol, and thence proceded to Byberry and Horſham meetings, and by this time I was relieved from the depreſſion of ſpirit I felt before, yet was under a humble reverent fear, not forgetting the meeting at North Wales; I was in ſome degree again admitted to behold the lifting up of the Heavenly Fathers countenance, which makes the ſolitary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice. From Horſham we went to a meeting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at William Hallowell's, the company of the man who undertook to ſhew us the way not being agreeable, we perſwaded him to return, and ſo were left not knowing the way to the houſe, which made me very thoughtful, leſt we ſhould miſs our way, and friends would then be blamed for neglect of duty towards us; as I was thus pondering in my mind, a faith aroſe, that providence could direct, and that moment I beheld the track of a man who had croſſed the road we were in, and felt a ſudden turn of mind to follow the ſame, which made me quite eaſy; it brought us to a field, where we found the fence down on both ſides, and led to the houſe where friends were gathered, and we were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be without a guide, for which I was thankful, believing it to be the ſecret direction of kind providence, and not barely chance. I relate
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016223_0039_0F9BD468F00C6A40"/>
this with a view to excite ſuch who may meet with difficulties, to rely on him alone who can ſhew the way, and give faith to follow, but man muſt be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet in mind, to underſtand the inward gentle ſenſe that Truth favours with; this ſmall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering was owned in a good degree with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence.</p>
               <p>From thence we paſſed to Abington and Frankfort meetings, and to Philadelphia; and after viſiting of thoſe meetings, we turned to Germantown, and ſo over Schuylkill to Merion meeting, where we met our worthy friend John Forthergill, who had great and good ſervice therein, with whom my brother W. B. returned to Philadelphia to the quarterly meeting, which began next day, and while he was abſent from me I attended Springfield and Newtown meetings, when he again came to me, we attended ſome other meetings until our quarterly meeting began, at which was our friend John Cadwalader from Horſham, who had good ſervice; after which I returned home and was glad to ſit with friends in our own meeting, wherein I did not ſee it was my place to ſay much, but by example to recommend ſilence.</p>
               <p>Early this ſpring (1737<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) the Lord was pleaſed to try me with poverty and inward want, which brought me into great ſearchings of heart, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enquiry into the cauſe, but could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that I had wilfully diſobeyed, neither ſtood convicted in my mind for doing amiſs, but my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and inward want increaſed, with diſtreſs and doubting to that degree, that I began to fear I had miſtaken, and took error for truth, and in my own imagination formed a religion, and for the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my youth was ſuffered to go on until now; and all that ever I had done was brought into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reduced to nothing, and the enemy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtir me up to impatience, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016223_0040_0F9BD46F4AD5CDC0"/>
me, that my tranſgreſſions would never be forgiven; many days of ſorrow and nights of ſore diſtreſs I paſſed through, and began to deſpair of ever beholding the Light of the Heavenly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance lifted up towards me again.</p>
               <p>Towards the laſt of the third month I went to Sadſbury, to ſettle a diſpute about the bounds of land and having ſomething to do near Samuel Nutt's Iron works on French creek, as I was going thither being alone and my inward ſorrow and diſtreſs very great, I thought I would now endeavour to vent it, were it but in mournful groans, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my breath in order to vent it in a groan, my inward anguiſh ſeemed to burn like fire, and I was inſtantly ſtaid from breaking forth, for I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded my paſſion of grief if given way unto, would go beyond bounds, to the tearing of my cloaths, if no further, my heart not being tender, I could not weep, which brought me to a more calm pauſe than I had known for ſome time, and therein was ready to ſay, can the good hand be ſtill near to ſtay me, Oh! that I may have patience given, and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtrengthned to continue ſeeking, and if at laſt I ſhould periſh, that it may be at his footſtool; for a ſmall ſpace I had ſome hope of beholding again him whom my ſoul once loved above all things; but in a few miles riding it began to look pleaſant to me, to go into ſome remote place where I ſhould not be known. When reflecting thus—what! aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don mine acquaintance! violate my marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and leave my neareſt connections! I ſuddenly knew this proſpect of pleaſure was from the evil one, and ſomething in me abhorred it as wicked, and as it were cloſed my eyes therefrom; ſo that evening I went to the houſe of a former intimate acquaintance to lodge, who received me kindly, and in the evening brought a book containing ſome aſtronomical problems, and began to converſe very
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016223_0041_0F9BD4707640FA20"/>
freely thereon, ſuppoſing it would be pleaſant to me as aforetime; but I was heavy in my ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly thoughtful about ſomething of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he ſoon perceiving his converſation on that ſubject was diſagreeable, propoſed my going to bed as fitteſt for a weary man, judging that to be my preſent ailment, I was glad of the offer and immediately accepted thereof. I ſaw now clearly, that when my mind was turned from delighting in that wherein our former friendſhip conſiſted, my company was rather unpleaſant to him, I ſoon left his houſe in the morning, diſpatched my buſineſs, and returned home with as much ſpeed as I could, without the leaſt inclination to go elſewhere; I believe my prayer was heard; for I had patience granted to me, I ſay granted, becauſe no man can endue himſelf therewith, and I think my diſtreſs gradually abated after the time aforementioned.</p>
               <p>When one has faſted, and ſuffered the want of natural food for a long ſeaſon, men or prud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will portion out the food they give to ſuch with care, that ſtrength may be increaſed and the conſtitution preſerved healthful and ſound. The Lord, whoſe Love and Care to his children doth far exceed that of any natural parent to his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, dealt with me in his tender mercy, giving at times by the gentle touches of his Love, to feel that he had not forſaken me, which in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes would be again withdrawn, but tho' of ſhort continuance, was ſufficient for me to own it was worth all my ſorrowful longing for and hereby he was pleaſed to let me experimentally know the value of Heavenly Bread by the want or it having food and raiment I was now taught to be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; the renewing of heavenly favour, and the covering of the Holy Spirit, ſo as to be admitted to ſtand before him in humble reverence with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acceptance, was all my ſoul craved; I neither
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016223_0042_0F9BD470C925C430"/>
wanted this man's gift, nor the other man's popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and eloquence, but to be in mercy admitted into the number of his family, and occupying mine own gift to his honour alone that gave it. When Peter was examined by his Lord whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied through fear, "Loveſt thou me more than theſe?" the third time anſwered; "Thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee:" He did not anſwer the queſtion in its full extent, <hi>viz. more than theſe</hi> with reſpect to the reſt of the Diſciples who had not denied their Lord and Maſter, as Peter had done, who was nevertheleſs looked upon with forgiving compaſſion, and therefore had need to love in proportion; perhaps his honeſt confeſſion and appeal to his Maſter's knowledge might ſhorten his anſwer; his threefold charge of feeding the ſheep and lambs of his Lord, was neceſſary to gain his diligent attention to the work of him whom he had three times denied; he to whom much is forgiven, loveth much if he is not ungrateful: No marvel that I met with this trial of my love and affection, who ſo often (not through fear, but the deſire of indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my creaturely will, had denied, or neglected to follow my Lord and Maſter who had ſo early made me acquainted with his will, and who now had paſſed by mine offences, and called me to work in his vineyard; now I was made thankful for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which before had ſcarcely been owned as ſuch; for to be preſerved inwardly watchful, and quietly reſigned, to wait upon the Lord, though we partake not of immediate conſolation by the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life, is a great bleſſing, for which we ought to be thankful, as we cannot ſtay our own minds, nor curb our thoughts; and I did believe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was healthful, created an appetite and ſweetned the reliſh of reſt and food in a ſpiritual as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe, and therefore I wanted not to eat the bread of idleneſs and live on the labour of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:016223_0043_0F9BD4734E8D4FB0"/>After this trial which continued moſt of the ſummer, I was much favoured with the incomes of Divine Love and Life, and in the winter following viſited moſt of the meetings in Cheſter County, and ſome few in Philadelphia County, the weather was very cold being about the middle of the tenth month when I ſet out, and in my journey went to viſit a worthy friend who was indiſpoſed, and lodged at his houſe, and as we ſat together in the evening, he aſked me why I choſe the winter ſeaſon to viſit my friends in, for many infirm folios could hardly attend meetings, and ſaid he was ſometimes ready to query, whether public friends do not take that time to ſerve their maſter, becauſe they could do but little for themſelves. I was thoughtful and low in my mind before, and had ſome reaſoning whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it had not been better that I had ſtaid at home than ventured out on the ſervice at that time of the year. Though I thought I had an engagement ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient when I ſet out; this query of his made me more thoughtful, and added to my reaſoning, but I ſoon recovered ſtrength, and it came freſh in my mind to aſk him whether friends could eat to ſupply and ſuſtain their bodies in the ſummer, and partake alſo of ſpiritual food for their ſouls in that ſeaſon, ſo as not to labour in the winter and care for the ſuſtenance of their bodies, or aſſemble and attend meetings to worſhip and wait upon God for ſpiritual food for their ſouls? he acknowledged I had by this query ſatisfied him to the full, and ſaid he was glad of my viſit, and hoped his talking as he did would not diſcourage me, for I believe he ſaw it brought a damp over me at firſt, this anſwer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was given to me for mine own help, and was encouragement to me through this journey, in which I had moſt of the time Joſhua Johnſon of Londongrove for a companion, who was very agreeable, and in my return home I felt great peace.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the Summer following I went with Robert Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan to Weſt-river yearly-meeting in Maryland, and we viſited moſt of the meetings of friends in that province, and his company was profitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to me who was but young in the miniſtry; I think I knew him well, he had a good gift of the miniſtry, and was highly favoured in the living openings of Truth, but was often low in mind and very humble in ſpirit; one time as we were riding together, he lagged behind for ſeveral miles, I aſked him why he rode ſo ſlow, he made no reply, whereupon I ſtopt until he came up, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſolid, and looked as if he had been weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I aſked what ailed him, after ſome time he told me, that he had been thinking of the great favours which man partook of, particularly in being placed over the beaſts of the field, and how eaſily they were broke, and made ſubject to his will, what a ſmall turn with the bridle would put them to the right hand or the left, and on a gentle motion would amend or ſlacken their pace, at the will or pleaſure of the rider, and that man, the moſt noble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creature, ſhould ſo far neglect the duty of a willing ſubjection to his Maker, who ſo highly
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:016223_0045_0F9BD474F6411578"/>
has favoured him with temporal bleſſings, and the knowledge of heavenly things. I had been at that meeting about three years before, having had ſome buſineſs to do for a friend of mine on the Eaſtern-ſhore of Cheſopeak, and croſſed over the Bay to the Weſtern-ſhore, and was at the yearly-meeting, and being grieved at the conduct of ſome of the elders, whoſe age, if they had kept to the Truth and had been zealous for the honour thereof, would have made them better examples; I ſpoke my mind plainly to them, but not without proper caution (as I thought) both with reſpect to my youth and their age; but ſome ſeemed a little warmed thereby, and aſked for my certificate, if I had any, I honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them, the principal buſineſs that brought me from home was temporal, which having accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, I thought I might attend that meeting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, if I did not miſbehave myſelf. William Richardſon deſired friends to conſider what I had ſaid, for he believed if they did, they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the young man had a certificate with him, that might anſwer for one of a neighbouring province to attend ſuch a meeting.</p>
               <p>It may not be unſeaſonable to relate that in the year 1736, one night as I lay in bed, my mind was uncommonly affected with the incomes of Divine Love and Life, and therein I had a view of the churches in New-Jerſey, with a clear proſpect that I ſhould viſit them, and in that proſpect and the ſtrength of affection which I then felt, I ſaid in my heart it is enough; I will prepare for the journey as ſoon as I can hear of a ſuitable companion, for I do not expect that I ſhall have a clearer ſight than I now have, I ſoon heard of a friend who had a viſit to New-Jerſey before him, I ſpoke to him about my concern, he let me know that he knew of a companion, and they had agreed upon a time to proceed; after I had mentioned it to him and ſome
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016223_0046_0F9BD47556289798"/>
other friends my concern ſeemed to die away; but I remembered the reſolution that I took up, and that I then thought I would not look to be bidden again, and was fearful ſomething had drawn my mind from the proper attention to that opening, which was the reaſon it ſeemed to go off; but the more I ſtrove to look after it, the duller it grew; I then ſorely repented that I had ſpoken about it, and thought it ſhould be a warning to me in future; for I began to ſee there was a difference between ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was to be done, and being bidden to do the thing ſhewn, beſides this, I had to conſider there was a time to bud, a time to bloſſom, a time for fruit to ſet and appear, and a time for it to ripen.</p>
               <p>And in the forepart of the winter (1738,) I thought it ſeemed to revive, and when I ſaw John Hunt a friend from England, I believed I ſhould go with him when he went thro' New-Jerſey, and told him what I thought, at which he rejoiced, for we were nearly united; ſo we appointed a time to meet at Philadelphia, and when we had ſo far concluded, being about ſix weeks beforehand, my concern, as I thought, ſoon withered away, and I began to be in great fear that I had been again too forward therein, but after ſome time of humbling exerciſe on that account, the Lord, whom I feared, from the Love with which he was pleaſed to enrich my heart, gave me to remember, that when I made the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with my friend, it was in his fear and great abaſement of ſelf, and as I had ſeen clearly to make the appointment, it was my place to attend in humble reliance on him for ability to perform the embaſſy; for the Lord who calleth and ſendeth forth his own, will alſo provide all things convenient for them.</p>
               <p>When the time came, I ſet forward very poor and needy, which continued until we entered our
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016223_0047_0F9BD475F8A56B48"/>
ſervice; we took a few meetings before our general ſpring meeting; and after attending that, we went to Woodberry, Piles-grove, Salem, Alloways-creek, Cohanſie, and ſo to Cape-may, and had ſome cloſe work, but in the main ſatisfactory to ourſelves at leaſt; after having ſeveral meetings at and near the Capes, we went to Great-Egg-harbour and had a meeting there, and another at the houſe of our friend Japhet Leeds, and ſo over the Marines to Little-Egg-harbour river, and had two meetings with friends, in one of which I ſtood up with a large opening as I thought, but after a ſhort introduction, it cloſed up, and I ſat down again, which was ſome mortification to me as a man, tho' very profitable, being thereby taught to know, that he that would ſpeak as the oracle of God, muſt, under the gentle burden of the word, in humble fear wait for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, utterance, and ablility to perform the ſervice to the edification of the church and his own inward Peace, and not to look after large and ſpecious openings, ſometimes deſirable to the creaturely part both in ourſelves and others, which muſt ſuffer famine.</p>
               <p>At one of the meetings in theſe parts, coming very early, a friend belonging thereto invited us to go to his houſe not far off, and he would put up our horſes to hay during the time of the meeting, ſaying that we muſt go to his houſe to dine; but I felt a ſtop in my mind, and told him that our horſes could ſtand very well there until after meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it ſo fell out that neither of us ſaid any thing in the meeting, which nevertheleſs was to us ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, for we had a ſenſe that the people had been fed with words, and had a hunger thereafter, more than for the inſtruction of the pure word of Power and Life nigh in the heart and mouth, that they might not only hear it but be found doers thereof: after the meeting no one aſked us to dine, but went
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016223_0048_0F9BD47BC61B2FC8"/>
away and left us, and had it not been for the care of our kind guide that came from the meeting we were laſt at, we ſhould have been at a loſs to have got forward; I mention this to ſhew how unacceptable ſilence is to ſuch whoſe ears itch after words.</p>
               <p>From hence we went thro' the deſert to upper Springfield, where we had a ſatisfactory meeting, then taking the meetings Northward to Stony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook and Trenton, we returned to Bordentown, and ſo croſſed Delaware. Some of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were large and very ſatisfactory under the owning of truth, the power whereof was in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the name of the Lord praiſed, who is worthy forever; and ſome were remarkably cloſe and hard, which made me remember a ſaying of that experienced miniſter and elder John Fothergill, that, "When he was firſt in this country, he had ſome extraordinary meetings hereaway, the people being induſtrious in a natural as well as ſpiritual ſenſe, ſome of whom were now removed, and their children poſſeſſed the temporal eſtates of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and though their outward habitations looked ſpacious their meetings for worſhip were dull and heavy, by reaſon of a wordly ſpririt, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference about heavenly treaſure." One meeting which we were at was remarkably hard; my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion J. H. was exceedingly exerciſed, under a ſenſe that the people were too rich, full, and whole in their own eyes, he ſat the meeting through and ſuffered in ſilence, but I had ſomething to ſay very cloſe and particular, and felt a degree of the ſtrength and power of Truth to clear myſelf in an innocent and loving manner, and remembering they were brethren, did not preach myſelf out of charity towards them, and ſo had peace. We went home with an elderly friend, who in a ſtern manner aſked me from whence I came, and ſaid I was a ſtranger to him, I anſwered him with a cheerful boldneſs;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016223_0049_0F9BD47CDBC04B38"/>
he aſked me what my calling was, I told him huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, he farther queried if I was uſed to ſplitting of wood, I let him know I had practiſed it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, he again aſked me, if I knew the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a common ſaying of thoſe who were uſed to that buſineſs, "Tis ſoft knocks muſt enter hard blocks;" I told him I knew it well, but there were ſome old wood that was rather decayed at heart, and to ſtrike with a ſoft or gentle blow at a wedge in ſuch blocks, would drive it to the head without renting them and the labour would be loſt, when a few ſmart lively ſtrokes would burſt them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; whereupon he laid his hand on my ſhoulder, ſaying, "Well my lad, I perceive thou art born for a warrior, and I commend thee;" And thus we came off better than we expected, for I thought he pointed at my ſervice that day; he was ever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward very loving to me, and I was inwardly thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that the Lord was near to me, for which I praiſe his ſacred name. To be becomingly bold in the cauſe of Truth, at times is particularly neceſſary, otherwiſe the weight of the teſtimony thereof would be leſſened, and a carping ſpirit ſet over it.</p>
               <p>From Bordentown we went to Plumſtead in Bucks-county, and on a firſt day had a pretty good meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to a monthly-meeting at Buckingham, then to Wrightſtown, the Falls, and Middletown, which meetings were in a good degree ſatisfactory, the reaches of the Power of Truth being felt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, for which we were thankful; tho' in ſome of them, there is too great a want of faithful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to put the diſcipline in practice againſt thoſe that were diſorderly, and thereby brought a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on the Truth; we then went to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and next day to Cheſter, from whence I went home the ſame day.</p>
               <p>In the fall of the year 1740, I had ſome draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in my mind to attend the quarterly-meeting at
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016223_0050_0F9BD47D833E17E8"/>
Shrewſbury, and was at ſeveral meetings on my way thither, at one of which a friend appeared, who I thought had good ſervice in the forepart of his teſtimony, but as truth did not riſe into domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo high as he expected, perhaps in too much zeal and creaturely warmth, he laid on a little too faſt, and continued until the life rather abated, and ſome tender minds hurt; for it often happens that ſuch to whom hard things belong, will put them off, and thoſe who are more tender and leaſt deſerving of ſuch doctrine, will take it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their own hurt. Oh! how careful miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ought to be whilſt they are in their ſervice, that they may be favoured with an inward feeling ſenſe of the ſtates to which they miniſter, and be influenced with Wiſdom from above to divide the word aright, in meekneſs, gentleneſs, and holy fear, then truth will have its own weight, authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and power. After the friend ſat down, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the concern of another in a few words, as it were to number the ſlain, and ſearch for the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſet cloſe and hard things where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, by deſcribing their ſeveral diſpoſitions in chooſing and refuſing to take hard things. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being in company with the friend above hinted, and he being down in his mind and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not fully knowing the cauſe, aſked me what I thought of the meeting, to which I was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to anſwer; he ſaid, tell me what I have done this day? whereupon I aſked him privately and in a pleaſant manner, what Gideon did to the men of Succoth? <hi>Jud.</hi> viii. 16. at which he was greatly humbled, fully underſtanding what I meant, and did not in the leaſt reſent the hint; which I thought was truly great in him, and very becoming a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; for if we would inſtruct others, we ſhould be exemplary in taking inſtruction ourſelves when neceſſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:016223_0051_0F9BD47E381B8298"/>On my way falling in company with Robert Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, we had a freedom to propoſe a meeting to the Anabaptiſts at Middletown, to which they readily conſented, and we had a profitable opportunity with them in their meeting houſe, and on the ſame evening a meeting at the houſe of Hugh Hartſhorne, to which ſeveral baptiſts came; this was a time of favour, and I hope of ſervice, it was concluded by R. J. in ſolemn prayer and thankſgiving to the Lord, who is worthy forever and ever. Juſt as the meeting broke up, I felt myſelf poor and inwardly weak, to as great a degree as ever I had done, and looking towards my ſaid friend I ſaw he was in the ſame condition, for it ſeem'd as if we had hardly ſtrength to ſtand; but a query of our dear Lord's came ſuddenly into my mind and miniſtered relief <hi>viz.</hi> Who hath touched me? Whereupon leaning toward my companion, I repeated it to him, being my belief that it was as much for his help as my own. He underſtood the meaning inſtantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further explanation, and was thereby alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. Perhaps ſome who may hereafter peruſe theſe lines, may think this is too bold for a mortal man to mention; but having by a degree of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience known, that when the healing virtue of Truth from the holy Phyſician of Souls, has flowed through an humble ſervant, to the relief of ſome of the infirm and poor amongſt the people, who have followed phyſicians of no value, and ſpent all their living thereby, and no cure wrought, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding virtue has gone through them as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments or conduits, they have felt inwardly weak for a time, that in humble abaſement of ſoul they might be taught to acknowledge, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, and Glory doth belong to him alone, who is God over all bleſſed forever and ever.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to William Hartſhorne's at at Sandy-hook, and ſo to the quarterly-meeting at
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016223_0052_0F9BD47F2D71C230"/>
Shrewſbury, which was large in the ſeveral ſittings, in which was felt the power of Truth in a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but many looſe and rude people of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood and parts adjacent coming together at ſuch times to drink, carouſe, and ride races, are very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to each other and diſturbing to friends. Then going homeward I had ſeveral meetings on the way, and enjoyed great inward peace, and could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rejoice and aſcribe the praiſe to the Lord, who had called and enabled me to perform this ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having a concern on my mind to viſit the meetings of friends on the Eaſtern ſhore in Maryland, I laid it before our monthly-meeting and obtained a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate in the tenth month; my brother in law James Brown bearing me company; and we were at Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil monthly-meeting held at Cheſter in the eleventh month, before meeting a friend informed me that he thought it would be beſt for me to croſs Cheſter river, and go directly Southward; I told him it might be ſo, but I could ſay little to it at preſent; but ſome friends conſulting about it, and one being there who lived near the meeting houſe in Queen Anns county, they thought he could give notice on firſt day to ſeveral meetings; ſo a friend ventured to ſpeak publicly thereof at the cloſe of the meeting for worſhip, without letting me know what he intended to do. I had been uncommonly diſtreſſed as I ſat in the meeting, from an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that but few of the friends belonging to that particular meeting were there, and when he publiſhed where it was propoſed I ſhould be the enſuing week, I felt my mind opened and turned another way, and ſtood up and told friends, that I did believe they thought it moſt for my eaſe to lay out the meetings after that manner, but if friends at that particular meeting would favour me ſo far as to meet there next day, I ſhould be glad to ſit with them, provided they would pleaſe to let other
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:016223_0053_0F9BD488C0C38A98"/>
friends and neighbours who were abſent know of it; for if I had a right ſenſe, there were ſeveral members not preſent, and I ſhould be willing to be at Caecil meeting on firſt day, and Saſſafraſs on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, which was directly back, and therefore told them it ſeemed eaſieſt to my mind, tho' it would occaſion more riding, this being agreed to, we had a much larger meeting next day, for many before were abſent as I had thought, and I had a full opportunity to diſcharge myſelf toward the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and indifferent, and diſorderly walkers, and had peace; I viſited ſeveral families on ſeventh day to good ſatisfaction, and was at Caecil meeting on firſt day, and the next day at Saſſafraſs, and had to believe it was by the ſecret direction of the good ſhepherd, who never faileth his dependant children, that I was turned this way; for he was pleaſed to own my ſervice in theſe meetings by his preſence in a good degree to the praiſe of his own name, which is worthy forever: From thence we paſſed over the Head of Cheſter by the bridge, John Browning, a friend from Saſſafraſs, going with us as a guide, who ſome time before had been convinced of the bleſſed Truth, by the inward operation of the Holy Spirit without any inſtrumental means; he had been a member of the church of England ſo called, and for his ſobriety was choſen a Veſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but after a time felt a ſcruple in his mind about taking off his hat, when he entered the Church-yard ſo called, fearing it was a ſuperſtitious adoration of the ground, from its ſuppoſed holineſs; but would take it off when he entered the worſhip houſe, and walk uncovered to his pew; but after a time could not uncover his head, till what they call Divine Service began; which as he kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly attentive to the ſcruple in his mind, became very lifeleſs to him, who was inwardly ſeeking for ſubſtance and life; and therefore withdrew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from;
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:016223_0054_0F9BD488E19AA940"/>
and after ſome time went to one of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rather out of curioſity than expecting any good, but felt himſelf owned, and had a taſte of the peace which the world cannot give, and from that time became a conſtant attender of our meetings.</p>
               <p>We had a meeting at Queen Ann's amongſt a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who for want of keeping to the life of Religion, had almoſt loſt the form: In converſation at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain houſe in the evening, I aſked a friend, whether ſhe was a friend's child or one convinced of our principles, her reply was, that when ſhe was young, ſhe lived at a friend's houſe, and took a notion of going to meeting with them, which ſhe had done ever ſince; Alaſs! when notion changes the will, and not that faith which works by love to the purifying of the heart, the religion is without reformation, empty and dead. From thence we went to Tuckaho meeting, and the weather being very cold and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers frozen up, ſeveral maſters of veſſels and ſailors came there and divers others people of faſhion with gay cloathing; in the fore part of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was an appearance made which grieved me, for my heart yearned towards the people; the words that he began with were "Wo, wo, to the crown of pride and drunkards of Ephraim;" and with very little application ſat down; it appeared to me as if the appearance of gaiety had fired the creaturely zeal, which was the chief motion to this ſhort ſermon, this with the cold wind blowing in at the door, much unſettled the meeting, it being at the time when that remarkable ſnow fell which laid ſo long in deep drifts this winter; whereupon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the door might be ſhut, which being done, the houſe became more comfortable, and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled, and I ſtood up with an heart filled with affection, having that paſſage of ſcripture before me, in which the apoſtle Peter declared the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of the Love of God, "I perceive of a Truth that God is no reſpecter of perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" and was
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:016223_0055_0F9BD48A027CA090"/>
much enlarged thereon to my own admiration, and I believe ſatisfaction of the people; the meeting ended ſweetly with thankſgiving and prayer to the Lord for the continuance of his mercy who is the alone author of all good, and worthy of adoration and worſhip forever. After which we attended the ſeveral neighbouring meetings, through very ſevere cold weather, and the houſes being very open and unprovided with the means of keeping them warm, of which there is too manifeſt a neglect in thoſe parts, they were uncomfortable and unſettled; in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney my companion appeared in a few words in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral families and meetings; we reached home juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our quarterly-meeting in the twelfth month.</p>
               <p>In this journey, travelling in Talbot county, an elderly man aſked us if we ſaw ſome poſts ſtanding, pointing to them and added, the firſt meeting George Fox had on this ſide of Cheſopeak Bay, was held in a tobacco houſe there which was then new; the poſts that were ſtanding were made of walnut, at which John Browning above mentioned rode to them, and ſat on his horſe very ſtill and quiet; then returning to us again with more ſpeed than he went, I aſked him what he ſaw amongſt thoſe old poſts, he anſwered,
<q>I would not have miſſed of what I ſaw for five pounds, for I ſaw the root and grounds of Idolatry; before I went I thought perhaps I might have felt ſome ſecret virtue in the place where George Fox had ſtood and preached, whom I believe to have been a good man; but whilſt I ſtood there, I was ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that if George was a good man, he was in Heaven and not there, and virtue is not to be communicated by dead things, whether poſts, earth, or curious pictures, but by the power of God who is the fountain of living virtue.</q>
A leſſon, which if rightly learned, would wean from the worſhip of images and adoration of relicts.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:016223_0056_0F9BD48A4834FF78"/>I was not many miles from home this ſummer, ſave to attend our own quarterly and yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but in the fall having ſome drawings in my mind to viſit friends in the New-ſettlement in Virginia, I went with a committee of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly-meeting, appointed to inſpect whether friends at Fairfax were in number and weight ſufficient to have a meeting ſettled amongſt them to the reputation of truth, and we viſited all the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of friends there, and had a meeting among them to ſatisfaction; from thence we went to a place called Providence or Tuſkarora, from whence Mordecai Yarnal who was one of the number went home, having heard that his wife was dead or likely to die; we had a meeting with the friends there, who were glad to ſee us, and then went to Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well monthly-meeting to ſome ſatisfaction; from whence I went to a few families ſettled up Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondoa above the Three-top't Mountain ſo called, and had a meeting amongſt them, they were pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much tendered and received the viſit kindly, eſpecially ſuch who did not make profeſſion of the truth with us; I admired how they had notice, for many came to it, and ſome ten miles or more: I believe that the delight in hunting and a roving idle life drew moſt of them under our name to ſettle there, ſo having diſcharged myſelf in a plain yet loving manner, I returned to Robert M'Coy jun's, and having had ſeveral other meetings thereaway, I went home with peace of mind and thankfulneſs of heart to him who alone enables his children to anſwer his requirings, having rode in this journey above four hundred miles.</p>
               <p>This winter John Cadwalader and Zebulon Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in their return from a religious viſit to friends in Maryland, Virginia, and Carolina, were at my houſe, and being deſirous to viſit ſome meetings on the Eaſtern-ſhore of Maryland, I went with them
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016223_0057_0F9BD48B0A18A7E0"/>
to Saſſafraſs-meeting, and called to ſee the widow and children of John Browning who had been dead about a month, and ſhe gave me in ſubſtance the following account of him, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>My huſband was not long ſick, but ſaid, that he believed he ſhould not recover, and charged me to endeavour that his children ſhould be brought up in the way of Truth which friends profeſs; and if they incline to have trades, to put them apprentice to real friends, not barely nominal ones, (which ſhe ſaid, ſhe was willing to do, tho' ſhe had never yet joined to friends) and deſired ſhe would not truſt her own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and named ſome friends with whom ſhe ſhould adviſe in chooſing matters; then ſaid, when I am dead, bury me by my father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the grave-yard belonging to our family, and thou knoweſt that I put a large grave-ſtone at my father's grave, and there is one ready for my mother's grave, which I did not put there, becauſe I began to think, they were more for grandeur than ſervice; I ſent for them from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (not at the requeſt of my father) they are mine, and now I have a full teſtimony againſt ſuch formal tokens of reſpect; therefore when I am buried, before the company leaves the grave, inform them what my will is, and deſire their help to take the grave-ſtone from my father's grave, and carry it out of the yard, that it may be brought home, and lay one in one hearth, and the other in the other hearth of this new-houſe, and they will be of real ſervice there; <note n="*" place="bottom">He had built a new brick houſe and the hearth not fully laid.</note> which ſhe promiſed him to obſerve, and told me ſhe had complyed therewith; he remained ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to near the laſt, and departed in a quiet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned frame of mind.</q>

                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:016223_0058_0F9BD48C33C7A168"/>How weak are the arguments of ſuch who make profeſſion with us, and plead for thoſe grand marks of memorial or other tokens of diſtinction ſet up at or on the graves of their deceaſed relations, and how ſoon would they ſubſide, did they but live ſo near the pure truth as to feel the mind thereof, as I fully believe this our friend did, knowing that the name of the righteous will not periſh, but be had in everlaſting remembrance, becauſe their portion is life for evermore, having entered into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for the bleſſed before the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>This ſpring of the year 1742, I felt ſtrong draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mind to viſit friends in New-England, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſome view thereof ſeveral years before; and having obtained a certificate, I ſet forward in the third month, and after viſiting ſeveral meetings in New-Jerſey, and one in New-York, I attended the yearly-meeting on Long Iſland, wherein the power of truth was felt, and a great openneſs to thoſe of other ſocieties, many of whom were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, particularly the laſt day, and two prieſts who be haved ſolidly.</p>
               <p>I then went with Samuel Hopwood (a miniſtring friend from England, with whom I had traveled in this journey through part of New-Jerſey) to Ryewood, and had a meeting there, where were a few ſolid friends, but others too talkative; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Old-Seabrook had a meeting in an inn, on the firſt day of the week, the people being chiefly Preſbyterians, few attended beſides ourſelves, and thoſe of the family who were kind and civil to us; then going to Conanicut we had a meeting with friends on that Iſland, and proceeded to Newport on Rhode-iſland, and on the fifth day of the week attended the meeting at Portſmouth, where we met with Lydia Dean from Pennſylvania, who was on a religious viſit to friends in New-England, and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:016223_0059_0F9BD495C9CD1C08"/>
many other friends coming to be at the yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Iſland; it began on the ſixth day of the week with a meeting of miniſters and elders, and two meetings for public worſhip, one in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon and the other in the afternoon, and were held in the ſame order until the ſecond day of the next week, when the meeting for diſcipline began; this large yearly meeting in the ſeveral ſettings thereof was generally ſolid and ſatisfactory; after which tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers meetings in our way, namely, Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Tiverton, Seconet, Accoakeſet, and Aponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gangſet, and attending their monthly-meeting there, all which were in a good degree ſatisfactory, S. Hopwood and myſelf embarked for Nantucket, and through the mercy of kind providence arrived ſafe there, after a paſſage of three days and two nights, occaſioned by ſcant winds, and an Eaſterly ſtorm which tore our ſails very much, being old and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſo that if ſome watchful friends on the Iſland had not ſeen us in diſtreſs, and come with three whale boats, and took all the paſſengers being twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four of us from the veſſel, we ſhould have been in great danger; for being near a ſand bar, the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſtruck ground ſoon after we left her, and by the violence of the wind was driven on ſhore: We looked on this deliverance as a mercy from God, to whom ſeveral of us were bowed in humble thankfulneſs for this particular favour: On the twenty-ſecond day of the fourth month the yearly-meeting began, which though ſmall on this day by reaſon of the ſtorm, was comfortable, the other ſittings were moſtly large and in a good degree own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the power and virtue of Truth.</p>
               <p>My friend S. Hopwood apprehending himſelf clear, inclined to return to the Main-land, but no paſſage offered; and notwithſtanding the meetings had been generally attended by moſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Iſland, and large, yet I was not eaſy
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:016223_0060_0F9BD496DCED5D70"/>
without endeavouring to have ſome opportunities with friends by themſelves, as much as could be, which I obtained, beſides attending their uſual week day meeting and in theſe ſittings, it pleaſed the Lord to open my way to deliver ſeveral things which had lain heavy on my mind; for although ſome ſolid tender ſpirited friends lived on this Iſland, yet I ſaw there was a libertine ſpirit ſecretly at work amongſt ſome others, to draw away from the pure inward life of religion and the ſimplicity of Truth, into eaſe and liberty; after which I had great peace, and my mind was made thankful to the Lord, who had owned my labour by a good degree of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and power.</p>
               <p>Being now fully clear and a paſſage offering, on the ſecond of the fifth month we took leave of our friends, and landed the ſame day in the evening at Seconnet, and on ſeventh day S. Hopwood and I went to the quarterly-meeting at Sandwich, and were at their firſt day meeting alſo, after which, I went back to Seconnet, and had a meeting at Benjamin Boreman's; then returned to Sandwich where I again met S. Hopwood, and on third day we had a meeting at Yarmouth, and returning to Humphrey Wady's, we from thence went towards Boſton, taking a meeting with friends at Pembrook, reached that town on ſixth day, and attended their morning and afternoon meetings on firſt day, alſo one at a friends houſe in the evening. I have here little to remark, ſave that religion ſeems to be at a low ebb From Boſton I went to Lynn, but S. Hopwood returned towards Rhode-iſland; I had a meeting at Lynn, alſo at Salem, Newberry and Dover, being the monthly-meeting; the next day at Cachechy, and in the afternoon again at Dover at the burial of Mary Whitehouſe who was ninety five years of age; and on ſecond day morning, I was ſecretly drawn to have a meeting over the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016223_0061_0F9BD497063DC740"/>
river on the Kittery ſhore among friends, which was ſatisfactory to myſelf and them, there being a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der people there: On third day morning as I lay in bed, I felt my mind drawn towards the North-weſt, which was an exerciſe to me, for I had before thought myſelf at liberty to return towards Boſton; I aroſe about ſun riſe, and aſked the friend where I lodged, whether any friends lived at a diſtance on that quarter, for that I had a draft that way, he anſwered no, and aſked how far I thought to go, I told him it did not ſeem to me to be more than ten miles; he ſaid there was a people about eight miles diſtant, which he ſuppoſed was the place to which I felt the draft; I deſired him to ſend a lad with a few lines to ſome perſon that he knew, to inform them that a ſtranger would be glad to have a meeting among them at the eleventh hour of that day, if they were free to grant it, which he did and with his wife went with me; ſo that we got to the place near the time propoſed, and found a conſiderable gathering of people, that I wondred how it could be in ſo ſhort a time, not more than three hours warning; they were preparing ſeats by laying boards on blocks in a pretty in large new houſe, and ſoon ſat down in an orderly manner; I went in great fear and inward weakneſs, and at the ſight of ſuch a gathering of people, and none of our profeſſion among them except the friend and his wife who accompanied me, and two others who joined us on the way, my ſpirit was greatly bowed, and my heart filled with ſecret cries to the Lord, that he would be pleaſed to magnify his own power, and bleſſed for ever be his holy name! he heard my cry, and furniſhed with wiſdom and ſtrength to declare his word to the people, among whom there were ſome very tender ſeekers after the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; and the doctrine of Truth flowed freely towards them, the univerſality of the love of
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:016223_0062_0F9BD497C655E320"/>
God being ſet forth in oppoſition to the common predeſtinarian notion of election and reprobation; when the meeting was over I felt an uncommon freedom to leave them, for they began to ſhew their ſatisfaction with the opportunity in many words, ſo ſpeaking to the friend who went with me, we withdrew and went to our horſes, and I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately mounting, beheld the man of the houſe where the meeting was held running to me, who taking hold of the bridle, told me I muſt not go away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dining with them; I look'd ſteadfaſtly on him; and told him, that I did believe this was a viſitation for their good, but I was fearful that they, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too freely and too much, would be in danger of loſing the benefit thereof, and miſs of the good that the Lord intended for them, and my going away was in order to example them to go home to their own houſes, and turn inward, and retire to that of God in their own hearts, which was the only way to grow in religion; ſo I left him, and returned with my friend Joſeph Eaſtees and his wife. Next day I was again at Cachechy meeting where Lydia Dean and her companion Eliphal Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per met me, it was a good meeting; from thence we went to Dover and had a meeting, and another the ſame evening at the houſe of John Kenny, and being clear in my mind of thoſe parts, I returned, having meetings at Hampton, Saliſbury, Aimſbury, and Haverhill, at which laſt place, ſeveral perſons were aſſembled with us who had never heared the preaching of any friend before; there was great openneſs among them, and we had a good meeting together, for which I was thankful to the holy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good. Next day I again met with Lydia Dean and E. Harper, at Stephen Sawyer's near Newberry where we had a meeting, at which I was concerned to ſpeak in a brief manner of the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reformation from the errors of the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:016223_0063_0F9BD49A6452B4C0"/>
church of Rome, and the ſufferings of the Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants particularly in England, ſome of whoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors turned perſecutors, and were very cruel to thoſe whom they called Sectarians; amongſt whom the Preſbyterians having ſuffered perſecution, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be eaſed therefrom, came into America and ſettled in New-England, expecting there to enjoy that reaſonable right, the liberty of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and in this their eaſe, forgetting the golden rule of doing to others as they would be done unto, became, to their laſting Ignominy, perſecutors of the Quakers ſo called, even to the death of ſeveral of them; and I had to ſpeak of the nature and ground of perſecution, and the great inconſiſtency thereof with chriſtianity: Several of the Preſbyterians were preſent, and an ancient man from Newberry, one of their leaders and an elder among them, when the meeting was over, deſired he might ſpeak with me, I being withdrawn into a little parlour, friend Sawyer came and informed me, that the old man wanted to be admitted to me, to which I felt no objection, being quiet and eaſy in my mind, tho' I expected he would be for diſputing; when he came in, he let me know that he had ſome obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to make to me; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>he ſuppoſed I was a man that had read much, or I could not be ſo fully acquainted with the reformation, and that he alſo ſuppoſed I had a College education;</q>
as to the laſt, I told him that I never had been at a ſchool but about three months, and the man I went to being a weaver, ſat in his loom and heard his ſcholars read; that I was ſo far from having a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular education, that I was born in a wilderneſs place, where a few families had ſettled many miles remote from other inhabitants; at which, lifting up his hands, he bleſſed himſelf and added, "Heaven has then anointed you to preach the Goſpel, and you have this day preached the truth; but I can

aſſure you, tho' I have been a Pariſh officer, I never did take any thing from your friends the Quakers, for I am againſt perſecution; ſo God bleſs you with a good journey."</p>
               <p>The next day I had a meeting at Ipſwich in the houſe of Benjamin Hoeg, none profeſſing with us living in that town but himſelf and family; tho' there was a friendly man, who, as I came late to the town the evening before, invited me to lodge at his houſe, of which I accepted, and being weary ſlept well; in the morning I heard a noiſe of high words in the ſtreet, and getting up I opened the door of the parlour where I lodged, and through a paſſage into the kitchen, ſaw a woman whom I took to be the miſtreſs of the houſe, and went toward her; but with a look of exceeding diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe immediately ſhut the door, ſo I turned into my room again; after a while the landlord came to me, and told me that he had been with the Burgeſs, who had given leave that a meeting might be held in the Town-hall; but the prieſt and his two ſons had ſince been with the Burgeſs and forbad him, and that rather than diſpleaſe them, he had withdrawn the leave; the prieſt aſſerted that the Quakers were heretics, and had gone about the town to forewarn his hearers againſt going to the meeting, which was the meaning of the noiſe I had heard in the ſtreet; I felt very eaſy, and deſired that he would not trouble himſelf any further than to inform them, that the meeting would be held at the houſe of B. Hoeg; for I did believe that the railing of the prieſt would raiſe the curioſity of the people the more to come, and ſo it proved: I aſked him to ſhew me the way to the houſe, that I might be aſſiſtant in making proviſion for ſeats if occaſion required, he ſaid I muſt take breakfaſt with him, which was ſoon brought in by the woman who had ſhut the door as before mentioned: I aſked him

if ſhe was his wife, he told me ſhe was, on which I aroſe from my ſeat and offered her my hand, aſking her how ſhe did, but ſhe in diſpleaſure refuſed, and ſaying not a word, directly left the room; after breakfaſt we went to the houſe where the meeting was to be held, and there ſoon came a great number of people, and the prieſt alſo very near the door, where he ſtood cautioning his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but ſeveral came by an alley to the back door, and others ſeemed little to regard him, that after a time he went away, and through the goodneſs of the Lord we had a ſolid profitable meeting; for I believe many were there whoſe hearts were reached and tendered by the love and power of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and among them I ſaw my ſcornful land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady; it ſeems, a woman whom ſhe valued had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her to come with her; before the meeting ended, I perceived her countenance was changed and her ſtout heart tendered, and after it ſhe came to me with her huſband, and kindly invited me to dine with them; I owned their love, and deſired them to mind the Truth by which they had been reached; ſo in humble thankfulneſs of heart to the great Author of all living mercies, I left them, and went that night to Salem; and tarrying one meeting the next day, paſſed on to Marblehead and had a meeting in the Town-hall, the magiſtrates readily granting it, which was large. I had to ſpeak on morality, the nature and neceſſity thereof, ſhewing that a man could not be a true Chriſtian without being a good moraliſt; I thought they had need of a reformation in their morals, tho' they profeſſed chriſtianity in a high manner; one thing is worthy of remarking, the ſelect men and officers were very careful to keep the rude boys and people that came to the door from making diſturbance, ſeveral of them walked to the door and ſpoke to them, and rapped ſome on their heads with their canes to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016223_0066_0F9BD49C5AF6D118"/>
make them ſtill; the meeting ended to ſatisfaction without the leaſt oppoſition; from thence, taking a meeting at Lynn by the way, I went to Boſton, and was at their meetings on firſt day in the forenoon and afternoon, at both which, ſeveral came that were not in profeſſion with us, and truth opened the doctrine thereof to the people pretty freely; but I was not eaſy to leave this town without having on opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with friends by themſelves, for which purpoſe it was held at Benja. Bagnall's, and therein I was deeply bowed under a ſenſe of the ſtate of eaſe in which ſome were delighting themſelves in their imaginary attainments, whilſt the pure ſeed lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuffering; but bleſſed be the Lord, who was graciouſly pleaſed to endue with a ſpirit of Love and tender compaſſion, and thereby enabled me to diſcharge myſelf fully, and I was releaſed from what had lain very heavy upon me for ſeveral days; the next day I had an opportunity with ſeveral friends at Samuel Pope's, and then left Boſton pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eaſy in my mind, and went to Samuel Thayres at Mendam, who accompanied me the next day to Uxbridge, where we had a meeting with a few raw, talkative people, which, through the goodneſs of God, was nevertheleſs to ſome degree of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I returned with Sam. Thayre to his houſe, where I met with Hannah Jenkinſon from Pennſylvania, and we were at Mendam meeting together; ſhe then went towards Boſton, and I to Wainſokett, and Providencetown, and had a meeting at each place, the latter of which was a poor meeting, the people looking for words and not waiting for the word of life in their own hearts; from thence I went to and had a large and good meeting at Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanticut, the Lord's preſence being felt to his own praiſe, and another at Greenwich; then proceeded to Smithfield and Taunton, taking a meeting at each to ſome good degree of ſatisfaction; from
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016223_0067_0F9BD4A21A3D7010"/>
thence to Swanzey, Freetown, Rocheſter, and Cuſhnet, having a meeting at each, at one of which, after I ſtood up to ſpeak a few words in great fear, life being low and as I apprehended the ſeed under ſuffering, I heard a kind of ſighing by one in the gallery, which ſeemed to bring death rather than to raiſe life, and after I had ſpoken a ſentence or two, it became exceedingly burthenſome; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it came freſh in my mind to ſay; "can an Iſraelite ſing a true Hebrew ſong whilſt the ſeed is in captivity and under ſuffering? an attempt of the kind ſhews ignorance." At which there was a great ſilence and the ſighing ended, and I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrength to deliver what was on mind, and truth was felt in a good degree to ariſe; the meeting end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well, and ſeveral friends expreſſed their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with the ſervice on that day. Being clear of thoſe parts I went to Rhode-iſland, and in a ſenſe of the goodneſs and mercy of the Lord who had helped me in my travels in his work, my ſoul wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped before him.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſecond of the ſixth month I ſat with friends at Newport in their fore and afternoon meetings, and next morning left Rhode-iſland with a heavy heart and had a meeting at South Kingſton, where I met with Suſanna Morris and her ſiſter Hannah Hurford, and the ſame day had a meeting at James Parry's, and the day following we had one at Thomas Stanton's in Weſterly, among a mixed people of ſeveral ſocieties, to whom I felt a ſtream of goſpel love; but the meeting was hurt by ſeveral appearances of one preſent who lived at no great diſtance. Our manner of ſitting in ſilence is ſo very different from the common practice of moſt other religious ſocieties, that it is no marvel if it ſhould be as time miſpent to ſome, and fill others with wonder, which was the caſe this day; and for want of a deep inward attention to the living word
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:016223_0068_0F9BD4A32E4F7FD0"/>
of Truth, inſtead of inſtructing the people in the true way of worſhip in the love of the Goſpel, there may be a warm cenſuring of them for what they underſtand not, and thereby raiſe a diſlike in them, to the forecloſing of other ſervice; and I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved hurt done by this means, by ſome who appeared in the impatience, not having the weight of the work upon them; cuſtom had taught the people to look for words, and they were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by words ſpoken not in ſeaſon, and therefore not fitly ſpoken; I left this meeting with ſorrow, and after I mounted my horſe, the perſon who had appeared there three times, came to me, and ſaid "he hoped he had not hindered my ſervice in it;" I reminded him, that he had informed the people in that meeting, their looking for words had been one reaſon, why the Lord had ſhut up the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Truth in the hearts of his ſervants, which I told him I did believe was not then the caſe; but that his forward appearances had mudded the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, unſettled the people, and marred the ſervice, ſo we parted; and feeling my mind drawn back towards Newport, I went that evening to James Congdon's, and the next day to Newport, calling in my way at James Parry's, where I found Lydia Dean very ſick, ſhe being ſo far on her journey towards home, and on the fifth day of the week I was at two ſatisfactory meetings there, and on ſeventh day had a ſmall meeting at Nicholas Eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, and on firſt day two large good meetings at Newport, and next day hearing that Lydia Dean was come to Samuel Clark's on Conanicut Iſland, I went with ſeveral others to ſee her, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with us to Newport, where after a very ſhort notice we had a large evening meeting, wherein the Lord was pleaſed mercifully to favour us with his immediate preſence to the glory and praiſe of his own eternal name which is worthy for ever!
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:016223_0069_0F9BD4A3C7773970"/>
After attending their monthly-meeting at Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, finding my mind clear and eaſy to proceed homeward, Lydia Dean, Patience Barker, John Eaſton, and myſelf ſet out from Newport, taking leave of friends in a tender manner on both ſides, and were the firſt day following at a meeting in Weſterly, which was in a good degree ſatisfactory, and paſſing through Connecticut to New-Milford, Oblong, and Nine-partners, had meetings in each place; and having a great deſire to be at our yearly-meeting for Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, to be held at Burlington, which was near approaching, we paſſed on, and took a meeting at Samuel Field's, to which ſeveral not of our ſociety came, and the opportunity was through the goodneſs of the Lord profitable; we then proceeded as faſt as convenient, and reached Burlington on firſt day in the time of the yearly-meeting, where many friends were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and Michael Lightfoot in his return from Great Britain, with whom came John Haſlam, and Edmund Peckover on a viſit to friends in America; this meeting was large and ſolid, at which I alſo met my dear wife to our mutual, thankful rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; after the meeting I went home, where I found things as to the outward in good order, for which I was humbly thankful to the Lord, who had not only been with me by his heavenly preſence in this journey, and brought me ſafe home to my family, but had ſupported them in my abſence; bleſſed be his holy name for ever!</p>

                  <p>His Viſit to Long-Iſland—Viſit with others to the families of Friends in Nottingham—and to ſome fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Philadelphia and to the Mayor of that City, alſo to the aſſembly of Pennſylvania in the Year <hi>1748.</hi>—His Journey with Michael Lightfoot to the Yearly-Meeting at Weſt River in Maryland—and accompanied by Joſhua Brown to divers Meetings in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey.—His conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Apprehending it his duty to viſit Friends in Europe, and proceedings in preparing to enter upon that weighty Service, to the time of his leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home in order to take ſhipping for London.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the Spring of the Year 1743, having draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in my mind to make a general viſit to Friends on Long-Iſland, I ſat out in the third month, in order to be at the Yearly-meeting at Fluſhing, which began on the ſixth day of the week, and continued until the ſecond of the week following; it was large and ſignally owned by the power of Truth in each ſitting; the publick ſervice in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry lay moſtly on Edmund Peckover, who was there in his way to New-England; on firſt day I thought I had an engagement to ſtand up, and conſiderable matter before me, and after ſpeaking three or four ſentences which came with weight, all cloſed up, and I ſtood ſtill and ſilent for ſeveral minutes, and ſaw nothing more, not one word to ſpeak; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the eyes of moſt of the people were upon me, they, as well as myſelf expecting more; but nothing further appearing, I ſat down, I think I may ſay in reverent fear and humble reſignation, when that remarkable ſentence of <hi>Job,</hi> chap. i. 21. was preſented to my mind, <hi>Naked came I out of my mothers womb, and naked ſhall I return; the Lord
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:016223_0071_0F9BD4A5624F6AB0"/>
gave, and the Lord hath taken away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> and for, I ſuppoſe, near a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour I remained in a ſilent quiet; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards let in great reaſonings and fear leſt I had not waited the right time to ſtand up, and ſo was ſuffered to fall into reproach; for the adverſary who is ever buſy, and unwearied in his attempts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, perſuaded me to believe that the pleople would laugh me to ſcorn, and I might as well return home immediately and privately, as attempt any further viſit on the Iſland; after meeting I hid my inward exerciſe and diſtreſs as much as I could, when night came I lodged with a ſympathizing friend and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced elder, who began to ſpeak encouragingly to me, but I ſaid to him, that I hoped he would not take it amiſs if I deſired him to forbear ſaying any thing; for if he ſhould ſay good things, I had no capacity to believe, and if otherwiſe, I could not then underſtand ſo as to be profitably corrected or inſtructed, and after ſome time fell aſleep; when I awoke, I remembred that the ſentences I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the meeting, were ſelf evident truths, which could not be wreſted to the diſadvantage of friends, or diſhonour of the cauſe of Truth, tho' they might look like roots or ſomething to para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon, and altho' my ſtanding ſome time ſilent before I ſat down might occaſion the people to think me a ſilly fellow, yet they had not cauſe to blame me for delivering words without ſenſe or life; thus I became very quiet, and not much depreſſed, and was favoured with an humble reſignation of mind, and a deſire that the Lord would be pleaſed to magnify his own name and truth, and preſerve me from bringing any reproach thereon; ſo I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to have meetings appointed, and my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar friend and intimate acquaintance Caleb Raper of Burlington, being at that meeting, went as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with me, of whoſe company I was glad, he
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:016223_0072_0F9BD4AB6621A860"/>
being a valuable elder: We went firſt to Rockaway, then to Jamaica, Sequetague, Setakit, Matinicock, Cowneck, and Weſtbury meetings, and at moſt of them I had good ſatisfaction; the good preſence of the Lord in whom I delighted above all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſſed to my comfort, and I believe to the edification and comfort of the ſincere in heart; but the teſtimony of Truth went particularly ſharp to the lukewarm profeſſors and libertines in our ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that humbling time I had at Fluſhing was of ſingular ſervice to me, being thereby made willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject to the Divine openings of Truth, and motion of the eternal Spirit and pure word of Life, in ſpeaking to the ſeveral ſtates of thoſe who were preſent in the meetings, and life came into dominion, and the power thereof overſhadowed at times, to my humble admiration, bleſſed be the name of the Lord who is worthy for ever and ever!</p>
               <p>Then croſſing Whiteſtone ferry we had meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Weſt-Cheſter, Momarineck, Rywoods, and Longreach, which were moſtly to good ſatisfaction, we then went to New-York and were at their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the evening had a ſelect one with friends, which gave me conſiderable relief, and I believe ſatisfaction to them, and we were made thankful together in the renewings of the covenant of life; from thence we went to a meeting at Newtown on Long-Iſland, and to the monthly-meeting at Fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where friends gave me a certificate in return to that I brought from home, in which they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their unity with my ſervice on the Iſland; then taking leave of friends in ſweetneſs of mind and inward peace, being clear of thoſe parts I returned homewards, and went to the Narrows that night, but could not get over; next morning early croſſed the ferry, when there was a great ſwell, occaſioned by the ſtormy weather in the evening and night before, and having now no wind were obliged to
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016223_0073_0F9BD4ADA81BB728"/>
row the boat over; in the paſſage I remembred, that in croſſing this ferry when coming on this viſit, I thought myſelf never much poorer, having only a ſecret hope and truſt in the holy arm of Power, and being now inwardly ſenſible of my own weakneſs, I had to acknowledge that I went not forth on this embaſſy in my own will and ſtrength, and therefore craved only, that my bleſſed Lord and maſter would blot out mine offences, and yet enable me ſo to walk in humble obedience the reſidue of my time, as to be favoured with the anſwer of well done at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and knowing the nature and treachery of ſelf, did not want to be intruſted with much reward at preſent, chooſing rather, that the Lord in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and mercy, ſhould deal out to me my daily bread according to his own pleaſure, <hi>bipaſſed over this Jordan with my ſtaff and now I am become two bands,</hi> was the ſaying of Jacob <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxii. 10. As this ſaying of the good Patriarch came freſh in my mind, I thought, that altho' I could not ſee myſelf much increaſed in heavenly treaſure, I came poor, and had only the ſtaff of Faith to lean upon, yet I had to bleſs the Lord that he was now pleaſed to favour me with the ſame ſtaff in my return, on the never failing ſtrength whereof, I might with ſafety evermore rely, and in holy reſignation I had to praiſe his worthy name. I proceeded with my friend Caleb Raper to Burlington, where we parted in much love and nearneſs, in which we had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, I reached home about wheat harveſt, and found my dear wife and family well.</p>
               <p>I went not much abroad the reſidue of this ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the year following; but was careful to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our own and many neighbouring meetings, alſo monthly, quarterly and yearly-meetings in this and the adjacent province, ſome buſineſs of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature, together with my own circumſtances, neceſſarily engaged me for ſeveral years, in which
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016223_0074_0F9BD4AEB79C9668"/>
time, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſpring of the year 1745, my dear wife having drawings in her mind to viſit the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of friends in Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina, obtained a certificate of the unity of friends with her, to travel in that ſervice with Jane Hoſkins of Cheſter; and in the ſame year I was nominated with ſeveral other friends to viſit the families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to our monthly-meeting, which being large and many friends living at a diſtance, was a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work, and not fully peformed until the fall of the year 1747, when account was given that the ſervice was perfected to a good degree of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the winter following, I had it on my mind to viſit all the families of the particular meeting of Newark near Brandywine, who ſeemed to be in a declining ſtate as to religion, having dropped their week day meeting, and often much neglected to attend their firſt day meeting, many of the elderly friends being deceaſed, and their children almoſt turned to the world, and united to the ſpirit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and paſtimes thereof; my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown, and his wife, and mine were with me on this ſervice, and great plainneſs was uſed in opening to many particulars the cauſe of their declenſion, and as the love of truth engaged me in the ſervice, I had peace and ſatisfaction, and thoſe viſited ſeemed to receive the viſit kindly.</p>
               <p>In the ſpring of the year 1748, I felt drawings in my mind to viſit ſome families of friends in Philadelphia, of which I acquainted my brethren at home, and having their concurrence, in the fourth month I joined with ſome friends in the city who were ſometime before appointed to the ſervice, and we went in much love from houſe to houſe, the Lord, by his good preſence, being with us to our mutual comfort; and as I attended to the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of truth, I found a concern to go to the mayor of the city (accompanied by my good friend Iſrael
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:016223_0075_0F9BD4AF0CCFBD48"/>
Pemberton the elder,) and was engaged to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the nature of his office as a magiſtrate, and exhorted him to take care that he bore not the ſword in vain, but put the laws in execution againſt evil doers, ſuch as drunkards, profane ſwearers, &amp;c. and to be, in his authority, a terror to the wicked, and an encourager of them that do well; he was loving and tender, and expreſſed his ſatisfaction with the viſit.</p>
               <p>While I was in the city, the Governor called or ſummoned the members of Aſſembly together, and in preſſing terms laid before them the defenceleſs ſtate of Pennſylvania, in order to prevail with the houſe to grant a ſum of money to ſtation a ſhip of force at Delaware capes, alſo to encourage the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a battery below the city, which was began ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before by ſubſcription, but likely to be too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for the undertakers; one night as I lay in my bed, it came very weightily upon me to go to the houſe of aſſembly, and lay before the members thereof the danger of departing from truſting in that divine arm of power which had hitherto protected the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of our land in peace and ſafety; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern reſted on me ſeveral days, which occaſioned me with earneſt breathings to ſeek the Lord, that if this was a motion from him, he would be pleaſed to direct my ſteps therein, ſo that I might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from giving juſt cauſe of offence to any, for it ſeemed to be a very difficult time; many, even of our ſociety, declaring their willingneſs that a ſum of money ſhould be given to the King, to ſhew our loyalty to him, and that they were willing to part with their ſubſtance for his uſe, tho' as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we had a teſtimony to bear againſt all outward wars and ſightings; I made no man privy to my concern until a week had near paſſed; when one morning it became ſo heavy upon me, that I went to the houſe of an intimate friend, who being juſt up invited me to come in, and as we ſat together,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:016223_0076_0F9BD4AFB9C64C68"/>
he had a ſenſe that ſomething of weight was upon me, and aſked if I was concerned about the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; whereupon I aſked him, if he ever knew of any friends going to the aſſembly with a concern to ſpeak to them? he anſwered nay, adding,
<q>but I have often wondered that they have not, for I have underſtood that it was formerly a common practice for them to ſit in ſilence a while, like ſolemn worſhip, before they proceeded to do buſineſs.</q>
I told him, that I had it on my mind to go to the houſe that morning and ſhould be glad of ſuitable company; he directed me to one whom he thought ſuch, and I immediately went to him and acquainted him with my concern; but as I ſpake, I felt that I had better go alone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told him, that if he did not feel clear and eaſy to go with me, I adviſed him to ſtay; he replied "thy way is before thee, but I believe I muſt not go:" I therefore returned to my friend, who did not diſcourage me, tho' I had no company; being preſſed in mind, I went directly to the State-houſe before I took breakfaſt, and got there juſt as the ſpeaker, J. K. was going in, I beckoned to him and he came to me; I told him I wanted to be admitted into the houſe, for I thought I had ſomething to ſay to them which ſeemed to me of importance; he ſaid, it was a critical time, and they had a difficult affair before them, and queried, whether I had not better wait until the houſe parted, and another member being near, ſaid, he thought it would be beſt, and leſs liable to give offence, for there were divers members not of our ſociety, and if I would wait until the houſe broke up, they would inform all the members that were friends, and did not doubt they would be willing to give me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to inform them what was on my mind. I told them, that would give me no relief, for I had a particular deſire that thoſe members who were not
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016223_0077_0F9BD4B088639158"/>
of our ſociety ſhould be preſent; believing that it would be better for them to hear and judge for themſelves than to have it at ſecond hand, as it might be differently repreſented; at which they were a little ſilent; then I requeſted the ſpeaker that he would go in and inform the members, that a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try man was in waiting who had a deſire to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, having ſomething to communicate to them, and if they refuſed he would be clear; he readily and affectionately anſwered he would, and ſoon brought me word that they were willing. There was a great awe over my mind when I went in, which I thought in ſome meaſure ſpread, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the members beyond my expectation, after a ſilence of perhaps ten or twelve minutes, I felt as though all fear of man was taken away, and my mind influenced to addreſs them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance after the following manner.</p>

               <p>I acknowledged their kindneſs in hearing me with ſo much patience, and taking leave, withdrew; ſeveral members followed me out and expreſſed their ſatisfaction in an affectionate manner with my viſit; and embracing each other, we parted in a ſenſe of the love and power of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who, with the Father, is worthy of all thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>After my ſervice in Philadelphia was over, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with peace and ſatisfaction, and went not much abroad ſave to our quarterly and yearly-meetings, until the ſpring following in the year 1749, when I went with Michael Lightfoot to the yearly-meeting at Weſt-river in Maryland, in which journey, the weather being hot and ſome weakneſs of body attending, it threw me into a ſtrong fever and a ſtoppage in my breaſt, that it was with ſome difficulty I got home, and continued without any amendment a conſiderable time; and one evening as I was preparing for bed, an impoſthume broke, which I ſuppoſe was on my lights becauſe it came up my windpipe, almoſt ſtrangling me for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, that I expected I was near expiring, but felt a reſignation in this trying time beyond my expectation, which I took to be a great favour from the Lord; there is no ſupport like the light of his countenance. I continued bleeding more or leſs many days, but gradually mended. In the eighth month being pretty well recovered, in much love

I felt drawings in my mind to viſit ſome meetings in the back parts of Cheſter, Philadelphia, and Bucks counties, and part of New-Jerſey, and laying my concern before my friends had their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and was accompanied by my kinſman Joſhua Brown through moſt of the journey; our firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meeting was at Radnor, in which truth owned our ſervice in a good degree, and paſſing over Schuylkill went to Plymouth, North-wales, Skippack, and New-providence, which laſt meeting for want of more careful notice was very ſmall, and not being eaſy in my mind, I had a ſingular free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to let them know, that I would endeavour to be at that place again on the ſecond day following, and ſhould be glad they would pleaſe to give full notice thereof, and having a ſtrong draught in my mind to turn back to North-wales, I went the ſame evening to Robert Jones's at Skippack, and next day to ſee a friend who had been a long time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, with whom we had a good opportunity, which I believe was of advantage to the friend, through the goodneſs and mercy of the bleſſed ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of Iſrael; I alſo viſited two other friends, and we were comforted together in the renewing of heavenly goodneſs; and on firſt day was at North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wales meeting, which was large and ſatisfactory, and at Providence again on ſecond day, where friends generally met, and I had an opportunity to clear myſelf in a particular manner; then went to Evans's meeting by the ſide of Schuylkill, and had a meeting the ſame evening at the houſe of Thomas May, both which were to ſome ſatisfaction; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards went to Maiden-creek, Exeter, and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and from thence over Delaware to Kingwood, and viſited the meetings in Burlington, Glouceſter, and Salem Counties as far down as Greenwich, and returnd homewards by Haddonfield, from whence in my going down, my kinſman Joſhua

Brown left me and went home; I called to viſit Hannah Cooper, whoſe huſband had not long been dead, ſhe ſeemed under affliction of body and mind; I felt a near ſympathy with her, and tho' we did not converſe much together, yet in the owning love of him who is a friend to the afflicted, we were mutually comforted; ſhe expreſſed her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in a tender manner, ſaying that ſoon after I came her exerciſe was lightened, and ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in a ſenſe of the kindneſs of the Lord, in affording a ſympathy and inward feeling to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his family; my ſoul was humbled in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thankfulneſs to him the author of all good, who is praiſe worthy for ever. In the morning I had a paſſage over Delaware about the tenth hour, which by reaſon of ice had not been paſſable for ſeveral days before; tarrying in Philadelphia that night, I went next day to Derby meeting, and the day following got well home, and found my dear wife and family well.</p>
               <p>On my leaving home to perform this viſit, I felt great inward weakneſs, and in going from meeting to meeting, frequent humbling baptiſms attended, in which the preſent ſtate of the church was ſeen, and the conditions of many ſpoken to in the love of truth, which made me often think that it ſeemed like a farewell viſit, at leaſt for a long time.</p>
               <p>I may now make a remark which I hope will not be improper or unprofitable. As I paſſed along in this viſit, I obſerved ſome people would earneſtly preſs me to go home with them, and would ſay they would not take it kind if I did not, and friends did not uſe to ſerve them ſo, that is, paſs by them; yet I thought there was not much of the innocent ſweetneſs of truth to be felt at their houſes, or even about them; tho' they would ſay, why! thou haſt hit the nail on the head, there is juſt ſuch people among us as thou haſt ſpoken of; and ſeemed as

to themſelves, ſafe and eaſy, when perhaps their religion lay much in thinking that good friends were familiar with them and thought well of them; I alſo took notice of another ſort, who tho' they were not fond of having friends to go with them, would ſpeak well of their ſervice, and deal it out liberally to others in a cenſorious manner, and not look on themſelves with a true proſpect which would have led them to ſmite on their own breaſts, with a feeling, ſhort prayer, rather than apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves better than others, when perhaps coveteouſneſs and a worldly ſpirit had almoſt deſtroyed charity, which is the ſure product of true religion; a third ſort, I beheld humbled and bowed, whoſe words were few, and would frequently if they ſaid any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, lament the ſtate of the ſociety, and ſpeak of their own weakneſs, and fear leſt they ſhould not walk in the uprightneſs of truth before their own families and the church, the dew reſted on them in their humble ſituation; I was thankful in the ſenſe I had, that there were ſome few of theſe in almoſt every meeting, and I had a firm belief, that ſome among the youth were under the hand of the great preparer of men for his own work; theſe children are moſtly modeſt and diffident of themſelves, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely affectionate, not over forward or fondling, but lovers of truth in heart, to whom I felt great nearneſs of ſpirit, believing they would grow, in the root of Life; I beheld ſome others among the youth, whom I feared had too great a delight to live on the labours of others, who nevertheleſs had been favoured with the reaches of divine Love, but for want of dwelling deep and humble with the pure witneſs in themſelves, ran out in the affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate part, and were greatly delighted to hear truth's teſtimony, and valued inſtruments according to their own liking; theſe, tho' they appear as goodly flowers, for want of an humble acode in the vine,

do ſometimes wither away as graſs on the houſe top. <hi>If you love me, keep my commandments,</hi> was a precept of our holy Lord and Maſter; to keep his commandments we muſt inwardly dwell with his grace in our hearts, by which the law of the ſpirit of life is known and underſtood, by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening and everlaſting ſure word of Prophecy, which will privately interpret, and ſecretly ſhew to every man his duty, and the calling of God, and abilitate to abide therein, and his <hi>law is light</hi> and his commandment as a lamp to the feet of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ever.</p>
               <p>As I ſat in a week day meeting in the winter (1748,) which was held in a private houſe, (our meeting houſe being burnt ſometime before;) I felt great weakneſs and poverty attending my mind, which occaſioned a deep inquiry into the cauſe; and after a time of inward waiting, the humbling divine preſence was felt in reverent profound ſilence, yet the gentle operation of the divine power cauſed a ſecret inward trembling, and the following was uttered in a language intelligent to the inward man, <hi>gather thyſelf from all the cumbers of the world, and be thou weaned from the popularity, love, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thereof.</hi> I believed this to be the voice of the holy one of Iſrael, as a merciful warning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for my final change, or to ſtand ready for ſome ſervice which would ſeparate me from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral buſineſs and the neareſt connections in life; and from that time I endeavoured to ſettle my affairs, and contract my little buſineſs as well as I could. In the ſummer following I met with an unexpected trial, for without my knowledge my name was put in the new commiſſion for juſtices of the peace, and endeavours were uſed to perſuade me to be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in order to act in that ſtation, and ſome of my particular friends told me it ſeemed providential, and they thought it was my place to accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:016223_0084_0F9BD4BBC3EB6718"/>
as I might be helpful by way of example to ſome in the commiſſion who were friends; for a ſhort time I was exceedingly ſtraitened, but my eye being fixed on the Lord for counſel, it pleaſed him in great condeſcention once more to revive the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence before mentioned, <hi>gather thyſelf from all the cumbers of the world,</hi> &amp;c. which to me ſettled the point, and I became eaſy in mind, and humbly thankful to my bleſſed inſtructor who had called me for other ſervice.</p>
               <p>After my return home from the viſit to friends in New-Jerſey before related, I felt ſuch an inward ſilence for about two or three weeks, that I thought I had done with the world, and alſo any further ſervice in the church, and the preparing hint was brought to my mind, with thankfulneſs that I had endeavoured in a good degree to practiſe it; and one day walking alone, I felt myſelf ſo inwardly weak and feeble, that I ſtood ſtill, and by the reverence that covered my mind, I knew that the hand of the Lord was on me and his preſence round about, the earth was ſilent and all fleſh brought into ſtillneſs, and light went forth with brightneſs, and ſhone on Great Britain, Ireland, and Holland, and my mind felt the gentle, yet ſtrongly drawing cords of that love which is ſtronger than death, which made me ſay, Lord! <hi>go before, and ſtrengthen me, and I will follow whitherſoever thou leads.</hi> I had ſeen this journey near fifteen years in a very plain manner, and at times for ten years, thought the concern ſo ſtrong upon me that I muſt lay it before my friends for their advice; but was ſecretly reſtrained; being made to believe, that an exerciſe of that ſort would ripen beſt to be kept quiet in my own heart to know the right time, by no means deſiring to run without being ſent; to ſee a thing is not a commiſſion to do that thing; the time when, and judgment to know the acceptable time, are the gifts of God. The time I had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:016223_0085_0F9BD4BCA2567760"/>
for the journey was ſhort, and therefore thought it was needful to employ my time to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and as I had a deſire to ſee friends of ſeveral particular meetings, namely Bradford, Weſt and Eaſt Caln, Uwchland, Nantmill, and Goſhen, my ſiſter Dinah James went with me to thoſe meetings, which through the goodneſs of the Lord were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly profitable, we had alſo a meeting at Henry Hockley's, near French Creek Iron-works, which was to ſome good ſatisfaction, and ſo to the quarterly meeting at Concord in the twelfth month, where I met my brother William Brown, who queried of me where I had been, and what I had been doing? I told him, I had been doing as he, and every ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ought to do, collecting little debts and paying where I owed, and endeavouring to ſettle my affairs; for that ſuch care was neceſſary when one expected a great ſum would be immediately demanded: In a few days after my return from the quarterly-meeting, I laid my concern before our preparative meeting, in order that friends might have a month to weigh and conſider it before I ſpoke for a certificate; for I wanted their feeling concurrence in this weighty undertaking, firmly believing, that my great and good Maſter would not require any thing of me in which my dear friends could not concur, and tho' while the power of Truth was upon me, I was made freely to give up; yet now home, and the near affection to a dear wife, only ſon, relations and friends, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly quick and affecting, and ſomething in me ſeemed to have a choice, that my friends would judge that I was too weakly and infirm in body, or not otherwiſe qualified for the ſervice, and if that ſhould be their mind, I thought I ſhould be clear; in the interval I viſited the neighbouring meetings, and carefully attended to the motion of truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and in the firſt month, having the concurrence
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016223_0086_0F9BD4BD388475C8"/>
of the preparative meeting, I laid my concern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the monthly meeting, and attended our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſpring meeting at Philadelphia, and my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown having ſpoken for a certificate on the like concern, it ſeemed pleaſant to think of croſſing the Ocean together, and friends were for propoſing a paſſage, and what ſhip we ſhould go in; but I felt a ſecret prohibition againſt being any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about a paſſage until I had a certificate, and knew that I was fully clear; ſo returned home. And having a deſire to ſee friends in York county over Suſquehanna, I went there, accompanied by my brother James Brown, to the meetings at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry, Warrington, Huntington, and Monallan, which were moſtly to a good degree of ſatisfaction, and in my return being humble and low in mind, and ruminating on my European journey, which was before me, my ſpirit ſeemed to ſink, and my affection to my dear wife, and family, and friends ſo awakened upon me, that it looked to me impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to part from them and live; but endeavouring to retire, bleſſed be the name of the Lord the helper of his people! by whoſe power a ſilence was known, and by a gentle, inſtructive, inward voice, my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was gained, and my mind diverted from its pain by the following query: "Suppoſe thou ſhouldſt lend a valuable thing to a neighbour of thine, to be returned on demand, and thou ſhouldſt favour him therewith from time to time, not only one year, but ſeven, and then ſhouldſt ſee cauſe to demand it to be reſigned; wouldſt thou not think that neighbour ungrateful, if he did not reſign it chearfully, and with thankfulneſs and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuitable to thy kindneſs?" The propoſition demanded my aſſent, and my underſtanding was fully opened by the following application: "All that thou enjoyeſt is mine, doſt thou love theſe things more than me? if not, why is it ſo hard for
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:016223_0087_0F9BD4C28A8DF338"/>
thee to reſign all to follow me? which made me cry, <hi>Lord! enable me, and I will follow thee, it is only by thy ſtrength I can do it;</hi>" and by the gracious goodneſs of Chriſt, my great and good Maſter, I felt an humble reſignation to his will, who being all things to his people, is worthy to be followed and obeyed for ever. Now I was led to believe this was the inſtruction of the bleſſed ſpirit to me, and as I had much comfort and ſatisfaction thereby, I am free to leave it as a hint, that others under trials of what kind ſo ever, may be encouraged to look unto him for help, who is the Lord, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſave, and able to deliver to the uttermoſt all who ſincerely truſt in him.</p>
               <p>I returned home, and my certificate being ſigned in the ſecond month, attended our quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Concord in the third month, and went to Philadelphia to ſee for a paſſage, and with my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther W.

               </argument>
               <p>ON the fourth day of the fourth month (1750) being the ſecond of the week, we left Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, accompanied by ſeveral of our relations and friends to Cheſter, and went on board the ſhip Carolina, Stephen Meſnard commander, (bound for London,) where my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown and myſelf took leave of them; and paſſing down Delaware, went out to ſea in the afternoon of the ſixth of the ſame month, and had a good paſſage, in which I was not ſea ſick, tho' my brother was moſt of the time. We landed at Dover on the ſixth of the fifth month, being juſt five weeks from the time I left my own houſe, and we had to rejoice with humble thankfulneſs, that, during the paſſage, we were careful to keep our meetings in the great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin twice a week, in which we felt the preſence of our great Lord and Maſter, and therein were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. On the day we landed we had a meeting at Dover to good ſatisfaction, then took paſſage in a ſtage coach to Canterbury the ſame evening, and lodged at William Patterſon's, who entertained us very kindly; reſted there on ſeventh day, and on firſt day ſat with friends in their morning and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon meetings to ſome ſatisfaction; tho' I had little to ſay to them, I thought there was a tender people in that city and W. B. had an open time; next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taking our paſſage in a ſtage coach, we reached London the ſame evening, and continued in and about the city until the twenty-firſt of the ſixth

month, in which time I wrote divers letters to my wife and particular friends in Pennſylvania, and was ſeveral times at each of the meetings in the city, in which I ſat moſtly ſilent, under a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mind from a ſenſe of a too forward miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which rather diſturbed the ſolemn quiet thereof than miniſtred inſtruction to the humble waiting children, of which number I thought there were many in that city; tho' it ſeemed delightful to thoſe who loved to hear words eloquently delivered, and to have the itching ear pleaſed, yet in heart were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines, and in practice diſorderly walkers, I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought, that my ſilent ſitting was ſo ordered for an example to others for a more ſteady waiting in their own gifts, to know life to ariſe into domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in meetings, my exerciſe increaſed ſo, that my ſleep ſeemed to depart from me, and I remained as one ſealed up as to miniſtry, nor had I freedom to go from houſe to houſe to dine, or to make many acquaintance, I was therefore cenſured by ſome as ſingular and narrow; at length I felt great enlargement of heart towards other ſocieties, tho' my mouth was ſhut towards our own, and for a time, it ſeemed as if I muſt go and have meetings among thoſe who did not profeſs with us; and one day, as I was walking towards Ratcliff Fields for the air, a draught of affection flowed ſo ſtrong towards ſome in high ſtations in government, that I concluded, that I muſt declare the way of life and ſalvation through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord among them, feeling a greater openneſs that way than to friends; but making a ſtand, I ſecretly cried, ah Lord! what then will become of the family whom thou dreweſt me hither to viſit; then, after a little while, that charge came into my mind very freſh, Mat. x. 5-6. <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not; but go rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> which

brought great ſweetneſs, and an increaſing heart-yearning for and love to the houſhold, and made me acknowledge, good art thou oh! Lord God, for thy mercies endure for ever and ever, and I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that Nehemiah quietly viewed the ſtate of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem by night, and ſaw, that if I had any ſervice to do in London, the time for it was not yet come; I alſo remembred what came into my mind at the ſecond meeting I was in after my landing, in which I had but a few ſentences to ſpeak, and the motion of life ceaſed, and I ſat down, as I have always found it ſafe to do, and felt inward poverty and weakneſs, yet a quiet and attentive mind; but my brother W. B. had good ſervice, and an open time among the people, at which I did admire, and ſaid in my heart; he is fit to be ſent abroad; but alas! I am one of the meaneſt ſervants that was ever ſent over the ſea to preach the goſpel; when this gentle caution came before me; <hi>mind thy own buſineſs, and be faithful in thy gift, thou haſt a great journey before thee and thy ſtore is ſmall; live therefore frugally, and ſpend carefully, and covet not another's, and thou ſhalt not want what is convenient for thyſelf, and ſomething to ſpare to the needy:</hi> Whereupon I deſired with an humble heart, to be preſerved in patience and meekneſs, becoming a diſciple of my great Lord and Maſter, and therein to wait for renewed inſtruction and ability, to labour in mine own gift without repining, however ſmall.</p>
               <p>In a few days I felt ſome openneſs towards the Weſt of England, and informed my brother W. B. thereof, who, after a little pauſe, told me that his way opened Eaſtward; on ſome conſideration of the matter, we concluded it was beſt for each of us to mind the pointings of truth, tho' in ſome croſs to our own wills; for this proſpect ſeemed to part us; and if we ſhould endeavour to go together for a time, and then part, ſome might judge there was

a diſlike, or want of unity between us, and on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning with ſome of our friends, they were of the ſame mind; ſo we reſigned, and in much love and affection took leave of each other.</p>
               <p>Underſtanding there was an yearly-meeting to be held in Somerſetſhire for ſeveral of the Weſtern counties, and having ſome drawings to attend it, I left London on the twenty-firſt of the ſixth month in company with my friend John Hunt, at whoſe houſe I lodged, and John Pemberton who came over ſea with us on account of his health, and had a meeting that day at Stains, which was pretty good and open, the next at Baſingſtoke, and ſo on to Saliſbury, and Shaftſbury, the two laſt being dull meetings, which is often the caſe where friends are not careful to live near to truth, and reached to Ivelcheſter, the place where the yearly-meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, on ſeventh day in the evening the twenty-fifth of the month; on firſt day we had two meetings in the Town Hall, and many people being there, meetings were held at the Market Croſs in the ſtreet at the ſame time; I ſat ſilent that day; on the next there was a meeting of miniſters and elders in the morning, in which I had ſome remarks to make reſpecting miniſtry; there were alſo two public meetings the ſame day, one of which was dull, the other more open, and on third day two meetings rather better, when the yearly-meeting ended; ſome meetings being laid out for me, John Hunt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to London, but John Pemberton concluded to go with me a few days, and his company was kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted of by me, he being a ſober, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined young man. We went to Ilminſter the firſt appointed meeting, in which the good preſence was witneſſed much to my comfort, for I ſaw that the Lord was near, and helped me in my gift by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of the meeting, bleſſed be his name for ever! I alſo had an evening meeting at Chard,

and next day at Yeovil which was large and open for doctrine, then at Sherborn on the edge of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetſhire, from thence went to viſit the wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Jonah Thompſon at Compton, he being in Pennſylvania on a religious viſit; I had ſome good ſatisfaction in the family, and tarried there a day; then went to the meetings at Long Sutton, Puddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Grinton, Glaſtonbury, Shipton-mallet, and Frome, in which I had moſtly, cloſe and plain ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; yet not without a degree of the ſweetneſs and power of Truth, in a ſenſe whereof I was often made humbly thankful to the Lord. Then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Bath, was at the ſorenoon and afternoon meetings there, and had an evening meeting at Caleb Tyley's, which were in ſome good degree owned by truth; but there is a want of weighty ſolid friends in this place, which is much frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt ſorts of people on account of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; from thence we went to Bradford, and Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick meetings; but not being clear at the firſt, I returned, and had an evening meeting there, to which many came, and it ended to ſatisfaction. Here I may note, that having a deſire to ſee friends by themſelves, and ſomething on my mind in a cloſe manner to the ſociety; when I ſtood up and began to ſpeak, the houſe was ſoon almoſt filled by others, who would wait without, ſetting ſome one to watch when there was any thing ſpoken; upon their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, the ſubject in my view cloſed, and an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a doctrinal way preſented, and my mind turned to it, and I believe it was to the ſatisfaction of ſome ſeeking people preſent; after I ſat down a few minutes, finding no eaſe reſpecting my concern towards friends, I had a freedom to inform the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the public ſervice of that meeting was now over, but I had a deſire, that the members of the meeting would ſtay a little while; on which a friend went to the door, and when the others had gone

out ſhut it, and the friends moſtly kept their ſeats, and in a little time, the ſtate of the meeting came freſh before me again, and I had an opportunity to clear myſelf in a very plain manner, ſhewing that the greateſt enemies to the truth, were the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it, who did not obſerve the inſtructions of truth, or grace of God in their own hearts; for altho' the doctrine thereof when declared by quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied inſtruments, was clear and powerfully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, having the love, and ſweetening evidence of Truth with it, reaching the witneſs in their hearts; yet when the eyes of ſuch ſo reached, were turned to behold the ſteps and conduct of the libertine profeſſors among us, they were ſtumbled by their example, and ſuch were an offence to the little ones, and their portion by way of compariſon is hinted at by our Lord, when he ſays, Mat. xviii. 6. <hi>But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones who believe in me, it were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi> From thence we went to Weſtbury, and Lavington meetings, and to the quarterly-meeting for Wiltſhire held at Devizes, which began on the firſt day of the week, two meetings for public worſhip, and one in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for miniſters and elders, and next day for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and buſineſs, but I could ſee no time, nor room to clear myſelf to advantage for want of more ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the ſervice of meetings may be hurt for want of ſilence, and the minds of the people become too unſettled to underſtand and hear to profit; in a ſenſe whereof, I left this place with an heavy heart, and went to Chippenham, Corſham, Charlcot, and Melkſham meetings, beſides which had three even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meetings, one at Pickwick in a School-houſe belonging to Thomas Bennet, with his boarding ſcholars and others; one at John Fry's of Sutton Benjar, and the other at Samuel Ru<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:016223_0094_0F9BD4CE182D9728"/>
which were good meetings; then leaving Wiltſhire we paſſed through Bradford, and Bath, and came to Briſtol on the twenty-ſecond of the month, where I tarried until firſt day, the ſeventh of the eighth month, conſtantly attending their meetings as they came in courſe, and viſiting ſeveral families as truth opened my way, my mind and ſpirit was bowed very low in this city, under a ſenſe of too general a declenſion and falling away from truth, into pride, high-mindedneſs, and the ſpirit of the world, and a conformity to the vain cuſtoms and faſhions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, of which I frequently made mention amongſt them; I was at their two weeks meeting for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and quarterly-meeting for inſpecting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of truth, and laboured much to encourage them to hold weekly meetings for miniſters and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in order to enquire how meetings for worſhip were attended by public friends, and whether their miniſtry was acceptable, and the lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of miniſters and elders correſpondent with their doctrine and profeſſion, which care they had dropped for ſometime. I was at ſixteen meetings in this city, and one at Frenchay, and viſited Anthony Purver's boarding ſchool at that place, and being eaſy to leave Briſtol for the preſent, we went to Chewmagna in Somerſetſhire; and after dining at John Hipſley's, had a religious opportunity in his family, and the next day a meeting at Portiſhead, an evening meeting at James Players, then to Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verham, Sidcot, and Mark, ſome of which were good meetings, a few elderly friends here live near truth, and there was a viſitation to the youth, ſeveral of whom appeared tender and growing in religion; tho' many profeſſors are ſeeking after the gain, love, and friendſhip of the world, not enough conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Godlineſs with contentment is the beſt gain; our next meeting was at Bridgewater, then at Taunton, and were comforted together with friends

in their morning and afternoon meetings; in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence there is life, and the living are made able to praiſe the Lord who is worthy. From thence paſſing to Minehead, Milverton, Wellington, Spice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Columpton, having a meeting at each place, we came to Exeter in Devonſhire, and attended three meetings there on firſt day, in each of which I had ſomething to offer; but was much depreſſed under an apprehenſion of the prevalence of a deiſtical ſpirit over ſome, which, with the indifference of others about religion, and a light forward zeal in ſome others, without the deep, inward, baptizing knowledge of Truth, occaſion the pure and ever bleſſed power thereof to be at a low ebb in that city. When the children of the Lord know him their Redeemer to live by his heavenly power in them, they know alſo that thereby they live, and feelingly know his Truth and the precious teſtimony, and by this knowledge are influenced with an holy, humble zeal, in love and meekneſs to work in his vineyard the church, to the honour of God, and the edification and reſtoration one of another.</p>
               <p>Leaving Exeter, we went to Topſham and had a dark dull meeting, and ſtaying at a friend's houſe to dine, one at the table, who, as I underſtood, could not ſpare time to attend the meeting, aſked me if I was ever in New-England, and whether I could inform him what ſort of a country it was? for, added he, I have heard people ſay, that the corn (that is wheat) will not ripen there, but is ſmitten with a rotting mildew which blaſts the wheat in the ear; I ſuddenly felt that I had need of being careful in anſwering, but knew not why; I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with caution, that I had ſeen wheat in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which looked to be well grown, but in the ear where grain ſhould be, there was little elſe but a black ſmut in form of a grain; I have heard, ſaid he, that it would bear full, good wheat formerly,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:016223_0096_0F9BD4D19DC82D10"/>
and what can now be the cauſe why it is blaſted, didſt thou ever hear? On which I related to him a paſſage which I had heard, <hi>viz.</hi> Two perſons being in Boſton had a curioſity to ſee the old priſon, from whence thoſe friends were led to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution who were hanged at Boſton for their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimony and principles, and an inhabitant of the town going with them, brought them to the priſon, and one of the men ſaid to their guide, is this the old jail where the friends lay who were hanged? an old woman who ſat knitting at the door, tho' not ſpoken to, anſwered yes it is, and we feelingly know it, for a curſe has been on the land ever ſince, ſo that it will not bear wheat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a blaſting, and we are beholden to other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for bread. He replied with an air of jeſting, I have heard ſo, but I believe nothing of it. I told him we might obſerve, that the Almighty had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times manifeſted his diſpleaſure on a people or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by famine, the ſword, or peſtilence for their tranſgreſſions, if we had a belief in the ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the old Teſtament; he ſaid, it could not be, that the Almighty who is Love in perfection, and in himſelf infinitely happy for ever, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſeverity, and take vengeance on man the workmanſhip of his hand; ſome who are narrow in their way of thinking may believe ſuch things, but for his part, he had Ideas more noble of the deity than to believe ſuch notions; by which I perceived he was a deiſt, and did not regard the Scriptures, and that it would be vain to ſay much to him; hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often thought it was very difficult to ſay any thing to reach thoſe ſort of low freethinkers, who exerciſe themſelves in the wiſdom which is from beneath, and dwell ſafely in their own imaginations and conceits, whoſe communication is often infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to others, and to be perceived in the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and neighbourhoods where they reſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:016223_0097_0F9BD4D24122E8A8"/>From thence we went to went to Bovy, Newton-Buſhel, Totneſs and Kingſbridge, at the laſt, after the morning and afternoon meetings, we had one in the evening with friends ſelected, which was to ſatisfaction; and hearing of one family that lived many miles from any meeting, I had a deſire to ſee them, and went thither; I let the friend know, that I came there on purpoſe to ſee him and his family, and ſhould be glad to have them come together and be ſtill a little while, deſiring it might be ſoon, for we intended to go that night to Plymouth; he ſaid it would not anſwer them at that time, his children being employed in preſſing out cider. I let him know, that I hoped I ſhould not detain them long, and if they lightened the preſs, the cider would not run over; but could not prevail with him, tho' I informed him, that I had left all my buſineſs, and had come ſome thouſand miles to ſee my friends in this nation, and hearing how remote he lived from meeting, had a particular mind to ſee him; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that he ſhould be glad it had ſuited them, but could not put his buſineſs by at that time; ſo, with a heavy heart, I left his houſe and went to Plymouth where we had a meeting the next day: Then to Germains, Liſcard, Looe, Auſtil, and Denny's (in Cornwall,) at which laſt place the people are moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in the tin mines, and we had a pretty good meeting, a viſit from a friend being accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, and they willing to leave their buſineſs tho' poor people. From hence we proceeded pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty direct to the Land's-end, intending to take the meetings on our return, and were at Penzance meeting on ſixth day; at this meeting my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on John Pemberton ſpoke a few words in way of teſtimony, tender and broken, being the firſt time, and I thought had a good degree of the ſavour of truth attending; and on ſeventh day, went to viſit an ancient friend ſick and bed rid, near the Land's-end
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:016223_0098_0F9BD079FAFD8830"/>
where formerly there had been a meeting, and returned in the evening to Penzance; on firſt day had a meeting at Marazion in the morning, and at Penzance in the evening: We then turned Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and attended a meeting at Falmouth, and five others in this county of Cornwall; then paſſed through Devonſhire, taking a meeting at Oakhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and twelve others in Somerſetſhire, ſome of which were large and open, for there came many ſeeking people to the meetings at Bridgewater, and I hope ſome of thoſe opportunities were through Divine favour profitable to ſome of them; and not being eaſy in my mind to leave this county without being at the quarterly-meeting for buſineſs to be held at Glaſtonbury, I returned thither, and was concerned to lay before friends the declining ſtate of the ſociety in that county, and to exhort them to put the diſcipline in practice, that the church might be cleared from diſorders, which cauſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; it was thought by friends to be the moſt ſolid quarterly-meeting which had been held in that county for many years. From thence we went to Caln in Wiltſhire, being about fifty miles, and were at their meeting on firſt day the ſixteenth of the tenth month, where we met out friend and country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Daniel Stanton from Philadelphia in the courſe of his religious viſit, and were glad in each others company, tho' the meetings both forenoon and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon were but dull, the people looking for words, were diſappointed; the next day we went together to a monthly-meeting at Chippenham; the meeting for worſhip was held in the meeting houſe, at the concluſion of which friends roſe and went out; I aſked them where they were going, for I felt very uneaſy, they ſaid to do the buſineſs of the meeting, and feeling a ſtrong engagement to be with them while they tranſacted the affairs of the church, I followed them, tho' it rained very faſt; they went
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:016223_0099_0F9BD07C68935058"/>
into a ſpacious houſe where a room was prepared for the purpoſe, and a good fire; I ſat down with them tho' ſorely diſtreſſed, they ſeemed to do the buſineſs in a formal ready way; I endeavoured to preſs them to weightineſs of ſpirit, that they might feel the ſtate of the ſociety and the need there was to put the diſcipline in practice, for religion was at a low ebb in that county; they ſeemed not to underſtand me, and indeed I found but little room or openneſs to ſay much to them; they ſoon finiſhed their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; when I roſe up and moved for going away, they informed me that friends ſtaid to dine where the buſineſs was tranſacted, and that the friends of the houſe would think it very ſtrange if I went away; ſo they told the woman that the friend was going away; ſhe met me in the Hall, and ſaid, I muſt not go before I took dinner; I told her I ſhould, for that I had not freedom to ſtay to eat or drink in the houſe; ſhe aſked me why? I preſſingly deſired her to inquire of the Truth in her own heart and ſhe might find the cauſe, ſo I went away, and a friend followed me out, and ſhewed me the way to his houſe where I left my horſe, and there I found Daniel Stanton, and my companion J. P. who went not to the meeting for buſineſs; Daniel informed me, that he followed us to the door, but could not go in, for he thought he felt the life of truth ſtruck at, or trampled upon in that houſe, and therefore returned to the other where we had left our horſes, and J. P. with him; I was glad that he had ſuch a ſenſe, and he expreſſed ſatisfaction that I did not ſtay to dine, ſo we dined together, after which Daniel went Weſtward, and we towards London, taking ſeveral meetings in our way, and arrived there the thirty-firſt of the tenth month, and tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the city until the twenty-fifth of the eleventh month, in the mean time I carefully viſited all the meetings in great awfulneſs, being bowed in ſpirit
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:016223_0100_0F9BD07D12BB2A80"/>
under a ſenſe of a forward miniſtry, and ſat chiefly in ſilence among them: I alſo attended their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for diſcipline, namely one quarterly-meeting, the monthly, two weeks, ſecond day morning meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and meeting for ſufferings, and was in much heavineſs of mind, having a ſenſe of a great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect in ſome who were active members, in not wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a true qualification to act for the honour of God and edification of the church; nevertheleſs there is a remnant who are concerned to ſeek his honour, and to wait for the influence of his Divine Spirit and Power, to whom I was, at times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſpeak by way of encouragement. To tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the weighty affairs of the church in as light and eaſy a manner as men commonly buy and ſell in a market, will always rather bring death over a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than life.</p>
               <p>We left London on the twenty-ſixth of the eleventh month, and went to Chelmsford in Eſſex, and the next day ſat with friends in their forenoon and afternoon meetings to pretty good ſatisfaction, through the goodneſs and power of the Lord, whoſe preſence was meaſurably felt among us to the praiſe of his ever worthy name; then taking meetings as regularly as we could, we viſited that county in twenty-four days, and had twenty-three public meetings, and ſome family ſittings. My ſervice for truth in this county was in a cloſe plain way, moſtly with but few words; for it often appeared to me, that there was a greater deſire to hear, than to put in practice thoſe things they were exhorted to, for which I often mourned, and had a ſtrong ſympathy with the few ſenſible, baptized friends amongſt them; for brevity ſake I cloſe this general account without further remark.</p>
               <p>We then paſſed to Ipſwich in Suffolk, and had a meeting with friends there to ſome ſatisfaction, there being a tender ſincere remnant among them;
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:016223_0101_0F9BD286D03D7880"/>
and taking the Eaſt part of the county, we had ten meetings, and viſited ſeveral indiſpoſed friends to good ſatisfaction; then went to Yarmouth in Norfolk, and after attending their meetings in the morning and afternoon on firſt day, had a large ſatisfactory one the ſame evening, many of the people of the town coming to it; then going to Norwich we tarried with friends there about a week, in which time I had four meetings in that city, and one at Lammas near it, and alſo viſited divers indiſpoſed friends, and had ſatisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Intending to viſit all the meetings in Norfolk county, a friend undertook to lay them out for me, and made a liſt of them, of which he gave me a copy, and told me, it was the way to take the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the leaſt traveling; but I felt a ſtrait in my mind, which I had always found ſafe for me to attend to until I ſaw a way open, and being thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about it, I deſired him to inform me, what meeting bore moſt to the North Eaſt from that place, he told me it was North-Walſam; I deſired him to begin there, and name the meetings moſt regular afterwards, and I would tell him if the liſt felt pleaſant as he went on; he then proceeded, and we readily finiſhed one which was eaſy to me; when I deſired him to ſet down the diſtances as he had done in the other, and on comparing them, we found the laſt to be at leaſt three miles leſs riding; he ſeemed to be pleaſed, and ſaid it was not the uſual way of taking thoſe meetings; I was willing to lay out nine, but told him, I was not fully eaſy to venture the giving public notice further, that perhaps the weather might be difficult; he ſaid there would be a general meeting in a few days, when friends from many meetings would be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and likely to have full notice very eaſily given for a few meetings further, which he thought I had beſt leave to him, ſo we went forward to North-Walſam,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:016223_0102_0F9BD28926C20710"/>
and had a ſatisfactory meeting, and taking the meetings in courſe, came to the quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders at Norwich; the friend who laid out the meetings informed me, that if I had taken them according to his firſt liſt, I ſhould have interfered with a public friend at ſeveral, who was then on a viſit, and he thought there was a hand of providence remarkable in turning me; for as we were both ſtrangers, we ſhould have been ſtraitened through a tender regard to each others ſervice; he likewiſe let me know, that he did not remember that their quarterly-meeting began the next day after the meeting beyond which I told him I was not free to appoint any, and that having ſent the liſt to a friend to publiſh at the general meeting before mentioned, he had been obliged to attend that meeting to ſtop the notice reſpecting the few meetings he talked of, otherwiſe I ſhould have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the quarterly-meeting, and he thought it would teach him to be more cautious in future. I mention this occurrence with a degree of reverent thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humility, with no other veiw than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe miniſters who are called forth to viſit the churches, to diligently and innocently attend to the motion of truth, which the more we are humbled and inwardly quiet, the clearer it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and felt; but as this is inſtruction for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is ſafer for us to treaſure it up in our own hearts, than to make it too cheap by talking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to others. This quarterly-meeting, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to public worſhip and tranſacting the affairs of truth, was held to ſatisfaction, through the Lord's favour, who will be near to them that diligently ſeek him, bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
               <p>Then taking Ellingham meeting, we went to Thetford, and had a meeting with friends there, both which were diſtreſſing, from a ſenſe of the prevalence of a ranting ſpirit: Here it appeared
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:016223_0103_0F9BD289477A2770"/>
expedient to lay out meetings for the enſuing week, in order that ſuitable notice might be given; and as they were named to me in courſe by friends, I felt a remarkable deſire to ſee the friends of one certain meeting by themſelves, at or near the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour of the day, altho' quite a ſtranger to their ſituation, numbers, or ſtate; and a friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent belonging to that meeting, I requeſted her care about it, and then went home with Richard Brewſter to Edmondſbury, and attended the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings there on the firſt day morning and afternoon, which were in the main ſatisfactory, and in the evening had a meeting with a ſick friend: In this town there is a conſiderable number of hopeful friends. We then went to Ratleſden, Bardwell, and through Livermore to Brand, the place where I had the deſire to ſee friends by themſelves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, and coming to the friend's houſe whoſe wife had been intruſted with the notice, I aſked her if it was not time to go to the meeting, ſhe ſaid, thou muſt aſk my huſband, appearing to be diſtreſſed; I aſked where he was, ſhe replied in his warehouſe, and ſent for him; he coming after a while, I ſuppoſe about twelve o'clock, I aſked him the time of the meeting, he anſwered at ſix in the evening (to be ſure;) I told him, that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his wife of my deſire that it ſhould be at eleven; he replied, ſhe ſaid ſo but I thought it would be diſhonorable, for few only would attend it at that time, for the people of that town were chiefly ſuch as were obliged to do their days work, which would be finiſhed at ſix in the evening, when the houſe would be nearly full; I told him, I did deſire to ſee friends by themſelves, and ſuppoſed they could meet at any hour; he granted that they could have met at the the time propoſed; but ſaid, he was a man of a more liberal ſpirit than to want to eat his morſel alone, but was deſirous his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:016223_0104_0F9BD28A82915D28"/>
ſhould partake with him, and thought it his duty to endeavour to inform and help thoſe whom he apprehended were backward or ignorant in the performance of their duty, and he ſaid, that the end and intent of miniſters going forth was to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the goſpel, and he thought, to the more the better; I let him know that it was neceſſary for thoſe who were called to the work of the miniſtry, to know alſo to whom they were called, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they might be miſtaken, and go north inſtead of ſouth, or to a different nation or country; he anſwered, that he believed if they were rightly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the ſpirit would inform them where they were to go; I replied very well, and when they are come to the right place, the ſpirit would let them know what they have to do, he ſaid, I believe ſo too. Whereupon I told him, if I knew the language of that ſpirit that called me from my native land to Old-England, it was the ſame that inclined me to ſee the friends of that town by themſelves, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards if I felt an enlargement of mind, could have propoſed a public meeting with the town's-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the evening; and why not one opportunity for both? he queried, adding "for I ſhould be willing that all the town might hear what thou canſt have to ſay us." I then ſaid to him, "if a certain great perſon on whom thy proſperity in all things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral did abſolutely depend, ſhould in ſingular kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to thee, ſend a meſſenger to acquaint or adviſe thee of ſome matter relating to thyſelf in thy own particular conduct, in which thy proſperity, peace, and intereſt would, without thy immediate care, be nearly affected, wouldſt thou judge it prudent to ſay to the ambaſſador of ſuch a friend, deliver not thy meſſage to me, until I call my neighbours and the people of the town to hear it, and ſo expoſe thy own weakneſs to thy diſadvantage, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to thy neighbours? conſider it carefully, my
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:016223_0105_0F9BD28AC5E1A550"/>
heart yearns to the profeſſors of truth in this town, and it ſeems to me that my buſineſs at preſent was only with them, and as I can't have an opportunity according to my freedom and deſire, I ſhall hold myſelf excuſed:" He anſwered, if nothing but a meeting with friends will do, we muſt ſend them word to come together as ſoon as they can; I told him, that would now by no means do; for he was at preſent ſo chafed in his mind, that he could not hear to much advantage; he then aſked me what end would be anſwered by my coming there? I told him, to detect ſuch heady unſound members as he was, that thought it diſhonourable for a few friends to meet together to worſhip God, tho' their number was more than two or three, to whom the promiſe was; he ſaid, then what will become of the meeting? I let him know he muſt look to that, who had without orders headily appointed it, and ſo left him; and went to Mildenhall, where a friend told me, that he being at the meeting aforeſaid when public notice was given, that it was on this wiſe, Friends and Neighbours! "Pleaſe to take notice that a friend from America deſires, a public meeting here on wedneſday next, at ſix o'clock in the evening," which circumſtance I did not know when I was at his houſe; on the whole I had inward peace in my obſervations and conduct to this man, and many friends rejoiced; for ſeveral had been overborn by him to their grief, and I was ſince informed, that he ſome what laid the matter to heart, and was often heard to ſay, that he would not ſerve any friend ſo again; after which we had many meetings in this county, and paſſing into Cambridgeſhire had eight meetings therein, and I thought the life of religion was low in general, tho' there are a few tender friends in ſeveral places; we then went to divers meetings in Huntingdonſhire, Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Bedfordſhire, and Hertfordſhire, in which it
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016223_0106_0F9BD28BAB979B60"/>
was moſtly my lot to point out to friends the danger they were in, of loſing the pure ſavour of truth, for want of humbly attending to the dictates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in their own hearts, which had already occaſioned a dwarfiſhneſs among the profeſſors in thoſe parts; ſeveral friends met us at Waltham Abbey from London, with whom we went to that city in order to attend the yearly-meeting, which began on the twenty-ſixth, and ended on the ſixth day of the week, the thirty-firſt of the third month (1751,) and in the ſeveral ſittings thereof, both for public worſhip and the tranſaction of the affairs of truth, was thought, by many, to be the moſt weighty and ſolid meeting that had been known for many years; which was cauſe of humble rejoicing and deep thankfulneſs to many friends, in that the Lord had vouchſafed his heavenly preſence in wiſdom and power, to the praiſe of his ſacred name; ſeveral friends ſtaying in the city after the meeting was over, we had a large and ſatisfactory one on the ſeventh day of the week, and I tarried attending divers meetings until the ſixth of the fourth month, then went to Chelmsford, and ſat with friends in their morning and afternoon meetings on firſt day, and from thence to the yearly-meeting at Colcheſter; but being taken ill of a fever, was prevented at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending more than one ſitting of that meeting; yet through mercy was reſigned, and had peace; ſtaid their meeting in that town on the fifth day of the week, and the next day ſet forward with my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown, John Griffith, and my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in order to attend Woodbridge yearly-meeting, which began on the ſeventeenth of the month, and altho' the fever had not left me, I was enabled to attend every ſitting of it, which was a large and ſolid meeting throughout, and friends were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed together; praiſed be the Lord! whoſe mercy is great to his people; my companion J. P. went
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:016223_0107_0F9BD28C461FE2E8"/>
with my brother to ſome adjacent meetings, but I ſtaid the week day meeting in this town, which was through Divine favour ſatisfactory. We met again at the yearly-meeting at Norwich in a few days, which concluded to ſatisfaction, and friends were made truly thankful to the Lord for this additional favour; we ſpent a few days longer at this city, and attended their monthly meeting; after which, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſire to viſit a few meetings in company with my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown where Ranteriſm ſeemed to prevail, he having the like concern, we took a monthly meeting at Wimondham, alſo the meetings at Matſſil and Ellingham, in which we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to uſe great plainneſs to clear ourſelves on account of that ranting ſpirit; then went to Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and had a precious meeting with the few friends of that place, and to a very large general meeting at Downham, many of other ſocieties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and it became my concern to recite the words of our bleſſed Lord, John v. 39-40. <hi>Search the Scriptures for in them, ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me, and ye will not come to me that ye might have life,</hi> from whence I had to ſhew them the danger of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to information and knowledge, whether by reading the Scriptures, or hearing them preached, and neglecting to attend unto the inſpeaking voice of Chriſt immediately in the heart, which is the only ſure interpreter of the ſcriptures, leading thoſe who attend to his inſtruction in the ſure way to life eternal. Then parting with W. B. we went to Wiſbich, and Thornyfenn in Cambridgeſhire, and taking divers meetings in Lincolnſhire, we paſſed into the Eaſt-Riding of Yorkſhire, in which we had twenty four meetings, and taking eight in the county of Durham, we came to Shields in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland, New-Caſtle, and Alnwick Abbey, and reached Kelſo in Scotland on the firſt of the ſeventh
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:016223_0108_0F9BD28DB64F9468"/>
month, where we met Suſanna Fothergill on her return home: We attended the morning and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon meetings at Kelſo, on firſt day. Alas! Truth is here at a low ebb, and feeling my mind not to be clear of friends in this place, I deſired to have a ſelect meeting with them, which Suſanna and her companion attended, and we had an opportunity of clearing ourſelves of friends there, who had much fallen from the ſimplicity of the pure Truth, into the modes, faſhions, and cuſtoms of the world, in their dreſs, language, and manners, and truth own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſervice with a degree of its divine authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; bleſſed be the Lord, the God of Truth! We then went to a meeting at the houſe of John Criſty, at Ormſton, to which many people came and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved quietly, and the doctrine of Truth opened pretty freely to them; from thence to a meeting at Edinburgh, in which I had a ſenſe that ſilence was beſt, apprehending the people had been too much fed with words; after ſometime one ſtood up, and ſpake of the excellence of reſignation in miniſters to ſpeak, or contentedly to be ſilent; to be any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or nothing, as the Lord was pleaſed to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but a ſecret diſtreſſing fear attended my mind, that he was not enough inwardly engaged to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the order and motion of the Spirit of Truth, from the buſy imagination and will of the creature, unſubjected to the Divine Spirit; and I found a concern to ſhew the nature of true reſignation, and the low humble quiet that attended the minds of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, or hearers, who had come to the real know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; the deſire of ſuch was turned unto the Lord only for heavenly inſtruction, and an inward evidence of the life and motion of Truth; for want of which, true Goſpel miniſtry was ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and the reaſon of ſilence not fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; after I ſat down, the ſame perſon again ſtood up, and in a ſlow of words and a zealous tone, ſaid,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:016223_0109_0F9BD28DCCFD3200"/>
that weakneſs, or the want of experience, led peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to miſtake both their own and the condition of others; as he appeared to me to be actuated by a confident, ranting ſpirit, my mind was greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed after the meeting; I remained at this place the two following days, being detained by rainy weather, and attended the meeting in the morning of firſt day, at which I ſat ſilent; but the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpake ſometime in words very encouraging to the auditory, as if all was well with them, which tended to increaſe the exerciſe of my mind, having a very different ſenſe of the ſtate of the meeting; I again attended their meeting in the afternoon, when the ſame perſon ſeemed as if he intended ſoon to ſtand up; but feeling the teſtimony of Truth ſtrong againſt that forward ranting ſpirit, and the ſenſe thereof being weighty upon me, I endeavoured to keep under it in patience, and ſoon the concern of that perſon began to diminiſh, and he to be drowſy, after which I had a favourable open time to clear my mind, of the exerciſe that had been upon me.</p>
               <p>Next day we paſſed over the Frith about ſeven miles broad, landed at Kinghorn and rode to a town called Cowper, and the day following reached to the houſe of one who eſteemed himſelf a friend, near Montroſs, where we endeavoured to have a meeting, but he would not allow it, alledging, that it would do his people or ſervants no good, and as for himſelf, he thought he knew as much of the Truth as we could inform him; and indeed he ſeemed ſo whole and ſelf righteous, I thought it would not avail to ſay much to him. We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

heads covered; <hi>If the Light in you become darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs.</hi> From hence we went to Ury, the ſeat of Robert Barclay, grandſon to the Apologiſt; but had no meeting until we came to the Old-Town, near a mile north of Aberdeen, which, was through the goodneſs of the Lord, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrengthening; from thence went to John Elmſlie's at Old-Meldrum, and on firſt day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended Killmuck meeting, and in the evening one at Old-Meldrum, to which many people came, and, through Divine favour, theſe meetings were ſatisfactory; the next day we had a ſelect meeting with friends, of whom there are ſeveral here, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and valuable, and we parted in love; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Kingſwells had a meeting there with many friends and others, truth owning the ſervice, which was cauſe of humble rejoicing: Continuing at and near Aberdeen, we had a large meeting on firſt day at Robert Barclay's. Altho' the deſcendants and children of friends who were as bright ſtars in their day, may value themſelves on the worthineſs of their parents; yet if they do not love and ſerve the God of their Fathers with a perfect heart and an upright mind, he will will not own them with his heavenly preſence, but they will be as unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury ſalt.</p>
               <p>We then ſet forward on our return towards Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, taking two meetings in our way to Glaſgow, where, on firſt day, we had alſo two which were large, open and ſatisfactory, to which many tender inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people came, who behaved well, and in the evening of the ſame day, had another with thoſe called friends by themſelves, having a concern to lay before them the need they had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Then paſſing to Carliſle in Cumberland, Morehouſe, Scoby, Solport and Kirklington, in moſt of which meetings truth ſeemed to be profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but too few had the life thereof in poſſeſſion, which occaſions hard dry meeetings. We rode to Cornwood in Northumberland, and lodged at the houſe of a man who had been for ſeveral years of a diſorderly conduct, and much given to the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive uſe of ſtrong drink, until he had very much impaired his conſtitution, but it pleaſed the Lord to open his underſtanding, and make him acquainted with his bleſſed Truth, whereby he was made free from that evil, and received ſtrength to forſake his old companions; but his joining with friends was a great grief to his wife, who informed me, that thro' prejudice for a time, ſhe would rather he had continued his former courſe of living than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Quaker, until obſerving the ſweetneſs of his temper and the recovery of his health in ſome degree, with a ſolid and ſober conduct, ſhe was reached, and made to believe in the power by which he had known ſuch a victory, and joined herſelf in the ſame religious profeſſion; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be ſteady friends: I would to God, that all tipplers and drunkards would turn to that great prophet which is in Iſrael, that they might by him be cleanſed from that leproſy of ſin! We had a comfortable meeting the next day in his houſe, with his neighbours and ſome friends; and on firſt day were at Allondale meeting, where are ſome ſolid friends, tho' others much tainted with a ſpirit of Ranteriſm, which is a confident, ſelf righteous ſpirit and very hard to be won upon: After having a meeting at Aldſtinmoor, we paſſed to the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Penrith in Cumberland, Terril, and Strick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land which is in a corner of Weſtmoreland; it was with ſome difficulty we had the meeting at Terril, a man of that place ſaying, he thought it needleſs,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:016223_0112_0F9BD298C009A4C0"/>
or queſtioned whether it would be to advantage, as moſt of their members had been at Penrith meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but after the meeting he deſired that I would not take it hard of him for endeavouring to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me, owning that he was miſtaken; whereupon I cautioned him to be more careful in future, how he diſcouraged ſuch who had come ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles to viſit them. Having meetings at divers places in the week following, I travelled in great pain and anguiſh of mind, from a ſenſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of a dark, deiſtical ſpirit over many of the profeſſors of truth, of which concern the Lord was pleaſed to give me ſtrength and underſtanding to clear myſelf both in public and private; there is no power but his, that can enable his ſervants to do his work, and is over all the powers of ſatan. On the next firſt day we were at Holme meeting; in the forenoon I ſat ſilent, one of the ſtock of the old Ranters was there and very troubleſome, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many friends, no doubt falſely, and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon meeting I had not much to ſay, believing that old ranting ſpirit is rather fed with words and and delights in contention, but found it my place to exhort friends to retire deeply inward in all their meetings, humbly waiting to be admitted into the heavenly preſence, to know their place of feeding to be out of the reach of ſuch ranting ſpirits; for if they ſuffered their own ſpirits to riſe or reſent their ill uſage, the meeting would be the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. Our next meetings were at Allonby and Broughton, from whence I went home with our friend Chriſtopher Wilſon to his houſe at Grayſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the next day attended the burial of a young man at Pardſay Hall, and the day following the burial of a young woman at the ſame place, both of which meetings were very large and ſolid, and I hope thro' divine goodneſs profitable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The firſt day of the following week we were
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:016223_0113_0F9BD29A06CD60F8"/>
at two meetings at Whitehaven, in both which I had ſome ſervice under the influence and owning of truth: We put up our horſes at a friend's houſe who had been uſed to lodge public friends, but I was not free to tarry there, being burthened with his conduct in the manner of his entertainment, which was even to ſuperfluity and grandeur, no way becoming the ſimplicity of truth; ſo after ſhewing my diſlike therewith I went to the houſe of John Harris at Highfield, his wife being with us, and reſted there a day, the weather being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rainy; then going to the meetings at Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kermouth, Iſel, and Grayſothen, we returned to Cockermouth and had a meeting with friends by themſelves, that is, without giving public notice, which was thro' Divine favour to good ſatisfaction; reſting another day with our friend John Harris, we went to meetings at Pardſay Hall, and at Keſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, at which laſt I was concerned to exhort the few friends there to keep up their week day meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, having a fear they were very ſlack on that account; we lodged at an Inn, where we had the company of ſome of thoſe friends, and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar one who was a public friend; ſome of them ſaid, if he would attend the week day meeting, they believed the reſt of them would; which gave me occaſion to obſerve to him, that he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample well, and ought to be more careful, as he had a public teſtimony to bear for Truth; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he was obliged to be induſtrious to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his family; but at laſt confeſſed, that, "He did not like to ſit with ſo few friends, for none elſe would come on a week day, and it was very dull and poor ſitting, and he liked to ſit in meetings where there were many aſſembled, for then he had ſomething to ſay, ſo life did ariſe and all were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and edified;" by which it appeared that he had greater ſatisfaction in preaching than in humble
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:016223_0114_0F9BD29A82D31560"/>
ſilent waiting to experience the worſhip which is performed in Spirit and Truth, to edification and comfort; I told him that I feared he was too much a ſtranger to pure religion and the nature of divine worſhip.</p>
               <p>From thence we went to Hawkſhead, in Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and had an evening meeting there in a friend's houſe, and next day were at the Hight meeting, and then at Swarthmoor where George Fox former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lived, tho' it had been famous for the proſperity of Truth, it is now at a low ſtate there: We then went to Kendal in Weſtmoreland, where we attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their two meetings on the firſt day of the week, and after taking ſome other meetings in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, returned to that town, in and about which we tarried ſeveral days, and viſited more than twenty families and attended ten public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, many of which opportunities were made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious through the goodneſs and great condeſcention of our Lord and Saviour; and in the ſchool of our friend Thomas Rebanks I had an extraordinary meeting; where many young folks not of our ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety were reached by the power of Truth, which was comfortably over all, praiſed be the Lord for ever. In the courſe of our viſiting families here, during our ſilent ſitting in one of them, my mind was much taken up in thinking of a watch, and the ſeveral wheels and movements thereof, until I was grieved at ſuch trifling thoughts, as I eſteemed them, when ſuddenly there appeared ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive therein, and I had a freedom to ſay, the ſeveral parts thereof ſeemed to repreſent the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inward faculties and gifts beſtowed on man, and that tho' the wheels, &amp;c. of a watch were truly made, and placed in their proper order, there muſt be a main ſpring to give them motion, ſo the gifts and faculties of men muſt have their main ſpring and cauſe of motion to every good work, a zeal to
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:016223_0115_0F9BD29B4FD7B1D0"/>
the honour of the Lord their creator, and a fervent holy deſire to anſwer the end of their creation; and as there is a regulating ſpring to a watch, ſo alſo there ſhould be the true knowledge of God and of themſelves experienced in his light, to preſerve from going too faſt, knowing by his heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, that no wiſdom, zeal, ſtrength, or abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will enable to do the Lord's work to his honour and the good of man, but that which God giveth; and in order that a watch may anſwer the end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Being clear of Kendal, we took leave of friends in much affection and went to a general meeting at Brigflatts in Yorkſhire, and to viſit our friend Alice Alderſon, who had been on a religious viſit in our country with Margaret Cowpland, whom we had before ſeen at Kendal where ſhe lives. Alice was glad to ſee us, and we found her tender in ſpirit and ſtrong in her love to friends; after attending meetings at Ravonſtonedale and Griſedale, we rode to our friend John Burton's, who with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion William Backhouſe, had alſo been in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on a religious viſit; we rejoiced to ſee him and were comforted by his grave converſation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: We then went to a meeting at Dent, which was large and ſavoured by the overſhadowing of Truth in a good degree, in the loving kindneſs of our Lord who is worthy of all praiſe for ever! Then taking ſeveral meetings in Lancaſhire and tarrying two days with our friend William Backhouſe, which was an acceptable reſt to us, the weather being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cold, the ways bad and we weary, we came to Lancaſter, and had an opportunity of viſiting our friend Lydia Lancaſter, who ſeveral years paſt had viſited our country; her faculties of mind and love to friends appeared freſh and ſtrong; from thence attending divers other meetings in that county, we went to our friend Samuel Fothergill's at Warring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, where we continued from the ſecond to the fourteenth of the firſt month (New-ſtile) 1752, he
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:016223_0117_0F9BD29D1D069678"/>
and Suſanna his wife being tender and kindly affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate, we were refreſhed in their company, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral meetings in that town and at Penketh, ſome whereof were made precious by the ownings of Truth. After many other meetings in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Yorkſhire, we reached Richmond and had a meeting with friends there, and next morning ſet forward with a guide for Maſham, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a meeting there, of which friends had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notice, the diſtance was near ſixteen miles, the days ſhort, and roads deep and miry; after we had rode five or ſix miles, I deſired our guide to mend his pace, fearing we ſhould be late; a little further we came to a place where the roads parted, and he taking the left hand I became uneaſy, and aſked him if he perfectly knew the way; he ſaid, he thought he did, I let him know my being in doubt about it, and deſired him to inquire of a man we ſaw in a field at ſome diſtance; but he rode on yet faſter; when I told him that I was perſwaded we had almoſt turned our backs on the way we ſhould go, at which he ſmiled; when we had gone about a mile, ſeeing a man by the way ſide at work, I aſked him if that was the way to Maſham, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, nay, for you have left it and muſt go back unleſs your horſes can leap over ditches very well, you may then ſave a mile, and pointing over a field ſhewed us a moor, on the other ſide whereof our right road was; our guide ſet forward, we followed with ſome difficulty over the ditches, and he rode on a gallop and ſoon left us; my mind inclined me to vary from his courſe and eſpying a gate, called to him, pointing to it and proceeded thither, on which he turned and came up, but ſaid he believed we were wrong; I let him know that my mind was eaſy to go that way, and in a while we came into a road at a public houſe, which he knew to be right, ſo we juſt reached the meeting in time, which through

Divine favour was profitable and edifying.

                  <p>Why the dreſs of your young folks, the men with their wigs, and young women with their finery, in imitation of faſhions; and I thought I would try another meeting, ſo next day I went
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016223_0119_0F9BD29FCC558FF0"/>
again, and then I concluded there was little differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but the bare name, between us whom you call the world's people, and ſome of you; for you are imitating of us in the love and faſhions of the world as faſt as you can; ſo that I ſaid in my heart, theſe people do want a Fox, a Penn, and a Barclay among them, and ſo turned from his Tenant.</p>
                  <p>I thought it would be a pity that the true and ſolid remark of this great man ſhould be loſt, underſtanding that it was rather expreſſed in pity than deriſion.</p>
                  <p>From Maſham we proceeded to viſit many other meetings in this county, in the courſe whereof we called to ſee good old John Richardſon, who was ſtrong in ſpirit tho' feeble in body, and nearly blind through age, being about eighty ſeven; and finding a draught to viſit friends once more at Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, we were there on firſt day the fifteenth of the third month, and had peace in my own mind, having done what I thought was my duty; but from a ſenſe of the prevalence of pride, which had occaſioned a great poverty as to true religion among the profeſſors of truth in that place, I left them with an aching heart, and went on our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in order to attend the quarterly-meeting at York, taking meetings in our way at Pickering, Thornton in the Clay, and Huby. The ſeveral ſittings of this quarterly meeting were in the main ſatisfactory, but not having time fully to clear my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, did not leave York quite eaſy; after which, having meetings at Clifforth, Leeds, Gilderſham, Bradford, Rawden, Aſquith, Fairfield, Keighley, Skipton and Lotherſdale, we rode to Settle, and then to attend the quarterly meeting at Lancaſter, which began on the fifth day of the week with a meeting of miniſters and elders, and was comfortable; next day was the meeting for public worſhip and the diſcipline, wherein we were made to rejoice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:016223_0120_0F9BD2A4EB8F3EC0"/>
and praiſe the name of the Lord who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy for ever, went home with our friend W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſo to Kendal quarterly-meeting, which was ſatisfactory and very large; then ſet out for the quarterly-meeting for Cumberland, held at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle, which began with a meeting of miniſters and elders, next day were held two public meetings, and the day following a meeting for the diſcipline, which ended in the afternoon with another for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and going home with Chriſtopher Willſon, we were at a good meeting at Pardſay Hall on firſt day.</p>
                  <p>My mind had been for ſometime drawn towards Ireland, and being deſirous to loſe no time, we went to Whitehaven, ſeveral veſſels being there nearly laden with coals for Dublin; but on viewing the ſhips accompanied by ſeveral friends from Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſothen, I had no freedom to take a paſſage in either of them, at which I was much ſtraitened, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly turning my mind, Ireland was hid from my view, and going to the houſe of a friend we ſat a while ſtill, and I had freedom to let friends know that I had no proſpect but the veſſels might go their voyage with ſafety, and did not decline a paſſage on that account; but feeling a full ſtop in my mind, had no freedom to proceed any where at preſent, ſave to return with our friends John and Hannah Harris to Highfield; we therefore returned with them, and attended Pardſay Hall monthly-meeting, where I had freedom to propoſe that friends would enter on the ſervice of viſiting families; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that ſome years before they had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated friends for that ſervice, but meeting with ſome diſcouragement they had not performed it, and being about to turn over the book to ſee who were then appointed, conſidering it was a long time ſince, they concluded it was better to proceed to a new choice, but ſeemed at a ſtand about naming
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:016223_0121_0F9BD2A662F4A390"/>
friends then; I had a ſingular freedom to let them know, that altho' I was a ſtranger, I could point out ſome who I believed would anſwer the ſervice if they would ſubmit to it: After a ſolid pauſe, a friend ſaid, as our friend has the matter before him I am free that he ſhould chooſe for us; to which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that being a ſtranger to their members, one might be choſen who was under ſome impediment, and therefore it would be ſafer for the meeting to chooſe; but perceiving they were at a loſs, I point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a few friends in great fear, with a ſingle eye to the ſenſe which I did believe truth gave me, and the clerk took their names; a friend ſaid he believed it was the truth which had made the chocie; I then mentioned, that if they could ſoon enter upon the ſervice, I found a freedom to accompany them therein, if friends had unity therewith, which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expreſſed, ſome women friends being alſo named by their meeting to join in it; before the ſervice was much proceeded in, a heavy concern came upon me from a ſecret ſenſe I had, that one of them was under the cenſure of ſome, by which I feared her ſervice would be laid waſte, unleſs it could be removed, and altho' I had no intimation of any thing of the kind from any perſon, I became hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily exerciſed, and at length requeſted a friend to invite the man and his wife to dine with him, who I apprehended were uneaſy with the woman, and I deſired her and her huſband to come to the ſame houſe in the afternoon, who accordingly came, thus the parties being met unexpectedly to each other, I was humbled under the weight attending my mind, and no others being preſent except the friend and his wife at whoſe houſe we were, I ventured to let them know the exerciſe I had been under ſome days, from an apprehenſion of a difference, or prejudice ſubſiſting between them, which if not removed would devour like fire, by which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:016223_0122_0F9BD2A792E82A08"/>
they were, already much affected, but as I had not received information, more or leſs, I might be miſtaken, and did not deſire they ſhould ſay any thing on the ſubject before me, but honeſtly confer on it between themſelves firſt, and if it was ſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the cauſe, and if nothing was amiſs then to let me know, that I might be warned to be more cautious in future; upon which I left them, and walked by myſelf about an hour, when the man of the houſe called me in, and they told me, that I was not miſtaken, for that there had been an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſubſiſting for ſometime, which they hoped was now done away; but when in the courſe of our viſit, we came to the houſe of the friends who had been uneaſy, I felt it as freſh as before, and told them I did believe they were not eaſy that the friend ſhould go on in the ſervice; to which one of them anſwered, if ſhe judges herſelf to be clear and others are eaſy, I have no objection; whereupon I aſked what others were meant; the man replied, her huſband and relations; and as the matter reſted upon me, it appeared that endeavours ought to be uſed for reconciliation before we could with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction proceed on our viſit, and believing that the Lord had ſecretly engaged me, I hoped he would accompany and bleſs the labour for the reſtoration of peace, which in a few days he was pleaſed to accompliſh, and then we proceeded more cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and I think I may ſay that the Lord was with us, to the praiſe of his great eternal name, who is worthy for ever.</p>
                  <p>We viſited the families of friends in Whitehaven, Broughton, Cockermouth, Pardſay Hall, Eagleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and Grayſothen, and others remote, and had ſeveral profitable public meetings in thoſe towns and places adjacent; having ſpent about ſeven weeks within the verge of Pardſay Hall monthly meeting and finding my mind clear, we went to Whitehaven
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:016223_0123_0F9BD2A808B946C0"/>
and took paſſage in the ſhip Globe, James Graſon maſter for Ireland on the eighth of the ſixth month (1752,) N. S. and parting with our dear friends in much love, ſet ſail about the fifth hour in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and landed at Dublin on the eleventh of the ſame month, and were kindly received at the houſe of Samuel Judd; as I was going to which, this ſecret hint was preſented to my mind, "Live retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be not ſuddenly acquainted with any man." After dinner our kind landlord ſaid, I do not well in that I have not informed friends of your arrival, they will blame me; I anſwered, let us firſt know that we are here, we have juſt come from ſea and are weary; for we had a troubleſome paſſage by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds and heavy rains, John Pemberton my companion having been very ſea ſick, and myſelf a little ſo; the next day we attended Sycamore Alley meeting, where we had the company of Suſanna Hatton, who had been in America with Ruth Courtney; we were at eight meetings in Dublin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at a monthly-meeting, and a quarterly-meeting for their young people, in which I was deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under conſideration of the prevalence of pride and the world's faſhions, which was declared to them in the love of truth, and the Lord was pleaſed to favour ſeveral of the meetings by his heavenly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to the praiſe of his holy name.</p>
                  <p>Leaving this city we went towards the North; at Drogheda there is a meeting houſe belonging to friends, but they are there ſo declined we could not have a meeting to ſatisfaction, we therefore went on to a meeting with a few friends at Rathfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the county of Down, then to Monallen, where the meeting was comfortable, and on firſt day had two meetings at Lurgan in the county of Armagh, at which place pride and a worldly ſpirit much prevails; then taking meetings at Newton, Liſburn, Hillſborough, and Ballinderry in the county
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016223_0124_0F9BD2A8C3BB23A0"/>
of Antrim, the laſt of which was a large good meeting; we had one at Antrim, where the ſavour of Truth ſeems much loſt by the few profeſſors there; we then paſſed on to the Grange meeting, which was very dull, through the prevalence of a worldly dark ſpirit, and from thence to a meeting at Ballynacre and ſo to Colerain, where we had a ſatisfactory opportunity with ſome of the town's people who came to the meeting out of curioſity; but I felt no freedom to expreſs the ſenſe I had of the ſtate of friends then, and as the meeting broke up I ſtept to a young woman, a friend, who lived near the meeting houſe, and deſired her to ſtep for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and turn the few friends in there, as ſhe knew them, and let the others go by, which ſhe readily performed; when we were all ſet down round the room, it ſoon felt to me that if I delivered my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in general terms, the intended end would not be anſwered, being in pain for their good, and cloſe matters ſpoken might be taken by ſuch to whom they leaſt belonged, and being greatly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, I was deſirous to be rightly inſtructed, (not knowing their names) to ſpeak to them ſeparately; the Lord who never fails thoſe who humbly truſt in him, ſhewed me where and with whom to begin, and ſo to the next, and mine eye being fixed on the perſon to whom I directed my ſpeech, each knew what was delivered to them in particular, and I hope the opportunity was beneficial; for I had great peace: When the friends were gone I aſked the young woman, who ſeemed in ſome ſurprize, what ailed her, ſhe ſaid that ſeveral were very exactly told their condition, and feared they would judge her for an informer; I told her ſhe need not matter that, as ſhe knew herſelf to be innocent. I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occurrence as a remarkable kindneſs from the merciful Lord to the children of men, for their help and inſtruction, and that his ſervants may be
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:016223_0125_0F9BD2A9CACF8848"/>
encouraged to wait upon him for inſtruction to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their duty as faithful ſtewards in his ſight, who knows the ſecrets of all hearts, and taught his ſervant in old time to know the wife of Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, tho' ſhe feigned herſelf to be another wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Bleſſed, and magnified be his holy name who is over all worthy for ever and ever!</p>
                  <p>Then taking meetings at Toberhead, Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and Ballyhagan, we attended the men's meeting at Lurgan, having a great deſire to ſit with friends there in the management of their diſcipline, which was adjourned to this time at my requeſt; it began with a meeting for worſhip, men and women being generally together, at the concluſion of which, the men went into the room where the meeting for buſineſs was uſually held, when after ſitting ſometime in ſilence, a leading friend ſaid, "This is only an adjourned meeting, and bid the clerk enter it and they might adjourn to the uſual time to do their buſineſs, when it would be more ſelect;" and the meeting ſitting a while without proceeding any way, I aſked them what was meant by the words, more ſelect, and further ſaid, if any perſons were preſent that had not a right to ſit there, they ſhould withdraw, they knew their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; if they meant the friend who came with us, he was a neighbouring friend and an elder; and as for myſelf, I eſteemed myſelf a proper member of their meeting, as I came to viſit them with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of my brethren at home, and had certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates from them, wherein I was recommended to friends in Europe and elſe where, and if I did any thing among them worthy of cenſure, I ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their dealing, and therefore deſired them to go on with their buſineſs, for I had come thither with a concern to ſee how the affairs of the church went on; ſo without more debate or much reply they proceeded, and to my ſurprize, things of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016223_0126_0F9BD2AA54EA2FE0"/>
had lain ſeveral years without proper dealing with various offenders, ſuch as drinkers of healths, ſome that had been at cockfightings and races, and one or more marriages out of the order of truth; which gave me an opportunity to clear myſelf fully of the concern that had for ſome days lain with weight on my mind, which I believe was accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome ſecretly pained friends, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to ſome others; ſo that I left the place with a peaceful mind, and thankful to the Lord who had given me an innocent boldneſs to aſſert my right of memberſhip; for I believe if we had not been there, the meeting would have been thought ſelect.</p>
                  <p>We then went to Ulſter Province-meeting at Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhagan which held two days, the elders and other concerned friends here inquire into the ſtate of things among their members in the province, and it was in the main a ſatisfactory meeting; from hence we went Southward, taking meetings at Caſtleſhane, Coothill, Ballyhais, and Old Caſtle, and to Ballymurry in Connaught, having a meeting in a barn at Gailey with a few friends, it being the only one kept up in that provice, except at Athlone, which we likewiſe attended, and came to James Clibborn's at the Moat of Granoge, where we alſo had a meeting; altho' I had travelled every day for more than a week with a fever on me and had eaten little, occaſioned as I thought by a cold taken by laying in damp beds, and was now very unwell, but ſat the firſt day meeting; next day my illneſs became very violent, ſo that friends thought I ſhould lay my body there, and ſent for an apothecary who let me blood, which ſomewhat allayed the fever and I fell into a ſleep, when I began to bleed again, which brought me very weak, that I was awakened at midnight with great drops of ſweat on my face, and ſickneſs; and calling my companion who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me, we found that I had bled much, the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016223_0127_0F9BD2AC61CFA3C0"/>
orifice in my arm being very large and not carefully bound up; my kind landlord and his wife being anxious about me, had prevailed with the apothecary to lodge in the houſe, who being called to me, on his coming. I deſired him to peel a bladder and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a thin piece of it about as broad as a half-penny on the wound; he aſked for what; I told him he would ſee, and when it was applied I requeſted him to hold his finger on the piece over the orifice ſo as to ſtop the blood, until the plaiſter dried and ſtuck, which it ſoon did and it bled no more; he ſaid that he had not ſeen the like. I mention this for the ſake of others, for the bladder ſticks as the blood under it dries, and will ſtop the bleeding of almoſt any wound. Next morning a graduate phyſician of the town came to viſit me, and feeling my pulſe, I aſked him what he thought of me? He making no anſwer, I ſaid be not afraid to tell me, for I am not afraid to hear; he replied, "that is happy for you," by which I ſuppoſed he thought I ſhould not recover; he viewed my ſpittle and ſaid I was in a deep conſumption, and propoſed my taking a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; I told him that I had not taken one many years, beſides as he judged my lungs were inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a moderate purge was better; at which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with an air of banter, "you are an odd pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, come, you ſhall be phyſician and I will be apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary;" I took him at his word and he ſent me a purge which gave me ſome relief; he viſited me daily for a week, and could hardly believe I ſhould recover, tho' I told him I believed that I ſhould, he ſtill judged my cough to be conſumptive, and at length told me, if I did recover to go home as ſoon as I could, for that the Lord was more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than to require ſuch an one as I was to travel as I did, and that I had already acted as a mad man to travel ſo long time with that fever before I lay by; I aſked him, if he was maſter of a veſſel at ſea
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016223_0128_0F9BD2AE91D63920"/>
which had ſprang a leak that could not be ſtopped, what he would do? he replied, endeavour to make to the next port for a dry dock to unlade and ſearch out the leak; why doctor ſaid I, this is juſt my caſe, I ſaw no place to lay by until I came hither, at which he laughed, and wiſhed me well; I think I never was reduced to ſo weak a ſtate in ſo ſhort a time, which might be occaſioned by my great loſs of blood; but the Lord was pleaſed to heal me, that I gathered ſtrength to admiration, and on firſt day ſat the meeting, which was comfortable, and continuing to recover tho' not fit to travel, I tarried until fourth day and attended their monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and underſtanding they had been endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to viſit families, but were backward in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I told friends that I had a freedom to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them in the work for a few days for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and we accordingly went with them to a few places to good ſatisfaction, and friends received ſtrength to go on with the ſervice. Then taking an affectionate leave of our kind landlord James Clibborn, and his wife who is grand-daughter to Robert Barclay the apologiſt, we went to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Birr, Kilconnermoor, Caſhell, Killcommon, Clonſmell, Youghall, and ſo to Cork on the firſt day of the week, where we alſo attended the men's meeting for diſcipline, and viſited the women's meeting, which were both to ſome good ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then going to Bandon, we returned to an appointed meeting at Cork for parents and their children, and having ſtrength given me to clear myſelf, it was, I hope profitable to many, being a large meeting; we then went to Malo, and had a ſeaſonable opportunity with a family of friends, thence to the Province-meeting for Munſter held at Limerick, the public and ſelect ſittings of which and for the diſcipline ended comfortably; and after attending the week day meeting, we went to a
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:016223_0129_0F9BD2AEC36F68E8"/>
meeting at Roſs, and returned to Limerick, and being unwell with a cold we tarried their meetings on firſt day, which were large and ſatisfactory, and in the evening had one with a ſick friend; being clear, and taking three meetings in our way, we proceeded to Leinſter Province-meeting at Mountmelick, which began on the ſixth day of the week with a meeting of miniſters, the next day for worſhip and the diſcipline, and on firſt day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a large and precious meeting, in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the town's people came in and it was a good ſatisfactory meeting, tho' not ſo large, friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſtly gone home. We had a meeting next day at Tullamoor, and returning to Mountmelic had a ſatisfactory one with the children in the ſchool of James Gough; after the week day meeting in this town we went to Ballacarrol, Ballanakel and Cooperhill, having a meeting at each; then to Catherlough monthly meeting on firſt day, and the next day to Athy, then to Ballitore which was through Divine Goodneſs attending, made profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we had alſo a ſatisfactory meeting with the ſcholars in Abraham Shackleton's ſchool; after a meeting at Newton we went to Samuel Watſon's at Killconner, whoſe wife (late Abigail Bowles) had been on a religious viſit in America ſeveral years paſt, ſhe was now near her end, but ſenſible and in a good frame of ſpirit, and greatly rejoiced to ſee us, and we were mutually comforted in a ſenſe of the Lord's preſence, for which his holy name was praiſed; after a meeting here and another at Cather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lough we went to Waterford, and ſat with friends in their morning, afternoon, and evening meetings on the firſt day, in all which having cleared my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf honeſtly, my ſpirit mourned under a ſenſe of formality among the people, and a deadneſs to the pure inward life of religion; then taking meetings at Roſs, Lambſtown, Wexford, Randals-mills or
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:016223_0130_0F9BD2B32E513D20"/>
Caſtleſaw, Cooladine, and ſeveral other places we came to Wicklow, at which meeting many ſoldiers attended who behaved well, and truth owned the ſervice in a good degree. I have obſerved where the ſoldiers came into our meetings, they were an awe to the rabble and looſe people, who are ſometimes apt to be rude; from hence we went to Dublin in order to attend the national half-years-meeting, and were kindly received by our old landlord Samuel Judd and his family.</p>
                  <p>Leinſter Province-meeting began on ſecond day the ſixth of the eleventh month, both for worſhip and diſcipline, and on third day the national meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which held four days; the ſeveral ſittings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being in general attended with a ſenſe of Divine Goodneſs, and the teſtimony of Truth ran ſtrong againſt hypocriſy, covetouſneſs, libertiniſm, and pride among the profeſſors thereof; but in a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory ſtream to the humble and contrite children of the family, in a thankful ſenſe whereof the name of the Lord was praiſed, who is worthy for ever and ever! We tarried a few days longer with friends in Dublin, and then went to meetings at Baltiboys, Timahoe, Rathangan, and Edenderry, and a religious ſitting in John Pim's family at Nurney, then returning to Edenderry attended their monthly-meeting, where having a concern to viſit ſome families of friends, we went to moſt of them in that town and to the houſe of a widow in the country, where we had a good opportunity with her and her children; I aſked the friend who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied us, whether there was any other friend's houſe to which we had not been; he ſaid he thought not; but my mind had a draught to ſome houſe and I pointed toward it, he then ſaid he believed he knew where; ſo we went to the place, and the family being called together, I inquired whether there was not another belonging to the houſe, and was told
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:016223_0131_0F9BD2B3626052D0"/>
there was; as ſoon as he came, I knew it was the man whom my mind was concerned to viſit, and ſomething I had to expreſs reached and tendered him very much, he being exceeding wild and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and did not love to attend religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but truth now reached him; on the firſt day following I ſaw him at Edenderry meeting, where the viſitation ſeemed to be renewed to him; I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards heard that he continued to be ſober and thoughtful, and I was thankful to the Lord that he was pleaſed to condeſcend in mercy to gather the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt of Iſrael. Being clear of this place, I returned to Dublin, and having a concern on my mind to viſit the families of ſome who made profeſſion of truth but were diſorderly in their conduct, we began that ſervice, being accompanied by ſeveral friends, and the Lord was pleaſed to own the work. During our ſtay we were careful to attend all the meetings in this city for worſhip and diſcipline, one of which was a quarterly-meeting for the youth, in which many were tendered by the love of God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour. We vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited about ſixty families, in moſt whereof the Lord was pleaſed to favour with authority to ſet the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of truth over the heads of the corrupt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly profeſſors, and to influence with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to divide the word and counſel of truth to the different ſtates of thoſe we viſited; in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe whereof, let my ſoul obey and adore him who is alone worthy for ever!</p>
                  <p>As I apprehended the women's meeting to be ſlack of doing their part of duty as true helps in the exerciſe of the diſcipline, and a proper care over the flock and family of the Lord, a weighty concern attended me to expreſs in writing my ſenſe of what was the proper buſineſs belonging to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's meetings, which I ſhewed to the men friends, and had their concurrence to lay it before the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's

meeting in order for their encouragement and practice in the wiſdom of Truth, and it was afterwards ſent to the women's meetings through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the nation.</p>
                  <p>The veſſel in which we came to Ireland being ready to ſail, and the maſter deſirous of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to return with him, I felt ſo clear and eaſy that I intended to go; but when he ſent us word to come on board, I was more inclined to ſtay that day, and went to meeting, being firſt day, and he ſailed; but meeting with contrary winds and dark weather, was obliged to put back into Dublin har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after about a week's fatigue; my being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from embarking, I thought was a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindneſs and favour from my great and good Maſter; praiſed be his name! we had afterwards ſeveral good meetings, in ſome of which it became my concern to recommend ſilence by example, of which they ſtood in much need; and on the twenty-third of the firſt month (1753,) after having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in Ireland thirteen hundred and fifteen miles, and had one hundred and thirty-four meetings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many family viſits, feeling my mind to be fully clear, we went on board a ſhip of Whitehaven, Allen Wilſon maſter, having in much love taken leave of our friends; and after a ſhort, but ſtormy rough paſſage of about twenty-three hours, arrived at Whitehaven with hearts humbly thankful to the Lord who had preſerved us; the maſter ſaying, that he had not known the like for twelve years, altho' he had ſailed between the two ports very conſtantly. Next day after our arrival, our friend John Harris of Highfield, with whom we had left our horſes, brought them to us and we went home with him, and viſiting the meetings in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, ſeveral of which, particularly the laſt at Pardſay Hall, were large and precious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and I thought I could perceive that my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:016223_0133_0F9BD2B4C6F61EA8"/>
painful labours among them had been bleſſed, for which I was truly thankful to the holy head of the church and maſter of the aſſemblies of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. From thence we went to Lortonhall and had an evening meeting with the people of the town, to which came the prieſt and moſt of his hearers, and altho' the craft and conduct of the hirelings were much ſet forth, all was quiet and it ended well.</p>
                  <p>From thence we went to Kendal and ſtaying a general meeting there, proceeded to divers others in Yorkſhire, and Lancaſhire, and to one we had appointed at Coln, where are no members of our ſociety, and tho' a poor dark town in reſpect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the people behaved ſoberly, and many were tendered by the gentle, yet powerful reaches of Heavenly goodneſs; and I may ſay, that in riding through ſome towns in England where no friend dwelt, I felt a ſecret ſalutation of love to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, tho' as a ſeed yet ungathered; but my preſent buſineſs in general was to the children of the family, that when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to open the eyes of others to behold Zion, no ſtumbling block might appear to offend the beholders, or dim her heavenly beauty.</p>
                  <p>From hence paſſing to Halifax we had a large open meeting there, and divers others in Yorkſhire, until we came to our friend John Haſlam's at Hanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth-Woodhouſe, then to Sheffield, where we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited ſome families to our ſatisfaction, and after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending two meetings in Derbyſhire returned to J. Haſlam's, and again to Sheffield, and ſat their morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meeting on firſt day, and in the afternoon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the burial of Ellen Atwick, a friend of good repute, to which many people came and I had a favourable opportunity; being then clear, I went to Blythe in Nottinghamſhire and had a meeting, and ſeveral in other towns this week, and reached
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:016223_0134_0F9BD2B58D3A3330"/>
Rawcliff in Yorkſhire on firſt day; on the night before I had a dream which much affected me; "I thought I heard a kind of melody and ſinging at my left hand, whereupon I ſaid, What do ye rejoice at; which continuing I ſaid, your ſinging is ſomewhat like David's rejoicing before the ark, but I ſee it not, and heard a voice on my right ſaying, the ark is in the land of the Philiſtines, where it was taken through the wickedneſs of the prieſts and ſins of the people, who removed the ark from Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh to ſtrengthen them in battle;" whereupon I awoke and was under ſome exerciſe for a time, concluding it was ominous, but ſaw no further, until we went to meeting in the forenoon, where I ſoon heard a kind of tuneful ſighing, which kept increaſing, and turning my head to diſcover from whence it came, found it to be at my left hand; after a while a perſon ſtood up and ſpoke a few ſentences of extraordinary enjoyments which were to be felt; my mind was pained, and after he ſat down I ſtood up and ſaid, What are ye doing? and what do you feel to occaſion this rejoicing? and ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to have told them my thoughts, but inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my dream came into my mind, and ſo with little addition ſat down very ſorrowful; after the meeting I went to dinner, but could not eat much or be chearful; at the afternoon meeting we had the ſame tune until my ſpirit was afflicted; but labouring to know that quiet which is not eaſily diſturbed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſtrength in a loving frame of mind to inform them, that I feared they were miſtaken in their ſtates and conditions, for that death reigned, and it was rather a time of mourning: And as truth aroſe in ſome good degree, that floating formal ſea became dried up; and in the evening having the company of the chief ſinger among them, I had a ſingular freedom ſimply to relate my dream to him, with a deſire that he might examine whether the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:016223_0135_0F9BD2B6ACD6B6C8"/>
ark encloſing the pure teſtimony was preſerved ſafe amongſt them; which ſhut up further converſation. In a few days after, an intimate friend aſked me how I fared there, I repeated to him my dream, and he told me it was very ſignificant, for that a withering had taken place in that meeting, and that perſon had ſeveral children who were married to ſuch that did not profeſs with us, and being treated with as a parent, he ſaid it might be a means of increaſing the meeting, if thoſe they had married came to meeting with them, and diſcouraged friends from dealing with them, leſt it ſhould prevent them.</p>
                  <p>Then taking a meeting at Selby, we proceeded to the quarterly-meeting at York, which continued two days, and was a good meeting; here we met my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown to our mutual comfort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſeparation of nineteen months; we ſoon parted again, he going towads Lancaſter and we to ſeveral meetings in Yorkſhire and ſome in Lincolnſhire; in ſome places I obſerved the form to remain and life to be wanting, and in others the profeſſors of truth are too generally declined from both; true life gives birth to a true form; but the mere form will never produce the life of Truth. From hence we went to Retford and Mansfield, in Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and at the laſt town had two meetings, one of which was with friends by themſelves; for it did not always appear convenient to deliver too public<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe things which tended to the reproof of ſome diſorderly walkers in the family, leſt it ſhould rather harden than reſtore and heal, eſpecially where their conduct did not occaſion open reproach; then taking a meeting at Broughton we went to Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and had three meetings there on firſt day, and the next at Oxham with a few friends who were glad thereof, being ſometimes miſſed by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers; the day following we had an appointed meeting at Nottingham to ſatisfaction; in this place
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016223_0136_0F9BD2B7393B3AD8"/>
they are troubled with ſome ranters, who force themſelves into meetings for diſcipline: Friends were exhorted to keep up the teſtimony of Truth in the meek humble ſpirit thereof, in which its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion will ſtand for ever; we then ſpent ſome time in viſiting many meetings in Leiceſterſhire, taking one at Oakham in Rutlandſhire, where ſome inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent friends live, and I think it is the only meeting of friends in that county; at Boſwellſtreet we had a meeting with ſome who had been lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, but had not yet known a true eſtabliſhment in humbly waiting for the power of Truth, to give a ſolid growth in pure religion; the ſame evening we had a meeting at Coventry to good ſatisfaction; and the week following came to Dudley in Worceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhire, where we lodged at James Payton's, whoſe ſiſter Catharine was preparing to go on a religious viſit to America; ſtaying the meeting on firſt day in Dudley, we went to divers others in this county and Warwickſhire, and came to Eaden in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thamptonſhire, at which meeting many people came, ſome of whom were very unruly, but the power of Truth prevailing, it ended quietly, praiſed be the Lord who is allſufficient for his own work! viſiting ſeveral other meetings in this county, at one of them held in an evening at Chipping-Norton there where many tender young people, to whom I felt a ſalutation in the love of Truth; but before I thought it ſafe for me to ſtand up, a young man not much like a friend ſtood up, and began to exhort them to be faithful in diſcharging whatſoever the Lord required of them, and how eminently he would be with, and qualify them for his work, as tho' they were all appointed to enter upon ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great ſervice; at which my mind was much grieved, for I thought it would be more ſuitable for them deeply to retire and wait for the virtue of Truth and ſap of life, to experience a growth

in grace and the knowledge of God, that they might be prepared to work out their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to expect a young tree to produce abundance of fruit before the branches are come forth and ſpread with ſtrength to bear it, is not reaſonable; the words "ſit down," paſſed through my mind for ſome time, and at length I ſpoke them ſo as for him to hear, which I perceived by a ſmall ſtop he made; but going on again, I ſaid prithee friend ſit down, which he did, but I felt that my ſaying ſo, ſurprized the people and perhaps offended ſome, and that it would be in vain to deliver what was on my mind, ſo expreſſing a few ſentences only, I ſat down very ſorrowful, and the meeting ended; I was informed by a friend at our lodgings that he was one lately come from the Methodiſts, which I before apprehended by his appearance; on going to bed I was much concerned leſt it ſhould hurt him, and deeply ſought to know whether I had not ſpoken to him in a ſelfiſh ſpirit, becauſe he had taken the time of the meeting appointed on my account, and feeling love towards him, I prayed in ſpirit that the Lord would be pleaſed to preſerve him from harm thereby, and that if I had done wrong, I might be made ſenſible of rebuke for my future inſtruction; when in great calmneſs I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it would not hurt him, ſo I went into a quiet ſleep; after a meeting the next day at Sib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, a woman friend who was at the meeting the evening before, deſired me to ſend by her a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, or write to the young man, for ſhe was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful he would go beſide himſelf; I told her that when I ſpake to him I thought myſelf right, and knew what I was about; but now I could not ſee what to do at preſent, and to act by her direction was dangerous, ſo we parted and in about a week after, a friend let me know that there was no danger of his receiving hurt, but hoped he would be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:016223_0138_0F9BD2BA01B4FB30"/>From hence, taking a few meetings on our way, we arrived at London on the ſeventh of the ſixth month, and next day attended Grace Church Street meeting, and in the following week the yearly-meeting, which was comfortable and ſolid, divers weighty matters being therein propoſed for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from ſeveral of the counties, which centred rather to benefit, tho' in the management of the affairs, there appeared in ſome, a diſpoſition to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what they thought to be new, notwithſtanding the ſame things appeared very expedient to others, who from their proſpect thereof, might urge their ſentiments rather too ſtrongly; a proſpect of the Lord's ſervants truly diſciplined, armed and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for his work, and of ſuch who equip, arm and arrange themſelves, and move by their own direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was preſented to my view in a dream one night during the time of this meeting; "I thought I beheld two armies ſet in array againſt each other, one of them well armed with ſwords and muſkets; the other had no formal weapons for their defence; but a charge given them by their general to keep their ranks, and gently to march directly forward as he ſhould lead, no man reaching forth his own hand to defend himſelf; they joined in battle, and when one of the unarmed ſoldiers was borne hard upon by his opponent, he reached forth his hand at arms length, when a ſword took off one of his fingers, and the blood ſprinkled on ſeveral of his fellow ſoldiers; whereupon knowing the orders given, I cried out, if that hand had not been ſo ſtretched out, this wound would not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and ſo I awakened." And on the morrow was fully convinced that in tranſacting the affairs of Truth, the honour of God ſhould be our only view, with a ſingle eye to his direction, and ſelf made of no reputation, which will be a ſhield againſt all reflections and perſonal cenſures; for it
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:016223_0139_0F9BD2BDABF7EBA0"/>
ſo happened, that a valuable zealous friend being ſtrongly reflected on as being a prejudiced party, and being a little warmed thereby, made an over-haſty, and perhaps too warm a reply, which is apt to ſtir up warmth in thoſe who depend on no other guard than their own armour, and with their own ſtrength uſe a ſelfiſh weapon; by this unguarded reply, the friend brought a reproof on himſelf and ſome others, that were united in the cauſe of truth; the victory belongs to the Lamb for ever, who when he was ſpit upon and reviled, did not again revile.</p>
                  <p>After ſtaying in London and attending the Peel-meeting on firſt day, and the meeting of miniſters and elders on ſecond day morning, we went to Chelmsford and reſted a day or two with our friend John Griffith, attended their week day meeting and a general meeting at Eaſterfordkelvedon, and proceeded to the yearly-meeting at Colcheſter, which held three days and was a time of Divine favour; then going to Ipſwich and to a monthly-meeting at Woodbridge, we there continued on firſt day, and on the next began their yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which held until the fourth day of the week, in all eight ſittings, ſome whereof were large and very good. No praiſe to him that willeth, or to him that runneth, but to the Lord alone that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy; and there being a marriage at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fifth day, I had an open time, wherein I had to ſet forth, that as man in the begining was taken from the earth or clay by the hand of the Lord, and a life breathed into him different from the earth, by which he became a living ſoul, and ſtood in the image and liberty of his Creator, but falling from the heavenly image and liberty therein through tranſgreſſion, is now of the earth, earthly in his love and liberty, ſo he muſt now be ſeparated from the earthly low eſtate which ſtands in the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:016223_0140_0F9BD2C010308418"/>
and death, by the Regenerating Word of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and transformed by the renewing of his mind, will and affections, and placing them on heavenly objects; for as the potter ſeparateth the clay from the other earth, and tempers it by itſelf before he formeth and maketh a veſſel thereof, ſo muſt man by the operation of the Heavenly hand, be tempered, wrought, prepared, and thereby freed from his own ſtubborn will, and made ſubmiſſive to the Heavenly Will, that he may not be marred on the wheel, but bear the turning of the heavenly hand until he be formed a veſſel to honour; but if the will of man does not become ſubject, but ſtands in rebellion, the Lord who ſaid, <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man,</hi> hath power over the clay to reject that which will not be wrought into a veſſel for honour, and ſuffer it to be marred in its own ſtubborn will; and when an earthly potter hath formed a veſſel for uſe, he carefully ſetteth it aſide, until it be prepared to bear a further operation, to harden and glaze it for the uſe for which it is made; if man ſhould put even water into an earthen veſſel formed for that uſe, before it is hardened and prepared by fire, he would both mar the veſſel, and expoſe that which was put therein; let not ſuch therefore who have known the heavenly hand of power ſo to prepare them, that they are willing to be whatſoever the Lord ſhould make of them, marvel if the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to ſet them by a while for the trial of their faith; if the earthly potters veſſel ſhould crack in drying, it would be marred, ſo if theſe veſſels of the Heavenly Potter keep not the word of his patience in this their drying ſeaſon, to prepare them for the operation of the Heavenly fire and furnace, in which the Lord will ſanctify and fit his veſſels for the uſe of his holy ſanctuary, they will alſo be marred; but otherwiſe they will come forth veſſels to honour in his houſe, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:016223_0141_0F9BD2C128A50F50"/>I thought this was a remarkable good meeting, the praiſe thereof belongs to the Lord alone. We had alſo a ſelect meeting with friends, and viſited ſeveral families in the town to ſatisfaction, truth owning us together, and after a good opportunity at a friend's houſe in the country on our way, we went to Norwich and attended their meetings on firſt day, the yearly-meeting began the next, and ended on fourth day after ſeven ſettings generally large and ſatisfactory, through the overſhadowing of Divine Goodneſs: I continued in this city ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days after, viſiting of families and ſteadily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their meetings, and had ſome open ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory opportunities. My way now opening for Holland we went to Yarmouth, ſeveral friends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying us, and on the twenty-ſixth of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month embarked on board the ſhip Three Brothers, Richard Smith maſter, my companion John Pemberton being willing to continue with me.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt day of the week following, we land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Rotterdam and lodged at an inn; next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feeling my mind drawn forward, we went in a ſtage waggon to Turgow, and from thence in the tract-ſkute to Amſterdam in the evening, the Metropolis of South Holland, and were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to friends meeting-houſe at the Three-hooks in Princes-ſtreet, in which Michael Laars and his ſiſter lived, and were kindly received and reſted the next day.</p>
                  <p>I found a concern to viſit the families of friends in this city, in which ſervice we ſpent moſt of the week to our ſatisfaction, John Vanderwarf jun<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> being interpreter; we alſo attended their week day meeting, in which Peter Linders was interpreter. On firſt day following the meeting in the morning was pretty large, and many people came to that in the afternoon, ſome of whom behaved rudely; but Truth came over, and they were ſtilled, and ſeemed
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:016223_0142_0F9BD2C180B44470"/>
to depart ſatisfied; we continued here until their week day meeting again, which many not of our ſociety attended, and it was to general ſatisfaction; I then felt my mind drawn towards North Holland, and taking paſſage in the tract-ſkute paſſed through ſeveral towns and arrived at the city of Hoorn, where we were met by our friend Cort Hendricks, who took us in his waggon to his houſe at Twiſk, in North Holland the ſame night, being accounted eighteen miles from Amſterdam to Hoorn by water, and from thence to Twiſk by land ſix miles; here alſo finding the like concern, we viſited the families of friends, and had a meeting with them in the evening together; next day we went to Abbey Kirk, a village about two miles diſtant, where about five or ſix families of friends live, whom we viſited alſo; the friends in general ſeemed to receive our viſits kindly, except one family, where I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſpeak of, and open that ſaying of our dear Lord, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of the Scribes, and Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c. for I was much burthened under a ſenſe of a ſelf-righteous, whole, exalted ſpirit, and in opening that paſſage, was alſo led to ſpeak of the Parable of the Phariſee and Publican who went up into the temple to pray, which probably touched the heads of that family, and I felt a ſtrong oppoſition in them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the paſſage was not pleaſing to our interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I could not ſhake off my burden, yet was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved quiet in my mind, having honeſtly done my part, and ſo returned to Twiſk, where the meeting was held for both villages, and on firſt day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the meeting was pretty large, friends being generally there; but our interpreter had moſt of the time, ſo that he was too overſpent to interpret much for me; ſeveral not profeſſing with us attended in the afternoon, and I had a ſatisfactory time with them early in the meeting, when an awful ſenſe of
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:016223_0143_0F9BD2C253B56900"/>
truth ſeemed to be over us, after which our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter had ſomething further to ſay; I have often lamented the increaſe of words, and a repetition of former experiences without the renewing of life, which diſpoſition ſeems to prevail in too many, to the burdening of ſenſible members in our ſociety.</p>
                  <p>As we ſat this evening in a friends houſe at Twiſk two elderly women came in, profeſſors of truth but very talkative: I had ſeen them ſeveral times before, and as often been burdened with them, and now had ſomething in particular to ſpeak; but feared that ſuch plain dealing would be too ſtrong for our interpreter, who appeared to be very ſociable with them; therefore I delivered my mind without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling them out, ſeveral others being preſent; theſe women took it to themſelves, but not in ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as I deſired, being diſturbed, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to our lodgings made their complaint to our interpreter, bidding him aſk me if I took them to be ſuch perſons as I had deſcribed; if ſo, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what I had to accuſe them with? at firſt it put me to a ſtand, but being ſtill, I ſoon thought it was providential, that they thus gave me an opportunity to clear myſelf of the burden I had borne on their account, and told them, that to enter into particular charges was not my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but was free to let them know that I had been in pain on their account from the firſt time I ſaw them, and that if I had a true ſenſe of their ſtates, they were not ſuch as they ought to be, but had loſt the favour of what they profeſſed to enjoy, and could ſo freely talk of, "and told one of them that I took her to be dark and ignorant of her own ſtate; and the other, that ſhe was too light and chaffy in her ſpirit, and that they both wanted the true cloathing of the Lord's children, which is humility of heart and reverence of ſpirit, which would ſeaſon all their converſation and conduct,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:016223_0144_0F9BD2C30085B290"/>
that they would not be ſtumbling blocks to their neighbours, as I feared they were: I alſo told them, that I believed when I ſpake as I did at the friend's houſe it belonged to them, in which I was now confirmed, for had they been ſincere hearted, they would have borne it without flinching; but now they had ſhewn that their ſore places were touched, and I dared not to leſſen the weight of what was then ſaid, but deſired them to receive and ponder it well; for I was ſure it was delivered in love, and believed it to be a viſitation to them in their old age." Which being interpreted to them, they ſpake ſomething to the interpreter which I did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; then one of them ſaid, ſhe had yet love in her heart for me: I told her that I had nothing but good will towards her, and ſo they went away.</p>
                  <p>After which, the interpreter told me, he had known theſe women many years; that I had a true ſenſe of them, and he had delivered my words ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and hoped they would do them good.</p>
                  <p>We next had a meeting with friends of Twiſk by themſelves in a private houſe, in which we were favoured with the ſavour of truth, the ſincere heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being refreſhed, and the diſorderly warned to be more careful.</p>
                  <p>After taking ſome refreſhment, we haſted to attend another meeting appointed for us at Abby-Kirk in the afternoon, which was held in the ſame houſe where I felt the oppoſition before mentioned: I ſoon was ſenſible of ſome matter in my mind to divide to the people; firſt to a low afflicted ſtate, and things opened pretty clear, and were interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed readily; but proceeding to the other ſtates, I felt the current obſtructed, and the force of my ſentences evaded, and had a ſenſe that the minds of the friends of that houſe were ſhut up againſt what I had to deliver, ſo I forbore going on, and the interpreter ſoon began and continued to ſpeak
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:016223_0145_0F9BD2C404836928"/>
near an hour; when he had done, I felt a great weight on my mind, and deſired him to interpret a few ſentences for me, he did not ſeem very free, ſaying, "let it be ſhort then," the ſubſtance was, "That I had come in love to ſee them, and was in no way prepoſſeſſed or informed concerning any perſon or caſe among them; yet found they were ſhut up againſt what I had to deliver; nevertheleſs I could not be eaſy without letting them know, that I did believe, unleſs they humbled themſelves, and were ſtripped from that ſelf-righteous wholeneſs, wherewith they had cloathed themſelves, they never would grow in the life of true religion; but would be as ſtumbling blocks to the ſincere hearted among them," ſo I went out of the houſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to our lodging, not having freedom to ſtay there longer. Our interpreter who tarried with them after we were gone, told me that they judged a certain friend who had been in Holland ſometime before and ſpoken very cloſely to them, had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me concerning them, and I thought the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter alſo favoured that ſentiment, which made me not to wonder at the oppoſition I had felt both in him and them; whereupon I told him, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that time I never knew that the friend whom they thus judged had been there, and that I had never heard of their names, nor the name of the town until I came with him, and deſired him to give it in charge to a friend of Twiſk who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us, to let thoſe friends know from me, what I then ſaid of my innocency.</p>
                  <p>Feeling myſelf now pretty eaſy reſpecting that place we returned towards Amſterdam, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two friends to Hoorn, where no friends now live, tho' formerly there were, and ſometimes meetings have been held there; and I had ſome thoughts of having one; but being under diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, had almoſt concluded to proceed on our
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:016223_0146_0F9BD2C484549CB0"/>
way; but in walking through the city to the ſkute, which was to ſet off for Amſterdam in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, I felt my mind affected with a ſenſe that my great and good maſter was near, and deſired with earneſt breathings to know his will, and if he would be pleaſed to be with me, I was willing to do the ſame, as he ſhould require and enable me; I then felt ſuch a ſtream of love towards the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that I was convinced there was a viſitation to them, as tho' the Lord would in his own time gather a people there; as yet I had not diſcloſed my mind to any one, although I felt a draught back; when ſeeing a young man in the ſtreet, I deſired the interpreter to aſk him if he thought we could have a meeting in that town, to which he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwered that he believed we might, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of my baggage ſaid, if we would pleaſe to return to his houſe, he would endeavour to procure a place and acquaint the people, which he very punctually, and with great ſpeed performed, and we met about four in the afternoon at the houſe of Cornelius Olyſlager, and had a good opportunity with a tender friendly people, ſeveral of whom were reached and tendered by the virtue and ſavour of truth, which ſpread freely; for which the giver of all good was reverently praiſed, who is worthy for ever. The people departed in much love, and we returned to the young man's houſe, where we were affectionately entertained that night; we ſhould have been glad to have converſed with the people, but could not underſtand their language, yet had a ſenſe that they were ſatisfied with the meeting.</p>
                  <p>Being accompanied by this kind young man Dirk Meſchaert, our landlord, to the track-ſkute, we took leave with tears on each ſide, and arriving at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, we ſat with friends that afternoon in their week day meeting to ſatisfaction, having travelled in North Holland about ſeventy four miles by
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:016223_0147_0F9BD2C9C0D516C8"/>
boat and waggon, we then viſited the remainder of friends families in this city, and were comforted therein, the Lord being pleaſed to own our labour, and I pray it may be bleſſed to them; on firſt day morning we had a large ſolid meeting, at which were ſeveral ſtrangers, particularly two young men, Italians, ſuppoſed to be princes, who behaved well, alſo many of the citizens who had never been at a friend's meeting before. The afternoon meeting was alſo large, but ſome of the lower ſort who came to gaze out of curioſity, behaved rude, yet it ended better than I expected; there ſeemed to be an openneſs in many to hear the teſtimony and principle of Truth declared; but it is a dull way to ſpeak by an imperfect interpreter.</p>
                  <p>On the twenty-ſecond of the eighth month was held what they call their yearly meeting, which was attended by ſeveral not of our ſociety; but it has little more than the name of a yearly-meeting, the diſcipline of truth being much loſt.</p>
                  <p>Feeling ſome concern ſtill to continue on my mind towards the friends at Abby-Kirk where I was ſenſible of the oppoſition before hinted, I had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to write them a letter; but on conſidering that the friend and his wife to whom I wrote were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of note, I was fearful that their reſentment might hurt ſome others, and having a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern towards the ſincere hearted, it was with me to prepare the way by writing an Epiſtle to friends of the meeting at Twiſk, to which thoſe of Abby-Kirk do alſo belong, both which I got a friend of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam to tranſlate; that to the meeting I ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately that it might be read on a firſt day, and directed the other to be ſent ſoon after.</p>

                     <p>"Dear Friends, beware of letting out your minds after the doctrines and teachings of men, who have not the word of Life committed to them to preach in the Love and Power of Truth: For if ye do, ye will be unſtable and wavering, and a wavering man is as a wave of the ſea, toſſed to and fro with every contrary wind of doctrine; neither look you too much to the example one of another, but wait to receive in yourſelves, a ſenſe of what ye ought to do and to join with, and what ye ought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from, then will you be able to judge what you hear and ſee; becauſe you have the ſpirit of Truth in your own hearts, for that is the true rule, judge and guide, which leads into all Truth.</p>

                     <p>Dear Friends, be careful to meet together, and admoniſh thoſe that fall ſhort of their duty herein: And when you are aſſembled, wait on the Lord with a mind turned inward, and if ye do wait in Faith and Patience, the Lord will be found of you, and reveal himſelf in the midſt of you, to your comfort and conſolation.</p>

Lord doth teach of his ways; and the meek he guides in judgment: But the whole and ſelf-right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, who are wiſe in their own eyes, and prudent in their own conceit, the Lord will hide the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his pure wiſdom from theſe; but to the babes who are truly changed, and born from above; and thoſe ſucklings who are weaned from the breaſts of the world, and its wiſdom, and are leaning on the breaſt of Chriſt their beloved, deſiring the ſincere milk of his word, that they may grow thereby; unto theſe the Lord will reveal true Knowledge, and Wiſdom from above; and that wiſdom is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, and thoſe that have the ſame in poſſeſſion, they have the ſeaſoning virtue of Truth; they have ſalt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are therefore preſerved in peace and unity with the pure Truth, and alſo one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſuch profeſſors who inwardly know, and receive the moſt holy Faith, they know the ſame to work in them by love, to the purifying of their hearts: Theſe are Jews inward, circumciſed in heart, true Iſraelites indeed, in whom there is no guile; and their righteouſneſs exceeds that of the ſcribes and phariſees.</p>

                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:016223_0151_0F9BD2CE405B7228"/>We continued with friends in this city and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their two meetings on firſt day, and in the evening had an opportunity with ſeveral to ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for our love rather increaſed; next morning feeling my mind clear of friends in Holland, I was eaſy to return towards England, and accompanied by ſeveral to the ſkute we took leave and went to Turgow by water, from thence by waggon to Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, in all about forty-two miles, there are no members of our ſociety left in this city; we went to ſee the meeting houſe and had ſome thoughts of having a meeting; but being the time of a great fair, which occaſioned a concourſe of rude people, there was no proſpect of having one to advantage.</p>
               <p>John Vanderwaarf jun<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> came with us to Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, with whom we parted in much love early on fourth day morning the twenty-ninth of the eighth month, and went on board the ſame ſhip which brought us hither, it having made a voyage to England and back ſince; we ſailed with a fair wind down the Maze to the Briell before noon, when it becoming contrary, we lay at anchor until firſt day morning, then proceeding, we paſſed over the dangerous ſands and ſo to ſea, and arrived at Yarmouth about one the next day, and had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with friends the ſame evening.</p>
               <p>In this journey to Holland, we travelled by ſea and land about five hundred miles.</p>
               <p>From Yarmouth we went in a chaiſe to Norwich, where friends were rejoiced to ſee us, and we were thankful for our ſafe return, and being concerned to ſpend ſome more time among them in this city, we viſited a few families and attended their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, alſo their two meetings on firſt day, which were dull and heavy; the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being too much outward, I found it my place to recommend ſilence by example more than by words, in both thoſe meetings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:016223_0152_0F9BD2CF829D47F0"/>Next day in company with other friends I went to viſit Hannah Lucas, a ſchool miſtreſs, who was newly convinced; ſhe was in a low ſtate of mind; our viſit was to mutual ſatisfaction, being comforted together.</p>
               <p>At their week day meeting on third day, I had a ſeaſonable time to diſcharge my mind towards friends in that city, in which I was led to deal plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them: They are a loving people to ſtrangers and each other; but there is a want of weightineſs of ſpirit, and of a proper care in the exerciſe of the diſcipline of the church.</p>
               <p>Before my going to Holland I was at the ſhop of a barber in this city ſeveral times to be ſhaved; the ſecond time I was there, I had to wait a while for my turn, he having no aſſiſtant; and when others were gone out he told me, he was ſorry I had to wait and hoped he ſhould have my cuſtom, and that if I would come on Saturdays and Wedneſdays in the forenoon I need not wait; but in the afternoon others came; I aſked him what days of the week thoſe were which he called Saturday, and Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day? he ſeemed to wonder at my ignorance, but knew not how to tell me otherwiſe; I ſaid, I do not read in the Scripures of any days ſo named; he replied, that is true; for what reaſon then, ſaid I, doſt thou call them ſo; becauſe it is a common cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, ſaid he; ſuppoſe then, ſaid I, that we lived in a heathen country among infidels who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Idols, ſhould we follow their cuſtoms becauſe common? he replied, by no means; I then ſaid, If I have underſtood rightly, the Heathens gave the days of the week thoſe names: I never heard that before, ſaid he, pray for what reaſon? I anſwered they worſhipped the Sun on the firſt day of the week and named it after their idol, Sunday; the Moon on the ſecond day of the week, ſo came
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:016223_0153_0F9BD2CFF0CDCE10"/>
monday, and the other days after other idols, for they had many gods; third day they called tueſday after their idol Tuiſco; and after the idol Woden, fourth day they called wedneſday, and fifth day after their Idol Thor they called thurſday; from Friga, friday; and after Saturn they called the ſeventh day, ſaturday; and as I believe in the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, and expect Eternal Life by no other name or power, I dare not for conſcience ſake own the gods of the Heathen, or name a day after them; but chooſe the names which the days were called by, when the moſt high performed his ſeveral works of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, ſecond, third, and ſo on, which is ſcriptural, moſt plain and eaſily underſtood.</p>
               <p>He ſeemed ſome what affected with the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I deſired him to inquire into the matter for himſelf, and not to think that I deſigned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon him; the next time of my going to his ſhop, he ſhewed me ſome papers whereon he had began to learn Algebra, and aſked me how I liked it; I ſaid it might be uſeful to ſome, but that I could take up grubbing or follow the plough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudying Algebra, as he might alſo ſhave a man, &amp;c. without it; beſides I found it a more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and delightful ſtudy to be quietly employed in learning the law of the Lord written in mine own heart, ſo that I might walk before him acceptably.</p>
               <p>On my return from Holland to Norwich, a man ran to me in the ſtreet putting a paper into my hand, and immediately left me, whom I ſoon found to be this barber; the letter contained an innocent child like acknowledgment to me for my freedom with him, as is before mentioned in language rather too much ſhewing his value for me as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and believing him to be reached by the love of Truth, and in meaſure convinced of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:016223_0154_0F9BD2D234A635E0"/>
thereof, I thought it beſt to leave him in the Lord's hand for further inſtruction, to learn by the immediate teachings of the Holy Spirit, that his love might be centred on the true beloved of Souls; for want whereof many are hurt, looking outward and growing in head knowledge, ſeeking the eſteem and friendſhip of men, from whom we are to ceaſe, his breath and life being ſtopped at the Lord's command.</p>
               <p>I mention this paſſage with a view to ſtir up my friends of the ſame holy profeſſion, to let their language in words be the real language of Truth to all men, in purity of Spirit, and not to name the days of the week or months after the heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh idolatrous cuſtoms, ſaying for excuſe, that they to whom they ſpeak do beſt underſtand them, and it ſaves them any further explanation, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is far from proceeding from a diſpoſition apt to teach, and letting the Light of Truth ſhine as they ought. <hi>Neither do men,</hi> ſaid our bleſſed inſtructor, <hi>light a candle and put it under a buſhel; but on a candleſtick, and it giveth light to all that are in the houſe,</hi> Mat. v. 21. Nor doth the Lord enlighten his candle, that is the ſpirit of man, with the pure knowledge of Truth, that we ſhould cover it, either with an eaſeful diſpoſition to ſave ourſelves trouble, or hide the work thereof under the covering buſhel of worldly ſaving care, after the gain and treaſure of this world; but that it may ſtand on the candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and thereby crown thoſe who are thus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the holy Light, that as a city ſet on an hill they cannot be hid.</p>
               <p>The corrupt language of you to a ſingle perſon, and calling the months and days by heathen names, are eſteemed by ſome to be little things; but if a faithful teſtimony in theſe little things, was bleſſed in the inſtance before mentioned, even to the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an earneſt inquiry after the ſaving knowledge
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:016223_0155_0F9BD2D2C0ACC290"/>
of God and his bleſſed Son, whom to know is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; perhaps ſuch who baulk their teſtimony to the pure Talent of Truth given them to profit withal, may one day have their portion appointed with the wicked and ſlothful ſervant, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 24-25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the laſt mentioned meeting I found my mind eaſy to leave Norwich, and went with Richard Brewſter and wife to Wymondam that evening, and next day to Edmondſbury, where feeling an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of mind we ſtaid eight days, attending their ſeveral meetings, and monthly-meeting, which is compoſed of five particular meetings, where, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of a forward formal miniſtry, my ſoul mourned and was cloathed with ſorrow; the next day we had a precious meeting, and the ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another with the miniſters and ſolid friends, in which it became my concern to ſet forth the care they ought to exerciſe over each other, and how neceſſary it was to deal plainly with thoſe that did not keep their places: Truth owned us together and I believe the opportunity will be remembered.</p>
               <p>My mind being drawn to towards Wales, my companion John Pemberton who had been with me three years, having travelled together in much love and unity, inclining to go towards London, we parted in the ſame love, and I, accompanied by my kind friend Richard Brewſter, went to Henry Gray's at Godmancheſter in Huntingdonſhire, and the next day to Wellingborough in Northamptonſhire, and were at their two meetings on firſt day the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>third of the ninth month, which were heavy for want of more faithful inward labourers; that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I had alſo a ſitting with a ſick friend.</p>
               <p>Next morning my friend R. Brewſter returned homewards, and ſeveral friends coming to take leave of me, I had an opportunity to remark to them the reaſon that their meetings were ſo dull
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:016223_0156_0F9BD2D787BCBE50"/>
and cloudy; for I thought I clearly ſaw there was a neglect among them of putting the diſcipline in practice, where diſorders were evident; and that this neglect had cauſed them to ſuffer, which would ſtill continue and increaſe, until they ſet the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Truth over the heads of ſuch who by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly walking had brought a reproach thereon: The friends were affected, and acknowledged they believed it to be the caſe amongſt them. We part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in tenderneſs and I proceeded on my journey with an income of ſolid peace, and after riding thirty ſeven miles reached Banbury in Oxfordſhire, and the next day Eatington in Warwickſhire, where I met with my friends Richard Partridge and Mary Weſton of London, and we were truly glad to ſee each other, ſpending the day together and had a meeting with friends in the evening to our mutual comfort; we went in company to Warwick and Coventry, and at the meeting at the laſt place, which was comfortable, I thought I ſenſibly felt the benefit of the painful labour I had been exerciſed in when there before; R. Partridge returning to London, Mary Weſton went with me to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly-meeting at Leiceſter, which began with a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miniſters and elders, and one for worſhip and diſcipline was held the ſame day; the ſervice in which lay heavy upon me, and Truth favoured, the power thereof being felt to the comfort of many; and I wiſh that ſeaſon may not be forgotten by the members of that meeting; on the firſt day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went to a general meeting at Badgeley, and had an evening meeting at Daniel Lythal's at Poleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, who hath a large family of hopeful tender children. I next went to Allen England's at Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, and had a ſatisfactory opportunity in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to which I had felt a drawing in my mind for ſome time; but did not know that it would fall ſo in the way to the quarterly-meeting at Stafford;
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:016223_0157_0F9BD2D9EAB79BA0"/>
which I attended and there met my friend Joſhua Tofft, in company with whom I returned to Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and next day had a meeting at the widow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's, and another that evening at Uttuxiter, from thence to Leek, and after a favoured meeting went home with Joſhua to Hargate, where after reſting one day, had another meeting at Leek, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity with ſome friends at Joſhua Strangman's, wherewith I had a degree of peace.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by J. Tofft I went to a general meeting at Eaton in Cheſhire, then to Macclesfield, Stockport, Morley, and Farnly, the laſt of which was a good meeting; there my friend Samuel Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thergill met me, and we went to a meeting at Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; the next day Suſanna Fothergill and her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alexander came to ſee me, and we had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable time together at Thomas Hough's, being owned by Truth; I was next at a labourious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Newton, tho' it ended well, and after it I met again with Joſhua Tofft at Edgebury, and had a meeting the next day at Middlewich, then at Nantwich, and Cheſter, from whence rode to John Bellows at Stretton; my travelling and labours through Cheſhire was in a particular cloſe manner, tho' there are ſome ſolid friends in that county.</p>
               <p>Paſſing to Shrewſbury in Shropſhire, I was at a meeting on firſt day at Colebrookdale and had ſome cloſe work; but Truth ſeemed to give victory, and in the evening at Abraham Darby's houſe had an opportunity, in which the teſtimony of Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to the tendering ſome high and lofty young people; whoſe faults were told them in the power of the ſearcher of hearts, for which the ſincere were truly thankful.</p>
               <p>Next day returning to Shrewſbury, I went to viſit Benjamin Thomas and Richard Bellows, who had been confined in priſon about four years and a half for their conſcientious refuſal to pay tithes, and

we had a comfortable ſeaſon together in the jail, feeling the living preſence of the Lord, which makes his people free, even in priſons.</p>
               <p>The day following had a meeting in this town, and one in the evening at the houſe of John Young, both which afforded ſome peace; but the life of Truth is at a low ſtate in Shropſhire, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors with us few in number.</p>
               <p>I then paſſed into North-Wales, to Charles Lloyd's at Dolobran in Montgomeryſhire, John Young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me, and had a meeting there, at this place there was formerly a large meeting; but it is now much declined; from thence we went to Tydeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garrig in Merrionethſhire, and had a meeting with a few ſincere friends at the houſe of Lewis Owen; after which I proceeded on my viſit to the other meetings in this county; firſt at Llwindu in the family of Humphrey Owen, which was a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, tho' no other friends live in this place; then at the houſe of John Goodwin in Eſgingoch in Montgomeryſhire, where were ſeveral tender friends; but the living are ſcarcely able to bear the weight of thoſe profeſſors, who altho' they know the truth, do not abide therein, and ſo are as withered branches caſt forth. Next was a pretty large and ſatisfactory meeting at Talcoyd in Radnorſhire, then at Cwm, and Gluerindrew, and on a firſt day at Penbank, where are many profeſſors, tho' but few ſolid friends; after which at Penplace and Caermar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which laſt meeting was much to my ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the few friends here being of the better ſort; from hence to Haverfordweſt with friends by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſtly, and ſtaying their meetings on firſt day, that in the afternoon was open and ſatisfactory as to other profeſſors who came in; but pride and worldly mindedneſs hath much hurt the members of our ſociety, tho' there are a few tender friends. In the evening I had another opportunity with
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:016223_0159_0F9BD2DBC8EF0878"/>
friends, and was enabled to relieve my mind among them with a degree of thankfulneſs; next meeting was at Jameſtown, and in the evening of the day following at Larn with the people of the town, who behaved civilly, but ſeemed barren as to religion in a right ſenſe; there is but one in this town in unity with friends, and he ſeemed near his end, whom I viſited. After croſſing a ferry near a mile broad, not without great danger, being driven on ſhore and the wind very high, the boat was likely to fill with water, that I was obliged to go over a marſh to Caermarthen, being thankful for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, where I had a public meeting with the town's people, to a good degree of ſatisfaction, and next morning met with my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown at Swanzey, and we were made joyful in the company of each other; here we had two meetings, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with friends ſelected, in which he got ſome relief; after his leaving me here having a concern on my mind I viſited the families of friends, tho' not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear; but felt the help and ſtrength of my great and good maſter, who furniſhed me with power and ſkill to diſcharge my duty, both to the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and the corrupt diſorderly profeſſors, without wounding his own children, ſome of whom there are in this town; I ſtay'd their meeting on fourth day, which ſeaſon being divinely favoured, I pray may not be forgotten, the power which alone can enable to tread on ſcorpions or ſerpents, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the force of deadly poiſon being over all: The honour, praiſe, and glory, be aſcribed to the Lord who is worthy for ever!</p>
               <p>Next day I reſted, and in a degree of humble thankfulneſs made theſe remarks.</p>
               <p>I continued many days longer in this town, in which time had divers meetings, ſome whereof were very ſatisfactory, many of the town's people attending, and the good hand of the Lord was
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:016223_0160_0F9BD2DD5E949148"/>
ſtretched forth towards them; for which I was truly thankful; after ſpending ſixteen days among them I went to Llantriſhon, and the next day had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Trewaruge; then one at Hillary with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enquiring people, alſo at Cardiff with a ſeeking people, who had ſeparated themſelves from the public worſhip and met together in ſilence; this opportunity was an inſtructive ſeaſon to them. On the firſt day following I was at Pontipool, where at two meetings I had many cloſe things to deliver, obſerving want of order among them; in the evening had an opportunity with ſome of the friends moſt active in the diſcipline, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſcharge myſelf; and on third day a large and pretty open meeting; being detained by a great ſnow, I had another meeting with friends of the foremoſt rank on ſixth day, in which I cleared my mind of a great burden, which I had borne on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a formal miniſtry among them; my next meeting was at Shere-Newton, which was pretty large tho' dull, the favour of Truth being much loſt among friends here; yet I was favoured with ſtrength to diſcharge myſelf, and in the feeling ſenſe of peace went that night to the paſſage over the Severn, and next day to Briſtol, my friend and kind landlord James Griffiths bearing me company from his own houſe at Swanzey.</p>
               <p>On third day I attended their meeting in Briſtol, but fat in ſilence, and was very heavy hearted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of a forward ſpirit, which would prompt to anſwer the expectations of the people, and is apt to prevail on ſome who ſeem to be called to the work of the miniſtry; but Truth only bleſſeth its own motion.</p>
               <p>I continued in and near this city about four weeks, attending their ſeveral meetings, but did not feel relief from the burden I was under, and on the fifteenth of the firſt month (1754,) hearing that
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:016223_0161_0F9BD2DDFAD0DAB0"/>
my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown was at Ann Young's at Erthcot, I went there to ſee him, and we were comforted in each others company, and next being their meeting day, we attended it to our refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; from whence we returned together to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol, where we tarried until the twenty-ſixth, in which time I had ſeveral open meetings, which ſet me at liberty to leave that city, when we again parted, and I took meetings at Ulverſtone, Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Sadſbury, Dedmartin, Tedbury, and two at Nailſworth, and another there in the evening, when I had an opportunity to the eaſe of my mind, heavily oppreſſed on account of the formal profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of truth, to the comfort of the faithful, and cauſed thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>From thence calling to viſit the widow Fowler who was in affliction, I went to meetings at Painſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Glouceſter, Roſs in Herefordſhire, Almerly, Leominſter, and Uphan, where I viſited the wives of the two friends before mentioned, who are impriſoned at Shrewſbury for their teſtimony againſt Tithes; then returning to Leominſter attended the monthly-meeting there, in which truth owned us, and taking a meeting at Broomſgrove went to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, and on firſt day was at two comfortable meetings, and another on third day, and the next day attended the quarterly-meeting, which was a precious time, wherein friends were comforted; and finding a concern on my mind I went into the women's meeting, wherein the power of Truth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, which is the crown of our religious meetings, here is a tender feed eſpecially amongſt the female ſex, which will thrive if this Divine power is kept unto.</p>
               <p>Being now clear of this city, I departed with peace to meetings at Tewſkbury, Cheltenham, and again to Nailſworth, where I was at two meetings, which tho' hard, I had an evidence that the Lord
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:016223_0162_0F9BD2E33191B668"/>
had not forſaken his ſeeking people. After attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a conference with ſeveral friends endeavouring to compoſe a difference, which ended to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I proceeded to the quarterly meeting for Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire held at Tedbury, where I again met with my brother W. B. Divine Goodneſs and a good degree of the authority of Truth attending in the time of worſhip, and in tranſacting the affairs of the church.</p>
               <p>Next day my brother went to Bath and I to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renceſter, where I had a hard and dull meeting, the profeſſors of truth having too much departed from the favour thereof; at another in the evening I had an evidence of having diſcharged my duty; then proceeded to meetings at Farringdon in Berk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Litchfield, Burford in Oxfordſhire, Milton, Stow in Glouceſterſhire, Chipping-Norton, Charlbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Witney, Abingdon, Warbury, North End, and from thence to High Wiccomb, where the weather being very cold I tarried ſix days, viſiting ſeveral families of ſick friends, and the laſt public meeting being in the evening, many of the town's people attended, and it was a ſolid opportunity. From thence I went to Amerſham tho' with difficulty on account of the ſnow, and on firſt day had a meeting at Cheſham; then to Hampſtead, and had there a meeting, which was much enlarged by the ſcholars of W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Squire's ſchool, ſeveral of whom were affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; then having a good opportunity with friends at Albans, I went to London, where I remained ſeven weeks and three days, viſiting the meetings and felt much of the weight and burden of the ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me there, and in the opening and authority of Truth, I had to ſpeak to the preſent date of our ſociety, not only to the inſtruction of the ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children and comforting of the mourners; but alſo by way of rebuke to the diſorderly, and cloſe warning to the rebellious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:016223_0163_0F9BD2E5781BD4A0"/>During my continuance here I felt my mind drawn towards Wiltſhire, and thought of attending the quarterly-meeting there; but on the day on which I expected to ſet forward, I found a ſtop in my mind; tho' not relieved from a ſolid concern, which engaged me to enquire ſecretly what I ſhould do; for notwithſtanding this concern to Wiltſhire, my burden reſpecting London ſeemed rather to increaſe; but as I kept quiet, I found my heart warmed in love and my mind opened, and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to write an Epiſtle to that quarterly-meeting, which with thankfulneſs I then eſteemed a great favour from my great and good Maſter, being in a poor ſtate of health, the weather unfavourable, and the journey long. So in the opening of truth, I wrote as followeth.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To Friends in Wiltſhire.</head>
                     <p>HAVING had ſtrong deſires in my mind for your welfare in the truth, I purpoſed to have attended your quarterly-meeting, but being lett at this time, and not knowing that I ſhall ever have an opportunity to ſee you, I feel a freedom to viſit you with a few lines in the opening and love of truth, which flows to you-ward.</p>
                     <p>Dear Friends, male and female, old and young, as many of you as are deſirous to be called the Children of God, and followers of Chriſt Jeſus, be humble, that you may be taught of him; for it is the humble that he teaches of his ways; and be ye meek and low in heart, that you may ſerve him in your generation, and one another in his pure fear, ſo you will know him for your reſt, and his peace your quiet habitation.</p>
                     <p>My ſoul hath mourned, and is in ſome degree covered therewith at this time, under a ſenſe that the love of the world, and its pleaſures and earthly
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:016223_0164_0F9BD2E59BF35D70"/>
delights, abound in too many, (which is iniquity) and becauſe thereof the love of many towards God waxeth cold; and for want of witneſſing the love of God in a pure heart, the mind becomes at eaſe, lukewarm, and indifferent about the things which belong to our peace and future happineſs, and ſo fathers and mothers, maſters and miſtreſſes, become dull, if not dead to that holy concern, which ſhould ever excite them, both by example and precept, to inſtruct and train up their children and ſervants in all Godlineſs of life and converſation.</p>
                     <p>Oh dear Friends! ſearch your hearts, and diligently enquire whether ſomething hath not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly crept in, and ſtolen away your affections from God; and the deep attention of your minds from the inſtructions of his Holy Spirit of Truth; and if this becomes your concern, I fully believe that the Lord will bleſs you with enlightened minds to ſee, and willing hearts to give up all to the fire and ſword of his Word and Spirit, that your hearts may be purged, and made tabernacles and temples in which he would take delight to dwell: For if the ſoul is chaſte in Love to God, and the eye of the mind ſingle to the inſtruction of the ſpirit of truth, the whole body will be full of Light: It is herein that the children of God are preſerved ſafe in their own ſecret ſteps before the Lord, and free from giving occaſion of ſtumbling to others.</p>
                     <p>I am fully perſuaded there is a remnant amongſt you, who feelingly know, that the living ſenſe of the preſence and power of God, in your meetings both for worſhip and diſcipline, is not plentifully enjoyed, but is at a low ebb: And it is in my mind to let you know what has appeared to me to be as one great reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> There are many profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the truth amongſt you, who delight to be accounted of as friends in eſteem in the ſociety; who have a ſmooth and fawning behaviour, and
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:016223_0165_0F9BD2E6E84324E8"/>
flattering tongues, and do ſeek the love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſuch who are friends of truth, for their own honour and credit, and the reputation of ſelf. Dear Friends, of ſuch beware, for their friendſhip is poiſon, and their intimate fellowſhip, if cleaved unto, is benumbing, even to inſenſibility: And for want of a clear diſcovery of that ſpirit, ſome of the tender and ſincere hearted amongſt you have ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>In whomſoever earthly mindedneſs prevails, or the love of the world and its friendſhip; there is a ſecret giving way to, and a gradual reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with its ſordid practices; and the eye that once ſaw in the true Light, becomes cloſed or dimmed, if not wholly blinded by the God of this world.</p>
                     <p>Liberty is then taken by parents, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is given to their children; which occaſions pain and diſtreſs of heart to thoſe who have not loſt their ſight and feeling: But ſome, for fear of being rebuked and diſeſteemed by ſuch who have a ſenſe of them, will court their affections; with which bait they have been taken, and ſo have been afraid to ſpeak their minds plainly leſt they ſhould offend, or drive them further from the ſociety; concluding there is a tender thing in them, becauſe they ſeem to love friends: And ſo many who might have made great progreſs have loſt ground, for want of ſpeaking truth to their neighbours; and thus the infection of pride, libertiniſm, and earthly mindedneſs has ſpread and prevailed, even to the hurt of ſome families, that were once exceedingly grieved therewith.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, my dear Friends, fear God with a perfect heart, and in his Light watch over your own ſelves and your families: So ſhall your hearts be warmly influenced, and filled with holy zeal, and love to God and his Truth; in which you will be bold to act in your meetings for diſcipline, and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:016223_0166_0F9BD2E70E89D8F8"/>
in the power of God, which is the authority of the church, you will be able to judge thoſe who walk diſorderly; and being faithful therein, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſtumbling blocks, and roll away the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach which is imputed to the church.</p>
                     <p>Then would the Lord feed ſuch his faithful labourers with his Heavenly Bread, and honour them with his Life giving, preſence and whether the diſorderly would hear or forbear, the Lord would be the ſhield and exceeding great reward of his people, and fill their hearts with praiſe to his name, who is worthy forever and ever.</p>

               <p>I have before hinted, that in my travelling to the meetings in Wiltſhire, and attending the quarterly-meeting in the ſeventh month, Old Stile, 1750, I was ſtraitened to clear myſelf towards them, which occaſioned me to leave them in pain of mind, but now having ſent them this epiſtle I was made eaſy, believing they would read it, and ſend copies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to their ſeveral monthly-meetings, which would be likely to be heard by more friends than if my concern had been delivered in the quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only; incloſing it to an innocent friend at Chip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penham, I deſired him to deliver it to the ſaid meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I afterwards understood he did, and that friends had anſwered my requeſt.</p>
               <p>Now feeling my mind eaſy to leave London for a while, I went to Eſher in Surry, was the next day at a large meeting at Kingſton on Thames, which was pretty open as to doctrine, the people ſeemed attentive and ſeveral much tendered; there are but few friends here.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:016223_0167_0F9BD2E7C87373C0"/>I then viſited divers other meetings in Hampſhire and Berkſhire, being made thankful to the great author of all good, who had been with me in the journey under my indiſpoſition of body; coming to London I met with many friends from different parts of the nation in order to attend the yearly-meeting, which began on the ſecond day of the ſixth month, and continued ten days, being a very large and in the main a ſolid meeting; many weighty affairs relating to our religious ſociety were therein conſidered, it was then alſo agreed, that in future this meeting ſhould begin with a meeting of miniſters and elders, on the ſeventh day of the week at the third hour in the afternoon, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry might be made into the ſtate of the miniſtry in general, which I hope may be attended with good ſervice hereafter.</p>
               <p>On the eleventh of the ſixth month and third day of the week, after the parting meeting I went from London to Margarets in Hertfordſhire, next day attended a yearly-meeting in Hertford which was very large.</p>
               <p>The next day I accompanied ſeveral friends who were appointed to viſit a monthly-meeting, the members of which paid tithes, and contended for liberty ſo to do without cenſure; we had a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with them, in which the teſtimony of Truth being ſet over them for that time, they were taken and confounded in their own arguments.</p>
               <p>After this I attended a general or yearly-meeting at Baldock, which was very large and ſatisfactory, returning next morning to London, I was truly thankful that I had been enabled to attend theſe three meetings, enjoying great peace in my labours there, which lay heavy upon me; my gracious and good Maſter gave me wiſdom, boldneſs, and ſtrength to clear myſelf in the love and power of Truth, to the tendering of many hearts; may I
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:016223_0168_0F9BD2E983DE9DA8"/>
ever remember his mercies to me, and be enabled to bleſs and praiſe his holy name, who is worthy for ever!</p>
               <p>Continuing in and near London about ten days, I then went to a large ſatisfactory meeting at Rocheſter in Kent, where were ſeveral clergymen, who behaved well; next day had a meeting at Loos in the houſe of Thomas Criſp with a few friends and divers others; then going to my friend William Patterſons, at Canterbury, I was at their meeting in that town, and the day following had one on the Iſle of Thanet, where there are a few friendly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the meeting next day at Dover was pretty open; on firſt day I was at two meetings at Folk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which were dull and heavy, tho' there are many friends in that place, amongſt whom I was favoured with ſtrength to eaſe my mind.</p>
               <p>I then viſited the Meetings at marſham, Aſhford, Tenterden, (to which friends of Colebrook came,) Gardnerſtreet, Lewis, Brightelmſtone, Ifield, Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Shipley, Arundle, and Chicheſter, when find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a concern to viſit the families of friends in this city, I ſpent two days in the ſervice and had ſame cloſe exerciſe, tho' a good degree of peace; I alſo attended their two meetings on firſt day, which were heavy and laborious; for tho' here are ſome tender people, yet the ſpirit of the world has brought a blaſt on ſeveral profeſſors.</p>
               <p>From hence I went to Goſport in Hampſhire where we had a meeting, alſo one in the evening at Portſmouth, Jn<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Griffith and Jerem. Waring being with me; then going to Southampton, went in a boat to Cowes on the Iſle of Wight, and the day after had a good meeting at Newport, likewiſe one in the evening with the town's people, after another opportunity with friends, returned to Cowes where I had another with a few of our brethren, ſo went back to Southampton, and on firſt day the
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:016223_0169_0F9BD2EA137097D0"/>
twenty-firſt of the ſeventh month attended two meetings at Pool in Dorſetſhire, which were dull and laborious; a worldly libertine ſpirit has brought a blaſt on many: Next day we had a meeting with a few friends at Weymouth, then at Bridport, truth ſeems at a low ebb in Dorſetſhire: The next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was at Ringwood in Hampſhire, which was dull; where the life of Truth is not abode in, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will wither. The ſame evening we had a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pretty good ſatisfaction at Fordingbridge; then one at Alton, at which place we had another very ſatisfactory meeting, on firſt day, and that evening at Godalmen; the next day had a meeting at Capel in Surry and in the evening at Darking; on the day following at Ryegate and in the evening at Croydon; from whence on fourth day morning the thirty-firſt of the ſeventh month coming again to London for the laſt time, I ſpent eight days more with friends in that city.</p>
               <p>On my coming here from Albans, on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the third month before mentioned, I felt great fear to poſſeſs my mind, having at ſundry times before ſpent about thirteen weeks in that city, moſtly under a cloſe exerciſe of ſpirit, without an openneſs to ſay much in public or private to obtain relief; ſo that to go thither again appeared to me like entering into a cloud, altho' I was ſecretly bound in ſpirit to proceed; but attending all the meetings as they came in courſe, I felt a gradual openneſs and ſtrength to decare thoſe things, which before had been ſealed up, being now made ſenſible that every opening or viſion, which the Lord is pleaſed to manifeſt to his ſervants, are not for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate utterance; but the Lord who gives judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be carefully waited' upon, who only can ſhew, by the manifeſtation of his heavenly light, the time when, and by the gentle putting forth of his arm of power, abilitates in the opening of his
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:016223_0170_0F9BD2EC82BB0920"/>
ſpirit, which giveth tongue and utterance to ſpeak the word of Truth, in the demonſtration of the ſpirit and power, that openeth a door of entrance in the hearts of them who hear. Our dear Lord ſaid, <hi>For it is not ye that ſpeak; but the Spirit of your Father, which ſpeaketh in you,</hi> Mat. x. 20.</p>
               <p>Now as my ſervice opened and ſtrength increaſed, I was invited by ſome to their houſes to dine, who before looked on me with indifference; but now ſaid they ſhould be glad to ſee me there to be more acquainted; but as I felt on my firſt arrival in this city, a ſecret prohibition from going much from houſe to houſe without inward leave, ſo now the ſame reſtraint continued with me, left by going to ſuch places 1 might ſomewhat contradict by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the precepts which Truth had directed me to diliver in public, to wit, a life of ſelf-denial and temperance in eating and drinking, with a ſteady inward attention to the teachings of the Spirit of Grace, in order to know an eſtabliſhment of heart thereby, as being the certain duty of every follower of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p>Thus I think I have ſeen that there is great need to be exceedingly careful, when the Lord is pleaſed to reach unto and convict diſorderly walkers by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental means, that we do not leſſen the weight of Divine reproof, by being familiar with ſuch as if all was well; for they are apt to be fond of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument through whom they have been reached, and if by their fondling, they gain the eſteem of ſuch a friend, it ſeems to heal them before their wounds are ſearched to the bottom; ſo that I rather choſe retirement, and to live as private as I well could; now I alſo ſaw, that if I had fought many acquaintance, and thereby beheld the conduct and behaviour of ſome in their families, my way would not have been ſo open as it now was.</p>

Nevertheleſs a participation of the love of God by the members of the true church, has taught them to know the communion of ſaints, and the deeply engraven unity of the one ſpirit, which makes them as Epiſtles written in one another's hearts, which time or diſtance can never eraſe.</p>

the ſhip, where we had a precious uniting time, and then returned on ſhore to dine; after which my friend Samuel Fothergill and myſelf taking leave of our friends went on board again, and paſſed down the Thames to Margaret Bay, near the Iſle of Thanet; on firſt day the eleventh we went to the Downs by Deal, tho' very much indiſpoſed in body, I enjoyed ſuch quietude of mind, that I was borne up, ard preſerved from repining: Samuel Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill before mentioned, came over with me on a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious viſit to friends in America; and during our paſſage, great nearneſs was between us; we held meetings conſtantly on the firſt and fifth days of the week, and landed near Wilmington in New-Caſtle County on Delaware on the twenty-fourth of the ninth month (1754) in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>My brother William Brown with our friend Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua Dixon from the county of Durham in Great Britain, who was coming over alſo on a religious viſit to friends in theſe colonies, having embarked in another ſhip, which ſailed ſome time before us, arrived likewiſe the ſame day, and quite unexpected to each other we met in this town to our mutual joy and ſatisfaction; from whence after dining, they with Samuel Fothergill proceeded up to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and I went home that evening, where I found a kind reception.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>OUR Yearly-meeting for worſhip at Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was held in the week after I landed, and I was greatly rejoiced to ſee many of my friends and acquaintance there.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh month following I went up to the quarterly-meeting in Philadelphia, and returned to ours at Concord, where alſo was Samuel Fothergill; it was a very large meeting, in which he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely opened in ſpeaking to the ſtate of friends in his public miniſtry, and ſerviceable in the diſcipline; he alſo attended our general-meeting in the ſame month at London-Grove, which was alſo large and profitable, then went towards Lancaſter on his way to the Southern Provinces.</p>
               <p>I ſpent this winter moſtly at and near home, at times attending ſome neighbouring meetings, until towards the ſpring I took a ſmall journey to ſeven or eight others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:016223_0174_0F9BD2F2412F5458"/>During my late travels in Europe, beholding the declenſion of many of the profeſſors of truth from the ancient ſimplicity in habit and deportment, I ſometimes was ready to cry out and ſay, O Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania! may thine inhabitants be for ever ſtrangers to the vanities of the world, and the profeſſors of truth keep their garments clean from the ſpots thereof, pride and ſuperfluity of every kind; but now with ſorrow of heart, I thought I beheld ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the youth in our ſociety taking their flight as into the air, where the ſnares of the prince of the power thereof are laid to catch them, ſome of whom being already ſo much enſnared to their unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hurt, I knew them not otherwiſe than by their natural features and a family reſemblance, their demeanour and habit being ſo exceedingly altered in a little more than four years; yet to my comfort I ſaw a few, who by walking in the Light, had eſcaped the wiles of ſatan and were growing in the Truth.</p>
               <p>In the fourth month (1755) I attended the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral annual-meeting at Duck-Creek, alſo meetings at Little-Creek and George's-Creek, the laſt of which was more open than I expected, ſeveral of other ſocieties being there, who behaved orderly; after which I ſpent moſt of the ſummer at home, diligently attending our meetings for worſhip and diſcipline, and had to obſerve that the general part of the members of our meeting, were for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time remarkable in their care to come together near the hour appointed, and we had ſome precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, many of which were held in ſilence, wherein I often ſaw it to be a time of renewed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation to many, which if not carefully improved, would not be continued very long; but that a more trying ſeaſon would overtake us, (of which I was ſometimes led to ſpeak as truth opened) wherein the door of outward miniſtry would be more cloſed up,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:016223_0175_0F9BD2F4D71C88D0"/>
which would prove the religion of the profeſſors of truth, and manifeſt what they attended meetings for, whether to wait upon God for the Spiritual Bread, or on man for outward miniſtry.</p>
               <p>In the ninth month I attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia, which was large and ſolid, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many weighty matters coming under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were concluded to ſatisfaction, that many friends parted in a feeling ſenſe of the overſhadowing of the Heavenly wing, with reverent thankfulneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>In the tenth month I attended Shrewſbury quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly-meeting in Eaſt-Jerſey, at which alſo were our friends John Evans and Joſeph White, it was large the ſittings thereof being favoured with a degree of the Divine preſence; we alſo attended the monthly-meeting there and had ſome ſervice; friends were encouraged to deal with ſuch who were diſorderly in conduct, there having been ſome ſlackneſs among them in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>As the ſound of war and public commotions, had now entered the borders of theſe heretofore peaceful provinces, ſome ſolid thoughts attended my mind at Shrewſbury, reſpecting the nature of giving money for the King's uſe, knowing the ſame to be intended for the carrying on of war. John Evans accompanying me homewards, we took three meetings in our way, the laſt being at Eveſham, at which place I told him that I felt an engagement of mind to go to Philadelphia, and he conſented to go with me; when we came to the city the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania being ſitting, we underſtood that a Committee of the Houſe was appointed to prepare a bill, for granting a ſum of money for the King's uſe to be iſſued in paper bills of credit, to be called in and ſunk at a ſtated time by a tax on the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, on which account ſeveral friends were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a cloſe exerciſe of mind, ſome of whom being
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:016223_0176_0F9BD2F5450746F8"/>
providentially together, and conferring on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, concluded it was expedient to requeſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with thoſe members of the Houſe who were of our religious profeſſion; on applying to the Speaker, who was one himſelf, we obtained an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of converſing with them, after which, we believed that an Addreſs to the Aſſembly would be neceſſary; but we then being only few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, conſulted with ſeveral weighty friends thereon, at length upwards of twenty met together, who after ſolidly conſidering the matter before us, were all of opinion that an Addreſs to the Aſſembly would be proper and neceſſary; whereupon one was drawn up, which being conſidered, agreed to and ſigned by all of us, we went together to the Houſe, and preſenting it to the Speaker, it was read while we were preſent; a copy whereof here follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>We ſincerely aſſure you, we have no temporal motives for thus addreſſing you; and could we have preſerved peace in our own minds, and with each other, we ſhould have declined it; being unwilling to give you any unneceſſary trouble, and deeply ſenſible of your difficulty in diſcharging the truſt committed to you, irreproachable in theſe perilous times; which hath engaged our ſervent deſires, that the immediate inſtructions of Supreme wiſdom, may influence your minds; and that being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſteady attention thereto, you may be enabled to ſecure peace and tranquillity to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thoſe you repreſent, by purſuing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures conſiſtent with our peaceable principles; and then we truſt we may continue humbly to confide in the protection of that Almighty Power, whoſe providence has heretofore been as walls and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks round about us.</p>

<pb n="173" facs="unknown:016223_0179_0F9BD2FCEDC56070"/>
and ſolid conferences we have had together, with many other friends, upon the preſent ſituation of the affairs of the ſociety in this Province; and in that love, we find our ſpirits engaged to acquaint you, that under a ſolid exerciſe of mind to ſeek for council and direction, from the High Prieſt of our profeſſion, who is the Prince of Peace: We believe he hath renewedly favoured us with ſtrong and lively evidences, that in his due and appointed time, the day which hath dawned in theſe latter ages, foretold by the Prophet, wherein ſwords ſhould be beaten into plough-ſhares, and ſpears into pruning-hooks, ſhall gloriouſly riſe higher and higher; and the Spirit of the Goſpel, which teaches to love enemies, prevail to that degree, that the art of war ſhall be no more learned. And that it is his detemination to exalt this bleſſed day, in this our age, if in the depth of humility we receive his inſtructions, and obey his voice: And being painfully apprehenſive, that the large ſum granted by the late Act of Aſſembly for the King's uſe, is principally intended for purpoſes inconſiſtent with our peaceable teſtimony; we therefore think, that as we cannot be concerned in wars and fightings, ſo neither ought we to contribute thereto, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tax directed by the ſaid act, though ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be the conſequence of our refuſal, which we hope to be enabled to bear with patience.

at the ſame time aſſenting to, or allowing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in practices, which we apprehend contrary to the teſtimony which the Lord hath given us to bear, for his name and truth's ſake.</p>
                     <p>And having the health and proſpecity of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at heart, we earneſtly exhort friends to wait for the appearing of the true Light, and ſtand in the council of God, that we may know him to be the Rock of Salvation, and place of our Refuge forever. And beware of the ſpirit of the world, that is unſtable, and often draws into dark and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous reaſonings; left the god thereof ſhould be ſuffered to blind the eye of the mind: And ſuch, not knowing the ſure Foundation, the Rock of Ages, may partake of the terrors and fears, that are not known to the inhabitants of that place, where the ſheep and lambs of Chriſt ever had a quiet habitation, which a remnant have to ſay, to the praiſe of his name, they have been bleſſed with a meaſure of, in this day of diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>And as our fidelity to the preſent government, and our willingly paying all taxes for purpoſes which do not interfere with our conſciences, may juſtly exempt us from the imputation of diſloyalty: So we earneſtly deſire that all who by a deep and quiet ſeeking for direction from the Holy Spirit, are or ſhall be convinced that he calls us as a people to this teſtimony, may dwell under the guidance of the ſame Divine Spirit, and manifeſt by the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humility of their converſation, that they are really under that influence; and therein may know true fortitude and patience to bear that, and every other teſtimony committed to them, faithfully and uniformly: And that all friends may know their ſpirits cloathed and covered with true charity, the bond of Chriſtian fellowſhip, wherein we again tenderly ſalute you, and remain your Friends and Brethren."</p>

                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:016223_0181_0F9BD2FFC5B7D248"/>In the Year 1756 I attended our general ſpring-meeting in Philadelphia, at which we had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of our dear friends Samuel Fothergill and Catharine Payton from Great Britain, and her companion Mary Peaſley from Ireland, and it was a ſolemn edifying meeting.</p>
               <p>The Indians having burnt ſeveral houſes on the frontiers of this Province, alſo at Gnadenhutten in Northampton County, and murdered and ſcalped ſome of the inhabitants; at the time of this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three of the dead bodies were brought to Philadelphia in a waggon, with an intent as was ſuppoſed to animate the people to unite in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of war to take vengeance on the Indians, and deſtroy them: They were carried along ſeveral of the ſtreets, many people following, curſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, alſo the Quakers becauſe they would not join in war for deſtruction of the Indians. The ſight of the dead bodies and the outcry of the people, were very afflicting and ſhocking to me: Standing at the door of a friend's houſe as they paſſed along, my mind was humbled and turned much inward when I was made ſecretly to cry; <hi>What will become of Pennſylvania?</hi> for it felt to me that many did not conſider, that the ſins of the inhabitants, pride, profane ſwearing, drunkenneſs with other wickedneſs were the cauſe, that the Lord had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this calamity and ſcourge to come upon them; the weight of my exerciſe increaſing as I walked along the ſtreet; at length it was ſaid in my ſoul, <hi>This Land is polluted with blood, and in the day of inquiſition for blood, it will not only be required at the frontiers and borders, but even in this place where theſe bodies are now ſeen.</hi> I ſaid within myſelf, "How can this be? ſince this has been a land of peace, and as yet not much concerned in war;" but as it were in a moment mine eyes turned to the caſe of the poor enſlaved Negroes: And however light
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:016223_0182_0F9BD3010D71FC70"/>
a matter they who have been concerned with them may look upon the purchaſing, ſelling, or keeping thoſe oppreſſed people in ſlavery, it then appeared plain to me, that ſuch were partakers in iniquity, encouragers of war and the ſhedding of innocent blood, which is often the caſe, where thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py people are or have been captivated and brought away for ſlaves: The ſame day I went to Pine-ſtreet meeting under an exerciſing mournful ſtate of mind, and thought I could be willing to ſit among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple undiſcovered.</p>
               <p>I attended our Quarterly-meeting at Concord in the fifth month, and in a few days after went to the yearlv-meeting at Weſt-River in Maryland, which was large and in a good degree ſatisfactory, then going to meetings at Herring-Creek, and the Clifts, returned the following firſt day to Weſt-River, where I had a good opportunity to clear myſelf towards friends of that place; being concerned on account of ſeveral of the elders, who did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſo examplary as they ought before the youth, and left them relieved in my mind; from thence I returned home, taking ſeveral meetings in my way.</p>
               <p>In the ninth month I was at our yearly-meeting for Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, held this year at Burlington, which was large and edifying; many weighty matters being in much brotherly love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted to ſatisfaction, our friend Thomas Gawthrop from Great Britain was there, in the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of our worthy friend and brother John Evans of Gwynnedd departing this life, Thomas and I went to attend the burial, on which ſolemn occaſion, he had a ſeaſonable opportunity to remind a large gathering of people of their latter end, and I thought it was a ſolid time.</p>
               <p>Being one of the committee appointed by the yearly-meeting to viſit the quarterly and monthly-meetings, I was careful in attending on that ſervice,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:016223_0183_0F9BD3019D3631F8"/>
as way was opened in company with other friends, as likewiſe our meeting for ſufferings this year eſtabliſhed, which is held monthly in Philadelphia, frequently taking meetings in my way going and returning.</p>
               <p>In the Spring of the year 1757, I alſo attended our general-meeting for miniſters and elders held at Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>Having often remembered a remarkable account given me when in England by our ancient worthy friend John Richardſon, which as it made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my mind I committed to writing, and now reviving think it is worthy to be preſerved, being nearly as follows, tho' I was not particular in regard to the time of the occurrence, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>"Peter Gardner, a Friend who lived in Eſſex, had a concern to viſit friends in Scotland; but being low in circumſtances, and having a wife and ſeveral children, was under diſcouragement about it: The Lord in mercy condeſcended to remove his doubts, by letting him know he would be with him, and though he had no horſe to ride, and was but a weakly man, yet he would give him ſtrength to perform the journey, and ſuſtain him ſo that he ſhould not want for what was ſufficient. And having faith, he laid his concern before the monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he belonged to, with innocent weight; and friends concurring with him therein, he took his journey along the Eaſt-ſide of the Nation, through Norfolk, Lincolnſhire, and Yorkſhire, and coming to a week-day meeting at Bridlington where John Richardſon then dwelt, he lodged at his houſe. In the evening the doors being ſhut, Peter aſked him if any friend lived that way, (pointing with his finger) John told him he pointed towards the ſea, which was not far from thence: he ſaid he believed he muſt go and ſee ſomebody that way in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:016223_0184_0F9BD307BAB115E0"/>
John aſked him if he ſhould go with him? he ſaid he believed it would not be beſt, and ſo went to bed."</p>
               <p>"In the morning when John's wife had prepared breakfaſt, he thought he would go and ſee if the friend was well, but found the bed empty, and that he was gone, at which John Richardſon wondred; but ſoon after Peter came in, to whom John ſaid, Thou haſt taken a morning walk, come to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: And before they had done eating, a friend from the Quay or harbour (the way that Peter Gardner pointed to over night) came in, and ſaid, "I wonder at thee John, to ſend this man with ſuch a meſſage to my houſe," and related as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> That he came to him as he was ſtanding at the Fiſh-market-Place, looking on the ſea, to obſerve the wind, That he aſked him if he would walk into his houſe? to which Peter anſwered that he came for that purpoſe; (this was in the twilight of the morning,) that when he went into the houſe, he enquired whether his wife was well, to which the man anſwered, that ſhe was ſick in bed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to go in and ſee her; he ſaid he came ſo to do: Then being conducted into the chamber where the ſick woman was, he ſat down by her; and after a ſhort time told her, the will and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of her mind was accepted inſtead of the deed, and that ſhe was excuſed from the journey which had been before her, and ſhould die in peace with God and men: Then turning to the man (her huſband) he ſaid, Thy wife had a concern to viſit the churches in another country beyond the ſea, but thou wouldſt not give her leave, ſo ſhe ſhall be taken from thee; and behold, the Lord's hand is againſt thee, and thou ſhalt be blaſted in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou doeſt, and reduced to want thy bread. So the man ſeemed angry with John Richardſon, who ſaid to him, "be ſtill, and weigh the matter,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:016223_0185_0F9BD309099FD630"/>
for I knew not of the friend's going to thy houſe; but thought he was in bed, and did not inform him about thee nor thy wife," at which he went away. ſo Peter purſued his journey towards Scotland, John Richardſon and another friend going with him to Scarborough on horſe back, (for he would not let them go on foot with him,) he kept before them full as faſt as they choſe to ride; and when they had gone about half way, he gained ground of them, and John ſaid he was filled with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for he ſeemed to go with more flight and eaſe, he thought than ever he had ſeen any man before: And riding faſt to overtake him, he thought he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a ſmall white cloud as it were encompaſſing his head; when he overtook him John ſaid to him, Thou doeſt travel very faſt; Peter replied, my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter told me before I left home, that he would give me hinds feet, and he hath performed his promiſe to me."</p>
               <p>"When they came in ſight of Scarborough, Peter ſaid, take me to a friend's houſe if there is any there; John replied, I will take thee to the place where I lodge, and if thou art not eaſy there, I will go until we find a place, if it may be: ſo John Richardſon took him to his lodgings, and juſt as they entered the door, they heard ſome one go up ſtairs, and anon the woman friend of the houſe coming down with a neighbour of hers invited them to ſit down; and in a ſhort time, Peter ſaith, Here is light and darkneſs, good and bad in this houſe. The woman, after ſhe had got them ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, came and aſked John, "who haſt thou brought here?" A man of God, he replied. Having a meeting at Scarborough the next day, John Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon ſtaid with him, and ſaid he had good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; he alſo went with him to ſeveral friends houſes there, and he frequently ſpake his ſenſe of the ſtate of the families; but as they were near entering one
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:016223_0186_0F9BD3098714E978"/>
houſe, Peter ſtopped, and ſaid, my Maſter is not there, I will not go in, ſo they turned away."</p>
               <p>"Next morning at parting, John Richardſon aſked him how he was prepared for money, telling him the journey was long; to whom Peter anſwered, I have enough, my Maſter told me I ſhould not want, and now, a bit of bread, and ſome water from a brook, refreſhes me as much as a ſet meal at a table: But John inſiſted to ſee how much money he had, which was but two half-crowns; upon which John took a handfull of ſmall pieces out of his pocket, and forced Peter to take them, telling him it was as free to him as his own, for ſo the Lord had put it into his heart; thus they parted, John and the other friend returning home."</p>
               <p>"In about two weeks afterwards the man's wife (before mentioned) died, as Peter had foretold; at that time, the ſame man had three ſhips at ſea, his ſon was maſter of one, a ſecond ſon was on board another, and in their voyages they were all wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or foundered and their cargoes chiefly loſt; his two ſons and ſeveral of the hands being drowned: The man ſoon after broke and could not pay his debts, but came to want bread before he died, though he had been in good circumſtances, if not very rich."</p>
               <p>"John Richardſon further ſaid, That after ſome time he heard Peter Gardner was dead in Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, on his return from Scotland, and being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him in near affection, he went to enquire how he ended."</p>
               <p>"John Bowſtead a noted friend near Carliſle gave him an account that Peter had been through Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and came to Carliſle, and the ſmall pox being there, he took the infection very ſuddenly and lay ill with it: So J. Bowſtead went juſt as the pock was coming out on him, and took him to his houſe, they never came out kindly, but ſwelled him very
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:016223_0187_0F9BD30AA9A5ED20"/>
much, ſo that he was blind, and died about the ſeventh day, was quite ſenſible to the laſt, and knew the ſtates of thoſe who came to ſee him: He had enough to pay his funeral charges."</p>
               <p>On the twelfth of the ſeventh month this year I left home, in order to attend a treaty to be held between the Indians and our Government at Eaſton in Northampton County; and proceeded to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, where I was preſent at ſeveral conferences with friends, the Governor having declared his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to their attendance at that treaty, or their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing themſelves by giving the Indians any preſents; the reſult was, that as mutual tokens of the revival of antient friendſhip had paſſed between them and the Indians, with a veiw to promote a general peace; it would be of bad conſequence now to neglect or decline attending on this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant occaſion; tho' it was judged neceſſary for friends to act with great caution. We therefore ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and taking a meeting at Gwynnedd in the way, reached Eaſton on fourth day the twenty-firſt of the month, the Governor being got there about two hours before us; but did not enter on buſineſs that day.</p>
               <p>Many friends from Philadelphia and other parts being here collected, we held a meeting on fifth day which was low and dull, things appearing very dark; in the afternoon the Indians with Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung their King, or chief man, went to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and ſignified the ſincerity of their intentions to promote the good work of peace, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſeveral ſtrings and belts of wampum, in order to certify the full power and authority given to Teedyuſcung for that purpoſe, who alſo deſired that as things had heretofore been miſunderſtood or forgotten, he might have the liberty to chooſe a clerk to take the minutes of the tranſactions at this treaty on behalf of the Indians, which was put off by the Governor at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:016223_0188_0F9BD30B21ADE708"/>Next morning Teedyuſcung renewed the ſame requeſt, but was again put by: Then the Indians began to be very uneaſy, from an apprehenſion that ſome people from the Jerſey ſide of the river were likely to riſe, with a deſign to deſtroy them; but on going to converſe with them, and giving them ſome pipes and tobacco, which they were told was a preſent from friends, they became more quiet, and ſeemingly pacified; this day and the next there was little buſineſs done.</p>
               <p>On firſt day the twenty-fourth of the month, friends held a public meeting, in the Treaty-booth to pretty good ſatisfaction, to which a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people came, two friends having acceptable ſervice therein; in the afternoon friends met again; but there ſeemed ſo great a cloud over the meeting, by reaſon of a raw careleſs ſpirit prevailing over the minds of the people, as though there was no God, notwithſtanding his judgments are ſo conſpicuous. eſpecially in theſe parts of the country, that life did not ariſe in this meeting, about ſunſet this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we heard that the Mohawk Indians had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to have a fire made to dance round, which the governor allowed, as he had the evening before to the Delawares, with both which we were very uneaſy, as the tendency thereof was to make the Indians drunk; but no endeavours of ours could prevent it.</p>
               <p>On ſecond day morning the Governor agreed to allow the Indian King to chooſe himſelf a clerk, which he did, and about one o'clock that day the treaty was firſt opened in public, when Teedyuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cung was deſired fully to inform with an open heart, wherein he apprehended the Indians had been defrauded by the Proprietaries, to which he anſwered that he would to-morrow; but they muſt firſt clean up the blood, (as he expreſſed it) and bury the dead bodies: Next day being again met,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:016223_0189_0F9BD31457356FD0"/>
the King ſaid, "that according to his word, he had now met ſome of the ſeveral nations to do what they could for ſettling peace; but now in the firſt place he had ſeen, and conſidered the black cloud that hung over the land, the blood and bodies of the people who had ſuffered," and then ſaid, "I have gathered up the ſtained leaves, the blood and dead bodies, and looked round about, when all ſeemed terrible, that I could find no place to hide them; but looking up, I ſaw the great and good Spirit above; let us heartily join in prayer to him, that he may give us power to bury all theſe things out of our ſight, that neither the evil ſpirit, nor any wicked perſon may ever be able to raiſe them; that we may love like brethren, and the ſun may ſhine clear upon us, that we, our wives, our young men and children may rejoice in a laſting peace, that we may eat the fruits of the earth, and they may do us good, ſo that we may enjoy peace in the day time, and at night lay down and ſleep in it." Gave a belt of ſeventeen rows of wampum.</p>
               <p>By another belt he told the Governor, that he took him by one hand, and the five nations of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians and their allies took him by the other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid he, let us all ſtand as one man, with one heart and one mind, and join in this good work of peace. When we intend to lift or remove a great weight, we muſt be ſtrong, if all do not exert themſelves we can never do it; but if all heartily join, it is eaſy to remove it, our forefathers did not proceed right when they met together, they looked at the earth and things preſent, which will ſoon paſs out of our ſight; but did not look forward to the good of poſterity. Let us ſet out right, and do better than they did, that a peace may be ſettled which may laſt to our children.</p>
               <p>He next acquainted the Governor, that one of the meſſengers who had gone on a late meſſage
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:016223_0190_0F9BD31585E6A2A8"/>
to the Indians a far off, (meaning Moſes Tatamy's ſon) was ſhot on his return by one of our young men, and lay in a dangerous condition; and by a ſtring of wampum inſiſted, that if he died, the other ſhould be tried by our law, and ſuffer death alſo; and that ſome of their people ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to be able to inform the other nations of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the juſtice done. He alſo revived the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient agreement, that if any of them ſhould commit the like offence, the criminal ſhould be delivered up to be tried according to our laws, and ſuffer death in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>On fourth day there was no public treaty, things ſeemed in much confuſion and very dull; but friends kept quiet; the next day I found myſelf much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and therefore thought it beſt to leave Eaſton before the treaty ended; but before I left it friends had a ſolemn opportunity together, at which time I thought I ſaw, that the working of the dark revengeful ſpirit, which oppoſed the meaſures of peace, was one reaſon why friends were ſo baptized into diſtreſs and ſuffering, of which I made ſome mention to friends, and that if they kept quiet, the clouds as to them would ſomewhat break away; Daniel Stanton had a ſolemn time in ſupplication. After this meeting taking leave of friends, I rode to Richland, and tho' my diſtemper increaſed and I was very ill, I purſued my journey the next day, and the day following reached Philadelphia, where I was carefully attended through a time of tedious and cloſe affliction, my dear wife coming to me in my illneſs was alſo taken with the ſame diſorder, that we were not able to move homewards until the twenty-third of the eighth month, but through the goodneſs of kind providence in ſupporting us, got to our own habitation the next day in the evening, where after about a week's ſtay I ſet out again to attend the meeting for ſufferings in Philadelphia,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:016223_0191_0F9BD315992F7E98"/>
and tho' very weak, got there, after tarrying part of three days in town, went forward in order to attend the monthly-meetings in Bucks County, of which I had a view while I lay ſick, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me the way to recover my ſtrength was to be faithful to every diſcovery of duty; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in company with ſeveral other friends appointed by the yearly-meeting, I viſited the ſeveral monthly meetings in that county, in ſome of which a good degree of the Divine preſence being felt, was cauſe of thankfulneſs; tho' at one of them we had ſome remarkable cloſe work, both in the time of worſhip and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Returning to Philadelphia I perceived myſelf much recovered, ſpent five days there attending meetings as they came in courſe; and then went to Newtown meeting in Cheſter County, which was ſmall, there being an evident ſlackneſs of attending week day meetings; from thence I went to Uwch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, to the marriage of William Trimble and Phebe Thomas, which was a good meeting, where I met my dear wife on her way to the yearly-meeting at Philadelphia; and after attending a meeting at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, we went into the city the next evening; our friends Thomas Gawthrop, Samuel Spavold, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Reckitt and others from Great Britain, alſo Thomas Nicholſon from North-Carolina, were at this yearly-meeting, which was large and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, holding from the ſeventeenth to the twenty-fourth of the ninth month, 1757.</p>
               <p>Here I may note, that before I left home to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the late Indian treaty at Eaſton: In my ſleep I thought I was riding Eaſtward in the twilight, and ſaw a light before me towards fun-riſing, which did not appear to be a common light, but ſoon obſerved the appearance of ſomething therein, whereat the beaſt that I rode was much affrighted and would have ran from it, which I knew would be in vain;
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:016223_0192_0F9BD31643C65AB8"/>
for I took it to be an Angel, whoſe motion was as ſwift as thought, ſo rather ſtopt and reined in my beaſt towards it; it was encompaſſed with a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs like a rainbow, with a large looſe garment of the ſame colour down to the feet; it rather ſeemed to move even along than to walk, and then ſtood ſtill in the midſt of many curious ſtacks of corn; it was of a human form about ſeven feet high (as I thought,) and ſmiling on me, aſked where I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I ſaid towards yonder building, which I thought was an elegant one directly before me; it ſeemed to approve my way and vaniſhed upwards. Then I awakened and had particularly to remember the complexion of this angelic apparition, which was not much different from one of the Indians clean waſhed from his greaſe and filth; remembering my dream very freſh, when I had ſeen the Indians at the treaty, and had heard ſome matters remarkably ſpoken by ſome particulars of them, I was made to believe it was not unreaſonable to conclude, that the Lord was in them by his good Spirit, and that all colours were equal to him, who gave life and being to all mankind; we ſhould therefore be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to examine deeper than the outward appearance, with a tender regard to ſtation and education, if we deſire to be preſerved from error in judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The following Sentences being delivered in two of his public teſtimonies, were ſoon after committed to writing by a friend who was preſent, and appearing worthy to be further preſerved are now communicated, —viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a firſt day meeting at Eaſt Nottingham the nineteenth of the twelfth month 1756, he expreſſed nearly as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I felt my mind in this meeting remarkably drawn from outward obſervation, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:016223_0193_0F9BD3174D9566D8"/>
to center in deep and awful ſilence, wherein there was ſuch a flowing of good will to mankind, as is ſcarcely to be uttered by tongue; but thus centering with diligent attention, I thought I felt a ſtrong power of darkneſs and ſtupid ignorance, ſeemingly combined to make war againſt this ſolemn attention of mind; yet after patiently waiting ſome time, to my comfort I felt a ſecret victory, and the darkneſs vaniſhed: Then, a voice was uttered in me attended (I thought) with Divine authority thus, <hi>I will bow the inhabitants of the earth, and particularly of this land, and I will make them fear and reverence me, either in mercy or in judgment;</hi> hereupon a proſpect immediately opened to my view of a day of calamity and ſore diſtreſs which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and in which the careleſs and ſtupid profeſſors, who are eaſy, and not concerned to properly worſhip and adore the almighty, and have not laboured to witneſs their foundation to be laid on him the immoveable Rock, will be greatly ſurpriſed with fearfulneſs; and on the behalf of ſuch, a piercing cry and lamentation ran through me, thus, <hi>Alas for the day! Alas for the day! Woe is me!</hi> (ſeveral times repeated) and a voice which ſeemed to be connected with the foregoing, ſaid further, yet once more faith the Lord, I ſhake not the earth only but alſo heaven: Not only the ſituation of thoſe that know not any place of ſafety or refuge, that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and earthly; but alſo thoſe who aſſume a higher place and in their ſpecious appearances and falſe pretences amongſt men, do value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on their aſſumed goodneſs, and would fain be accounted of the higheſt rank, and even place themſelves among the ſaints, and are by ſome accounted as ſtars in the firmament; yet in the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:016223_0194_0F9BD317D91831C0"/>
day of my power wherein I will ſhake the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and the earth, thoſe ſtars ſhall fall to the ground.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the opening, ſomething within me was ready to ſay, amen ſo be it, O Lord Almighty, cut ſhort thy work in the earth, in order that thou may'ſt put an end to ſin, and finiſh tranſgreſſion, that thy fear, and the knowledge of thee, may cover the earth, as the waters cover the ſea. Wherefore, my friends, the fervent deſire of my ſoul is, that all preſent may with diligence la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have your minds truly centred and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before God, to know a being fixed on that foundation which only ſtandeth ſure, that in a time of outward diſtreſs, which perhaps may come in your day, ye may find a place of ſafety and refuge.</q>
All which with more to the like effect, was delivered in great humility and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>At a week day meeting at the ſame place, the ſeventeenth of the ſecond month 1757, ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by unſeaſonable coming in had interrupted the quiet of the meeting, he gave a ſuitable caution in that reſpect, in gentle winning terms, reminding thoſe met of the awfulneſs and ſolemnity which ſhould attend us when we approach the preſence of him who is moſt Holy; and in what reverence, fear and care, we ought to come together, not forgetting the hour appointed; and then expreſſed nearly as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A certain ſentence has been preſented to the view of my mind, which ſeemed to contain a gentle engaging caution, and matter of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, attended with ſweetneſs; which was, <hi>Work while it is day.</hi> Friends, this is our day, wherein we ought to be diligent and induſtrious, in the light of the day we may ſee, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:016223_0195_0F9BD31DECA71378"/>
how to work, and what to do, that at the concluſion we may obtain from the Maſter of the day, who dwelleth in Light, the anſwer of well done; for the night will come, wherein no man can work: We are now favoured with liberty in this our day, to aſſemble together for worſhip unmoleſted; and my hearty deſire is, that we may properly improve this mercy; for the time to ſome of us may come, before our day in this life is cloſed, wherein this priviledge, may in ſome meaſure be taken from us; ſomething in me would be ready to ſay, The Lord forbid that ſhould be the caſe; but by reaſon of the great declenſion which has overſpread the church, I hardly dare to expect any other: Oh may we therefore be careful to prize the mercy of God, and endeavour to gain an inheritance in the light, that when night overtakes, and darkneſs as to the outward may hang over us, we may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to withdraw into the ſure hiding place, and know a quiet habitation!</q>

proceed on my ſervice, I acquainted our monthly-meeting at Nottingham, with whoſe concurrence I left home on the third of the twelfth month 1757, accompanied by a near relation, and attended Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by meeting on firſt day, wherein tho' life and the power of Truth ſeemed to be low, I thought the humble waiters were encouraged; we went to the evening meeting in Philadelphia, next morning at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the meeting of miniſters and elders, and the day following a meeting at the Bank, alſo a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſufferings, and on fourth day returned to Darby to their monthly-meeting, where we found friends under a ſtrait about diſowning one among them, who denied the Divinity of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; on whom they had bellowed much labour to convince him of his error, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended well; the company of the friends who attended it being acceptable and of ſervice: We were next day at Haverford monthly-meeting held at Radnor, where the lively exerciſe of the discipline appeared to be very low, yet I was glad I was there; during the time of the buſineſs, feeling a concern on my mind to appoint a meeting at Haverford to be held the next day, I propoſed it for concurrence, which being readily agreed to, we attended there accordingly, and had a large meeting much to ſatisfaction, having great peace in obſerving the motion of truth reſpecting this appointment; on the following day accompanied by my friend Hugh Evans, I viſited ſome ancient friends, who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of old age and indiſpoſition could not get out to meetings, wherein I was favoured with that peace, which I have often experienced to attend the acceptable work of viſiting the afflicted: On firſt day after a ſatisfactory meeting at Merrion, I went to the evening meeting in Philadelphia, in which truth favoured with a degree of openneſs, to the inſtruction and comfort of many: On third

day afternoon, accompanied by my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown, went forward to Richland monthly-meeting held on the fifth day, where we had ſome cloſe hard work, which generally happens when a life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs formal ſpirit hath the prevalence in managing the affairs of the church, for want of feeling after and waiting for the true authority, even the power of God, yet we were glad tnat we were there; from thence my brother returned home, the reſt of us going to an appointed meeting at Plumſtead, which tho' the weather was ſeverely cold, was large and comfortable, in the ſenſe whereof we were thankful to the author of all good; the meeting next day at Buckingham was ſmall but ſatisfactory; I have often obſerved, that the ſeverity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not a ſufficient excuſe for the Lord's panting children to neglect public worſhip, which is a duty incumbent on us and due to his glorious name; at Wrightſtown meeting the next day the maſter of our Aſſemblies was pleaſed to appear in an eminent manner, to the comfort of the poor, inſtruction of the enquirers, rebuke of the backſliders, and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of many; for which the ſacrifice of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiſe was offered to him, who alone is worthy for ever; after this meeting I felt the value of that peace, which by the humble is better felt than expreſſed: We had next a good meeting at Makefield, at which were many ſeeking tender young people; then attended the Falls preparative meeting, which was ſatisfactory, a comfortable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of unity ſubſiſting among friends; our next meeting was at Briſtol, in which after a dark diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing time in ſilence, what I had to communicate was introduced by a queſtion thus, <hi>Are you found in faith and practice?</hi> and I was led to ſet forth, "that to profeſs and acknowledge even ſacred Truths, without a life of ſelf-denial with an anſwerable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt conduct, was no way ſufficient; that being a
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:016223_0198_0F9BCF39D7E176E0"/>
dead faith, which produceth not good works in him who faith he believeth; ſhewing what ſtumbling blocks, the nominal profeſſors are, who by their example plainly manifeſt, that they are not poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of what they profeſs to have, and are the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies the truth hath, which I was doubtful was the caſe with ſome among them;" I had peace in this plain dealing; our next was a laborious meeting at Byberry, yet yielded a degree of the ſame peace; a friend afterwards told me that the Hate of the meeting was clearly ſpoken to, which I relate not for any praiſe to man; but that it was an additional confirmation of the Lord's ſufficiency to his own work, and when we are weak, fooliſh or contemptible in our own eſteem, his ſtrength appears, and his wiſdom inſpires with true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby he magnifieth himſelf; we went home with our friend James Thornton and next day to Horſham, where was a large and good meeting, after which we had a comfortable time in the family of John Cadwalader; next day we attended the monthly-meeting at Abington in company with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Eaſtburn and Joſeph White; we found things low here, becauſe of a want of that ſtrength in which ſtands the authority of the church; it is only the pure wiſdom from above, that preſerves friends in peace, meekneſs, gentleneſs, and unanimity in the diſtribution of right juſtice and judgment in the church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We were next day at Gwynedd monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was a precious time through the power of that ſacred name, which is as ointment poured forth, the favour whereof continued thro' both worſhip and diſcipline, in which the faithful were mutually comforted; we from thence went to Ellen Evans's, and had an evening-meeting, ſome of the neighbours coming in, ſeveral friends were much
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:016223_0199_0F9BCF3A8FA7A8F0"/>
enlarged in counſel, and the opportunity ended in ſolemn prayer and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>We went from thence to Exeter monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ended to ſatisfaction in the main; then home with our friend Ellis Hugh, where Joſeph White and Sam<hi rend="sup">l.</hi> Eaſtburn left us to return home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; my companion and I proceeding to Reading, had a public meeting in the Court-houſe, which I thought was pretty well conſidering the company, many looſe people attending; but Truth ſeemed to come into dominion and quieted them, that the meeting ended in a degree of awful ſweetneſs; On firſt day, being alſo the firſt of the new-year 1758, we were at Maiden Creek meeting, which altho' a low time, afforded peace and comfort, from a proſpect that there were among the youth in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſome true branches of the vine of Life, who therefore could not be ſatisfied without the living ſap from the Holy root, and in the Lord's time would be favoured therewith, if there was a patient waiting for that ſpringing ſeaſon; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Reading that evening, to a meeting held by appointment at a friend's houſe for the members of our ſociety in that town, in the attendance of which I found peace; croſſing the river Schuylkill we were next day at Robinſon or the Foreſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after which I was much humbled in a ſenſe of the great condeſcention and mercy of the Lord our God, who was pleaſed to renew the reaches of his power to ſeveral, who had many years made profeſſion of the pure Truth, and yet dwelt in that which is impure, as drinking to exceſs and other evils, ſome of whom I knew, but did not know that they were there till the meeting was over; the weak were ſtrengthened and the humble ſeekers encouraged, and great love flowed towards the youth: Returning again over Schuylkill we went to
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:016223_0200_0F9BCF3B8461AC70"/>
that called Evans's meeting, which was very open for doctrine, ſeveral not of our ſociety being preſent: The firſt ſentences that appeared in my view were, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> attended with ſuch weakneſs, and ſuch a ſenſe of my own fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs and inability for handling that ſubject, that I was afraid, becauſe I had a ſecret apprehenſion that ſome would incline to make an advantage of thoſe words, <hi>but few are choſen,</hi> in applying them to ſtrengthen themſelves in the corrupt manner in which they hold election; but it appeared that the words, <hi>all have not obeyed,</hi> was the reaſon why ſo few are choſen: My mouth was opened in fear, even to trembling, yet with a ſecret hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that the Lord would, be mouth and wiſdom, with deſires that he would bind my attention to his own immediate inſtruction, that the language of his Spirit might be only uttered by me, and he was pleaſed to magnify his own Truth in the opening of theſe paſſages: I give this hint, that they who are concerned in the miniſtry may humbly truſt in God, and not lean to their fears, knowledge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or wiſdom, in opening the myſteries of the Goſpel, but confide in the key of David, which when it opens none can ſhut. Next day we were at Providence or Perkiomin meeting, which tho' poor, and truth low, peace was afterwards meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably enjoyed, from an evidence of having been honeſt according to the ability given; and the day following at Plymouth, faithful friends were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in the gracious condeſcention of our holy head, who was pleaſed to favour with the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the life and love of Truth; we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Philadelphia with thankful hearts for the evidence of peace.</p>
               <p>My companion returning home, I went in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with my brother on firſt day morning to Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, having felt an engagement for a conſiderable
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:016223_0201_0F9BCF3C0E758DA8"/>
time to viſit that meeting; a ſenſe of the declenſion of friends in this place, both in reſpect to numbers and the life of religion, was cauſe of heavineſs of heart, but having performed my viſit in faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to ability, returned with a degree of peace to the evening meeting in the city, which was comfortable, ſtaying there until the fifth day of the week, in which time I attended the uſual meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, one with the Negroes much to ſatisfaction, and alſo the meeting for ſufferings I got ſafe home on ſeventh day the fourteenth of the firſt month, having travelled in this journey about four hundred and ten miles.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſecond of the ſecond month, I again left home in order to attend the quarterly-meeting at Burlington, and ſome particular meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in New-Jerſey, as well on account of the year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting's appointment, as my own ſenſe of duty, of which I had the approbation of our monthly-meeting ſignified by a minute; in my way I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the monthly-meeting in Philadelphia with ſome degree of ſatisfaction; then taking Cheſter or Adam's meeting in New-Jerſey, reached Burling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on firſt day evening, the next day being the quarterly-meeting, at which with William Horne and my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown I had ſome ſervice; after ſtaying the youth's meeting, they left me and I went to a meeting on fourth day at a School-houſe, where ſeveral friends met, alſo divers others who perhaps had not been at any place of worſhip for ſometime, and were eaſy about religion, to whom it became my concern to ſhew how diſagreeable and loathſome that ſtate was, from Rev. iii. 15. <hi>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; ſo then, becauſe thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth.</hi>" It opened to me that a lukewarm condition, to hold a profeſſion of religion ſo as to take it ill not to be thought a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:016223_0202_0F9BCF3CCF109528"/>
but at the ſame time to remain eaſy and not in earneſt to experience the life, virtue, and power of chriſtianity; not ſo cold as to forget the name, nor ſo hot or zealous as to witneſs the life of true religion, was very diſpleaſing to the Almighty. A good degree of power attended the opening, and in treating on that paſſage, with much love to ſuch lukewarm profeſſors, which reached and tendered ſeveral beyond expectation; but no praiſe to man, tho' he may will or run, but to God who ſheweth mercy.</p>
               <p>At Cheſterfield monthly-meeting my friend John Woolman met me the next day; a raw company attending on account of a propoſal or two for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which I ſuppoſe they expected to be there preſented; it was a time ſomewhat low and diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The advice of the yearly-meeting not being here enough obſerved, which is againſt allowing ſuch who are not members of our ſociety to ſit in our meetings for diſcipline, unleſs they are nearly related to the parties concerned, of which that meeting was modeſtly reminded; I was alſo grieved that matters were introduced too much at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pleaſure of individuals, by reaſon that they are not in the practice of holding preparative meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ſervice of which, was particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their conſideration; I had ſome reward of peace in having attended this meeting: We were next at a meeting in Trenton with a few friends whom the ſpirit of the world (I thought) had much laid waſte; there ſeemed more oppenneſs towards a few of other ſocieties preſent, ſome of whom were tendered by Truth's teſtimony, which ſeemed to reach the witneſs in them; at Bordentown meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next day, many were made thankful, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence being felt among us; from hence J. Woolman returned home, and John Sykes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied me to Upper-Springfield, where the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:016223_0203_0F9BCF3F164F6D00"/>
was large, and through the Lord's mercy, open and ſatisfactory, the teſtimony of Truth flowing in his love towards the youth, many were tendered thereby, the faithful were encouraged and the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent warned; after which I went to Burlington to attend that monthly-meeting, then to the burial of Margaret Butcher at Mansfield, which was a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious painful meeting compoſed of a mixed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet ſomething of an evidence attended truth's teſtimony, ſo that the meeting ended with ſolidity; from thence I went to Peter Harvey's and was thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the enjoyment of a peaceful quiet mind, tho' poor; next day was at Old-Springfield meeting, which was ſlow and late in gathering, dull and heavy in ſitting, as will be the caſe, when and whereſoever the life and power of religion is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not carefully ſought after and waited for, by thoſe who profeſs it, which was obſerved to them in the love of truth, and in the ſimplicity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, ſo that I left this meeting with a heavy heart, not from a ſenſe of any omiſſion of duty on my part; but leſt they ſhould too ſoon forget what manner of perſons they ſaw themſelves to be in the Light, that diſcovers and anſwers the witneſs, as face anſwers face in a glaſs. Then taking meetings at Mountholly, Rancocus, and viſiting the widow of Peter Andrews, I was at a large meeting at Eveſham on firſt day following; but the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people being much outward, occaſioned a painful deep waiting a conſiderable time, or at leaſt I thought ſo, when at length I felt ſome preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on my mind to ſtand up, which as I followed carefully, Truth opened into the ſtate of the meeting to my admiration, that I was enabled therein with an innocent boldneſs to attend thereto in ſpeaking, which yielded me great peace after the meeting, and I was thankful for that opportunity. Next day I attended Haddonfield monthly-meeting, at which
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:016223_0204_0F9BCF3FD57A5A20"/>
were Samuel Nottingham and William Horne, whoſe company was comfortable and of advantage to the meeting. I then viſited the meetings at Pileſgrove, Alloways Creek, Greenwich, lower Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loways Creek, Salem, and one at Raccoon Creek, to which many ſober people came not profeſſing with us, alſo a large, and I believe to ſome a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory meeting at Woodberry, the ſtate whereof opened pretty clearly, the humble being inſtructed, but I was ſenſible of an oppoſition here to ſome part of what I had to deliver to a ſelf-righteous ſtate, yet through the mercy of our gracious Lord, I left this meeting with an evidence of peace, and an affectionate heart yearning towards them, then went to Haddonfield to attend the quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Glouceſter and Salem Counties, and from thence to the General Spring-meeting at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, after which I returned home, having been out five weeks and three days.</p>
               <p>After this journey I did not go much abroad for more than a year, except to attend our quarterly meeting, and the yearly and general Spring-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>In the year 1759, I had ſome drawings in my mind to viſit a few meetings in Maryland and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, alſo the yearly-meeting at Weſt-River; in which having the concurrence of our monthly-meeting, I left home on the twenty-eighth of the fifth month and next day was at Gunpowder meet-meeting; then at Elkridge with a few friends and divers not profeſſing with us, amongſt whom there was an openneſs to hear the teſtimony of Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; but for want of a ſteady walking in the profeſſors thereof, it ſeems in a great meaſure laid waſte; that night I lodged at the houſe of a kind man, but have to remark that natural affability in any one, unleſs it is ſweetened by the baptiſm of the Spirit of Truth, is of little value; on fifth day
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:016223_0205_0F9BCF409F22AC30"/>
I was at a new-meeting houſe at Indian Spring with a few friends, ſome of whom I fear, ſcarcely know what they profeſs, the next had a meeting at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Plummer's houſe at Patuxent to ſatisfaction, and on ſeventh day the yearly-meeting at Weſt-River began, which held until fourth day following, which was in the main the moſt open and ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meeting I was ever at in that place; I thought a diſpoſition rather prevailed among the younger ſort, to attend to the diſcipline more cloſely than in times paſt. Then taking a meeting at Sandy Spring, I proceeded to Fairfax, being about forty miles, where I had a comfortable meeting on firſt day, for which the hearts of many were made thankful to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good, the ſame day we had alſo a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory opportunity in Mahlon Janney's family, his mother being indiſpoſed, and the next day attended Monaquaſy meeting in Maryland, where truth is at a low ebb, through the conduct of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful profeſſors; our next was a precious meeting with a few ſincere friends at Buſh Creek, that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went to William Farquar's, having a meeting at Pipe Creek next day, which was pretty open, and ſatisfactory and one the day following at Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tapſco Foreſt amongſt a withered people. Alas! to profeſs the truth and not poſſeſs it in ſanctification of ſpirit, makes little meetings feel deſolate; from thence I returned home to our monthly-meeting, being abſent nineteen days and rode near three hundred and fifty miles, Samuel England being my companion.</p>
               <p>In this year I was alſo engaged with my friend John Woolman in viſiting ſome active members of our ſociety, who held ſlaves, firſt in the city of Philadelphia, and in other places; alſo in New-Jerſey, in which ſervice we were enabled to go through ſome heavy labours, and were favoured with peace; Divine Love in a tender ſympathy
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:016223_0206_0F9BCF4155F3ACB8"/>
prevailing at times, with a hope that theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would not be in vain.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond month 1760, I acquainted our monthly-meeting, that in order to proceed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the appointment of the yearly-meeting, having alſo a draught in my own mind, I had an inclination to viſit ſome meetings up the river Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, particularly the monthly-meeting of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in New-Jerſey, with which having the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of friends, I ſet out from home on the twenty-ſixth of the fifth month following, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bank meeting in Philadelphia the next day; from thence proceeded to the quarterly-meeting for Bucks County held at Buckingham, where tho' things were low, the affairs of the church were tranſacted in a good degree of amity and peace; it was a large meeting, there being a great appearance of young people, ſome very hopeful, who in the love of truth were exhorted to come up in their places, by learning diſcipline of the author thereof, viz. <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and they were cautioned againſt that very unbecoming and hurtful practice, tho' too common, of going out after worſhip, and ſtanding without in companies talking when they ſhould keep their places in the meeting, which ſhould quietly and ſolidly proceed on the buſineſs coming before it; heavenly love was felt by the tender in ſpirit, which I hope will be remembered by many; the next day the general or youth's-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was large, open and ſatisfactory in the main; for which the name of the Lord was praiſed. Next day I ſpent in viſiting a widow, alſo other aged and infirm friends, in the performance of which duty I had ſome ſatisfaction, and on firſt day was at Plumſtead meeting, which was large and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, the divine preſence being felt, the power of Truth prevailed to the tendering of many; but ſuch favour being not of him that willeth or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:016223_0207_0F9BCF4214252E48"/>
but of God that ſheweth mercy, to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the praiſe of all, who is worthly for ever. In the evening I attended a meeting at a School-houſe near Samuel Eaſtburn's, in which I had ſome particular ſervice, the ſtates of many preſent being very clearly opened before them in the love of the Goſpel, which made deep impreſſion on ſome who were much broken, and I believe it would be as dew on their hearts, if they would remain enough in the valley of humility.</p>
               <p>I was the next day at Buckingham monthly-meeting, which in the time of buſineſs ſuffered much by the prevalence of a talkative noiſy ſpirit, which mightily darkens counſel in thoſe who give way to it, and leads into doubtful and trifling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations; ſo that I left that meeting with pain of heart, in a ſenſe that the time had been ſo loſt that ſeveral weighty matters could not be brought under conſideration to advantage, which were therefore continued until the next month.</p>
               <p>Wrightſtown monthly-meeting on third day was more ſatisfactory, the ſpirit for diſcipline rather reviving, and I hope a deſire among the youth at leaſt for an improvement; it too frequently is the caſe, that ſome of the elderly ſort are ſo bigotted to their old forms and cuſtoms, that they will ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trouble themſelves to examine whether theſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are agreeable to the teſtimony of Truth, or whether through inattention they have not ſwerved and fallen ſhort in various matters that now occaſion a difficulty in the churches, which difficulties muſt be laboured under for a ſeaſon by the baptized members, who nevertheleſs, as they keep their places will grow ſtronger.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by my friend Thomas Roſs I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Falls monthly-meeting, wherein I was comforted from a ſenſe that a tender people were among them, tho' they felt a time of dearth, whom
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:016223_0208_0F9BCF42D265ABC8"/>
the Lord would in his own time water as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar heritage; but this comfort was heavily ballaſted from a ſecret fear attending me, that there were among them ſome, who like the heath in the deſert, know not when good cometh, ſuch who were eaſy in a dead form, and contented with a name, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting to wait for that transforming power, which would renew into the image and life of the Son of God; to whom in the love, and plainneſs of the Goſpel, I was conſtrained to clear myſelf; the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for diſcipline was pretty open and ended in a good degree of ſweetneſs; we went home with the wife of Joſeph White, who was then on a religious viſit to friends in Europe, and had a comfortable ſeaſon in the family with the children, ſhe appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reſigned in the abſence of her huſband, her ſpirit being ſweetened with the truth in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent quietude.</p>
               <p>At Middletown monthly-meeting the next day truth ſeemed to be low, but we had ſome ſervice in the diſcipline, that I came away with peace, and the day following in company with Joſhua Ely went to Jacob Birdſhal's in Amwell townſhip New-Jerſey, and had a meeting in his barn, which being a wet time) was ſmall; there are few here who profeſs with us, ſome of whom ſeem to have nothing more than the name. Next morning we called at the houſe of an old profeſſor, he and his wife were both ancient but full of talk; I felt a deſire to viſit them, and had a full time to clear myſelf in a cloſe and plain manner, tho' in love to them. After which going to Kingwood or Bethlehem attended two meetings there on firſt day, when truth favoured in opening the ſtates of the people in mercy to many, which may be of advantage if rightly remembered; then proceeding to the Drowned-lands ſo called, had there a meeting with a few profeſſors who ſeemed too much withered, then taking another at Paulin's
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:016223_0209_0F9BCF43944CA3D8"/>
Kiln to pretty good ſatisfaction, returned to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood monthly-meeting than held at Hardwick; ſeveral hopeful young people belong thereto, the meeting was comfortable, friends rejoicing in the company one of another, and in the Lord for his merciful regard; next day I returned to Bethlehem, and from thence to Gwynedd meeting on firſt day, after which I rode to Uwchlan, about twenty-eight miles, from thence home, where I found all well, having been abſent three weeks and rode about four hundred and ſixteen miles in this journey.</p>
               <p>Having a draught of love and a motion therein to viſit the monthly and particular meetings within our own quarter, on the Weſt ſide of Suſquehanna river, with the concurrence of our monthly-meeting on that occaſion, I ſet out from home on the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the tenth month in company with my brother-in-law James Brown, who likewiſe had the approbation of Goſhen monthly-meeting for this purpoſe; we viſited the meetings at Pipe Creek, Buſh Creek and Monaquaſy in Maryland, in the firſt of which the Lord was pleaſed to favour in opening the ſtate of friends to the tendering the hearts of many; the other was ſatisfactory, and the laſt ſeemed to be a renewed viſitation to a raw declining people, ſeveral of whom were tendered through the gracious long-ſuffering of Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we were next at the preparative meeting at Fairfax in Virginia; then at Gooſe Creek, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in truth owned our ſervice to the comfort of the faithful; we then attended the meeting of miniſters and elders, alſo the monthly-meeting at Fairfax, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the firſt day meeting there, and one that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Francis Hague's houſe, whoſe wife was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; ſeveral diſorderly walkers being preſent, the Lord was pleaſed to open, and give ability to ſpeak to their ſtates in a meaſure of his heart tendering love, to the reaching the witneſs in ſome; after this
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:016223_0210_0F9BCF4452022B20"/>
returning to the widow Janney's, we had a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opportunity with her and children to our mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Our next meeting was at Potts's near the South-mountain, which was open for doctrine, ſeveral of other religious profeſſions attending, who appeared loving and well ſatisfied; then at Crooked-run, near the North-branch of Shanandoa-river, in company with ſeveral other friends from Pennſylvania, ſome of us being a committee appointed by our quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, the friends living here having requeſted to have a meeting ſettled among them; the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was to ſome ſatisfaction, there being ſome young people who I hope will grow in the truth, tho' ſome of thoſe who are elderly appear too ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial. From hence we went to Hopewell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative meeting, alſo to a ſmall meeting over the mountain near Jeſſe Pugh's, then we attended a ſelect meeting at Hopewell, and at the ſame place on firſt day, which was large and ſolid, many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being much tendered, to the praiſe of the Lord whoſe mercy endureth for ever; in the evening we had alſo a ſatisfactory meeting at the widow Lup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's near Wincheſter. Next day we were at Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well monthly-meeting, where we found conſiderable weakneſs, as to the practice of the diſcipline, on which account we had ſome labour to the comfort of the well-minded; on our return we had meetings at Monallan, Huntington, Warrington, and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry in York County Pennſylvania, and a ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity with friends in Yorktown, from whence I proceeded home with a thankful mind, having travelled about four hundred miles in this journey.</p>
               <p>In the ſpring of the year 1761, having an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement on my mind to viſit Barbadoes and ſome of the adjacent Iſlands, I propoſed the ſame to my brethren at home for their weighty conſideration
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:016223_0211_0F9BCF4510CB0E98"/>
before I aſked for their certificate, who after a time expreſſed their unity therewith, and gave me a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, to which the quarterly-meeting ſignified their approbation; at our next yearly-meeting I laid my concern before the miniſters and elders when for any thing that appeared, I had their unity and prayers; I came home intending to proceed before the winter ſat in, and attended our general meeting at Nottingham in the tenth month, but in a few days after was taken ill with a fever, which with bodily pain and exerciſe of mind reduced me to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low and weak ſtate; <note n="*" place="bottom">See page 208.</note> but the Lord was pleaſed to give me inward ſtrength, influencing my mind with love to all men, and great love to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our religious ſociety, the ſtate whereof I ſaw in a clear manner, and I ſo far recovered as to attend our quarterly-meeting at London Grove in the eleventh month, at which I had an opportunity to clear myſelf to my humble admiration, and was inwardly comforted: Soon after which (my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for going to Barbadoes continuing,) I went to Philadelphia to inquire for a paſſage, when my friends informed me of five veſſels, three of which were near ready to ſail; but underſtanding that all of them were prepared with guns for defence, I felt a ſecret excerciſe on my mind, ſo that I could not go to ſee any of them; but kept quiet from ſixth day evening until ſecond day morning, when I went to the meeting of miniſters and elders, where I had a ſingular freedom to let friends know, "That I came to town in order to take my paſſage for Barbadoes, but found myſelf not at liberty to go in any of thoſe veſſels, becauſe they carried arms for defence; for as my motive in going, was to publiſh <hi>the Glad-tidings of the Goſpel, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth love to all men,</hi> I could not go with thoſe who were prepared to deſtroy men, whom Chriſt Jeſus our Lord and Maſter laid down his life to ſave and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:016223_0212_0F9BCF45CF40D8A0"/>
deliver from that ſpirit in which wars and fightings ſtand." I further added, "If I had a concern to viſit in goſpel love, thoſe now living at Pittſburgh or Fort Duqueſne, do you think it would become me to go along with a band of ſoldiers, as if I wanted the arm of fleſh to guard me; would it not be more becoming to go with a few ſimple unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men? I now tenderly deſire your ſympathy and advice." One honeſt friend ſaid, "Keep to the tender ſcruple in thy own mind, for it rejoices me to hear it; and ſeveral ſaid, they believed it would be beſt for me to mind my own freedom." I then begged that friends would conſider weightily, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was right for any profeſſing with us, to be owners or part owners, charterers, freighters, or inſurers of ſuch veſſels that a friend could not be free to go paſſenger in on a goſpel meſſage: And as I returned to my lodgings, I felt ſo much peace of mind in thus bearing my teſtimony, that I thought if all my concern ended therein, it was worth all my trouble, tho' at that time I did not think it would, yet was quite eaſy to return home and wait until my way appeared more open; and as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern went off in this manner, I have been ſince led to conſider, that I could not have borne that teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſo fully and feelingly, if I had not been thus reſtrained. <hi>The wiſdom and judgments of the Lord are unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out, and happy are they who move at his command and ſtand ſtedfaſt in his counſel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our worthy friends John Stephenſon, Robert Proud, Hannah Harris and Elizabeth Wilkinſon of Great Britain being in this country on a religious viſit, attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia this year, which was large and favoured with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling goodneſs, and in a ſenſe of the Divine preſence that meeting ended very ſolidly; the ſervices of theſe friends, I think, have been great among us in
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:016223_0213_0F9BCF46910A80C8"/>
this Land, both in their public miniſtry, alſo in the diſcipline of the church, and the remembrance thereof is precious I believe to many whom the Lord is preparing for his work.</p>
               <p>After this I ſpent a conſiderable time at and near home, except attending the quarterly, yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and the general ſpring-meetings as they came in courſe, in the mean time being careful to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the meeting I belonged to.</p>
               <p>A new monthly-meeting being allowed to be eſtabliſhed at Uwchlan in Cheſter County, it aroſe in my mind to ſalute friends there with an Epiſtle, a copy whereof I ſent to their firſt meeting in the firſt month 1763, being as follows.</p>

                     <p>IN the gentle ſpringing up of Goſpel love and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip I ſalute you my dear brethren and ſiſters, and hereby let you know, that it is my fervent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and prayer that you may individually attend to the gift of God in your own hearts, and therein wait for the ariſing of his pure life and power, that therein and thereby only, the affairs of the church may be tranſacted to the honour of Truth and your own peace and ſafety; for to ſpeak in the church to the buſineſs and affairs of truth, by the will, wiſdom, and power of man, (however knowing he thinks himſelf) will lead into it's own nature, and in the end miniſter ſtrife and contention, and break the unity of the one ſpirit wherein the peace of the church ſtands. Wherefore I beſeech you beware thereof, and as I know there are among you ſuch whom the Lord by his ſpirit and the gentle operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his power, is preparing for his own work; mind your calling in deep humility and holy atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoul; for in your obedience only, will you be elected and choſen to the work whereunto he

May each of you ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in your own lots in the regeneration, waiting for the pouring forth of the ſpirit and anointing of of the Holy Ghoſt, by the renewing whereof, a true qualification is given in the influence of the love of the Father, rightly to overſee the flock and family of our God, amongſt whom there are ſome plants with you worthy of your care.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould have been glad to have ſat with you, in your monthly-meeting, from the ſenſe of that love which I now renewedly feel to ſpring and flow towards you, but cannot well leave home, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this time, in the pure refreſhing ſtream thereof again ſalute you, and remain your friend and brother,</p>

                  <hi>In the time of his illneſs in the year</hi> 1761, <hi>as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in page</hi> 205, <hi>he uttered divers weighty expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome of which were committed to writing by a friend who was preſent, and being well worthy to be further preferred are here inſerted,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>In this ſickneſs he was reduced very low, and ſometimes ſaid it looked unlikely that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, in the forepart thereof he often mentioned his being in great poverty of ſpirit ſaying, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was taken ill, he felt ſuch deep diſtreſs of mind, that he thought he was a cumber to the ground, and ſcarcely worthy to partake of the meaneſt neceſſaries of life, that even bread and water ſeemed too good for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:016223_0215_0F9BCF48105409D8"/>On the fourth of the eleventh month, four friends being preſent, he ſpake in a very awful frame of mind nearly as follows,
<q>Such build on a ſandy foundation who refuſe paying that which is call<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the Provincial or King's Tax, only becauſe ſome others ſcruple paying it, whom they eſteem, yet I have now clearly ſeen, as well as heretofore that the teſtimony of Truth if deeply attended to, will not be found to unite with warlike mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: And that it will in the Lord's time be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above all oppoſition, and come to poſſeſs even the gates of it's enemies; though it may appear mean and contemptible in the eyes of ſome now a days, as the conduct of our primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive friends did, in divers reſpects in the world's view: And whoſoever continues to trample upon, or deſpiſe the tender ſcruples of their brethren in relation to their clearneſs concerning war, will certainly find it a weight too heavy for them to bear.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>My teſtimony on this account ſo far as I have borne it, yields me ſatisfaction at this time; and the painful ſteps I have taken on ſundry occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in publick and private to diſcharge my conſcience in the ſight of God, in giving faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful warnings to my brethren and countrymen, both in a civil and religious capacity, afford me comfort in this diſtreſſing ſeaſon. I have clearly ſeen, and the proſpect at this time adds Divine ſtrength to my ſoul, That the God of Truth is determined in due time to exalt the mountain of his Holineſs above all the hills of an empty profeſſion; and all ſuch who ſhall be admitted as clean inhabitants thereon, he wills them to be quite clean handed; and that they ſhould become ſubject to the Lamb's Nature in every reſpect, and not ſhake hands with that
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:016223_0216_0F9BCF48D016A700"/>
nature which would tear and devour, nor in any ſhape contribute to the price of blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At another time he ſaid,
<q>I have been led in the preſent diſpenſation allotted me, to behold the ſituation of divers particular friends, to whom I feel ardent affection, who ſeem to have given, or ſold away for this worlds friendſhip, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony they ſhould have born for the Prince of Peace, who is the High Prieſt of our profeſſion; and for fear of breaking an outſide unity, which will ſurely come to be broken, that the true uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the bond of peace may be exalted, have acted contrary to the former ſight of their duty, and are thereby become halt, and dimſighted in ſeveral reſpects; ſuch, though they ſtill ſeem to deſire it, cannot attain to the ſpotleſs beauty of Truth, nor approach to the top of the mountain; on whoſe account I am afraid, that ſome of them will never recover their former ſtrength, nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that dignity the truth would have placed upon them, if they had been faithful; the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whom I have bewailed with anxiety of mind: I have been from my youth up accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſorrow, and am a man acquainted with grief, and now remarkably; the lives of my brethren, and of all men appear exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in my ſight. It looks doubtful whether I ſhall ever ſee my friends met in a quarterly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again, yet if it be the will of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I much deſire it; having heretofore thro' a timerous diſpoſition, leſt I ſhould offend ſome, and for fear of the frowns of elder brethren, concealed ſome things I ſhould have declared: And if I ſhould now never more have a publick opportunity, I ſpeak thus in your hearing, to let it be known that I am ſtill a well-wiſher to all men, and that my integrity to the teſtimony of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:016223_0217_0F9BCF4990D56708"/>
Truth, againſt all connections with wars and fighting, is now full as ſtrong, or ſtronger than ever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On ſecond day morning the ninth of the eleventh month, he ſaid to his effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>I have been led to ſee the neceſſity there is for friends to beware of the cuſtom of drinking drams, or ſtrong ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits mixed; I have for many years rarely taken any, except on particular occaſions, and then but a very ſmall quantity: It is my judgment, that the leſs any of us accuſtom ourſelves to the uſe of thoſe ſpirits, the better it would be for our conſtitutions in general; I believe it is not conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the will of Divine Providence, that the courſe of nature ſhould be obſtructed and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our animal ſpirits corrupted through the unnatural warmth of ſpirituous liquors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>From my preſent ſenſe and feeling of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular temperance which is truly pleaſing in the Eyes of Heaven, I have mourned that the uſe of ſtrong drink ſhould become ſo prevalent amongſt us who make ſo high a profeſſion; whoſe bodies ſhould be temples of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſhould not be defiled, or tainted with any degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance: In harveſt there is generally plenty of other refreſhment, which would keep the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men as ſtrong, and as capable to perform hard labour: Witneſs the health and ſtrength of our fore-fathers in the firſt ſettlement of this country, when ſtrong liquors were very little uſed amongſt them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Alas! how dimneſs has overtaken us, when we compare ourſelves, and our practices with the temperance and moderation of our fore-fathers, and the early ſettlers of this Province! How ſumptuous now are the tables, how rich and coſtly the apparel, the diet, and the furniture, of many of our friends even in the country;
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:016223_0218_0F9BCF4A504A41F0"/>
but more eſpecially in the city! How is the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and plainneſs of Truth departed from, and pomp and ſplendid appearances taken their place! And how much coſt and time might be ſpared from needleſs things, and applyed to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſes, to the bettering of our country, and helping to turn away the judgment which hangs over us, in part occaſioned by theſe things.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I deſire that my grand children may be brought up in a plain ſimple way, accuſtomed to induſtry, and ſome uſeful buſineſs in the creation; not aiming at great eſtates, nor following others in that way; but give them uſeful learning, and rather chuſe huſbandry, and a plain calling for them in the country, than endeavour to promote them to ways of merchandize; for according to my obſervation from my youth up, the former is leſs dangerous, and leſs corrupting: I obſerved when I was in England, that ſome of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and wiſeſt men in a religious ſenſe, were brought up at the plough tail, or in ſome labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occupation; where the mind is leſs liable to be diverted from an awful ſenſe of the creator, than in an eaſy idle education: How many great men there are, whom I could name, whoſe way of living is mean and homely, in this world's account, ſo that they have little more than real neceſſity requires; and yet they are rich in the beſt ſenſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The next day, being aſked how he was, he ſaid nearly as follows,
<q>I have ſlept ſweetly, and ſeem much refreſhed, and tho' I feel myſelf very weak in body, I am full of Divine conſolation, having never before had ſuch proſpects of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things: It ſeems even as though my ſoul was united in chorus with glorifyed Saints and Angels both ſleeping and waking. I now believe I ſhall recover, and that this ſickneſs did not
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:016223_0219_0F9BCF4B19860EC0"/>
happen to me altogether on my own account; my way to recover is to be induſtrious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in what I believe is required of me; I have many meſſages to deliver, both in publick, and privately to divers friends, whom I have ſeen to have miſſed their way, and have in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deprived themſelves of the beauty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with an humble abiding in the truth would have dignifyed them; and ſome of my elder brethren, for whom I feel an uncommon nearneſs of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their lives never appeared to be more near to me, and I dare not conceal counſel from them, whether they will hear or forbear: Yea, I thought laſt night, I had a clear proſpect of the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many within the verge of our quarterly-meeting; it ſeemed as though the inward ſtates of particulars were opened to me in full view; the pure Life in the brightneſs of Religion never appeared to be more precious; an uncommon earneſtneſs attends my mind, for the recovery of the rebellious, hypocritical, and backſliding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of all ranks amongſt us: And if I get to our quarterly-meeting (which I believe I ſhall) and can have time allowed me when there, I have tidings, important tidings, as from a dying man, to many particulars: I have ſeen the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the three days, or the Prophets laying three days and three nights in the belly of the fiſh: A wicked and adulterous generation are now as well as formerly, ſeeking for a ſign to things ſpoken cloſely, but no ſign ſhall be given them, ſave the ſign of the Prophet Jonah: Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's ſufferings for mankind, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into the bowels of the earth prefigured that this followers muſt, after his pattern, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into Spiritual Baptiſm; that they may riſe again, freed from the dregs of nature, and from the corruptions of the creaturely paſſions, before
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:016223_0220_0F9BCF4D2D358838"/>
they can be qualified to ſee, and ſuitably to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to the ſtates of others. I have likewiſe ſeen the myſtery of Ezekiel's ſufferings, and bearing the ſins of the houſe of Iſrael for the ſpace of 390 days, which being accompliſhed, he was commanded to turn on the other ſide, and to bear the ſins of Judah forty days, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of that princely tribe, who ſhould have been as way-marks to others. My ſtate has been for ſeveral years paſt, my deep Baptiſms, and painful ſittings in our meetings, like bearing the rod of the wicked, in which diſpenſation I have been ſometimes ready to conclude with Elijah, that the altars were thrown down, and the Lord's Prophets ſlain, and I, a mean worthleſs ſervant left alone, and that my life was ſought alſo; I have now ſeen the uſe of thoſe diſpenſations to me, with the uſe of my late ſickneſs, whereby I am reduced to great weakneſs of body; that I might be as a ſign to this generation, and as with the mouth of a dying man, utter tidings without fear of giving offence; tidings which I have heretofore concealed, through a timerous diſpoſition. I have ſeen at this ſeaſon that the Lord hath preſerved a living number in Iſrael, who have not bowed the knee to Baal, or the god of this world, I have alſo ſeen the conditions of many who have worſhipped ſtrange gods; and the corruption even of ſome who have aſſumed the ſtation of miniſters in our ſociety, how they are deceived ſo far as to believe a lye; have ſeen lying viſions, and have cauſed the weak to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; they have been ſpeaking peace to the people as in the Lord's Name, when it was only a flaſh, or divination of their own brain, which has tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to corruption and putrefaction in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: And I have ſeen how that many little ones have laid groaning as under the burden and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:016223_0221_0F9BCF4D534A1470"/>
of theſe things, whoſe day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth near, when they ſhall be made by the Almighty, as bright ſtars in the firmament of his power; and thoſe who are corrupt, and ſettled on their lees, ſhall be puniſhed. In this diſpenſation I have abundantly witneſſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of that Peace and Love which paſſeth all underſtanding; neither my tongue nor capacity are able to ſet forth the bowels of compaſſion which I livingly feel to flow towards the whole bulk of mankind; and eſpecially to my brethren in profeſſion: Yea, it ſeems as though no affliction would be too great to endure for their ſakes, if it might be a means to have ſome of them (whoſe ſitutation I have now been led to behold as particulars) reſtored to their former greenneſs and ſpiritual health, from whence they have fallen, and dimneſs has overtaken them. And tho' my outward man ſeems almoſt waſted, my ſpirit is ſtrong in the Lord, and in the inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtrength of affection, I have found my ſpirit led from place to place over the country, to viſit the ſouls in priſon: Yea, I have beheld the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that precious morning, wherein corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be ſwept away from the church, and Righteouſneſs and Truth begin to flouriſh great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: The day ſeems to me to be at hand; and what if I ſay, I have a degree of faith that ſome of the children now born may live to ſee it: Through innocent boldneſs, my face now ſeems to be as braſs, and in the openings of the viſion of life, I think I could utter Goſpel Truths, and diſcover the myſtery of iniquity which I have ſeen, without fearing any mortal man: I may be raiſed to live a while longer, though to die now, would be a welcome releaſe to me: Yea, I could not deſire to live, but for the longings of ſoul, and pantings of heart which I feel towards the
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:016223_0222_0F9BCF4E11D5BC20"/>
precious ſeed in many whom I have now been led in ſpirit to viſit. I have beheld their ſituation to be as lumps, taken or cut-out from the bowels of their mother the earth, tho' much hidden from the view of mortals; and are tempering and faſhioning by the Divine Power, in different ſhapes, for divers uſes; and I have ſeen that the Potter's Power is ſufficient to pick out, and take away every gravel and little pebble of nature; many I have beheld in this ſituation, ſet by (as it were) out of ſight to dry, until all the damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and natural moiſture is removed from them: Not being yet fitted to undergo the operation of burning; but when properly prepared, and thoroughly dried, many will be brought to the fire, burned, and glazed, ſo that they may retain the liquor or wine of the kingdom with a ſweet taſte, without any degree of taint, or nauſeous ſmell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the twelfth of the eleventh month early in the morning, he ſpake to this purpoſe;
<q>I believe I muſt endeavour to go to our quarterly-meeting, (which began the fourteenth) although as to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſtrength I am very weak: There my mind is remarkably, ſleeping and waking; there I hope to be relieved of ſome things which ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main like a fire in my bones; I dare not forbear, I know it is the way for me to recover my ſtrength outwardly, and to be eaſed of that which is a heavy burden inwardly; I ſee I muſt go, and believe I ſhall recruit, and gain ſtrength every day,</q>
(which was the caſe accordingly.) He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid,
<q>My mind has for ſeveral days been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with an uncommon ſweetneſs, the like I never knew for ſo long together, with a ſucceſſion of ſoul-melting proſpects: I have freedom to relate what I had a ſight of this morning before day, as I lay in a ſweet ſlumber,</q>
(which was nearly in theſe
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:016223_0223_0F9BCF4ED7A3F8B0"/>

                  <q>I thought I ſaw Noah's Ark floating on the deluge, or flood, with Noah and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in it, and looking earneſtly at it, I beheld the window of the Ark, and ſaw Noah put out the dove; and I beheld her flying to and fro, for ſome time; but finding no reſt for the ſoal of her foot, I thought ſhe returned, and I ſaw Noah's hand put forth to take her in again. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome time I thought I beheld her put forth a ſecond time, and a raven with her, the dove fled as before for ſome time, and then I ſaw her return with a green olive leaf in her mouth, as a welcome token of the flood's being abated; I thought I ſaw alſo the raven fly, cawking, to and fro, but he did not return; and it came into my mind, this is a ravenous bird, and ſeeks only for prey to ſatisfy his own ſtomach, otherwiſe he might have returned to the Ark with good tidings, or ſome pleaſant token, as well as the dove: Again, after a ſhort ſpace, I thought I beheld the mountain tops, and ſome of the tree tops, beginning to appear above the waters, and that I could perceive the flood abate very faſt; and as the waters fell away I ſaw the trees began to bud and a gradual greenneſs of new leaves came upon them, and I heard the voice of the turtle, and ſaw many ſymptoms of a pleaſant and happy ſeaſon approaching, more than I can now relate; and the proſpect thereof raviſhed my ſoul; I beheld the trees bloſſoming, the fragrant valleys adorned with graſs, herbs, and pretty flowers, and the pleaſant ſtreams guſhing down towards the ocean; indeed, all nature appeared to have a new dreſs; the birds were hopping on the boughs of the trees, and chirping; each in their own notes, warbled forth the praiſe of their creator. And whilſt I beheld theſe things, a ſaying of the Prophet was brought freſh in my

memory, and applicable as I thought to the view before me, viz. <hi>The mountains and the hills ſhall break forth before you into ſinging, and all the trees of the field ſhall clap their hands; inſtead of the thorn ſhall come up the fir tree, and inſtead of the brier ſhall come up the myrtle tree, and it ſhall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlaſting ſign that ſhall not be cut off,</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>When I awoke, the proſpect remained clear in my mind, and had a ſweet reliſh, which now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues with me; and the application of the Viſion ſeems to me in this manner: The flood which appeared to cover the face of the earth, is the corruption and darkneſs which is ſo prevalent over the hearts of mankind; the Ark repreſents a place of ſafe (tho' ſolitary) refuge, wherein the Almighty preſerves his humble attentive people, who, like Noah, are aiming at perfection in their generation. The dove ſets forth the innocent, harmleſs, and loving diſpoſition, which attends the followers of the lamb who are always willing to bring good tidings, when ſuch are to be had: The raven repreſents a contrary diſpoſition which reigns in the hearts of the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who chiefly aim at gratifying their own ſenſual appetites; the waters gradually abating, the trees appearing, and afterwards budding, the voice of the turtle, and the pleaſant notes of the birds, all ſeem clear to me, to preſage the approach of that glorious morning, wherein cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and iniquity ſhall begin to abate, and be ſwept away; and then every thing ſhall appear to have a new dreſs: I am fully confirmed in the belief, that that ſeaſon will approach, which was foretold by the prophet, wherein the glory of the Lord ſhall cover the earth, as the waters cover the ſea; and in a ſenſe of theſe things my ſoul is overcome. I feel the loving kindneſs of the

Lord Almighty, yet waiting for the return of backſliders with unſpeakable mercy; and my ſoul in a ſenſe of it, ſeems bound ſtronger than ever, in the bonds of a goſpel travail; which travail I hope will encreaſe, and ſpread amongſt the faithful, for the enlargement of the church; that the nations may flock unto Sion; which ſhall become an eternal excellency, even the joy of the whole earth.</q>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the ſpring of the year 1764, I acquainted my friends that I had a deſire to attend the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly-meeting at Salem in New-Jerſey, wherewith having their concurrence, on the ſeventeenth of the fifth month I left home and went to Wilmington, and next day in company with ſeveral friends from thence by water to our friend Joſhua Thompſon's at the mouth of Salem Creek; at the meeting of miniſters and elders we were comfortted together through the goodneſs of the Lord; on firſt day there was a large gathering of a mixed multitude, and quiet, the Divine power being felt and Goſpel Truths preached, by the influence of the love whereof many hearts were tendered; tho' I thought the beauty and ſolemnity of the meeting was a little marred by an appearance that was continued too long; <hi>to begin in the life and conclude in the power and life, is becoming a miniſter of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On ſecond day morning the meeting of miniſters and elders was again held, it was a precious inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeaſon in the love of Chriſt our holy head, by which the humble were united; afterwards we had a large meeting for public worſhip, wherein the teſtimony of Truth flowed freely; the call to the
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:016223_0227_0F9BCF51D1D287D0"/>
miniſtry and qualification neceſſary to preach the Goſpel being clearly ſet forth; in humble admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I could renewedly acknowledge, <hi>Thou art, Oh Lord! Strength in our weakneſs, mouth and wiſdom, yea all things to thy humble depending ſervants whoſe truſt is on thee, waiting for thy putting forth in the way, and gently going before them, bleſſed be thy holy name for ever.</hi> In tranſacting the affairs or the diſcipline a ſpirit of brotherly love prevailed; the youth's-meeting at Pileſgrove was alſo large and edifying, the great Shepherd of Iſrael being pleaſed to ſtretch forth the crook of his Love, for gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtraying youth from purſuing after lying vanities and worldly pleaſures; miniſtring reproof to hypocrites and formal profeſſors, yet comforting his children and humble dependant followers, to the praiſe of his own eternal name; the meeting of miniſters and elders ſat again by adjournment, when we had an uniting parting ſeaſon; I returned to my friend Joſhua Thompſon's, next day to a meeting at Wilmington, and in the evening home, being thankful that I had been enabled to perform this ſmall journey.</p>
               <p>After which having a ſtrong deſire to attend the general-meetings at Goſhen and Uwchlan, on the eighth of the ſixth month my dear wife and I left home, tho' I was very unwell with a cold taken in my return from Salem, and a fever attending me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day; we attended Uwchlan meeting on firſt day, alſo one in the evening at the houſe of our brother Daniel Brown, which was dull and exerciſing, from a ſenſe of the prevalence of a ſpirit which leads many into forgetfulneſs of God, after the vanities, love and pleaſures of this periſhing world. Next day the general meeting at Goſhen was very large, and much diſturbed by the going out and coming in of many, but thro' Divine goodneſs it came to a better ſettlement before it concluded, when ſolid

friends in a degree of the renewing of the Lord's comforting love, were refreſhed in him and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; a viſitation being continued to the youth, the praiſe whereof belongs to the great Author of all good!</p>
               <p>The general-meeting at Uwchlan on the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing was alſo large, and meaſurably attended with the ownings of truth, under the influence of which, admonition and counſel flowed freely to the youth, the Divine witneſs in ſeveral of whom was reached, and the name of the Lord praiſed, who is for ever worthy!</p>
               <p>In theſe large meetings, as on all other ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, it is neceſſary in order for a proper qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to miniſter to the people, humbly to wait to know the inward life, and baptizing virtue of the ſpirit and power of Jeſus Chriſt, our all in all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe help we can never do his work to his praiſe, but inſtead of gathering the flock, we ſhall miniſter to their ſcattering from the true place of feeding. After being at the preparative meeting at Eaſt-Caln and a meeting at Uwchlan, we returned home thankful to the Lord, who had mercifully ſupported us in this ſmall journey, both of us being weakly and indiſpoſed in health.</p>
               <p>In the ninth month 1767, I attended our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia, which held a week, all the ſittings whereof both for worſhip and diſcipline, were through the overſhadowing of Divine favour, inſtructive to the humble waiters; and the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Truth, particularly againſt the unjuſt and unrighteous practice of ſlave-keeping, greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and friends were fully cautioned againſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing by will, as ſlaves to their poſterity, the poor Negroes, their fellow-creatures, it being an unlawful act in the ſight of the great and righteous parent of all mankind. This meeting concluded with a degree of awe and reverence, under the ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:016223_0229_0F9BCF534EFDEBD0"/>
influence of the Father's Love: I returned home to our general-meeting at Nottingham, which was held on the fourth and fifth days of the tenth month.</p>
               <p>After which having a ſtrong deſire to attend the general-meeting at Caecil in Maryland, I ſat out in company with ſeveral other friends, and reached the firſt ſitting of the meeting, which was ſmall and dull; the public meeting next day was very large and attended with ſome ſatisfaction, thoſe of other ſocieties who were there were moſtly pretty quiet; at the meeting of miniſters and elders the want of ſolid elders being evident, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof was propoſed to the quarterly-meeting, which was held in the afternoon of the ſame day, when it was recommended to the monthly-meetings to obſerve the directions of the yearly-meeting, to chuſe well qualified ſolid friends for that weighty ſtation.</p>
               <p>The meeting for public worſhip was again large, being attended by many of other ſocieties, and my brother W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Brown was largely opened in doctrine to the edification of the auditory; after which I had a ſhort teſtimony tending to cloſe the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: In the meeting for diſcipline I had occaſion to lament that there were too few who feelingly underſtood the weight of ſuch meetings, or were clean handed to move therein, either to their own profit or the help of their brethren; yet there are a few who ſeem to be under a preparation for the work, and I hope will grow in their gifts. On third day morning buſineſs began again, and ended full as well as I expected. I thought the Lord was mercifully pleaſed to open conſiderable inſtruction to ſuch among them, who had ears to hear and hearts diſpoſed to receive it. The meeting for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip held that afternoon, was not ſo large as on the other two days, the ſervice thereof lay weightily
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:016223_0230_0F9BCF540FBECEB8"/>
on me, and I had a full opportunity to relieve my mind towards the people, in opening to them the nature and ground of ſpiritual worſhip and true prayer, alſo the true call and qualification for goſpel miniſtry, declaring what it was to <hi>live of the Goſpel,</hi> in oppoſition to a forced maintenance; Truth favoured and the people were ſolid, ſeveral being much reached; the meeting ending to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, with a ſenſe of humble thankſgiving in many hearts to the Lord, whoſe mercies through Chriſt Jeſus are to his people yea and amen for ever.</p>

                     <p>Our friend Margaret Churchman was born (of believing parents William and Either Brown, who lived at Chicheſter in the county of Cheſter in Pennſylvania,) the thirteenth of the firſt month 1706-7, her father removing with his family into Maryland near Suſquehanna, died before ſhe was ten years old. In the twenty-third year of her age, ſhe entered into a marriage ſtate with John Churchman of Nottingham, and being religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined from her childhood, became a diligent ſeeker after that bread which nouriſhes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and thereby grew in religion, and about the thirty-fourth year of her age, it pleaſed the Lord to put her forth in the miniſtry, in which ſhe was frequently exerciſed to the comfort and edification of the churches where ſhe viſited, in this and the Southern Provinces, being delivered in a degree of life, and goſpel ſweetneſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent

               <p>Having an inclination to attend Cheſter quarterly-meeting, alſo ſome meetings within the verge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; with the concurrence of friends I ſat out on the firſt of the ſecond month 1771, attended New-Garden monthly-meeting next day, in which the love of our merciful Father was meaſurably felt, to the comfort of the humble in heart, and on firſt
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:016223_0232_0F9BCF5590E6BC88"/>
day at Birmingham, on the next had a meeting in the houſe of Richard Downing at Milltown, with people of various ſorts; the Lord was pleaſed to aſſiſt with wiſdom and ability, in meaſure, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his word in reproof, counſel, admonition and caution, to the praiſe of his own name; on third day at Pikeland was a pretty full meeting tho' a very cold day, Truth was felt to be near us; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable opportunity was had alſo in the family of the widow Meredith, the being weakly did not get out to their meeting; next day had a cold ride to Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, where was a large full meeting and I believe beneficial to many preſent, by the tendering good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the bleſſed Shepherd of ſpiritual Iſrael, the crook of whoſe heavenly love is ſtill ſtretched forth to his ſheep, who are not yet acquainted with the true fold of reſt and ſafe feeding place; his own works praiſe him: Uwchlan monthly-meeting on the day following was a laborious ſeaſon, yet through Divine favour made comfortable to the weary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who had to rejoice together in a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the conſolation of Iſrael, and therein to worſhip his name who is worthy for ever. Goſhen monthly-meeting was alſo laborious; when former experience is fed upon, or the love or honour of the world and fleſhly eaſe takes place, a ſpirit grows up in the church, which cannot judge for God and his Truth; for the judgment is his, in whoſe fear his children are made to rejoice, when his preſence is known, and his humbling goodneſs manifeſted to his people. On firſt day I was at Middletown meeting, in which there ſeemed to be a tender viſitation and call to the youth, to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the God of their Fathers, his love being meaſurably witneſſed among us. The quarterly-meeting for Cheſter held at Concord, was ſolid and edifying, through the extending of the Heavenly father's love to the children of his family; from
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:016223_0233_0F9BCF564FD661E0"/>
thence I went to Wilmington, viſited ſome of my aquaintance, and had a comfortable ſitting in the family of David Ferriſs, his ſon Benjamin being ill in a conſumption: I alſo attended the monthly-meeting, which tho' a ſearching time, was I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the comfort and edification of many, the uniting love of truth being experienced, reſted on friends in the time of the buſineſs; after which I went to the monthly-meetings at Center and Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and from thence to our quarterly-meeting at London-Grove; then returned home, having great peace in performing this journey, and being favoured with ability, felt a degree of reverent thankfulneſs to the Lord, who is all things to his ſervants, who truly abide in nothingneſs of ſelf, he is therefore worthy of all obedience and honour for ever.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-firſt of the third month, I left my habitation in order to attend our general ſpring-meeting at Philadelphia, in my way called at Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington, and was at the burial of Benjamin Ferriſs before mentioned: Our ſpring-meeting was to me very comfortable in a ſenſe of the living preſence of the Holy Head of the church, in which his true children were edified, and ſtrengthened and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally comforted one in another; bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
               <p>At this meeting the brethren both miniſters and elders, apprehend it their duty in the love of Chriſt, to appoint ſuch who are willing to give up their names to attend the ſeveral large or general meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which come in courſe in the enſuing ſummer before our yearly-meeting, to which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to give ſome account of the meetings ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them, and feeling a ſmall draught in my mind to be at that at Duck Creek, I gave in my name to attend it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:016223_0234_0F9BCF58763BCA00"/>On my return from Philadelphia I ſat with friends at their week day meeting in Wilmington, which through the continued goodneſs of the Lord, was in ſome meaſure a profitable ſeaſon, I hope to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Here I felt a ſtrong deſire to ſee the friends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who are owners of the griſt-mills lately built at and near Brandiwyne, and upon notice thereof, they met the ſame afternoon at the houſe of Daniel Byrnes, when I had an opportunity to diſcharge my mind in an affectionate manner, of what had impreſſed it towards them, which they appeared to receive in a degree of the ſame love, and as I believe it came from the author of all good, who is alone worthy of praiſe, a bleſſing may attend that opportunity if rightly remembered.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſixth of the fourth month being accompanied by a friend and neighbour, I went to Duck Creek, and was at the monthly-meeting there the next day, which was heavy, occaſioned by the prevalence of a formal, lukewarm worldly ſpirit over many of the profeſſors belonging thereto, but through the long ſuffering and continued mercy of God, there ſeemed to be a renewed awakening vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation to ſome. The meeting on firſt day was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, the Lord being mercifully pleaſed to open the ſtates and conditions of many, in a particular inſtrumental manner, and in a meaſure of his holy heart tendering power, which reached the witneſs, divers were humbled, and the meeting ended with thankſgiving, prayer and praiſes to the Lord who is worthy for ever.</p>
               <p>On ſecond day the meeting was not ſo large, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a fair being near, nevertheleſs it was a ſeaſon in which the doctrine and myſteries of the kingdom of Chriſt were largely ſet forth to the people, by the influence of the ſpirit, and in the love and wiſdom of the holy high Prieſt, who is all in all to his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:016223_0235_0F9BCF58945FB6A8"/>We had alſo three ſelect opportunities with the miniſters and elders, among whom there was great apparent weakneſs, the reaſons whereof were plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made known to them, from the ſenſe given in the love and fear of him, who will not own and unite with ſuch as are defiled, which plainneſs we had a hope would be profitable.</p>
               <p>Next day ſeveral of us were at George's Creek, which meeting is much declined; where the love of the world and its alluring vanities prevail on the profeſſors of truth, their affections are drawn from God, they grow ſlack in attending meetings, and are a bad example one to another; it was a hard meeting, but through the love of Chriſt, a meaſure of goſpel anointing enabled to open to them their ſtates in great love and plainneſs, which ſeemed to affect ſome particulars, may it be remembred with reverence before him who is the author of all good, and praiſe worthy for ever!</p>
               <p>Soon after my return home, feeling my mind engaged to attend the quarterly-meeting in Bucks County, with a few other meetings in Philadelphia quarter, I ſet out on the twenty-ſixth of the fifth month, accompanied by Samuel England, and on the third day of the week following was at the Bank meeting in Philadelphia, which was comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; on fifth day at the quarterly-meeting at Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, and next day at the general youth's meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was large and divinely favoured, then viſiting ſeveral indiſpoſed friends, on firſt day I attended Plumſtead meeting, and in that week the ſeveral monthly-meetings of Buckingham, Wrightſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, the Falls and Middletown, alſo a public meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Makefield; was on firſt day at Briſtol, from whence I went with my friend James Thornton to their afternoon meeting at Byberry, had an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one at the ſame place next day; and in that week viſited the ſeveral neigbouring meetings, one

of which was a general youth's meeting at Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, large and inſtructive, wherein the love of our Heavenly Father was felt by his truly depending children; then taking meetings at Gwynedd, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Richland, Oley, Exeter, Maiden Creek, Reading, and on firſt day at the Foreſt, I from thence rode to Uwchlan, and on ſecond day had a meeting at Milltown in the houſe of Robert Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, then proceeded home, having rode about 370 miles in this journey, in which I was favoured with my health, and held travelling beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At the gentle drawings of Truth I left my habitation, having little proſpect of much before me, but was preſerved in a quiet reſignation to the Divine will to do whatſoever ſhould appear my duty, beſeeching the Lord to enable me to watch againſt every appearance of ſelf in the great and pure work of declaring the goſpel to the people, and have great cauſe to be humbly thankful, that the Lord was pleaſed to own my ſervice beyond expectation, to the exaltation of his own truth; bleſſed be his name for ever!</p>
               <p>In the tenth month following I went to the yearly-meeting at Third-haven in Maryland, the meetings for worſhip held three days, and each of them were very large, and many Goſpel Truths were delivered in the love and power thereof, by which the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God was reached in the hearts of many of the people, and friends comforted and made thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Lord, that he was pleaſed to own us with the overſhadowing of his heavenly love; on fourth day morning the affairs of the diſcipline were finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when we had a parting meeting, which through Divine favour was a precious time to many. I had never been at the yearly-meeting when held at this place before, and now witneſſed my heart enlarged in the love of the Goſpel to declare the ſame among the multitude of people who profeſſed the Chriſtian

name, and to remind them of their conduct and dreſs, how different it was from that of thoſe who formerly ſuffered martyrdom for their religion as now profeſſed by the members of the Church of England ſo called, who own the reformers as their predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Feeling a draught of love in my mind towards ſome meetings in New-Jerſey, particulartly at Egg-harbour, having the concurrence of my friends at home, I ſet out on ſecond day the firſt of the ſixth month 1772, and taking in my way a meeting at Haddonfield, and another at the houſe of my friend Thomas Evans, which through the preſence and power of the ſearcher of hearts was made profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſome there preſent, reached Little Egg-harbour on ſeventh day, and the next attended the yearly-meeting, in which the love of the goſpel was felt to flow towards a looſe, raw, uncivilized people, who appeared to attend there more out of curioſity, than a reverent thoughtfulneſs of worſhiping almighty God; in the afternoon of the ſame day the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ce of Divine favour was remarkably evident towards the inhabitants, for which the Lord made the hearts of his ſenſible children thankful to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who is the author of all good; the meeting on ſecond day was alſo very large, in which the true children of the family were comforted in Chriſt Jeſus the Lord and holy head of the church, by the anointing virtue of whoſe precious name and power, they were made to rejoice in the company one of another; here parting with many valuable beloved friends, I went over the bay, to the upper meeting on Great Egg-harbour ſhore, which was large conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the notice, here I was comforted in knowing for whoſe name ſake I was made willing to leave my company, and turn that way, the Lord being pleaſed to own my ſervice by the inſpiration of a degree of his heavenly wiſdom and love, to ſpeak
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:016223_0238_0F9BCF5AD02020C8"/>
to the ſtates of thoſe that were preſent, bleſſed be his name who is worthy for ever. I went home with my friend Joſeph Mapes, next day attended the lower meeting, which through Divine favour was a precious ſeaſon, then paſſed over to the Cape, and next morning was at a meeting at the upper houſe, where many not of our ſociety attended, to whom the doctrine of the Goſpel flowed in deſcribing the nature of pure and undefiled religion, and wherein it conſiſted; the people were ſtill and quiet. In the afternoon of the ſame day I had a meeting at the lower houſe, which is called eight miles down the Cape, this was an heart tendering time, for which friends were made truly thankful; I thought it ſeemed like to be my laſt viſit to theſe parts. From thence I went to Cohanſy, 45 miles, to Mark Reeve's where I reſted the next day, being very weary and almoſt overcome with hard traveling; on firſt day I was at Greenwich meeting, and in the afternoon at Alloways Creek, which was very large, many of other ſocieties attending, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Truth flowed to them in a meaſure of the love thereof; next day the meeting at Salem was held in the Court-houſe, the meeting-houſe being taken down, and a new one building; on third day I was at the upper meeting near Alloways Creek, which through Divine Goodneſs was an inſtructive time to ſome ſeekers; the paſſage treated upon was our Lord's deſcription of the phariſee and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican who went up to the temple to pray, the great difference in the form of their addreſſes was opened in a clear manner, by the ſpirit of him who gave forth that parable, to my humble admiration, which was cauſe of reverent thankfulneſs, they who were ſenſible being encouraged, and the conceited form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts rebuked.</p>
               <p>From hence I went to John Davis's, had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable opportunity with ſome indiſpoſed friends in

his family; then taking meetings at Pileſgrove, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Greenwich, and Woodberry, was on firſt day morning at Haddonfield, and in the afternoon at Newtown, which laſt was laborious, tho' I believe being bleſſed to ſeveral preſent, was thereby made profitable; that evening I went over to Philadelphia weary in body, but chearful in mind, being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a degree of thankfulneſs for the continued favour of my Lord and Maſter, who had been to me a quiet habitation and ſecret ſupport in this journey. After ſtaying two days, and on each at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending meetings in the city, I took Wilmington meeting in my way home, having travelled about three hundred and fifty miles, attended about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meetings, beſides having ſeveral comfortable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities in families.</p>
               <p>Being under an appointment with other friends of our quarterly-meeting, to viſit friends of the monthly-meetings of Warrington and Fairfax, I ſet out on the ſeventh of the tenth month, and taking a meeting with friends in Yorktown, we were at Warrington on firſt day, then viſited the ſeveral meetings of Newberry, Huntington, and Monallen, in which Truth owned our ſervice in a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; our labour of love appearing to be kindly received, I hope may be uſeful; on the firſt day following five of us were at Pipe Creek meeting, then at Buſh Creek, Monaqueſy, Fairfax, Gooſe Creek, and Southfork, wherein the Lord was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his wonted goodneſs and mercy to magnify his own name who is praiſe worthy for ever.</p>
               <p>After a ſeaſonable opportunity with friends held in the houſe of Abel Janny at parting with them, we returned to Fairfax meeting on firſt day, where under the influence of the Divine preſence, the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony and doctrine of Truth flowed freely to the people, in a humble ſenſe whereof, praiſes aſcended to his holy name who is over all worthy for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="unknown:016223_0240_0F9BCF5C52441DF0"/>Several of our company now returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, three of us not being eaſy yet to return, two of us went to viſit a friend who lay in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing condition, which I believe was ſerviceable, the love of our Heavenly Father being in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree felt among us; on third day we had a meeting at the Gap (ſo called) among a raw people, where Divine Goodneſs meaſurably favoured the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; on the day following we attended Fairfax pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative meeting, the two next days we viſited ſome ſick friends, and on ſeventh day were at the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-meeting, which was in the main ſatisfactory; on firſt day the meeting was thought to be the largeſt ever held at this place, and the Goſpel being preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the love of it to the tendering the hearts of many, the meeting ended in humble thankſgiving to the holy Author of all good; next day in company with ſeveral friends of Fairfax, I attended a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Monaqueſy, where ſome came who did not make religious profeſſion with us, which was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive tendering ſeaſon through the Lord's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; after a meeting at Buſh Creek, and another at Pipe Creek, I travelled to Gunpowder, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the quarterly-meeting for the Weſtern ſhore of Maryland, likewiſe the general-meeting for worſhip on firſt day, at which were ſeveral not of our ſociety whoſe hearts were reached by the love of truth; next day I had a meeting at the little Falls, and from thence returned home, where after ſtaying three days, I went to our quarterly-meeting at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Grove, the two laſt days of which afforded ſome comfort and ſatisfaction. On the fourteenth of the twelfth month I went to Wilmington, on which day Margaret the wife of John Perry was buried after a ſhort illneſs, I ſpent part of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his afflicted family to ſatisfaction, ſtaying in the town two days I attended their monthly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thought there was a want of more mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

deeply baptized for the work which appears neceſſary in the church at that place; at this time Deborah the daughter of David Ferriſs being in a declining conſumptive ſtate, and waſting faſt, I viſited her to my ſatisfaction, ſhe appearing to be in a reſigned humble frame of ſpirit, was an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary young woman whom I eſteemed; then going to Center and Hockeſſon meetings, I was at New-Garden on firſt day, which I thought thro' Divine favour an inſtructive profitable meeting to myſelf, and perhaps to ſome others; the ſubject which opened was the neceſſity of not leaning to, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing any man, but of attending to the pure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſecret influence of the Spirit of Truth manifeſted in the heart, in the meekneſs, and purity of the wiſdom from above, it was that by which the churches were gathered, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, preſerved in the unity of the one bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and perfect bond of peace and good order.</p>
               <p>I next attended our preparative and monthly-meetings, after which was confined moſtly at home for about a month by a fever, during which time my mind was often much humbled under a ſenſe of the prevalence of a dull, lukewarm ſpirit, as to the life and power of Truth; earthly mindedneſs, and the cares and cumbers concerning the things of this preſent life having drawn the minds of many into death; I never more clearly ſaw the neceſſity there was for us who profeſs the truth, ſingly to attend to the gentle inſtructions of the Holy Spirit thereof, which only doth, and ever will, lead and guide into all Truth, and preſerveth from thoſe errors and failings which are ſo abundantly evident among us, whereby our hands are weakened in reſpect to a careful exerciſe of the diſcipline of the church.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BEING ſomewhat recovered of my indiſpoſition of body, I ſat in our ſelect meeting of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and elders on the firſt of the ſecond month 1773, in which I was comforted under a ſenſe of our being owned in ſome degree by the viſitation of Divine love, and afterwards attended our quarterly-meeting at London-Grove, each ſitting whereof was favoured with the continuance of heavenly help, to the encouragement of the humble waiters. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with thankfulneſs in my mind to the Lord, who had furniſhed me with ſtrength in my weak ſtate to ſit with my friends, in which we ought to be good examples; I attended our own meeting on the fifth and firſt days following, and in the ſame week went to Wilmington to the burial of Deborah Ferriſs before mentioned, after which, a ſolid and profitable meeting was held.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-ſixth of the third month I ſet out from home in order to attend our general ſpring meeting at Philadelphia, but did not get there in time for the firſt ſitting thereof, ſuch of them as I
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:016223_0243_0F9BCF5E8FB96018"/>
did attend, I thought were in the main, times of Divine favour; on my return homeward I was at a ſmall meeting at Cheſter, alſo the general meeting at Wilmington, and ſoon after the general meeting at Duck. Creek, and their monthly-meeting preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; the meeting there on firſt day was large, and tho' a mixed multitude attended, it was ſolid through the overſhadowing of heavenly power, the Lord was pleaſed to open the myſteries of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, influencing my heart to preach the Goſpel in the love thereof to my humble admiration, and many were tendered, for which renewed viſitation and favour, a ſacrifice of thankſgiving aſcended from the hearts of his children, to the all powerful and merciful God who is worthy for ever; the meeting on ſecond day was a time of conſolation to the heavy hearted, inſtruction to the humble ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a ſeaſon of ſtrengthening to the weak, bleſſed be the name of the Lord for his mercies endure for ever: I was next at George's Creek meeting, in which friends were encouraged, and in ſome degree refreſhed divers not of our ſociety attending; the doctrine of perſonal election and reprobation as held by ſome, was refuted, and it was clearly pointed out wherein the election ſtood, viz. <hi>In Chriſt the ſeed, which cleaved unto, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by man, for his true inſtructor and leader by his light and witneſs in the heart as a reprover for ſin, and ſo followed and obeyed, man comes to know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf elected in him.</hi> I went home with George Ford at Back Creek, and had an opportunity in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily I hope to ſome profit.</p>
               <p>Towards the fall of the year I had a draught in my mind to attend ſome meetings in the Jerſeys, particularly the quarterly-meeting at Shrewſbury, of which having acquainted my brethren at home, and had there concurrence, after attending our yearly-meeting in Philadelphia and returning from
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:016223_0244_0F9BCF5F51CD76F0"/>
thence, I ſet out in company with my friend Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel England on the twelfth of the tenth month, but was detained at Philadelphia by a fever which held me ſeveral days, yet I ſo far recovered as to proceed on our journey, taking on our way meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Mountholly, at a School-houſe near Shreve's mount in upper Springfield, in which I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to warn the youth to beware of Deiſm, and to ſhew the ground and cauſe of falling into that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, alſo at upper Freehold, and in a friend's houſe near that called Robbins's meeting; there ſeems to be a viſitation to the youth in that place, to which if they are faithful that meeting may again increaſe; we reached the meeting of miniſters and elders at Shrewſbury, in which truth owned the lovers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; the public meetings on the three following days were large, and thought to be the moſt quiet and ſatisfactory which had been known of late years there; the affairs of the diſcipline were, as I thought, pretty well conducted; finding myſelf not clear of the members of our ſociety at this place, I therefore propoſed to ſeveral friends that they would favour me ſo much as to meet on their week day meeting day, which I underſtood they uſually had omitted in this week, requeſting that they would acquaint their members with my deſire of ſeeing them, their children, and families together; I therefore waited until fifth day, when they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally met, which gave me an opportunity comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to clear myſelf towards friends here, to the encouragment of the ſincere, being led to ſhew the active members the cauſe of dwarfiſhneſs, the love of the world, and its friendſhips, choaking the good ſeed, which ſhould grow and bear rule: I was thankful for this opportunity, and left them with the enjoyment of a quiet mind; from hence we paſſed to Rahway, had a meeting at Woodbridge, and another at Plainfield, in both which truth
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:016223_0245_0F9BCF60112056A0"/>
owned my ſervice; I thought there was a tender viſitation renewed to friends in thoſe parts, in the ſenſe whereof I was thankful, and that I had been favoured with ſtrength to pay them a viſit in the love of my great and good maſter, may I ever walk anſwerable to his manifold favours, who is praiſe worthy for ever! We were next at Stonybrook meeting, which was made precious in the renewing of Divine favour, and then at Trenton with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have much loſt the life and ſavour of truth; from thence going to Byberry and Philadelphia, I reached the quarterly-meeting, at Concord which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan on the ſixth of the eleventh month, the next day I went to Chicheſter, where I was enabled to ſpeak to the ſtates of the people in the love of truth, which may be uſeful if remembred in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and returned to the quarterly-meeting on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day, which was comfortable, the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence being felt, our friend Elizabeth Robinſon was there, and had good ſervice; on third day I attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the general meeting at Cheſter, which was poor and dull; the expectations of the people being too much outward, they were diſappointed; then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the monthly-meeting at Wilmington, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their meeting the next day, and proceeded to our quarterly-meeting at London Grove, at which we had the company of our friends Robert Walker, Elizabeth Robinſon, and Mary Leaver from Great-Britain; it was a ſeaſon of refreſhment and comfort to many friends; then went home, having travelled in this journey about 360 miles.</p>
               <p>In the third month 1774, I attended our general ſpring-meeting in Philadelphia, the divers ſitttings whereof were divinely favoured; and after it, the general meeting at Wilmington, which was held chiefly in ſilence, and on that account remarkable.</p>
               <p>Having an engagement on my mind for ſome time to viſit friends on Long-Iſland, with ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:016223_0246_0F9BCF60CECABA58"/>
meetings, I laid it before my brethren, who gave me their certificate for that purpoſe; and on the third of the fifth month I ſet out on the journey, having the company of a friend from Wilmington, taking a meeting at Philadelphia, we reached New-York, attended their morning and afternoon meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on firſt day, and had an opportunity with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers friends in the evening, which was to me (at leaſt) inſtructive, and I believe through Divine goodneſs profitable to ſome others. We then had meetings at Weſt-Cheſter, Mamaroneck, and the Purchaſe, the laſt being a monthly-meeting; theſe opportunities were cloſe and ſearching, the teſtimony of Truth was encouraging to the well-minded, but very ſharp to the formaliſts, and my mind was made thankful for the bleſſing of peace in the diſcharge of my duty. We next attended meetings at Fluſhing on Long-Iſland, Cowneck, Weſtbury, Matinicock, Sequitogue and Bethpage, then at Newtown, the monthly-meeting at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and the quarterly-meeting at Fluſhing, where the yearly-meeting began the next day, which held four days, and on the whole I believe it may be ſaid, that the authority of Truth was in ſome good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree felt to keep down forward ſpirits both in the miniſtry and diſcipline, which was cauſe of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to the Lord who rules among his children, and is worthy of all praiſe for ever; here I had the company of our dear friends Robert Walker, Eliz<hi rend="sup">a.</hi> Robinſon, and Suſanna Lightfoot, who intending for Rhode-Iſland, I parted with them, and went to the monthly-meeting at New-York, which through merciful regard was comfortable; from thence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Rahway, had a meeting at Plainfield which was ſatisfactory through the extendings of Divine favour; then at Kingwood on firſt day, from whence croſſing Delaware we were at Buckingham monthly meeting, where I thought the true Spirit of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:016223_0247_0F9BCF6332A24F90"/>
appeared to be much wanting in many; here my companion returned homewards; the next day I was at Wright's-town monthly-meeting, which through the Lord's bleſſing was edifying to many, and we parted in peace and ſweetneſs of Spirit, the day following I attended the meeting at Pine-ſtreet in Philadelphia, alſo that at High-ſtreet on fifth day, which was a precious opportunity to ſuch who loved to live near the Spirit of Truth, from thence I went to viſit my brother-in-law Daniel Brown near Cheſter, was at Newtown meeting on firſt day, and at an afternoon meeting near Amos Yarnal's, then went to the general meetings at Goſhen, and Uwchlan, after which taking London-Grove meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I came home, having rode in this journey about 600 miles, and feeling a degree of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the Lord was pleaſed to give me ability to perform it.</p>
               <p>I tarried much at home the remaining part of this ſummer; on the twenty-firſt of the ninth month, I ſet out in order to attend the yearly-meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Philadelphia, which was very large in the ſeveral ſittings, continued a full week, and I thought it the moſt ſolid and weighty in tranſacting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of truth that I ever knew: The teſtimony thereof againſt ſlave keeping was wonderfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, thro' the power and love of God who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all praiſe for ever. In my way home I was at Providence meeting, in which the teſtimony of truth went forth by way of warning to the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and declining profeſſors, and of encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the youth.</p>
               <p>Our general meeting at Nottingham next day was large, and I hope profitable to ſome; after which having a deſire to be at the general meeting at Caecil in Maryland, I left home on the ſeventh of the tenth month, was at the quarterly-meeting of miniſters and elders there on firſt day morning,
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:016223_0248_0F9BCF63D1D75E18"/>
which was profitably inſtructive through Divine Goodneſs; two public meetings for worſhip were held on firſt and ſecond days, both large and ſolid, ſeveral other friends from Pennſylvania were there, the buſineſs of the quarterly-meeting ended on third day morning, on the ſame day we had a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble public meeting, from which we parted with friends in much love and nearneſs. On the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day was their monthly-meeting, to attend which ſeveral of us ſtaid; then having a deſire to ſee friends at Cheſter-River, I went to their week day meeting, Nicholas Waln bearing me company; the meeting was large, and through the Lord's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it was, I believe, made profitable to many; then taking meetings at Saſſafraſs, Duck-Creek, Motherkill, and Little-Creek, the two laſt being their preparative meeting at each place, the next day was their ſelect meeting of miniſters and elders, and their monthly-meeting the day following, which, with divers other friends from Pennſylvania, we attended, and on the firſt and ſecond days of the next week the general meeting at Little-Creek: I believe there is a renewed viſitation to friends, and ſome others hereaway; but formal profeſſors at preſent appear to be as ſtumbling blocks by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſpirit of the world; I returned home with an eaſy mind.</p>
               <p>Weakneſs and infirmity of body gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing upon our beloved friend, he frequently mentioned, that many years part, it was unexpected to him to live to his ſeventieth year, and to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with health and ſtrength ſufficient to travel ſo much as he lately had, ſaying, that now he ſcarcely thought much more would be required of him; he however attended the weſtern quarterly-meeting in the eleventh month this year, and in the ſecond month 1775, in both which he was favoured
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:016223_0249_0F9BCF64B0E447F8"/>
with ſtrength and clearneſs to ſpeak to the ſtate of the church, as well in ſome of the ſelect, as the more public meetings, tending to the edification and comfort of many.</p>
               <p>In the third month 1775, he alſo attended the general ſpring-meeting at Philadelphia, and in ſome of the ſittings thereof was much favoured, on his return home from thence, he was at Wilmington general meeting, in company with our friends Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Walker and Elizabeth Robinſon from Great-Britain.</p>
               <p>His laſt journey was on a viſit to moſt of the meetings on the Eaſtern-ſhore of Maryland, and to attend the yearly-meeting at Thirdhaven in Talbot County, for which purpoſe he ſet out from his own habitation on the twenty-ſecond of the fifth month, having, according to his uſual care, obtained the concurrence of his brethren, and was accompanied by a young man (William Jackſon) a member of New-Garden monthly-meeting, who has given the following account of this journey.</p>
               <p>"Our firſt days ride was to George Ford's near Back-Creek, the next morning being damp and foggy, was very trying to his weak conſtitution, yet we rode forty five miles that day to Hannah Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's in Queen Ann's County, which was thought to be a means of bringing on him a diſorder which proved painful and afflicting, and increaſed till near his end, being advanced in age, his bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties appeared great, but the fervency of his mind for the promotion of truth and righteouſneſs, and his care as a Father in Iſrael, was truly as preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as ever. On the twenty-fourth of the month he went to the preparative meeting at Tuckahoa, wherein he was concerned to exhort ſome to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in times of temptation and tryal, that they might experience an overcoming, and be enabled to ſtrengthen their brethren. Next, day we attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:016223_0250_0F9BCF654ED856B8"/>
Thirdhaven monthly-meeting, in which he was I qualified to ſpeak inſtructively to the members thereof, particularly to ſuch who were incumbered with much care about the things of this life, things, which although lawful in themſelves, yet when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to engroſs the minds and affections of people, obſtruct a progreſs in religion. On the twenty-ſixth a meeting at Choptank was a time of heavy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe on account of a lifeleſs, lukewarm, indifferent ſituation of mind, which ſeemed to attend divers there aſſembled; the next day we attended a burial at Thirdhaven, on which occaſion a meeting was held, and he laboured honeſtly to arouſe thoſe that lived in the neglect of making timely preparation for their laſt awful and ſolemn change: On the twenty-eighth we were at Tuckahoa meeting, and on ſecond day at the Bay-ſide, where were but few of our ſociety, but ſeveral others attended who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved ſoberly, and ſome of the younger ſort were reached and tendered by Truth's Teſtimony, to whom he was led inſtructively to ſhew, <hi>That they need not give their money for that which is not bread, nor their labour for that which ſatisfieth not,</hi> and opened to them the way of life and ſalvation which is attained through <hi>the Spirit, or free gift of Grace that is come upon all men for juſtification,</hi> ſo that if they attended to the dictates thereof in their own hearts, it was ſufficient to inſtruct them in the way of Godlineſs, but when people go from, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect this inward teacher, ſeeking to, or depending on learned men, they err."</p>
               <p>"Next day we had a religious opportunity in the family of John Bartlett, and on fourth day went to Tuckahoa meeting again, where he had to ſpeak of the ſufficiency of the grace of God, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of people's living in a profeſſion thereof without being found in the faith, or fully believing in this principle as ſufficient for ſalvation. We next
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:016223_0251_0F9BCF6615C6EF98"/>
attended the meetings at Thirdhaven, and Marſhy-Creek; the yearly-meeting began on ſeventh day, and continued until the fourth of the following week, which altho' he was feeble and unwell, he attended the ſeveral ſittings thereof, being nine in the five days, and the laſt held ſeven hours; he was enabled to appear for the cauſe and teſtimony of truth, both in the meetings for worſhip and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and like the good ſcribe well inſtructed in the things of the kingdom, had to bring forth out of the treaſury, things new and old, profitable and inſtructive, being ſeaſoned with the love and virtue of truth: After the meeting on fourth day, we went to the houſe of Joſeph Berry, where next morning had a religious opportunity in the family, and the day following a meeting in Queen Ann's Foreſt, from whence we went to Joſhua Vanſant's; here he was very poorly, having taken ſome freſh cold; the next day being very warm, he was much ſpent with riding, and ſaid, as he had at ſeveral times before on this journey, "that he believed it would be his laſt, if he lived to reach home, which at times he thought ſeemed unlikely." On firſt day the eleventh of the ſixth month he had a meeting in a School-houſe at Back-Creek, among a people who behaved with much ſobriety, which was a ſatisfactory time, very inſtructive and open for doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and that evening reached home, having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in this journey about 290 miles."</p>
               <p>On the fourteenth of the ſixth month he went to the week day meeting at London-Grove, to meet with a committee of our quarterly-meeting on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular buſineſs, and returned to our meeting at Nottingham the next day, on the firſt day of the week following, was there alſo, in the ſame week he attended our preparative and monthly-meetings, but a fever daily increaſing upon him, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards chiefly confined at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="246" facs="unknown:016223_0252_0F9BCF66CEAB3BD8"/>On the fourth of the ſeventh month he expreſſed himſelf thus, "I am glad that I am at home, I have ever found it beſt when my ſervice abroad was over, to get home as quick as might be, and though I have felt great inward poverty, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſince my laſt journey, ſo that I can neither ſee my beginning, nor ending, but ſeem as if all were hidden, yet I hope if Providence ſhall ſee meet to remove me at this time, ſome light will appear again, and that it will be otherwiſe before I go."</p>
               <p>At another time he ſpake to this purpoſe,
<q>I have found myſelf much ſtripped as to a ſenſe of good, and tried with poverty many days. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have been accounted by ſome, as one of the better ſort of people, but have ſeen great occaſion to beware of a diſpoſition that would ſeek to feed upon the praiſe or commendations of others; a carnal ſelfiſh ſpirit is very apt to preſent, and creep in here if poſſible, and I have ſeen it hurt many who have had right beginnings, it always introduceth dimneſs, and oppreſſion, to the pure, precious, innocent life of truth, which only groweth up into dominion, through deep abaſement of ſoul, and the entire death of ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At ſeveral other times he ſignified to this effect,
<q>My preſent baptiſm of affliction hath tended to the further refinement of my nature, and to the bringing me more perfectly into the image of my maſter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He frequently expreſſed his full ſubmiſſion to the Divine Will either reſpecting life or death, ſeveral times ſaying, "I now experience my life and my will to be ſlain, and I have no will leſt."</p>
               <p>In the two laſt weeks of his time it appeared that his deſire and hope, mentioned in the forepart of his illneſs, for light again to appear was fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the freſh influence thereof, ſo that altho' his
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:016223_0253_0F9BCF67933A35F0"/>
pain was often great he would many times in a day break forth into a kind of melody with his voice, without uttering words, which as he ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated was an involuntary aſpiration of his ſoul in praiſe to the Lord who had again been pleaſed to ſhine forth in brightneſs after many days of poverty and deep baptiſm, which tho' painful had proved beneficial to him, being a means of further purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the dregs of nature, ſaying he was at times afraid to diſcover that melody in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome that viſited him, leſt they could not comprehend its meaning, and might therefore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue it.</p>
               <p>On ſecond day morning the ſeventeenth of the ſeventh month being aſked by a friend how he was, he replied, "<hi>I am here in the body yet, and when I go out of it I hope there is nothing but peace,</hi>" and ſoon after further ſaid, "<hi>I have ſeen that all the buſtles, and noiſes that are now in the world will end in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and our young men that know not an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Truth and the Lord's fear for a ballaſt will be caught in a trying moment,</hi>" at another time he ſaid, "<hi>I feel nothing but peace, having endeavoured honeſtly to diſcharge myſelf in public, and privately to individuals as I apprehended was required, and if it be the Lord's will that I ſhould go now, I ſhall be releaſed from a great deal of trouble and exerciſe, which I believe friends who are left behind will have to paſs through.</hi>"</p>
               <p>On the twentieth of the ſame month he thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf, "<hi>I love friends who abide in the truth as much as ever I did, and I feel earneſt breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Lord, that there may be ſuch raiſed up in the church who may go forth in humility, ſweetneſs, and life, clear of all ſuperfluity in expreſſions and otherwiſe, ſtanding for the teſtimony, that they may be uſeful to the church in theſe difficult times.</hi>"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:016223_0254_0F9BCF684FA12110"/>About three days before his death ſeveral friends being in his room he ſpake as follows, "Friends in the beginning, if they had health and liberty, were not eaſily diverted from paying their tribute of worſhip to the Almighty on week days as well as firſt days, but after a while when outward ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ceaſed, life and zeal decaying, eaſe and the ſpirit of the world took place with many, and thus it became cuſtomary for one or two out of a family to attend meetings, and to leave their children much at home; parents alſo it worldly concerns were in the way could neglect their week day meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſometimes; yet be willing to hold the name, and plead excuſe becauſe of a buſy time, or the like, but I believe that ſuch a departure from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive integrity ever did, and ever will, occaſion a withering from the life of true religion."</p>
               <p>To a friend who came to viſit him on the twenty-firſt of the ſeventh month he ſaid, "<hi>I feel that which lives beyond death and the grave, which is now an inexpreſſible comfort to me after a time of deep baptiſm that I have paſſed through, I believe my being continued here is in the will of Providence, and I am fully reſigned.</hi>"</p>
               <p>His illneſs increaſing he ſaid but little on ſeventh day the twenty-ſecond; in the afternoon he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low, and ſpeechleſs about twelve hours; early on firſt day morning he recruited a little, and gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about his coffin to a friend who ſat up with him being a joiner; continuing rather eaſier the forepart of that day and appearing chearful, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed divers weighty ſentences like farewell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to ſome who came to ſee him; on ſecond day morning he ſat up a conſiderable time, in the afternoon he appeared lively and ſenſible, tho' very weak, thus expreſſing himſelf, "<hi>I am much refreſhed with my Maſter's ſweet air, I feel more life, more light, more love, and ſweetneſs than ever before,</hi>"
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:016223_0255_0F9BCF69104AD278"/>
and often mentioned the Divine refreſhment and comfort he felt flowing like a pure ſtream to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, ſaying to thoſe who were with him, "<hi>I may tell you of it, but you cannot feel it as I do.</hi>"</p>
               <p>In the evening a young perſon coming into the room, looking at her earneſtly and affectionately, he ſaid, "<hi>Deborah aroſe a mother in Iſrael,</hi>" and ſhortly after, "<hi>The ſweetneſs that I feel,</hi>" then his difficulty of breathing increaſed, and being turned once or twice he requeſted to be helped up, and was placed in his chair, in which he expired about the ninth hour on ſecond day night the twenty-fourth of the ſeventh month 1775, being aged near ſeventy, and miniſter about forty-two years, and was buried on the twenty-ſixth in friend's Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard at Eaſt-Nottingham, a large concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple attending, after which a ſolemn meeting was held.</p>

               <p>The following Memorial of our beloved Friend Joſeph White, who was endued with an eminent Gift in the Miniſtry, and uniformly concerned for the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Churches, is here ſubjoined at the deſire of divers Friends, which as no account of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Viſits in the ſervice of the Goſpel appears to be preſerved by himſelf, may in ſome meaſure ſupply that Deficiency, and we apprehend will be an inſtructive and acceptable Appendage to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Journal, tending to revive and keep in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance his pious Life, and the near Fellowſhip of his Brethren with him, and further animate ſurvivors to Faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of their ſeveral Religious duties, in order that they alſo may be favoured with a well grounded Hope of attaining the like Happy End.</p>
            </argument>
            <head>A TESTIMONY from the Falls Monthly-Meeting in Bucks County, concerning our Friend JOSEPH WHITE.</head>
            <p>AS the Memory of the juſt is pronounced bleſſed, we think it expedient to give forth a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning this our eſteemed friend.</p>
            <p>He was born at the Falls the twenty-eighth of the eleventh month 1712-13; being young when his father died, he was brought up under the care of his relations and friends: And through the early extendings of Heavenly regard whilſt young, and attending to the teachings of Divine Grace he was lead and preſerved from many of the follies and extravagances incident to unthinking youth. About the twentieth year of his age he appeared in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic teſtimony in our religious meetings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in a good degree faithful to the meaſure of Light and Grace communicated, he grew in his gift, and became a lively and able miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="unknown:016223_0257_0F9BCF6A93DEAB80"/>He was naturally of an open cheerful diſpoſition, and honeſtly concerned for the promotion of piety and virtue, and for the ſupport and maintenance of good order in the church; for which ſervice he was eminently gifted, and truly ſerviceable amongſt us, being often concerned that the authority of Truth might be kept up in all our meetings of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and that true judgment might be placed upon the diſorderly and irreclaimable. He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplary in his life and converſation, a diligent and timely attender of our religious meetings when health of body permitted; and was often favoured therein in public teſtimony and ſupplication, much to the comfort and edification of the truly humble waiters. And altho' he had a large gift in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, he many times ſat meetings in ſilence, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, not being haſty or forward in the exerciſe of his gift; but careful not to miniſter without the Heavenly Life and Power that firſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up in the miniſtry, whereby his public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was greatly to the conſolation and refreſhment of many.</p>
            <p>He ſeveral times had a concern to viſit the churches abroad, and with the concurrence of this meeting, viſited many of the meetings of friends in this and ſeveral of the adjacent provinces, and once through ſome parts of Maryland, Virginia and North-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina: And having for ſome conſiderable time been under a weighty concern to pay a religious viſit to friends in ſeveral parts of Europe, he with the concurrence and unity of his friends took ſhipping for that purpoſe in the year 1758, and after a ſhort paſſage landed in England, and having pretty gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally viſited friends meetings in England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſome parts of Wales, he returned to his family and friends, having been from home in truth's ſervice near three years: And at his return from theſe viſits produced certificates of friends
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:016223_0258_0F9BCF6B507DF838"/>
unity and good ſatisfaction with him, and his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice amongſt them.</p>
            <p>He was divers times appointed and engaged in the ſervice of viſiting families, being well qualified for that weighty ſervice.</p>
            <p>He much loved the company and converſation of his friends; was a loving and affectionate huſband, a tender parent and a good neighbour, generally beloved by his friends and others that knew him, being in ſeveral reſpects uſeful and ſerviceable in the neighbourhood where he lived.</p>
            <p>He was attended from his youth at times, with a pain at his breaſt, with intermiſſions of health, ſometimes for years, and at other times but ſhort; but as he advanced further in age, intermiſſions of health grew ſhort and pain encreaſed, which brought on other bodily infirmities, which he bore with patience and reſignation, often craving he might not be off his watch when his pains were exquiſite, nor his faith fail in the time of trial, believing it to be the goodneſs of God, through his thus deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, more and more to wean him from all outward connections and neareſt ties of nature, that being as the pure gold, refined through the furnace, he might with triumph join the redeemed that were gone before, which he at times had a foretaſte and evidence of; but the time when, as he himſelf ſometimes expreſſed, he did not then ſee, believing it to be conſiſtent with Divine Wiſdom to keep it hid from him.</p>
            <p>The latter part of his time for ſeveral months, he ſlept but little in the night ſeaſon, being at times engaged in reverent interceſſions and Divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and appeared to be waiting for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn moment.</p>
            <p>He lived in the compaſs of the Falls particular meeting until a few years before his death, and then removed to Makefield, (a branch of the ſame
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:016223_0259_0F9BCF6C0F035688"/>
monthly-meeting,) and having for ſome months felt ſtrong deſires (if favoured with health) to go to the Falls meeting, and on a monthly-meeting day ſet out to go there; but the weather being cold and he in a weak ſtate of health, ſoon found himſelf unable to perform the journey, and returned home. But ſome time after feeling his bodily ſtrength ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſtored, and love renewed, he ſet out, in company with his wife, one firſt day morning, and got to the meeting where he was favoured with an open time in publick teſtimony, much to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe preſent. After the meeting was over and friends gone out, a friend being deſirous of ſpeaking to him, not ſeeing him out of doors, returned into the houſe, and found him ſitting on a ſeat, unable to move without help; the friend aſſiſted him, and took him to his houſe, where he was taken care of: The fit being of the paralytick kind, was much more favourable than at ſome other times, tho' it continued ebbing and flowing for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours; in which time he expreſſed ſeveral things, ſome of which being then taken down, are nearly as follows.</p>
            <p>Being aſked by his ſon Samuel how it was with him; he anſwered, "<hi>I dont know but that I am near my end. My deſire at this time for thee is, that thou ſeek unto the Lord for aſſiſtance, to govern thee in thy conduct in this fluctuating life, for I have found him to be a ſure help and counſellor to me; and if thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after him in truth and ſincerity, as I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do, he will be unto thee a ſufficient director, a Teacher that cannot be removed into a corner: I have not been anxious to gather a portion of this world, nor make to myſelf mammon of unrighteouſneſs, for I think I have ſeen a ſnare that has attended many young people on theſe accounts. I have ever from my youth had a deſire to be more in ſubſtance than in ſhew: Let me appear as I might in the ſight of men,
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:016223_0260_0F9BCF6E5A6B4A58"/>
their praiſe I ſought not for; but I have ſought the honour of God, therefore there is a place where no trouble ſhall annoy, prepared for me as a reward for obedience: You that ſtay, be more humble, and when trouble awaits you, look not upon nor truſt to the arm of fleſh for aſſiſtance, but ſtay yourſelves upon him who ſuffered for you, for me, and for all mankind; for I have for ſome time believed, and lived in the hopes thereof, and am now in meaſure confirmed, of more glorious things yet to be revealed to the church of Chriſt, and that further and greater diſcoveries will yet be made, with reſpect to the Chriſtian Religion than ever yet has been ſince the apoſtaſy.</hi>"</p>
            <p>And after a ſhort pauſe he broke forth in theſe expreſſions, "<hi>The door is open, I ſee an innumerable company of ſaints, of Angels, and of the Spirits of juſt men, which I long to be unbodied to be with, but not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! I cannot utter nor my tongue expreſs, what I feel of that Light, Life and Love that attends me, which the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give, neither can it take away from me. My ſins are waſhed away by the blood of the Lamb that was ſlain from the foundation of the world: All rags and filthineſs are taken away, and in room thereof love and good will for all mankind: O that we may become more united in the church militant, and nearer reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the church triumphant! O that we all might make ſuch an end as I have in proſpect, for its all Light, all Life, all Love and all Peace, the light that I ſee is more glorious than the Sun in the Firmament; come Lord Jeſus Chriſt, come when thou pleaſes, thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is ready and willing; into thy hands I commit my ſpirit, not my will, but thy will be done O Lord! Let this mortal body be committed to the duſt, be with me, with my children and my grand-children; be with all them that love thee, that love thy appearance. O the pains that I feel, that attend this mortal body, they are more comely to me than jewels! I rejoice in my
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:016223_0261_0F9BCF6F16ED6A50"/>
ſighs and groans, for to me they are moſt melodious; I am near to enter that harmony with Moſes and the Lamb, where they cry Holy, Holy, Holy, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the joy I feel. My heart (if it were poſſible) would break for joy: If any enquire after me, after my end, let them know all is well with me.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Many more weighty expreſſions he ſpoke, which not being taken down, cannot be recollected.</p>
            <p>The next day his pain abating, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomewhat relieved from his diſorder, he was taken to his own houſe, where he remained in a weak ſtate of health for ſometime, being unable to go much abroad. And one night ſome ſhort time before his death, his pain had been ſharp the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the night, but the latter part it abating, his wife lay down by him, and fell aſleep, but he as uſual ſlept not, but after ſometime called to his wife in theſe words: "<hi>My dear, I believe I muſt take my leave of thee, I have never ſeen my end till now, and now I ſee its near, and the Holy Angels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe me around, waiting to receive me;</hi>" his wife aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if ſhe ſhould call up the children, he ſaid, he did not ſee any thing further he had to ſay to them, except to his ſon Joſeph who being called, and he having expreſt what he had on his mind, was much ſpent, and appeared as tho' he was near his deſired port; but after ſome time he revived, with theſe words, "<hi>Life is yet ſtrong in me and will not yield;</hi>" thus he continued the few concluding days, waiting in reſignation and retiredneſs of mind, until the repeated returns of the paralytick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint reduced his faculties and ſenſes ſo, that he knew not what was done for ſome days, and departed in much ſtillneſs as in a ſleep, the tenth day of the third month 1777, and was decently interred in friend's burying ground at the Fall's meeting-houſe, the twelfth of the ſame; his body being attended to the grave by a number of friends and neighbours.</p>
