            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But we have a further Assurance, that five dayes before the <hi>Feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,</hi> namely, on the <hi>Tenth</hi> Day of the <hi>Seventh Month,</hi> a <hi>Fast</hi> was kept for a <hi>Day of Expiation</hi>: Even on the same Day that <hi>Moses</hi> having <hi>Thrice Fasted</hi> forty dayes together, came down to his people, with the News of the Lords being Reconciled unto them.

the Sorrowful Occasions of those <hi>Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tears</hi> of an <hi>Humbled,</hi> a <hi>Melted,</hi> a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Heart, O let us <hi>Draw that Water,</hi> and <hi>pour it out before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the General Assembly of <hi>Israel, poured out Water before the Lord,</hi> it is the Opinion of some, that they designed with an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of much <hi>Humiliation,</hi> to express their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous Condition. A State Irretrievably ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous, is thus described, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. <hi>We are as water spilt upon the ground, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gathered up again.</hi> Thus the Intention of the General Assembly here, might be, most significantly to say, <hi>Lord, see whether we are not a People so utterly Lost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Spoilt, and Gone, that it is as impossible to Retrieve our doleful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, as to gather up the Water which is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out upon the Ground.</hi> Now, thy Condition, O poor <hi>New England,</hi> is indeed so very like that of <hi>Water poured out,</hi> that it pathetically ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us all, to <hi>pour out the Water</hi> of our <hi>Tears</hi> before the Lord. <hi>Weeping,</hi> is one of those Exercises, whereto the God of <hi>Heaven</hi> calls His people, to <hi>Humble</hi> themselves before Him. And in the Bible we have many Instances of a <hi>Practice,</hi> according to that <hi>Precept,</hi> in Joel 2.12. <hi>Turn ye to God, with all your Heart, with weeping, and with mourning.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Tears</hi> of the <hi>Eye,</hi> are to be expected of men, more or less, according to their <hi>Natural Constitutions.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000755_0009_0FAA5009D58CC4F8"/>
It is desirable, that the <hi>Eye,</hi> which has been the Grand <hi>Broker for Sin,</hi> should by its <hi>Tears</hi> bear its part in discovering the passions of our minds thereupon. But where the <hi>Eye,</hi> does not Naturally afford so free a Channel to that Brine, which the compression and constriction of the <hi>Brain</hi> upon <hi>Grief</hi> produceth, we have still our <hi>Sighs,</hi> which <hi>Austin,</hi> well calls, our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Tears.</hi> And now, O our <hi>Tears,</hi> where are you!</p>
            <p>We read concerning a General Assembly, in <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.1. <hi>An Angel of the Lord came unto them, and said, I brought you unto the Land, which I sware unto your Fathers; but ye have not obeyed my voice; wherefore there shall yet be Thorns in your sides: And it came to pass, when the Angel of the Lord spake these words, the people lift up their voice and wept; And they called the Name of the place Bochim</hi>; i. e. Weepers. Oh! why should not <hi>Boston</hi> this Day, be thus called <hi>Bochim.</hi> So <hi>Autocratorically</hi> spoke that <hi>Angel,</hi> that it seems to have been the <hi>Messiah</hi> himself, appearing in an Humane Shape; even, the same <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> that had formerly appeared unto <hi>Joshua</hi> at <hi>Gilgal</hi>; and therefore 'tis here said, <hi>He came up from Gilgal.</hi> Permit a poor Servant of that Blessed <hi>Messiah,</hi> thus to Expostulate with you; <hi>The Lord of Heaven from whom I come unto you, brought our Fathers into this Good Land, which He provided for us; But we have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000755_0010_0FAA500A65BC6E50"/>
not obey'd His voice; and this our Disobedience He has chastised with continual Thorns in our sides.</hi> Why should we not <hi>Lift up our voice</hi> &amp; <hi>weep,</hi> at such doleful Tidings!</p>
            <p>I am sure there are such Things as these to bespeak our <hi>Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The Horrid <hi>Sins</hi> committed in the Land, yea, commonly committed, loudly call for our <hi>Tears.</hi> Alas, it may be said of us, That <hi>we have been Drinking in Iniquity like water.</hi> How much ought we then to, <hi>Drop it away in Tears,</hi> as I may say, when we <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bloody</hi> Crimes, like those, the Imputation whereof, made our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Sweat</hi> out His very <hi>Blood,</hi> have abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us; and will they not cause us to <hi>weep</hi>? Truly, <hi>Tears of Blood,</hi> were little enough to bewayl our <hi>Bloody, Scarlet, Crimson</hi> Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. There is not one of all the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> in the Law, which our God has given us, but people are notoriously violating of it, from one end of the Land unto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. While our Land is full of Unconverted, Unrenewed, Unsanctifyed <hi>Sinners,</hi> how should it be any other than full of all <hi>Ungodliness</hi>! And yet such is the vast multitude of <hi>Dead Souls</hi> among us, or of Souls which do not <hi>Live</hi> unto God, by vertue of <hi>Union</hi> with the Lord Jesus Christ, that we may with Horror say, <hi>There is hardly an House, in which there is not one

That the <hi>Institutions</hi> of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ are shamefully neglected, and the <hi>Superstitions</hi> of a <hi>vain Conversation</hi> practised? That the <hi>Names, Words, Works</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Providences,</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are most Irreverently &amp; Unprofitably look'd upon? And, That we have a <hi>Profane</hi> Indisposition to the <hi>Sabbaths</hi> of the Lord? Shall we not <hi>Mourn</hi> when we see the <hi>Disorder</hi> which confounds all Societies, and the <hi>Selfishness</hi> which depraves the most in all Societies? Our <hi>Hating</hi> &amp; <hi>Vexing</hi> of one another? Our <hi>Unchastity</hi> in all sorts of <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?</hi> Our <hi>Injustice</hi> in our Dealings? Our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold <hi>Falshood</hi> in our Affayrs? Our <hi>Discontent</hi> in every Station? We could, in a <hi>Synod</hi> of our Churches, near Seventeen years ago, charge our selves with Epidemical Breaches of all the Rules
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000755_0012_0FAA500BD2D1C3A8"/>
of <hi>Love,</hi> to God, and man. And verily, t'would be a brave Sponge to Dry up our <hi>Tears,</hi> if we could say, that we are mended since the Admonitions of that faithful <hi>Synod,</hi> But besides the more common Violations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law among us, there are more Special out-breakings of Sin, in the midst of us, for which, no <hi>Tears</hi> are enough. We may say, but Oh! not without our <hi>Tears,</hi> as in Jer. 5.30. <hi>A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful &amp; Horrible Thing is committed in the Land.</hi> The Land was fearfully Defiled, by the Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which were the first Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Now, is it not <hi>A Wonderful &amp; an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Thing,</hi> for so many <hi>English</hi> that have Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded them, to <hi>Indianize,</hi> and by the <hi>Indian</hi> Vices of <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Idleness,</hi> and <hi>Sorcery,</hi> and a notorious want of all <hi>Family-Discipline,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obnoxious unto the old Score, and Store of wrath due unto the Land? Is it not <hi>a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful &amp; an Horrible thing,</hi> that the Sins of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> should so much prevail in a Land, which was once a <hi>Land of Uprightness?</hi> For, <hi>this was the Iniquity of our Sister Sodom, Pride, Fulness of Bread, and Abundance of Idleness; neither did she strengthen the Hand of the Poor &amp; Needy</hi>: The whole <hi>Spirit</hi> of all their <hi>Dealings,</hi> was, it seems, a General contrivance to <hi>Oppress,</hi> one another. Is it not a <hi>Wonderful &amp; an Horrible Thing,</hi> that in such a Land as this, there should be the Sins that made the <hi>Old Land of Canaan, Vomit out

her Inhabitants</hi>? For so did those Infandous, &amp; Confounded, Mixtures, that have openly shown their Heads among our selves. There was a Time, when one Returning from hence to <hi>England,</hi> could in a Sermon to a very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Auditory, give this Report concerning us, <hi>I have been Seven years in a Country, where I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beheld one common Beggar, I never saw one man Drunk; I never heard one Profane Oath, for all the Time of my being there.</hi> But is it not a <hi>Wonderful &amp; an Horrible Thing,</hi> that the Vices of <hi>Drinking</hi> &amp; <hi>Swearing,</hi> are now every Day, the objects of our Observation; I pray, let it be a <hi>Sorrowful</hi> Observation? And is it not a <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful &amp; an Horrible Thing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it should be a Complaint made about <hi>New England, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness once Lodged in it, but now Murderers</hi>? I do speak it, with a Great concern of Soul; The <hi>Tears</hi> of a bitter Detestation, are necessary to cleanse this Land, from the Guilt &amp; Shame, of the <hi>Murderous</hi> Things, that have been with too much credibility Reported, as done by some <hi>New-Englanders</hi>! God forbid, That I should Reproach my Country. As the Apostle could say, <hi>I do not make my Appeal, as having any thing to Accuse my Nation of</hi>: So I would say, <hi>I do not Accuse my County, of any Thing, but what any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation may as much be charged withal.</hi> But, when <hi>Caesar</hi> saw one that was nearly Related unto himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Stabbing of him, he cryed out, with a Singular Agony, <hi>What? You my Son! Have I a Son among you!</hi> Thus, there is <hi>this</hi> Aggravation upon all of our Miscarriages: Our Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven may thus Argue with us; <hi>If other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do Wound me by their Sins, 'tis not such a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and horrible Thing: But for you, O my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of</hi> New England, <hi>a People that for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Gospel, I have known above the other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth; a People that are obliged unto me, above the rest of mankind: For these Vile Things to be done among you, my Children</hi>! Oh! This is a <hi>Lamentation, &amp; it should be for a Lamentation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, No <hi>Tears</hi> are enough to Bewayl the visible <hi>Degeneracy,</hi> which is to be Instanced, let me <hi>plainly,</hi> and <hi>humbly</hi> say so! in all Orders of men throughout the Land. When there was a Second Edition of the <hi>Temple,</hi> among the People of God, it is noted, in Neh. 3.12. <hi>The Ancient men, who had seen the first House, when the Foundation of this House was laid before their Eyes, they wept with a loud voice.</hi> Truly, the few <hi>Ancient men</hi> that are left among us, do <hi>weep with a loud voice,</hi> when they see how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably <hi>Temple-work</hi> is now circumstanced, in the <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third</hi> Generation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Tho' we may <hi>Shout aloud for joy,</hi> when we see <hi>so much</hi> of Christ, and of <hi>Truth,</hi> and of <hi>Grace,</hi> among us; for indeed, <hi>so much</hi> there is, that if they who talk of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

would please to stay, as methinks they should, until they hear of a Country that has proportionably more of CHRIST in it, there would for the present, be little said of a Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val! Yet let not this Hinder our joyning with such as <hi>weep with a loud voice</hi> for our Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. It is affirmed, That many sorts of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Creatures, when Transplanted from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> into <hi>America,</hi> do Degenerate by the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation; But if this Remark must be made upon the <hi>People</hi> too, what can we do, but spend our <hi>Tears</hi> upon such a sad Remark? Our Lord Jesus Christ from Heaven seems to bestow that Rebuke upon us, in Jer. 2.21. <hi>I planted thee a Noble Vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How then art thou Turned into the Degenerate Plant of a strange vine unto me! New England</hi> once had a famous Governour, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Hopkins</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> whose words were, <hi>I fear, I fear, the Sins of</hi> New-England <hi>will e're long be read in its punishments.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000755_0016_0FAA501109DA3398"/>
It must be acknowledged unto the praise of God, that <hi>New-England</hi> is yet Blessed with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Worthy men in all Orders; but alas, we have not such a <hi>Choice</hi> of them, as once we had. I suppose, 'twere easy to single out, it may be, less than <hi>Twenty men,</hi> upon whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from us, all our Affairs would be <hi>Palsey-struck,</hi> with an Irrecoverable Feebleness, and the Countrey would almost fall, for want of <hi>Pillars</hi> to support it. Indeed, the best symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom that <hi>New-England</hi> has to boast of, is an <hi>Hopeful Issue,</hi> of Learned and Pious <hi>Young men,</hi> from a well-governed <hi>Colledge</hi>; a <hi>Colledge,</hi> which the Sons of Barbarity among us, perhaps care not, if it might be <hi>Rased unto the ground.</hi> But those thy Sons, O <hi>New-England,</hi> will be no sooner Hatch'd and Fledg'd, but it may be, they will fly away from thee, as fast as they can. Among the First Planters of <hi>New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> there was a vast variety of Generous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notable, <hi>Brave Spirited</hi> men; yea, some of those very men, that were afterwards found able to conquer and manage mighty Kingdoms, would have been but <hi>New England</hi> Farmers, if their silly Persecutors had not hindred them: <hi>Choice Grain from three sifted Nations</hi> filled this Wilderness.

I pray, mark what I say; I wonder exceedingly, How any Church dare proceed so far as to vote, and call a Minister, for their fixed Service, until they have by a <hi>Day of Prayer,</hi> first made their <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for His Direction: The jealous Lord Jesus Christ, may justly show them, that they <hi>make more Haste than good speed,</hi> when the <hi>chief Shepherd,</hi> is thus forgotten with them. Whereas, if you will go to the Lord Jesus Christ, O ye <hi>Flocks</hi> of the Lord; He will give you those <hi>Pastors,</hi> that shall be <hi>Good men, and Full of the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp; men, by whom <hi>there shall be much people added unto the Lord</hi>: Men, in whom you shall be, on a thousand accounts unspeakably Happy, as long as they live among you.</p>

God is at Hand!</hi> This is not meer <hi>Conjecture,</hi> or <hi>Opinion</hi>; but there is <hi>Demonstration,</hi> I assert nothing short of <hi>Demonstration</hi> for it. For, I pray, when the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> managed by his <hi>Vicar</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> is Expired, whose <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall next Succeed upon it? Now, Tis very certain, That there will be no more than <hi>Twelve Hundred &amp; Sixty</hi> years allow'd unto that Papal Kingdom: Tis very certain, That when <hi>Ten</hi> Soveraign Kings arise, in the broken Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, the <hi>Twelve Hundred &amp; Sixty</hi> years of the Papal Kingdom, are Commenced: And It is very certain, That by the middle of the <hi>Fifth</hi> century, <hi>Ten</hi> several Distinct Kingdomes, took advantage from the Distractions then upon the Roman Empire, to set up for themselves. By this Calculation, we have nothing less than a Demonstration, that the <hi>Papal Kingdom,</hi> ha's the last Sands, of its last <hi>Hour-glass,</hi> now run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for it. Nor is it <hi>Unlikely,</hi> no, but all Things conspire, even to <hi>Demonstration</hi> it self, That the last <hi>Half Time,</hi> or, Hundred and Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score years, of the Papal Kingdom, Entred at the <hi>Reformation</hi> in the <hi>Former Century.</hi> All the <hi>Schaemes,</hi> that put off this most <hi>Happy Period,</hi> unto further and future Ages, are easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of manifest <hi>Inconsistences:</hi> And therefore, I question, whether there be so much as one Judicious and Considerate Student, in those Prophecies, which, <hi>Blessed are they that Study,</hi> but

what concurs to this Expectation, <hi>That the Kingdom of God is at Hand. Lift up your Heads</hi> then, O you that <hi>Love the Appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> For there seems as if there were an <hi>Age of Miracles</hi> now <hi>Dawning</hi> upon us. Proper <hi>Miracles</hi> were continued in the Church of God, for Two or Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together, even until the Antichristian <hi>Apostasy</hi> was come on to some Extremity. And when that <hi>Apostasy</hi> is over, tis possible, there may be a Return of proper <hi>Miracles</hi>; those, <hi>Powers of the World to come.</hi> Such <hi>Miracles</hi> have been lately Wrought, more than two or three of them, in the City of <hi>London,</hi> that, what if they should be a Few Drops of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> falling before a Mighty Shower of that <hi>Spirit?</hi> Persons who have had their <hi>Limbs</hi> miserably disjointed, Persons that have had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate <hi>Palseyes,</hi> Incurable <hi>Fistula's,</hi> Desperate <hi>Leprosies</hi>; These Persons, as they have been Reading the Ancient <hi>Miracles</hi> of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ hath wonderfully given them, the <hi>Faith</hi> of His doing the like for them; and Behold, they have, to the Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mankind, been by the like <hi>Miracles,</hi> perfectly and presently recovered out of all their Maladies.

Yea, There was a Time, when the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000755_0048_0FAA502B24BF16D8"/>
pursued a whole Company of Sea faring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a Storm came upon them, that had like to have Sunk them all: No doubt, they were as faulty and as vicious, as any other Sea-faring Folks use to be: Nevertheless, the Storm came for the Sins, of that person, that one would have least suspected among them all; than man was the <hi>Jonas,</hi> whose Error had Expos'd them all. So <hi>Uunsearchable are the Judgments of God!</hi> And that which renders them yet more <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable</hi> is, The wondrous <hi>Distance of Time,</hi> which the Lord may take, to punish a people, for <hi>Former Iniquities,</hi> and even (as that passage of Scripture which I am now quoting, may be Translated) for the <hi>Iniquities of those that have gone before them.</hi> The Children of <hi>Jacob</hi> were once brought into astonishing Distresses; and in those Distresses, Then <hi>Josephs Bloody Coat</hi> is laid before their Eyes; The Hard <hi>Things</hi> done by them to a <hi>Brother</hi> of theirs, Things done <hi>Twenty years ago,</hi> so came unto Remembrance, as to make them cry out with Horror, <hi>We are verily Guilty!</hi> If none of all these Instances are enough to perplex our Thoughts, about the <hi>Unsearchable Judgments of God,</hi> I'le give you one more. I take Notice, That when <hi>David</hi> Numbred the <hi>People,</hi> there was a <hi>Great Sin</hi> cleaving to that matter; and it was not Holy <hi>David</hi> alone, but it was the <hi>People,</hi> whom the Lord was in that matter chiefly offended at.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:000755_0049_0FAA502DDBD44480"/>
God had Required, That when the People were Numbred, <hi>Every man should give a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for his Soul unto the Lord, That there be no Plague among them</hi> (says he) <hi>when thou Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest them.</hi> Now, because the Lord had a Controversy with that People, for their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Iniquities,</hi> he leaves <hi>David,</hi> the Best man in the Nation, to act in this weighty matter, without the Advice of the <hi>Priests of the Lord</hi>; Hence, tho' it was not a Sin simply to <hi>Number the People,</hi> yet the <hi>People</hi> not being put upon their part, that they might be <hi>Ransomed</hi> from a <hi>Plague</hi> among them, it became a Sin and a Snare unto them: Now, as an effect hereof, I take Notice of a strange Threatning, in 2 Sam. 24.13. <hi>Shall seven years of Famine come unto thee, in thy Land?</hi> Whereas, the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning runs no more than so, in 1 Chron. 21.12. <hi>Three years of Famine.</hi> I pray, How shall these two passages be Reconciled? Attend, and you shall see a very Remarkable Thing, in the Reconciliation. There had been <hi>Three Years</hi> of a Famine upon the People, for an old Sin, of slaying the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>; God thus chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the people, for a Sin that had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more than Forty years before: and while the <hi>Fourth Year</hi> was Running, there was that <hi>New Provocation,</hi> about the <hi>Numbring</hi> of the People, added unto the former: and that <hi>Fourth year</hi> being well nigh Expired, <hi>Three years</hi>

more of a Famine denounced, make up the <hi>Seven</hi>: The first of which <hi>seven years</hi> Famine, was the year that next followed after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Absalom:</hi> as <hi>That</hi> was Forty Years, after the Anointing of <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Oh! What a world of <hi>Intricacies,</hi> were there, in these Dispensations of Providence! The only Thing, that I design here to Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, from the mention of these Intricate &amp; Mysterious Matters is, A most Self-jealous and Self-loathing, <hi>Humility of Soul,</hi> in our Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, after those Things, that are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as <hi>Provoking Evils,</hi> e're peace will be Restored unto our Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This is very sure, that this Land has often had its <hi>Dayes of Temptation</hi>; and when the People of God come with <hi>Second Thoughts</hi> to Reflect upon those dayes, they often see cause to cry out, <hi>Peccavimus omnes</hi>: we have one and all been out of the way. On the whole, The <hi>Temper</hi> which I would propound is This; Let us not be without some <hi>Suspicion,</hi> that our God may be Angry with us, for some <hi>Evil</hi> or other, which is not yet universally Acknowledged: But yet let us manage that <hi>Suspicion</hi> so Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, so Modestly, so Seriously, that we may not thereby add a <hi>New Evil</hi> unto the old score. 'Tis very certain, That when a <hi>Secret Cause</hi> of a Divine Controversy, is Enquired after, there is nothing more usual, than for
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000755_0051_0FAA502EE7E0ADE0"/>
men <hi>to Enquire not wisely concerning that matter.</hi> An Assembly of <hi>Lutherans</hi> coming together to Enquire, after the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Judgments</hi> which God had brought upon their Churches, most unhappily determined, <hi>That their not paying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect enough unto Images, in their Churches, was one cause of the Lords Controversy with them.</hi> Unhappy Enquirers; Instead of your Dream that you had not Sinn'd enough against the <hi>Second Commandment,</hi> you should have thought whether you had not Sinn'd too much against the <hi>Fourth.</hi> But we hear not a word, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their universal prophanations of the <hi>Lords-Day</hi> to this Day. That which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore say, is This; In a just Apprehension of our own <hi>Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Weakness,</hi> Let us make that Prayer to our Lord, <hi>Lord, show us where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou contendest with us.</hi> Let us then have our <hi>Debates,</hi> with one another hereupon; but let us come to those <hi>Debates,</hi> alwayes with a <hi>Disposition</hi> to judge our selves rather than any one else, and a <hi>Resolation</hi> to take any shame to our selves, that Scripture and Reason, shall cast upon us. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In pursuing the Designs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> why should not <hi>Every man,</hi> even <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one</hi> concern himself, according to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi> of the Station, wherein God has placed them? That a General <hi>Reformation</hi> may be effected, <hi>Every man</hi> should begin with <hi>Himself</hi>;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000755_0052_0FAA503046C57D70"/>
and if <hi>Every man</hi> would <hi>mend one,</hi> the <hi>Emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manners</hi> among us, would indeed be very general. Men should be as desirous in point of <hi>Repentance,</hi> as they use to be in point of <hi>Charity,</hi> to <hi>Begin at Home! Self-Reformation</hi> every where conscientiously endeavoured, would prevent a double <hi>Evil,</hi> very <hi>common under the Sun.</hi> Sometimes, men make a Noise about <hi>Reformation,</hi> when they do but follow the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of their own <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Revenge,</hi> in all the Noise. There was once, a <hi>Shimei,</hi> who, seeing the Judgments of God come upon the Land, he presently fell to Railing at the chief Rulers in the Land: he falls upon <hi>David,</hi> with such out-cries, as those, in 2. Sam. 16.8. <hi>Thou Bloody m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, the Lord has now Returned all the Blood of the House of Saul, in whose stead thou hast Reigned.</hi> This poor man, was himself of <hi>the House of Saul,</hi> and because he thought his <hi>own House</hi> had met with some hard measure from the <hi>Government,</hi> he falls to Reviling as if the Land had no Sins, but those of the <hi>Government</hi> then to answer for. But I can tell you, That he was egregiously mistaken! And men had need beware, lest by giving way to their own exasperated Spirits and Passions, they become <hi>Shimei's,</hi> in exclaming for a <hi>Reformation.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again, there is a cry made about <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> by men that only cover their own vile <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> by the Diversion of such a cry. 'Tis
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000755_0053_0FAA5030782DCE30"/>
very clear, that there are <hi>Vanities</hi> of Apparel to be Rebuked and Retrenched among us; those little Female, foolish <hi>Vanities,</hi> are <hi>utterly a Fault among us:</hi> the Holy <hi>Angels</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, are doubtless grieved, when they see the <hi>Flags,</hi> and <hi>Signs</hi> of a vain mind, hung out by the children of men; else the Lord would never have said, as in Isa. 3.16. <hi>Because the Daughters of Zion are Haughty, and walk with stretched forth Necks, therefore the Lord will take away the Bravery of their Tinkling Ornaments, &amp; thy men shall fall by the Sword.</hi> But now there are persons, who are themselves <hi>Drones,</hi> or <hi>Thieves,</hi> or <hi>Cheats,</hi> or <hi>Lyars,</hi> of <hi>Drunkards,</hi> or <hi>Fornicators,</hi> or some other way horribly <hi>Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Creatures</hi>: And these, to quiet their own guilty Consciences, will Declame very bitterly against certain <hi>Vanities</hi> in other people, and perhaps will with more <hi>pride</hi> than <hi>Scripture,</hi> croud in many lawful and needful Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those <hi>Vanities</hi>: These are the Things that want <hi>Reformation,</hi> they say; But thou wouldest say it, with a better Grace, O man, if some of the zeal were spent upon thy own Enormities. However, Thus they'l fall into a fiery rage about those Things, <hi>As if nothing else brought the Judgments of God upon the Land.</hi> But that which we are first of all to do, is This: It becomes <hi>every one</hi> of us, first of all to <hi>Judge</hi> themselves, and throw the <hi>First Stone,</hi> at

               <hi>pernicious Things</hi> among us, which have been Recommended unto these <hi>Worshipful</hi> Persons, may likewise be most profitably practised, by the <hi>Grand-Jury-men,</hi> the <hi>Constables,</hi> the <hi>Tithing-men,</hi> in their several Precincts.

            <p>But above all, O ye <hi>Watchmen</hi> in our <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; 'Tis from <hi>You,</hi> that the Lord Jesus Christ expects the most critical <hi>watchfulness,</hi> in Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your several <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Charges,</hi> of the several <hi>Evils,</hi> that are to be Reformed among them.

there is Danger that they will <hi>never be Healed,</hi> but <hi>be given to Salt for ever:</hi> there is Danger, that <hi>a Wrath unto the uttermost will overtake them.</hi> And now, there are further Instances of our <hi>Watchfulness,</hi> over our own Flocks, to be maintained. It may be, 'twould be one very significant piece of our <hi>Watchfulness,</hi> over the Churches, if some safe methods might be taken, that all those who go forth unto the Work of the Ministry, might carry with them some Testimonial of their Qualifications, from fit Judges of those Qualifications; and that Raw, Rude, Lewd Young Men, and profane Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi> may not go forth, to make a <hi>Living</hi> of their <hi>Preaching,</hi> and Ruine Christianity among us, by not <hi>Living</hi> according to their <hi>Preaching.</hi> Yea, I do earnestly Beseech the Congregations of <hi>New England,</hi> That, if they have any Regard unto the <hi>Things of their Peace,</hi> they would none of them, Invite, or Accept, any man, to constant Preaching among them, unless that some Holy, and Faithful, and Able Pastors of other Churches, do, upon a thorough Trial, Testify, <hi>That such a man is Worthy to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and be very Highly Esteemed for his Labour, among them.</hi> Nor is this All that we have to do. Can we not, in <hi>Visiting</hi> our <hi>Flocks,</hi> inform our selves about the <hi>Morals</hi> of our People, in every Quarter, and thereupon both Publickly and Privately set our selves to cure all that shall
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000755_0058_0FAA503432D5EE68"/>
be found amiss! May we <hi>Lift up our voice like a Trumpet,</hi> against every thing that we see of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive unto our Lord Jesus Christ; and let us therefore, by the Anticipations of our Faith, have in our Ears continually, the Sound of the <hi>Last Trumpet,</hi> which will fetch us before the Tribunal of our Lord. Much, very, very much will be done towards a Glorious <hi>Reformation,</hi> by our Discharging the work of our Ministry, as under the Awe of that most awful Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in Heb. 13.17. <hi>They watch for Souls, as they that must give an Account.</hi> I Remember, Tis Related concerning the Holy Mr. <hi>Herbert Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> That observing of Sundry Evils to have been become common in his Town of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> he took such Pains to convince the People of those Evils, that at last, they generally Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Instrument, wherein they Declared their <hi>Dislike</hi> of those Evils, and their <hi>Purpose</hi> to take heed of them forever; and a wondrous <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> ensued upon it. Syrs, who can tell, how far the concern of <hi>Reformation</hi> may possess the Hearts of our People, in almost every Town, if we took due pains to convince them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them; yea, if our Personal, Prudent, Loving Admonitions, might but operate, upon that one part of Neighbours, the <hi>Inn-keepers,</hi> who can tell how far the Desired <hi>Reformation</hi> might be Befriended and Attained! But this leads me into another Article of our Discourse.</p>

               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:000755_0059_0FAA50353064D6F8"/>Fourthly. To Assist the Designs of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among us, Why should we not Review, &amp; Renew, and Apply, the <hi>Obligation,</hi> which is by <hi>Covenant</hi> Lying upon us thereunto? If one would say at once, what it is, that hath procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indignation of Heaven against us, to be written in such Dismal and Bloody Characters, methinks, I could find a passage in our Psalter, that should Expressively enough describe it. While the Time was not yet come, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> should be delivered out of their Difficulties, the Active Colony of <hi>Ephrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> formed a Lively <hi>Expedition,</hi> against the <hi>Philistines</hi> to the <hi>North-ward,</hi> from whom they had Received many Injuries; they reckon'd themselves Numerous and Powerful enough, to attack the <hi>Canaanites</hi> in their own Country; but they came off unhappy loosers in it; and the Psalmist ha's told us, what was the reason of the loss that befel them: T'was, as in Psal. 78.10 Because, <hi>They kept not the Covenant of God.</hi> This I venture to say, whatever else may be said; <hi>Covenant-Breaking,</hi> I say, <hi>Covenant-Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or, the Neglect, and Contempt of that <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> even, the <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> wherein the Lord Jesus Christ, ha's been tendring Himself unto us; <hi>This,</hi> is the most comprehensive Cause of all our <hi>Disasters.</hi> I will say so, as long as I can Read that horrid Picture of our own condition, in Isa. 24.4. — <hi>the Lord makes the Land Empty,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000755_0060_0FAA5035D513BC98"/>
and makes it wast, and turns it upside down, and Scatters abroad the Inhabitants thereof; The Land mourns and fades.</hi> And why is all this? <hi>Because they have broken the everlasting Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inhabitants of the Land are Burned, &amp; few men are left.</hi> Wherefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we would be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of our Condition, 'tis the <hi>Covenant</hi> of our God, that must Recover us, &amp; <hi>Reform</hi> us. 'Tis imagined by some, That when the General Assembly of <hi>Israel</hi> here, <hi>Poured out Water before, the Lord,</hi> they used a Rite of making of a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; q. d. If we Return to our Sins, let our <hi>Blood</hi> be thus <hi>Poured out.</hi> This we all know; A Renovation of <hi>Covenant,</hi> ha's been alwayes pressed, as a very special and Important Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of <hi>Reformation.</hi> The <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is <hi>Brought</hi> unto us all, is very particularly <hi>Seal'd</hi> and <hi>Own'd,</hi> with such as have been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto any <hi>Ecclesiastical Priviledges</hi> among us. Let all Persons, by the Help of <hi>Grace,</hi> give the consent of their Souls unto this <hi>Covenant</hi>; Consent, O Immortal Souls, That God should be your <hi>God,</hi> and be unto you, better than all your Idols; that the Lord Jesus Christ should be your <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> and <hi>King</hi>; that the Holy Spirit should Possess you, and incline you to Glorify Him according to the Gracious Terms of this <hi>Covenant</hi> for ever. But then, Let them that have Enjoy'd the <hi>Seals</hi> of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again, with all possible Solemnity
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000755_0061_0FAA50366D4E8E78"/>
Repeat the Consent of their Souls thereunto. Syrs, A most wondrous <hi>Reformation</hi> would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon Immediately! Now, In the do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of this Thing, Why should not our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, most Explicitly <hi>Apply,</hi> the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> unto all the Designs of <hi>Reformation,</hi> as well as they <hi>Apply</hi> it unto the particular Designs, of a <hi>Particular Church-state</hi> before the Lord? Our <hi>Covenant</hi> will to the most Edification, and the most Satisfaction, be <hi>Renewed,</hi> when we most of all Express the <hi>Spirit of the New<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ant</hi> in all that we do. Now, 'Tis the <hi>Spirit of the New Covenant,</hi> for us to Acknowledge, That our <hi>Justification</hi> only by <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and our <hi>Surety,</hi> does powerfully oblige us to <hi>Depart from all Iniquity</hi>: And, Then, to Acknowledge, That this and that Evil Thing, whereof we are advised, is an <hi>Iniquity,</hi> from which we do, with our very Hearts within us, Desire to <hi>Depart</hi> for ever: But with such Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, we are to <hi>Protest</hi> in all Sincerity of Soul, That we ask the <hi>Grace</hi> of Heaven, to <hi>Watch</hi> against every such <hi>Abominable Thing,</hi> both in our selves, and in one another. What one <hi>Christian</hi> upon Earth would scruple to consent unto such <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> and <hi>Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi>? Now, if our <hi>Churches,</hi> yea, and other <hi>Societies</hi> too, would thus use the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> with pertinent Applications thereof, to every <hi>New Iniquity,</hi> that they Discern arising

And shall I add this one thing more? There are many sorts of <hi>Officers</hi> among us, that are under very special <hi>Oaths,</hi> unto God, for <hi>Well-Doing</hi>; and these would surely <hi>Do well,</hi> to have Copies of their <hi>Oaths,</hi> well Explained unto them, often before their Eyes.

            <p>But then, Lastly, to put an <hi>Edge</hi> upon these Things; That we may be in Earnest about the Necessary <hi>Reformation,</hi> Let us consider the loud calls of Heaven, that most earnestly bespeak it of us. <hi>The Necessity of Reformation,</hi> is a Thing that ha's been long and oft Preach'd unto us, ever since that the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, began to make us more generally miserable; but the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God, are going on still to further and further Degrees of misery upon us, while the <hi>Cares</hi> of a <hi>Necessary Reformation,</hi> continue fast asleep in our Souls. We do one year after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother feel the formidable Executions, of those Threatnings, in Lev. 26 23. <hi>If ye will not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by me, through these things, but will walk contrary unto me, Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and I will Punish you yet Seven Times for your Sins.</hi> Our most Intolerable Indisposition, to do any Significant Thing, towards our <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Reformation,</hi> ha's been already Revenged, with <hi>Sore Plagues, and of long Continuance</hi>; Yea, The Lord ha's made our <hi>Plagues Wonderful,</hi> for this our Obdurate &amp; Obstinate Impaenitency. Wherefore, As they cryed unto <hi>Pharaoh, Let the men go; knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:000755_0065_0FAA503BC33E8160"/>
Even such a cry must I this Day awaken you withal; <hi>Know you not, that</hi> New-England, <hi>is very near destroy'd, by the Sins that have been Harboured among us?</hi> Oh! Let them <hi>Go!</hi> Let them <hi>Go</hi>! Lest we perish in them. Christians, Let us take Warning. There have been many <hi>Thousands,</hi> I say, many <hi>Thousands,</hi> of Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> not much less famous for the Protestant Religion, than that little Handful &amp; Hundred of Churches, whereof this Country is composed; Every one of which, have been made an utter Desolation, within these few years; even since the Time that so Young a Man as I am, came into the World. And, is not the Fate of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a Solemn Warning to us, in these <hi>Ends of the World?</hi> I say again, Let us take the Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, <hi>Repent, Lest we likewise Perish.</hi> Don't you see, the Tokens of the Divine Wrath against us, arise apace towards an horrible Extremity? <hi>O Lord, They who dwell in these uttermost parts, are afraid at thy Tokens</hi>! I'l say only these Two Things. One thing is this; If there be not an Extraordinary Appearance of <hi>God, from Heaven,</hi> to give a check unto a Great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> who is at this Day Troubling all the <hi>European</hi> Waters, <hi>New-England</hi> will be soon overwhelmed in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. Another thing is this; If we should have such a <hi>Summer</hi> this year, as we had the last, for the <hi>Unseasonable Weather,</hi> which, alas, hitherto does hold, upon the Fruits of the Earth,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:000755_0066_0FAA503D59094958"/>
the Desolation of <hi>New-England</hi> will be more horrid, than any Tongue, ha's hitherto Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or Heart Conceived. On every side of us then, we have that cry Roaring in our Ears, <hi>Reformation, or Desolation! Reformation, or Deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>! Oh! Tis <hi>High Time to Awake out of our Sleep,</hi> and to do some Signal Thing for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of our Land.
