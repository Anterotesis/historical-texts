            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE metaphorical Terms in which our Text is delivered, are plain and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.

            <p>THE Scope of our SAVIOUR then in our Text is plainly this.

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003167_0010_0FF087E21CBB2DC8"/>take up our abode in a State of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction and Miſery, or of Everlaſting Life and Happineſs? On the one hand, would not the Happineſs of Heaven, which is ſo worthy of the deſire and purſuit of a reaſonable Creature, awaken our more ſollicitous Cares, and excite our earneſt and unwearied Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſecure it? On the other hand, would not the Miſery comprehended in an everlaſting Deſtruction fill us with greater Dread and Horror, and make many more among us appear concerned to fly from the Wrath to come, and inquiſitive what they ſhould do to be ſaved? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, inſtead of this, how unconcerned and unaffected are many, that bear the name of Chriſtians, about their future State? Whoſe Lives would rather induce us to think, they know of no Happineſs to be deſired, no Miſery to be feared in another World. O that we may none of us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge this ſtupid Security, but all more than ever realize this Truth, That in a little time everlaſting Deſtruction will be our Portion, unleſs we make ſure of everlaſting Life, before we dye.</p>
            <p>LET us therefore make theſe two fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture States of exiſtence the ſubject of our frequent and ſerious Meditation, when we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003167_0011_0FF087E4A539A5D8"/>lye down, and when we ariſe, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we retire for Devotion. This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will be likely to affect us with a juſt Concern for our moſt important Intereſts; and to excite our utmoſt Endeavours to avoid everlaſting Deſtruction, and ſecure everlaſting Life.</p>
            <p>AND let none of us any longer defer and put off this Concern about our future State. For this, if any thing in the world, I mean the taking care of our Souls with regard to Eternity, is the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; And through the undeſerved Favour of GOD we have yet a Space allowed us, wherein we may do ſomething to eſcape eternal Deſtruction, and lay hold on eternal Life. But if we conſider what a ſhort and uncertain Space this is, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at fartheſt on the Life of Man, which is but a vapour that appeareth for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and then vaniſheth away; I ſay, if we conſider this, we ſhall find it cannot be long before all of us here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are either ſaved or damned. And when everlaſting Deſtruction and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life depend and turn upon a few Moments with us, we have ſurely no time for Delay: but whatever our hand findeth to do, we ſhould do it with our might, making haſte to get ready for the

            <p>Now true <hi>Faith</hi> in the LORD JESUS CHRIST is not a mere Aſſent to the truth of the Goſpel; but a ſaving Grace of the HOLY SPIRIT, whereby we are inclined and enabled to receive JESUS CHRIST, as He is offered to us in the Goſpel: conſenting that He ſhould be to <hi>us</hi> all that He engaged to be to the People of GOD; and relying upon Him to ſave us to the uttermoſt, in the way of the New Covenant. This Faith worketh by Love, purifies the Heart, and overcomes the World: and it is the Way that leadeth unto Life; <hi>For</hi> GOD <hi>ſo loved the world; that he gave His only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on Him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>iſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>
            <p>THIS Faith is always accompanied with true <hi>Evangelical Repentance;</hi> by which I do not mean a flighty Sorrow for Sin, ariſing from Fear of GOD'S Anger, and an Apprehenſion of Puniſhment; but
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003167_0018_0FF087F874C6BA18"/>a hearty Turning from all Sin to GOD in CHRIST; attended with Hatred of it, and Shame &amp; Sorrow for having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gracious &amp; holy GOD, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our own Souls; and with a firm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and full Purpoſe of Heart to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after New Obedience. This Repentance alſo is the Way that leadeth unto Life. For as unleſs we repent we muſt periſh; ſo there is Mercy promiſed to true Penitents: and the <hi>Repentance not to be repented of,</hi> i. e. true and ſincere Repentance, is a <hi>Repentance unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.10.</p>
            <p>BUT then we muſt not flatter our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves, that our Repentance is thus true and ſincere; unleſs it be followed with a Life of <hi>New Obedience.</hi> And this is quite another thing than an honeſt Endeavour to comply with the Will of GOD, by any natural Strength and Power of our own. 'Tis an upright and conſtant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Endeavour after a Conformity of the whole Man to the whole good Will of GOD, as revealed to us by CHRIST in the Goſpel; ariſing from a new ſupernatural Principle of ſpiritual Life and Action pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the SPIRIT of GOD in a Work of Regeneration. In order to it we muſt be the <hi>workmanſhip of</hi> GOD, <hi>created in</hi>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 2.10.</note>. And that Courſe of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and external Obedience, which flows from ſuch a Principle produced in the Soul, by the gracious and powerful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the HOLY SPIRIT, is the Way that leadeth unto Life. For the Word of GOD aſſures us, that <hi>unto them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, He will render Eternal Life</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ro. 2.6, 7.</note>

            </p>
            <p>A Life of this Faith, Repentance and New Obedience is the Way that Jeadeth unto Heaven: and the <hi>only</hi> Way that will ever lead us to that happy State. Many indeed will fondly entertain Hopes of eternal Life and Happineſs, becauſe they are deſcended from pious Anceſtors; or from their Profeſſion of the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or from their external Relation to GOD in Covenant; or becauſe they are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003167_0020_0FF087FCCBDDE338"/>highly exalted and diſtinguiſhed with ſpiritual Priviledges; or from their moral Honeſty and deeds of Charity to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent; or from their Sorrow for Sin and viſible Reformation; or from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Reliance on the Mercy of GOD and Merits of CHRIST, although they take no care to ſecure &amp; evidence a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Intereſt therein: I ſay, many in the world will flatter themſelves with Hopes of Heaven and Happineſs upon ſome or other of theſe Conſiderations, or becauſe ſeveral of them are united together in their Character and Circumſtances; when they are all the while deſtitute of true Faith, Repentance, and New Obedience. But, alas, all theſe perſons will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dreadfully miſtaken. For all other Ways are but By-paths; which how fair and promiſing ſoever they may appear to them, will in the End lead down to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and leave them ſtrangers to the Way of Life.</p>
            <p>THUS the <hi>Way that leadeth to Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is the Way of Sin: and the <hi>Way that leadeth unto Life</hi> is the Way of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, comprehending Faith, Repentance, and New Obedience: Ways as different as the States of Exiſtence to which they tend.</p>

            <p>BUT then bad Examples, and wicked ſubtle Counſellors to do evil are not wanting in the World; which falling in with natural Corruption, and the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, render the Entrance into any Courſe of Sin ſtill more eaſy; and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003167_0025_0FF0880B5EB7B948"/>make men run into the Way of Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even with Greadineſs and Delight.</p>
            <p>IT often happens indeed, that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will check a man, when he is firſt entring upon a Courſe of ſin; and he is haunted with uneaſy Miſgivings for a while: but yet they who ſufficiently know themſelves will readily own, That the natural Bent of a Wicked Heart after the Gratification of corrupt Appetites, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the powerful Influence of Temptations from abroad, do often prove ſtrong enough to overcome the ſlight Miſgivings of Conſcience, the Exerciſe of natural Reaſon, and the Force of moral Swaſion; and make it a pleaſant and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy thing for a carnal man to enter into a Courſe of Sin, the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the <hi>Gate is Wide:</hi> ſo <hi>Broad</hi> is the <hi>Way</hi> that leadeth to Deſtruction; or, <hi>the Continuance and Progreſs in a ſinful Courſe is pleaſant and eaſy to a carnal Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN a life of Sin, there are ſo many things to be met with, ſuite to the evil Appetiles and Inclinations of men, as make it indeed the <hi>Broad Way;</hi> 'tis plain eaſy grateful and pleaſant; and the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003167_0026_0FF0880D83CC6598"/>Continuance in it is even more eaſy than the Entrance into it: as the <hi>Way</hi> is broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er than the <hi>Gate,</hi> which opens into it.</p>
            <p>IN this Way, how different ſoever the vicious Inclinations of Men may be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Tempers, Ages, Conditions and Employments; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Changes Men are liable to in any of theſe reſpects; there is a Variety of Paths to ſuit them all, and offer ſomething plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and agreeable to them, while they indulge the Deſires of their own Hearts. And a man may chuſe what Path he will: he may walk in <hi>the ways of his heart, and in the ſight of his eyes;</hi> than which there is nothing more pleaſant and agreeable to corrupt Nature; which hates Reſtraint, and loves to think, ſpeak, and act with a moſt licentious Liberty. This way af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no Rules or Maxims to abridge a man of taking his Fill of the Pleaſures of Sin, and indulging every Appetite: Or a man may exchange the Kinds of Sin, according to his own corrupt Inclination, leaving one for the ſake of another, which is grown more pleaſing to him; for in the broad Road to Deſtruction a man is not bound always to walk in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Path of Sin; but he may keep this, or take another, and there is a Liberty of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003167_0027_0FF08810197011D8"/>changing, as he pleaſes: Or to conſult his Intereſt or Reputation, he has in this Way a Liberty of cloaking Sin; he may forbear the open Practice of Sin, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge himſelf in the ſecret Commiſſion JO it, while he wears a Cloak and outward Shew of Religion; he is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put on Hypocriſy, if he cannot ſo well anſwer his ends, in the open and undiſguiſed Practice of Sin. Now what a broad and pleaſant Way muſt this be to a Carnal Heart, which allows Men a Liberty of running to the higheſt Degrees of Sin, or changing the Kinds of it, or co all with a Cloak of Religion, juſt as they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>THEN again, in this Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, however men are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards convinced of their Miſtake, yet when they have entred into the wide Gate, the Way before them looks very pleaſant; like a plain broad Road at a diſtance, promiſing abundance of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, Delight, and Satisfaction. And "the further Progreſs is made in it, the more pleaſant it oftentimes appears; the Evils and Dangers of it are leſs obſerved, and the Love of Sin grows with the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of it: the more habituated men are to an evil Courſe, the Checks of Conſcience
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003167_0028_0FF08813177F51E0"/>grow weaker; or growing more common are leſs regarded, and men grow hardned under them: ſo that the ſame ſenſual Gratifications appear greater, not being attended with that Remorſe which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them at the firſt ſetting out in a Courſe of Wickedneſs. And at the ſame time that the Way grows pleaſanter to a wicked Heart, the Difficulty of returning becomes greater; which encourages them to go on ſtill in the courſe they have begun; and they can by no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves to undertake the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of returning."</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, in the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, Men avoid many Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and Impediments, which are to be met with in the Way of Life; as may be ſhewn hereafter. The Pſalmiſt gives that Character of the Wicked, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. 73.15.</note> 
               <hi>They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other men.</hi> They have the World on their ſide: now the World loves its own, and doth a great deal to help and aſſiſt them in the Way; ſo that they often travel on without that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Hatred, and Perſecution which others meet with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:003167_0029_0FF08816169B71F0"/>
To all which we may add, that in the Way of Sin Men are ſuited with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the ſame evil Diſpoſitions and Inclinations with themſelves; which makes that Way appear ſtill more eaſy and pleaſant to them. For</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE Broad Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and a Continuance and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in a Courſe of Sin, are not only pleaſant to Corrupt Nature, upon the Conſiderations before mentioned: but <hi>Many there be, that go in thereat:</hi> there is <hi>abundance of Company</hi> that take this Way, and chuſe to walk in it.</p>
            <p>INDEED the greateſt part of Mankind have entred into this wide Gate, and are walking in the broad Way. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how many are Strangers to the Chriſtian Name; how many, tho' they have heard the Name &amp; Fame of CHRIST, yet do not own Him; how many make a Profeſſion of His Name, and yet hold dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies; how many truly profeſs the Religion of CHRIST, &amp; yet love &amp; live in open Sin; how many are Strangers to a real ſaving Work of Regeneration and Converſion, and know not by Experience what it is to believe in CHRIST, repent of Sin, and live to GOD in Newneſs of

            <p>AND this teaches us not to look on the Multitude as a ſafe Guide, nor to conceive and harbour any Prejudices in our minds, in favour of a Courſe of Sin, merely becauſe of the Number of thoſe that follow it: For if we ſhould chuſe to live and act as by far the greateſt part of the World do, they will lead us down to Hell &amp; Deſtruction.

            </p>
            <p>THIS is the Doctrine that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>NOR is this Doctrine at all inconſiſtent with the other Repreſentations, which the Scriptures give us, of the Eaſe &amp; Pleaſure to be found in the Way of Godlineſs. What we read Prov. 3.17. <hi>Her ways,</hi> i.e. the Ways of Wiſdom, <hi>are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, &amp; all her paths are peace;</hi> and what our SAVIOUR tells us, Math. 11 30. <hi>My yoke is eaſy, and my burden is lights;</hi> are very fairly to be reconciled with what

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is the way that leadeth unto Life.</hi> For a Life of Godlineſs contains nothing in it, but what 'tis infinitely fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and juſt for GOD to enjoyn, and for us to comply with: upon which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Commandments of GOD may not be ſaid to be grievous in themſelves. And then, where a ſaving Change is wrought in any by the SPIRIT, there is Strength afforded equal to the hard and difficult things to be encountred; which have all been ſurmounted, and may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſo again, by Strength derived from GOD thro' CHRIST; So that CHRIST'S Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden is light to a ſanctified Soul. Eſpecially if we conſider the Peace and Joy reſulting from the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good Conſcience, and the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT of GOD witneſſing with our Spirits, that we are His Children. In reſpect then of the new Nature, and ſpiritual Life, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and maintained in the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Sanctification, there is a great deal of Eaſe and Pleaſure to be found in the Way that leadeth unto Life eternal.</p>
            <p>BUT we muſt remember, 'tis in reſpect of our corrupt Nature and depraved Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, that our SAVIOUR ſays, <hi>Strait is
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003167_0034_0FF088241772B750"/>the Gate and narrow is the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>y things to be encountred in the Way of a godly Life. And if we conſider the matter thus, it will not only be found a very difficult thing to enter into this way; but the Continuance and Progreſs in it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage men to endure many things trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and uneaſy: tho' the more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is mortified, the leſs of Difficulty and Uneaſineſs will be found; and the more it prevails, and more difficult and uneaſy will it be to live godly in CHRIST JESUS. The Way of Happineſs is not ſo very plain and eaſy, as many ſeem to think it; who expect Heaven without inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Way thither, or walking in it when clearly marked out to them: but if we inquire into Particulars it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that <hi>ſtrait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leadeth unto Life, and Few there be that find it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>STRAIT</hi> is the <hi>Gate</hi> that leadeth unto Life; or, <hi>The Entrance into a Life of Godlineſs is difficult &amp; uneaſy:</hi> for we are ſtill to conſider the difference between the <hi>Way</hi> and the <hi>Gate</hi> that opens into it. AND the Conſideration of the ſame thing which, under the former Head, made the Way of Sin ſo eaſy and pleaſant to a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003167_0035_0FF0882635DDA088"/>carnal Man, will ſerve to ſhew the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of entring into a godly Life; that is, the Conſideration of our natural Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Propenſion to Sin and Wickedneſs. For as Sin is the moſt genuine Pleaſure of corrupt Nature; ſo there is nothing which interferes with, and hinders our darling Gratifications, more than the Practiſe of a godly Life: Since 'tis impoſſible for any to enter upon this, without giving up and renouncing all the ſinful Delights of a Wicked life; and engaging at the ſame time in the Practiſe of things that are moſt contrary and irkſome to corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For men muſt not only <hi>ceaſe to do evil,</hi> which they love, but <hi>learn to do well,</hi> which they have a natural Averſion to; and how difficult and uneaſy muſt this be to Sinners?</p>
            <p>BUT then the Caſe is often ſo, that in order to enter into the Way of Godlineſs, men muſt not only overcome their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Proneneſs and Inclination to Sin, but the ſtrong Habits of it, which ariſe from inveterate Cuſtom, and a long Courſe of Practiſe. Now the ſtronger and more eager our Love and Purſuit of Sin are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by theſe means, the more difficult and uneaſy ſtill muſt That be which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains and oppoſes them: So that for
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003167_0036_0FF08827E3A3F278"/>Sinners to <hi>deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and enter upon a <hi>ſober, righteous and godly life,</hi> neceſſarily infers much Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>AND indeed the Difficulty of it is ſo great, that the Scriptures repreſent the abſolute Impoſſibility of doing it by any Power and Strength of our own, and make the Exerciſe of divine Almighty Power neceſſary for it. Nothing leſs than this can break and open the rocky Hearts of Sinners, and bring forth the Waters of Repentance and godly Sorrow for Sin. The exceeding Greatneſs of GOD's mighty Power, which He wrought in CHRIST, when He raiſed. Him from the Dead, and ſet Him at His own right Hand in the Heavenly Places, is requiſite to make Sinners believe in CHRIST. Nor will any thing leſs than this make us the Workmanſhip of GOD created in CHRIST JESUS to good Works.</p>
            <p>'TIS not enought for us to have an external Revelation of the Way that leadeth unto Life; but we muſt have a ſpiritual Diſcernment of it, before we can enter into it: whereas this cannot be rightly diſcerned, without a ſupernatural Illumination by the SPIRIT of GOD, to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003167_0037_0FF0882B0496AEC0"/>remove the Blindneſs of a carnal Mind; and this Illumination is not produced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a divine Power and Efficacy to renew and change the Soul in all its Faculties, and pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e that Self-denial which CHRIST requires of all His Diſciples. Now this Self-denial includes in it things grievous and uneaſy to corrupt Nature: for it makes a Sinner renounce his own Will, to govern himſelf by the Will of GOD; to renounce his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as filthy Rags, and depend wholly on the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST, for a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the favour of GOD; and to renounce his darling Pleaſures, and be willing to part with the ſweeteſt Enjoyments of this Life for CHRIST'S ſake. But how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and uneaſy ſoever theſe things are to corrupt Nature, the firſt Leſſon to be learned, if we would forſake the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Way that leadeth unto Life, is that, Mat. 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, &amp; take up his Croſs, and follow me.</hi> Our SAVIOUR makes this abſolutely neceſſary, Matth. 10.37, 38. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſon or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his Croſs, and followeth me is not worthy of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003167_0038_0FF0883103845848"/>me.</hi> And as the <hi>Entrance</hi> into a Life of Godlineſs is difficult and uneaſy; <hi>Strait is the Gate:</hi> So,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>NARROW</hi> is the <hi>Way</hi> that leadeth unto Life; i. e. <hi>the Continuance &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in a godly Life will neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to encounter many things trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and uneaſy to be born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT here alſo the <hi>Way</hi> is not ſo ſtrait and narrow, as the <hi>Gate</hi> that leads into it; that is, the Continuance and Progreſs in the Way of Holineſs are not, in ſome reſpects, ſo difficult and uneaſy as the firſt Entrance into it. For they who have a ſupernatural Principle of Life, inſtead of hating the Way of Holineſs, are enabled delightfully to chuſe and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after Progreſs in it. And then by Continuance and Progreſs the Habits of Grace grow ſtronger and ſtronger, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ballance the Reluctances of Nature, and make the ſame Difficulties appear leſs and leſs continually.</p>
            <p>BUT yet there will always be ſome Remains of Sin and Corruption in us; and the difficult Duties of Self-denial and Mortification muſt be exerciſed &amp; carried on, to the End of our Lives. And tho' the Practiſe thereof may not continue ſo
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003167_0039_0FF088328CC33A28"/>difficult, as it was at firſt; yet the Fleſh will always reluct againſt the Spirit, and the Law in the Members war againſt the Law of the Mind: which will be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and uneaſy Exerciſe, too hard for us to go thro' without the continual Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the divine Power and Grace. For a Chriſtian is for ever denied the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Liberty of following his ſinful Inclinations, and bound to govern him, ſelf by the Will of GOD; abſtaining from what He forbids, and attending what He requires, tho' ever ſo irkſome to his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Affections. Now this Limitation and Confinement, in a conſtant Courſe of Mortification and Self-denial, make the Way that leadeth unto Life a <hi>narrow</hi> Way, and cauſe many Difficulties to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the Chriſtian Courſe; both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Duties</hi> and <hi>Afflictions</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) 'TIS difficult walking in the Way of Life, in regard of <hi>the Duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> in it, thro' the Courſe of our Lives; which are Faith, Repentance, and New-Obedience.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Faith,</hi> the way of Salvation is ſo contrived, that a Sinner muſt ſee and own himſelf indebted for it to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace of GOD, thro' the Merits of JESUS CHRIST; and receive it with the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003167_0040_0FF0883418889BF0"/>deepeſt Humility, or not at all. Now for man to maintain a firm Aſſent to the humbling Doctrines of the Goſpel, relating to CHRIST and the Way of Salvation by Him; to empty himſelf of himſelf; and as a vile loathſome guilty creature, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Righteouſneſs and Strength, to look to be juſtified and ſaved only by the free and rich Grace of GOD, thro' the Merits of CHRIST; I ſay, to live by ſuch a Faith in the SON of GOD, is no eaſy thing. For ſo proud a creature as Man, who would fain be juſtified and ſaved by ſome Righteouſneſs of his own, rather than ſtoop to be beholden altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to another, muſt find it hard to lay aſide and mortify his high Opinion of himſelf. And there is ſome of this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Pride of Nature left behind even in true Chriſtians: ſo that they muſt, in the way of Struggle and Warfare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to lead a Life of Faith before GOD, and find frequent occaſion for that Prayer, Mar. 9.24. <hi>Lord, help thou mine unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER difficult Duty to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if we would continue and make a Progreſs in the narrow Way, is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> For true Chriſtians have ſo much Corruption left in them, as makes it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to maintain a Courſe of Repentance,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003167_0041_0FF08835CB4EAF10"/>that it may have its perfect Work. They have ſo much Proneſs to ſin, Self-Love, and Pride, as make it difficult and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to examine their Lives and find out their Sins; to confeſs them in all their Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, and judge themſelves before GOD; to humble themſelves in the Duſt and take Shame to themſelves, on the account of them. Where there is ſo much remaining Corruption, who can think it an eaſy matter entirely to take off our Hearts from Sin, and form ſtedfaſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to forſake it? Reſolutions never more to harbour any Sin, tho' ever ſo pleaſant; or embrace any Temptation, tho' ever ſo urgent; but that we will cleave to the LORD in all holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to HisWill. And 'tis more difficult ſtill to put theſe Reſolutions into Practiſe, than to make them: But yet if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue &amp; make a Progreſs in the narrow Way, we muſt lead a Life of ſuch Repentance.</p>
            <p>Non is it ſo eaſy a thing, as ſome may imagine, to maintain a Courſe of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Obedience.</hi> For, on the one hand, to be <hi>dying daily to Sin;</hi> to contradict the Deſires of the Fleſh &amp; of the Mind, which are as preſſing &amp; urgent, as they are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular; to reduce licentious Appetites under the Government of Reaſon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003167_0042_0FF0883B48B83168"/>to forſake the moſt delightful Ways of Sin, and mortify the moſt belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed darling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſts; this is a very difficult and uneaſy Work indeed: like the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a right Hand, or the plucking out a right Eye. And on the other hand, <hi>to be living unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> in a hearty Compliance with the Commands of GOD, and a <hi>right</hi> Diſcharge of all the Duties He requires of us in the Holy Scriptures; to fear, love, truſt in Him, and worſhip Him in Spirit and in Truth; to maintain Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice &amp; Charity, from Obedience to GOD, and Love to our Neighbour; to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, in the Practiſe of Humility, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Meekneſs, Temperance, and the like Graces; I ſay, 'tis not eaſy thus in all things to obey from the Heart. But to be thus holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and endeavour after a Perfection of Holineſs in the fear of GOD, includes in it the Crucifixion of the old Man, and ſuch a Mortification of our Luſts, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it a very difficult and uneaſy thing. And yet, the <hi>Grace of GOD that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that denying ungodlineſs &amp; worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, rightecuſty, and godlily, in this preſent world: looking for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great GOD and our</hi> SAVIOUR

               </gap>y Obſtacles to be removed, Corruptions to be mortified, Sufferings to be endured, Temptations to be vanquiſhed, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be performed: the Soul muſt be humbled under a ſenſe of Sin &amp; miſery;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003167_0048_0FF0884BA10DDA60"/>the LORD JESUS CHRIST muſt be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced on Goſpel Terms; we are bound to obey all the Commands of GOD; and we muſt endeavour after a Perfection of Holineſs in His Fear. Let us not flatter our ſelves then with going eaſily to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; without being at any Pains, or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any Difficulties in the Way: like many in the World, who appear to think, that a little ſlighty external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Profeſſion, and Prayer, will be enough; and build their Hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon Modes and Forms, and ſuch bodily Exerciſe as the worſt of Men can perform as well as the beſt. For however this may ſuit our corrupt Nature, we are ſure it cannot poſſibly be <hi>the ſtrait Gate, and the narrow Way</hi> which our SAVIOUR ſpeaks of: And if we build our Hopes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Wherefore let us beware of ſuch eaſy Schemes of Religion, as will tempt us to think of getting to Heaven without any Trouble or Difficulty.</p>
            <p>BUT then on the other hand, we muſt alſo take heed, leſt from what has been
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003167_0049_0FF0884D4683B1B0"/>ſaid of the Difficulties attending the Way that leadeth unto Life, we be diſcouraged, and think this Way ſo narrow as to be unpaſſable. For tho' the Difficulties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it be very great, yet they are not inſuperable: but the narrow Way has been often paſſed, as rough &amp; cragg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it is. 'Tis true, we have no Strength of our own ſufficient to encounter and ſurmount thoſe Difficulties; but there is gracious Proviſion made for it in the New Covenant: for tho' we are <hi>ungodly and without ſtrength</hi> in our ſelves, yet being united to CHRIST by the mighty opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the HOLY SPIRIT in Effectual Calling, we may do all things through CHRIST ſtrengthening us; and the ſame Power and Grace which has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for others, will be ſufficient for us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Wherefore the Conſideration of the Difficulties to be encountred in the Way of Godlineſs ſhould not diſcourage us, nor make us think it impoſſible for us to arrive at everlaſting Life: but ſhould only put us upon realizing our own Weakneſs &amp; Inſufficiency, and ſtir us up to ſecure thoſe divine Influences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others have been enabled to enter in at the ſtrait Gare, &amp; walk in the narrow Way, which leadeth unto Life Eternal.</p>

1. <hi>LET us take a juſt View of the ſuppoſed Advantages of the broad Way of Sin.</hi> Now theſe are the carnal Eaſe and Delight ariſing from the Gratification of Luſt in the Practiſe of Sin; and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Company, which Sinners have to countenance and encourage them in the Practiſe of it. And the following Conſiderations make theſe things appear unworthy to be highly eſteemed by a reaſonable Creature.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>THESE ſuppoſed Advantages are exceeding mean and low in themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Gratification of Luſt in the Practiſe of Sin, it may be conſidered with reſpect to the more <hi>ſenſual</hi> or the more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sins: in one of which Men do but partake of the Felicity of Bruits; and in the other they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more like the Devils.</p>
            <p>FOR on the one hand, what doth a Man by Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, and other <hi>Senſualities,</hi> but degrade himſelf beneath the Level of the Beaſts that periſh? They alſo have Senſes to gratify, and indeed the Gratification of them is a ſort of Happineſs ſuited to the Rank and Order of their Beings: for they want the Superiour Fa culties, which would make them capa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whereas for <hi>Men</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon themſelves to ſenſual Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the Center of their Felicity, is to ſink beneath their Natures, and by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Senſes the Government over the Superiour Faculties of Reaſon, to fall unſpeakably ſhort of that Happineſs for which the Humane Nature is capacitated and deſigned. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul being ſo vaſtly ſuperiour to the Body, and the Powers of Underſtanding &amp; Reaſon ſo much above the Bodily Senſes, the Pleaſures of Senſe muſt be to <hi>Men</hi> but a low and mean Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage indeed. How baſe and ſordid it is for Man, who was made but little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angels, to make a high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe Gratifications which are common to him with the Beaſts that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh! How doth he neglect and degrade his high-born Soul, to live and act worſe than if he belonged to the Herd of the mere brutal Creation.</p>
            <p>AND on the other hand, how low and mean is the Pleaſure, that ariſes from the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003167_0056_0FF0886341BAA850"/>Gratification of Luſt, by indulging Pride, Envy, Malice, Revenge and the like <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Sins. For however theſe may lye more concealed from the View and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the World; yet they do not in the Sight of GOD, nor ought they in our Eyes to appear leſs degrading to our Nature, than a criminal Indulgence to Senſual Gratifications: which doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men more like the Beaſts, than thoſe more Spiritual Sins make them like the Devils. And certainly a Conformity unto thoſe Spiritual Wickedneſſes in high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which carries in it ſo vile an Abuſe and Miſapplication <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> our Superiour Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, cannot be leſs diſhonourable and ſhameful, than to neglect our Superiour Powers by letting the Senſes gain the aſcendant over them: but rather ſuch an Abuſe and Miſimprovement of them will carry us to a greater diſtance from GOD, the Center of our Happineſs, than to let them lay by neglected and unimproved; and ſo is more degrading to humane Nature.</p>
            <p>AND then the pretended Advantages of indulging the Deſires both of the Fleſh and of the Mind in the broad Way of Sin, is not more low and mean than the Company to be enjoyed in that Way
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003167_0057_0FF08864F6091D58"/>There Men may find Company enough; 'tis true: but who are they?

            <p>THUS having taken a View of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Advantages of the broad Way of Sin, they appear unworthy of the high Eſteem of a reaſonable Creature.

            <p>Now the Evil to be encountred in the End of the broad Way is <hi>Deſtruction;</hi> which comprehends in it all the endleſs Miſery, that the Word of GOD declares to be the Portion of the Wicked after Death. And it may ſeem a needleſs Queſtion to ask a reaſonable Creature, Whether the ſuppoſed Advantages of the broad Way, which are ſo low &amp; degrading to humane Nature, which are ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interrupted and mixed with ſo much Pain and Miſery, and which are ſo ſhort
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003167_0062_0FF08870DF884BD0"/>in their Duration, do contain ſo much <hi>Good</hi> in them, as is worthy to be laid in the ballance againſt the <hi>Evil</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Deſtruction that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them? But however ſuch a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſeem to contain a Sarcaſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on humane Nature, yet ſuch is the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Stupidity of Sinners as to render it neceſſary. For the Generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind let us know, by their common Choice and Practiſe, that they are not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to make a Queſtion of it: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would not ſo readily embrace the Pleaſures and Advantages of Sin, as a Counterballance to the Miſeries of the other World. But Men would do well to put this Queſtion to Conſcience, and require a ſerious Anſwer to it; in order to awaken their Conſideration, and bring them to a happy Change of Mind and Practiſe. For if we reflect and ſay, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Good contained in the low and mean Advantages of this Life, is as great as the Evil contained in the intollerable Pains and Miſeries of Hell, Stings of Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, Torments from Devils, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Impreſſions of divine Wrath? —Whether the interrupted &amp; mixed Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the broad Way of Sin contain ſo much Good, as there is Evil in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Miſeries of the other World,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003167_0063_0FF0887500F2AD00"/>where there is Wrath &amp; Pain without any Intervals, or any Remiſſion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Torment? — Whether the Pleaſures &amp; Advantages of Sin for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here, the duration of which is ſhort and uncertain, are not infinitely unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſet againſt the endleſs Torments of the other World; where the Worm dies not and the Fire is not quenched; where there is everlaſting Fire, and the ſmoke of the Torment aſcends for ever and ever? I ſay, if we reflect thus, it muſt appear, <hi>That the ſuppoſed Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the broad Way of Sin are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be laid in the ballance againſt the Evil which muſt certainly be found in the End of that Way.</hi> And being brought to confeſs the Diſproportion between theſe things according to that Propoſition, what other Concluſion can we make but this, That 'tis the greateſt Folly &amp; Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imaginable, for the ſake of mean pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and pernicious Pleaſures in the broad Way of Sin, to expoſe our ſelves to the certain inconceivable, remedileſs, and everlaſting Miſeries contained in the Deſtruction which that Way leads unto.</p>
            <p>OR if it were poſſible for any ſtill to doubt the truth of that Propoſition, it
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:003167_0064_0FF08877F6CCEE40"/>might be further confirmed by theſe two Conſiderations,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>THE ſuppoſed Advantages in the broad Way tend to haſten on the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in the End of it.</hi> For the more theſe are enjoyed and delighted in, the more provoked and incenſed is the Anger of that GOD, who has threatned to bring Deſtruction ſuddenly &amp; without Remedy, upon them that are wicked over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much. And</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>THESE ſuppoſed Advantages not only haſten upon the Wicked that Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is in the End of a ſinful Courſe, but tend to increaſe the Miſery of it.</hi> For in the Purſuit of theſe pretended Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages Men do not only treaſure up grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meaſures of Divine Wrath, in the way of Provocation and Deſert; but fit themſelves alſo for greater Torments.

Firſt. As to the <hi>Difficulties and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> of the ſtrait Gate and the narrow way, which ariſe either in regard of the Duties to be performed, or the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Afflictions to be encountred; theſe do not contain ſo great an Evil in them as the World is apt to imagine. I will mention ſeveral Conſiderations which tend to leſſen the Evil of them in our View.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>'TIS not expected that we ſhould perform and encounter theſe things, without a Power and Aſſiſtance equal to the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and Hardſhips of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Life of Faith, Repentance, and New Obedience contains very <hi>difficult Duties:</hi> but in the narrow Way GOD is pleaſed, by the gracious Influences of His SPIRIT, to vouchſafe ſufficient <hi>Strength</hi> for the diſcharge of them; and whereby all the Difficulties which attend them ſhall be maſter'd and ſurmounted: For 'tho a Chriſtian is of himſelf inſufficient ſo much as for a good Thought, yet through CHRIST ſtrengthening him he can do all things. The <hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> alſo to be encounted in the Way of Godlineſs are very great: but they ſhall not be too hard for the ſpiritual Principle, which GOD produces and maintains in the Soul
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003167_0067_0FF0887E82A9EE38"/>of every true Chriſtian by His Holy SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT. By this Principle the Chriſtian ſhall ſucceſsfully encounter them, and in the End ſhall join in that Song of Triumph 1 Cor. 15.57. <hi>Thanks be to</hi> GOD <hi>who giveth us the Victory through our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THESE Difficulties and Hardſhips are well conſiſtent with Pleaſure and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort far ſuperiour to any that can be found in the Way of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Pleaſures of Piety are very great: and we have the concurrent Teſtimony of Scripture and Experience, That <hi>the ways of Wiſdom are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. 3.17.</note>. Indeed the moſt difficult Duties of Religion tend to produce the ſweeteſt Peace in the Soul. And to the conſcientious and diligent Performance of them GOD promiſes the Conſolations of His SPIRIT under the ſoreſt Trials. Nor doth He ſail of His Word; but often makes His People won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to rejoyce in the greateſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, with a ſweet &amp; heavenly Joy, which the Strangers to the narrow Way of Godlineſs experience nothing of.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:003167_0068_0FF08883416BF7C8"/>
3. <hi>THESE Difficulties and Hardſhips are but of a ſhort Duration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE difficult and afflicted Way of Godlineſs is but ſhort; comprehended within the Bounds of this Life: which what is it, but a Vapour that appeareth for a little while? And in a very little time the laſt Enemy becomes a Friend to the Godly, and puts a Period to all their Afflictions; and to Sin which is the Cauſe of them, and itſelf the greateſt of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>THERE are no Difficulties &amp; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to be encountred in the narrow Way of Godlineſs, but what are ordered for Good, according to the Promiſes of the New and Everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a Covenant ordered in all things, and ſure: and according to it, GOD's infinite Wiſdom, Power, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs, are all engaged for His People, and exerciſed for their good in whatever befalls them. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this Covenant are in CHRIST <hi>Yea, &amp; in Him Amen to the glory of</hi> GOD: <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1.20.</note> In Him they are all ratified &amp; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the true Chriſtian. Let what will befall ſuch a One, we may reſt ſatisfied, that Good ſhall come out of Evil. For
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:003167_0069_0FF08884DB684BE0"/>
               <hi>we know that all things work together for good, to them that love</hi> GOD, <hi>to them that are called according to His purpoſe.</hi> Rom 8.28. The Difficulties and Afflictions of the narrow Way can laſt but a little Seaſon; and while they do continue, they are ſubſervient to bleſſed Ends and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and work for their good; as they prepare them for a glorious and happy State in the other World. Thus the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Warfare</hi> between the Fleſh and the Spirit is a troubleſome and uneaſy thing: but it weakens and works out that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which unfits the Soul for Heaven and Glory: and it confirms and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Principle of Divine Life, and thoſe Habits of Holineſs which render the Soul meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. The <hi>Afflictions</hi> &amp; <hi>Temptations</hi> alſo which the Godly Encounter <hi>from the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Diſpenſations of Providence</hi> are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified for the like deſirable Purpoſes. For the End of them is to purge out Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and take away Sin, to prove us and to humble us, and to do us good in the latter End: they tend to quicken us to thoſe Duties which are very comfortable to us, as well as honourary to GOD: and they tend to make us Partakers of His Holineſs; for they are the Exerciſe and Tryal of our Graces, which are thereby
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003167_0070_0FF08886816EFD38"/>ſtrengthened &amp; increaſed. And they that walk in the narrow Way of Holineſs may <hi>greatly rejoyce, though now for a Seaſon (if need be) they are in Heavineſs through manifold Temptations.</hi> Since it is <hi>That the Tryal of their Faith, being much more precious than of Gold that periſheth, tho' it be tryed in the Fire, may be found unto Praiſe and Honour and Glory at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7.</p>
            <p>THUS if we take a juſt view of the Hardſhips and Difficulties of the narrow Way, they do not contain ſo great an Evil in them, as Men are apt to imagine.</p>
            <p>Secondly. THIS is true likewiſe, if we take a juſt View of the <hi>Solitarineſs</hi> of that Way.</p>
            <p>The Smallneſs of the Number of thoſe who are found Walking in the narrow Way is not ſo great a Diſadvantage, as Men are apt to repreſent it to themſelves. For tho' there are but Few that find this Way; yet they are the moſt agreeable Company to wife and good Men, who have the higheſt Reliſh for good Society, and are the beſt Judges of it. And tho' their Number is but ſmall, compared with the Numbers to be found in the broad Way; yet as they have the moſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003167_0071_0FF088885E27DD28"/>Qualities for Society; ſo there is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>icient Number of them to make the Way of Piety really pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to countenance, and encourage, and aſſiſt one another in their Progreſs in it.</p>
            <p>BUT if the narrow Way had not ſo many in it as it has; yet it can be but a very little while, before it will bring the Travellers in it to an innumerable. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Holy Angels, to the General Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-Born which are written in Heaven, and to GOD the Judge of all, and to JESUS the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of the New Covenant in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly World.</p>
            <p>So then upon a juſt View of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Diſadvantages of the ſtrait Grate, and the narrow Way, there are many Conſiderations to leſſen the Evil of them in our Eſteem. And</p>
            <p n="2">[2.] <hi>LET us now reflect upon them, as they appear, when compared with the Good to be enjoyed in the End of that Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſtrait Gate and the narrow Way, not withſtanding all theſe Diſadvantages, will lead us unto LIFE and Happineſs; which will make Amends for all. And could Sinners apprehend and realize what
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:003167_0072_0FF0888C47CF3CB0"/>the Beatific Viſion, perfect Service, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> than enough to out weigh the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any Evil, to be encountred in the Purſuit of it. But 'tis impoſſible for any Tongue to deſcribe, or any Heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what this comprehends in it.

               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:003167_0073_0FF0888F4A2A2C40"/>the ſame Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Tho' our outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16, 17. Now when we ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect upon theſe things, how can the <hi>Affliction</hi> of this preſent Life bear any Proportion to future <hi>Glory? — Light</hi> Affliction to a <hi>Weight</hi> of Glory?—Light. Affliction for a <hi>Moment</hi> to an <hi>Eternal</hi> Weight of Glory?—Yea, to a <hi>far more exceeding</hi> and Eternal Weight of Glory? The Apoſtle ſeems at a loſs for Words, wherein to repreſent how much the Good to be enjoyed by the Righteous hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is greater than all the Evils of this Life: they are all to be ſwallowed up in unutterable Glory.</p>
            <p>THUS I have confirmed the Vth OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVATION, by ſhowing, That the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Advantages of the wide Gate and the broad Way are not worthy to be laid in the Ballance againſt the Evil which muſt certainly be endured in the End of that Way; and that the ſuppoſed Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſtrait Gate and the narrow Way are not to be compared with the Good which will certainly be enjoyed in the End of this. For when Life &amp; Death
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:003167_0074_0FF08892ADF29E78"/>are thus ſet before us, what Concluſion can we make but this, That 'tis the higheſt Wiſdom and the beſt Courſe we can take, to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and walk in the narrow Way; to deſpiſe the ſuppoſed Advantages of a Life of Sin, and encounter the ſhort and ſanctified Difficulties of a godly Life, which leads into the inconceivable and eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the World to come?</p>
            <p>WHAT now remains is an earneſt EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HORTATION to urge it upon <hi>Impenitent Sinners,</hi> that they would make an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Improvement of what has been ſaid. And O be perſwaded to ſuffer the Word of Exhortation, which calls upon you to enter in at the ſtrait Gate; that you may walk in the narrow Way, that leadeth unto Life.</p>
            <p>I am not about to treat with you upon a light and trivial matter. No leſs than eternal Life with all the inconceivable Glories of it, and everlaſting Deſtruction with all the inconceivable Miſeries of it, offer themſelves unto you by the narrow Way of Godlineſs, and the broad Way of Sin: the greateſt Intereſts which 'tis poſſible for a reaſonable Creature to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:003167_0075_0FF0889466DADE70"/>himſelf upon. And can you be ſo fooliſh and profane as to diſregard theſe, like trivial Concerns, unworthy of your ſerious Conſideration?</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of this, be perſwaded, O unconverted Sinners, to give the moſt earneſt Attention to the gracious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Heaven, while you are going on in the Broad Way that leadeth to Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Upon hearing that Call, Jer. 3. 22. <hi>Return, ye backſliding children, and I will heal your backſlidings;</hi> may your ready Compliance be expreſſed in the following words, <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD. The Call of GOD to Sinners is that, Ezek. 18.30, 31. <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your Tranſgreſſions; ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your ruine. Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit. For why will ye Dye? For I have no pleaſure in the Death of him that dyeth, ſaith the Lord: Wherefore turn your ſelves and live:</hi> And that Iſai. 55.7. <hi>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the unrighteous man his Thoughts and let him return to the</hi> LORD, <hi>and He will have Mercy on Him, and to our</hi> GOD, <hi>for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> And now what is
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:003167_0076_0FF08897D88EC610"/>there in the broad Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, valuable enough to make you continue in it, when you are thus called upon to turn out of it into the Way that leadeth unto Life?</p>
            <p>MAKE the moſt of all you can gain in the Broad Way of Sin: and what will it amount to? You may poſſibly gain earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wealth and Riches; and heaping up Silver and Gold, which the World call precious Treaſure, you may <hi>put them into a Bag with Holes.</hi> You may gain a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Meaſure of worldly Pomp, and pride your ſelves in magnificent Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Honour, and be dignified with that <hi>Name of the wicked which ſhall rot.</hi> You may give the Reins to your Luſts, ſoften your ſelves in Luxury, and take up ſome Time to diſſolve in thoſe Pleaſures of Sin, which will <hi>bite like a Serpent, and ſting like an Adder.</hi> You may follow the Multitude to do Evil, and rejoyce with the workers of Iniquity. And thus you may go on triumphing; 'till Death determines the Pleaſures of Sin to be but for a Seaſon, lays your Honour in the Duſt, and conſtrains you to take a melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Farewel of the Treaſures you have been laying up for your ſelves upon Earth, and of the beloved Companions, who have
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:003167_0077_0FF08899AE1AAC60"/>been countenanting and incouraging of you in a Life of Sin. Theſe are the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gains you may hopefully purſue in the broad Way.</p>
            <p>BUT then what ineſtimable Bleſſings muſt you forego, while you purſue theſe Gains in the Way of Sin? You muſt forego that Peace of Conſcience which is far ſweeter than the Delights of Senſe; that Fellowſhip with the FATHER and the SON, the Conſolations whereof are not ſmall; that Loving kindneſs of GOD which is better than Life: You muſt forego all the advantage of profeſſed Acts of Worſhip, while the LORD hears the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the righteous, and His Ears are open to their Cry: You muſt forego all the ſpiritual Benefits of CHRIST'S Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, which are promiſed in the New Covenant, and beſtowed in the narrow Way of Godlineſs: You muſt forego all that can afford you Comfort in the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Troubles of Life, and in a dying Hour when you will moſt of all need it: Finally, you muſt forego eternal Life in the Kingdom of Heaven, and a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away; and be forever baniſhed from the beatific Viſion, and from the Rivers of Pleaſure at GOD'S Right Hand; whereby is repreſented a
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003167_0078_0FF0889DCE730150"/>Happineſs too great to be conceived and everlaſting, in the Service and Enjoyment of GOD and CHRIST above.</p>
            <p>AND as you muſt forego theſe ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Bleſſings: ſo you are incurring the greateſt of Evils and Miſeries, all the while you proceed in the broad Way of Sin.

            <p>Now conſider theſe things, Ye that are going aſtray from GOD in the broad Way of Sin; Conſider what ineſtimable Bleſſings you are loſing, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Miſeries you are incurring; and be perſwaded to turn your Feet into the Way of Life: <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD, Conſider your Ways.</hi> If you will but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſet your ſelves to uſe the Powers GOD has given you, can you help ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleding, that ſuch Loſſes and ſuch Sufferings are too high a Price for any Advantages this World affords? Can you poſſibly think it reaſonable to purchaſe worldly Honour, Wealth, &amp; Pleaſure, with the Loſs of Peace and Grace and Glory, and with ſuffering the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Conſcience and the Pains of Hell? Cannot you apprehend theſe fading and unſatisfying Enjoyments to be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003167_0080_0FF088A1F3B32B20"/>for the Loſs of ſo great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Good, and the ſuffering ſo great and everlaſting Evil? Cannot you realize it, that you would make a moſt miſerable Bargain, to forfeit Heaven, ſell your ſelves to Satan, and damn your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, for the Pleaſures of Sin which are but for a Seaſon? Can you ſee no Reaſon in this practical Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, That 'tis better to forego your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pleaſures, and mortify the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Luſts, than to enjoy the one, and indulge the other for a Moment, and then loſe eternal Joys, and enter into endleſs Torments? Dare you pretend, that your Conſcience tells you, the Pleaſure of a Luſt is greater than the Happineſs of Heaven; or ſo great that a reaſonable Creature ſhould think it worth the while to ſuffer eternal Miſery for it? No; but if you conſult your Conſcience, it will tell you, That if a right Eye offend you, 'tis better to pluck it out; and if a right Hand offend you, 'tis better to cut it off, and ſo maimed to enter into Life, than having two Eyes and two Hands, to be caſt down to Hell.</p>
            <p>AND if you can thus reflect, conſider and reaſon the Caſe with your ſelves; then with what Face do you call your ſelves Men, and pretend to the Rank and

GOD doth not expect that Brutes ſhould think and reflect upon theſe things; becauſe He has not made them capable of it, nor formed them for any important Intereſts as moral Agents: but He has enabled you for it; He calls you to it; and gives you the ſtrongeſt Motives to induce you. And will you not then act like Men, and ſeriouſly think of theſe things?

As it was the Wiſh of Heaven Deut. 32.29 <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their batter end:</hi> ſo this Wiſdom is
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003167_0082_0FF088A9FA39EDF8"/>to be wiſhed for you; O that you may be greatly affected with an Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an End of the broad Way, which is leading you to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>AND be it known unto you, O Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner, that you muſt and will be brought to think of theſe things firſt or laſt. If you will not think of them now in this Life, while Opportunity &amp; Means and Hopes are left, Death and Judgment and Hell will bring you to think of them with a Vengeance. But then, alas, it will be too late for you to reap any good from theſe Reflections: your right Tho'ts will but ſerve to torment you, when your doleful Caſe is paſt all Remedy.</p>
            <p>SINCE then you muſt ſooner or later, firſt or laſt, come to have right Tho'ts of the broad Way of Sin, Why ſhould you let the falſe and treacherous Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of a vain World ſtifle them now, while the Opportunities of Life and the Means of Grace are continued to you; and put them off 'till hereafter, when they may only ſerve to wound and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men you? Let me ſpeak in the moving Language of Another on this Occaſion. <q>O the Folly and Stupidity of Men! To be ſo tranſported with preſent and ſenſible things, as to have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:003167_0083_0FF088AB9757D868"/>of our Future State, no pity for their Souls, no Senſe of our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Abode in another World; to be ſo blinded by Senſe, ſo bribed by the Pleaſures of Sin, which are but for a moment, as to forfeit the Happineſs of all Eternity! When the Pleaſure is paſt and gone, and the dear Price comes to be paid down, and the Soul is leaving this World, and going to take poſſeſſion of the everlaſting Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of Shame and Sorrow, of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and Anguiſh, which Men have purchaſed to themſelves by their own Folly; how ſhall they then repent of that bargain which they have ſo raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, but can never be releaſed from.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>IT is our lot who have the Souls of Men committed to our Charge, to ſee many of theſe ſad Sights. O my GOD, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> what Confuſion have I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen in the Face of a dying Man? What Sorrows on every ſide, what reſtleſs Workings and violent Throws of a guilty Conſcience? And how are we tempted (who are commonly ſent for too late to miniſter Comfort to ſuch perſons) I ſay, how are we tempted to ſow Pillows under their
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003167_0084_0FF088AD429D0970"/>uneaſy Heads, and out of very Pity and Compaſſion are afraid to ſay the worſt, and grieved at our very hearts to ſpeak thoſe ſad Truths which yet are fit for them to hear! 'Tis very grievous to ſee a Man in the Paroxiſms of a Fever, or in the extreme Torment of the Stone, or in the very Agony of Death: but the ſaddeſt Sight in the World is the Anguiſh of a dying Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; nothing looks ſo gaſtly as the final Deſpair of a Wicked Man, when GOD is taking away his Soul.</p>
               <p>BUT whatever Senſe Men have of theſe things, when they come to lie upon a Sick-bed; every Sinner will moſt certainly be convinced, when he comes into the other World. Then will they have nothing to divert them from theſe Tho'ts. They will feel that which will be a ſenſible Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them of their own Folly. Then will Men curſe thoſe falſe &amp; flattering Pleaſures which have cheated them into ſo much Miſery: but their own Folly moſt of all for being ſo eaſily abuſed. Then would they give Ten Thouſand Worlds, if they had them, to recover the Opportunity of a new Choice; but it cannot be: they parted with their Souls once at a cheap rate;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:003167_0085_0FF088AEF8BE7D40"/>but no Price will then be accepted for the Redemption of them.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now then be perſwaded, O Sinner, to regard the folemn Warnings of GOD; while Life and Death are ſet before you for your Choice, and you are compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately called upon to chuſe Life. Your Miniſters, if they have any Faithfulneſs to GOD and Love to your Souls cannot, without an aking Heart, behold you walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or running with full ſpeed in the broad Way, which leadeth down to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Nay, their own Souls are very nearly concerned in this matter. We read, Ezek. 33. 7, 8, 9.— <hi>O ſon of man, I have ſet thee a Watchman to the houſe of Iſrael: therefore thou ſhalt hear the word from my mouth and warn them from me. When I ſay to the wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die; if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thy hand. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it: if he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquity, but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi> Even ſo we, who are the Miniſters of CHRIST, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Watchmen; and we cannot be faithful to Him, nor deliver our own Souls,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:003167_0086_0FF088B3844E3FC8"/>if we do not ſet before you ſuch awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Truths as have been offer'd; how grie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ous ſoever it may be for you to hear them. You may think that we propheſy hard things, when we thus preach unto you the Neceſſity of turning out of the broad Way, and entring in at the ſtrait Gate: But how can we ſpeak ſmooth things, and cry, <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> unto you, when GOD ſays, and has bid us ſay, <hi>There is no Peace?</hi> Would you have us ſuffer you quietly to proceed in the Way of Sin; while we are bound by the Oath of GOD to warn you to flee from the Wrath to come? But we cannot be ſo void of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to you, if you are to us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we <hi>ſay to the Righteous, that it ſhall be well with him; for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings:</hi> ſo we muſt ſay it for your ſakes, and we will ſay it for our own, <hi>Woe unto the Wicked it ſhall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him.</hi> Iſai. 3.10, 11.</p>
            <p>AND O that we might be the happy Inſtruments of ſaving your Souls from Death and Deſtruction; by converting you from the Error of your Way, and bringing you into the Way that leadeth unto Life! As GOD calls, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye;</hi> and JESUS CHRIST
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:003167_0087_0FF088B6402D49C0"/>calls, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; no man comes to the Father but by me; Him that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> and the HOLY GHOST, <hi>ſaith, To day if ye will hear His Voice, harden not your hearts:</hi> ſo they who have the Care of your Souls committed to them, would now beſeech you in the Bowels of CHRIST, to hear and anſwer this Call. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to forſake your ſinful Ways, how alluring ſoever they be; and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>by your impenitent heart to treaſure up for your ſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath:</hi> We beſeech you to renounce your own Righteouſneſs, to embrance the LORD JESUS CHRIST by a living Faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up your ſelves to GOD through Him; ſince <hi>he that believeth not the</hi> SON, <hi>ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of</hi> GOD <hi>abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth on Him:</hi> We beſeech you to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Life of Holineſs and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; becauſe <hi>without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the</hi> LORD. And we beſeech you to make ſure of a real unfeigned Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to GOD in CHRIST; becauſe ſuch an Entrance at the ſtrait Gate is abſolutely neceſſary in order to your walking in the narrow Way, that leadeth unto Life and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:003167_0088_0FF088B7D0C939D8"/>
BUT I am aware of it, that the great Adverſary is always ready with his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to hinder your turning out of the Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and entring into the Path of GOD's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and to diſcourage you from uſing any Means in order unto this. For which end he will be forward to fall in with your depraved Diſpoſitions, by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting Objections to defeat the moſt powerful and moving Arguments and Exhortations. And particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Exhortation which has been purſued at this time, you may be tempted to excuſe or diſcourage yourſelves in the Language of this</p>
            <p>OBJECTION. <hi>THE Converſion to</hi> GOD <hi>by which we muſt enter in at the Strait Gate, is a thing wholly out of our own Power, and depends entirely on the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace of</hi> GOD, <hi>and thoſe Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of His</hi> SPIRIT <hi>which are diſpenſed according to His ſovereign Pleaſure: Why then do you thus urge and perſwade us to enter in at the Strait Gate, as if we could Change our own Hearts, and Convert our ſelves to</hi> GOD? This I doubt not, is an Objection whereby Satan has diſcouraged many awakened Souls, and defeated the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:003167_0089_0FF088BA090B8958"/>holy Counſels that have been given to them. And 'tis likely to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Force and Influence upon you, becauſe it ſeems naturally to ariſe from thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the ſacred Scripture which repreſent the ſpiritual Impotency of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Sinners, and the Neceſſity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace in Converſion.</p>
            <p>IN Anſwer to this Objection, I will not endeavour to repreſent your natural Condition as leſs miſerable than indeed it is. Inſtead of exalting humane Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Power of Man's Free-will to ſpiritual Good; as is done in ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and modiſh Schemes, which for the ſake of that Idol will dethrone the Grace of GOD: I ſay, inſtead of this, let it be reckoned a faithful Saying, That while unconverted you are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; and as unable to produce that Principle of ſpiritual Life in your Souls which is neceſſary to ſaving Converſion, as a Man under the power of natural Death, is unable to give himſelf a Principle of natural Life and Action. Nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with what Senſe and Meaning they who deny this, can put you upon making ſuch Trayers to GOD as that, <hi>Turn thou me and I ſhall be turned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:003167_0090_0FF088BC9C03A950"/>
BUT notwithſtanding all this, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection propoſed has no Force in it. For when Sinners in Scripture are exhorted to <hi>turn themſelves,</hi> and <hi>make themſelves a new Heart,</hi> and the like, 'tis evident by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring ſuch Exhortations with other Texts of Scripture, that the Deſign of them is to ſet forth the Sinners Duty, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Converſion in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to bring men to a Senſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Impotency; and to put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Seeking to GOD that He would change their Hearts, and turn them to Himſelf. And ſo when we ſet before you the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and Danger of your State in the broad Way of Sin, and exhort you to forſake it, and to enter in at the ſtrait Gate &amp; walk in the narrow Way, we do not urge and perſwade you, as if you could change your own Hearts and convert your ſelves. But who can tell, whether the Spirit of Life from GOD will not enter into your dead Souls with ſuch Exhortations? And we hope, that being awakened to ſee the Neceſſity of a new Heart in order to your Happineſs, and your own Inability to produce it in your ſelves, you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the Way to obtain it, and ſeek it of GOD; by attending thoſe Means of Grace in the diligent Uſe of which it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleaſes Him to beſtow it. For thus
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:003167_0091_0FF088BEAA23B070"/>you ought to ſeek it of Him; and thus you may do it with Hope of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I think the plain State of the Caſe may be laid down in the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. IF ever you are ſaved, that Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which CHRIST has purchaſed, muſt be effectually applied unto you, by the SPIRIT of GOD, in true Converſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>.</item>
               <item>II. GOD hath been pleaſed to appoint certain Means, in the Uſe of which He will be ſought unto, and waited on for the gracious Influences of His SPIRIT, which are neceſſary in order to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. And,</item>
               <item>III. 'TIS in your Power, while uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to attend thoſe Means of Grace ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, tho' not with a gracious Sincerity: ſuch as Reading and Hearing GOD'S Word, Meditation, and Prayer.</item>
               <item>IV. IF you <hi>do not</hi> thus ſeek to GOD, and wait on him in the Uſe of thoſe Means, you can have no grounds to hope for His converting Grace: but If you <hi>do,</hi> you are in the Way of this Bleſſing; for when they are diligently attended, GOD is often pleaſed to accompany thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means with the ſaving Influences of HIS SPIRIT.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="90" facs="unknown:003167_0092_0FF088C03797C408"/>
V. 'TIS therefore the greateſt Folly imaginable for you not to wait upon GOD in this Way. For, What? though you cannot find any neceſſary Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Uſe of the outward Means and converting Grace? Neither can you, between the Means uſed by the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a plentiful Harveſt; for after all he muſt depend on the Bleſſing of divine Provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ce, which is not always granted: and yet you call it extreme Folly in an Husbandman, who depends on a Harveſt for his Livelihood, not to uſe the Means in order to it; becauſe without uſing the Means, 'tis the vaineſt Preſumption to expect a Harveſt. In like manner, it muſt be the extremeſt Folly in you that have nothing but the ſovereign Grace of GOD to depend on for the Life and Salvation of your Souls, not to wait on Him in the uſe of the Means of Grace: ſince in the neglect of thoſe Means, 'tis the vaineſt Preſumption to expect that Bleſſing.</item>
               <item>VI. NOR can you pretend, that you have not <hi>ſufficient Incouragement to hold on</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to GOD, and waiting on Him, in the Uſe of the Means of Grace. For tho' I cannot ſay, you have any Covenanti-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to plead for your Succeſs in the Uſe of them; yet they are the only appointed
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:003167_0093_0FF088C2C435D9B0"/>Means of ſeeking the Grace of GOD; and none could ever yet produce a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Sinnor that held on in the ſerious and diligent Uſe of them, but after all was denied this Bleſſing: which Conſiderations give you more than a bare <hi>Peradventure,</hi> even a <hi>Probable ground of Hope,</hi> that if you perſevere in a diligent Uſe of the appointed Means, He will be pleaſed to beſtow upon you His convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace. And how ſtrongly ſhould <hi>a Probable ground of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>pe</hi> excite you to the diligent Uſe of Means, in a Caſe which is of ſuch infinite Importance to you, that a bare <hi>Poſſibility of Succeſs</hi> would be a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Motive.</item>
            </list>
            <p>WHEREFORE inſtead of going aboue to excuſe your ſelves, or ſinking under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſcouragements from the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own Impotency, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſhake off your Slothfulneſs, and concern your ſelves in earneſt about the eternal Intereſts of your precious and immortal Souls. For tho' you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give your ſelves a new Heart, and convert your ſelves; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gently attend upon the Means of Grace: you can read and hear the Word of GOD, you can meditate, and you can pray to GOD. And ſince
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:003167_0094_0FF088C7D4630A38"/>you may do theſe things with a Hope of Succeſs, why ſhould you ſuffer your ſelves to be idle or ſlothful, when the Life and Salvation of your Souls are ſo nearly concerned?</p>
            <p>THE time will not allow me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large by way of Direction: but you have Bibles in your hands; and if you would conſult your Miniſters about ſaving your Souls, with as much Concern as you do your Phyſicians about the Health of your Bodies, you would not want their beſt Advice and Direction; which they will be glad to give, whenever you ask it.</p>
            <p>YET will I not break off without this one Word of Counſel. If any of you are made to ſee the Evil and Danger of the Way of Sin, your Duty and Intereſt to turn out of it and live to GOD, and the Neceſſity of the divine Grace in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto this; and have ſerious Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from this time to be found ſeeking thoſe Influences of the SPRAIT of GOD, whereby you may be enabled to enter in at the ſtrait Gate and walk in the narrow Way; Be perſwaded to tal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Method. Often retire and go alone to beg of GOD His converting Grace. Enter into your Cloſets, and falling down before GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:003167_0095_0FF07DCC799F57C0"/>knowledge, that you are of your ſelves unable to forſake your Sins and return to Him; that you are unworthy He ſhould enable you; and that He would not be unrighteous if He ſhould refuſe to do it: but cry to Him, and beg of Him to enable you, by His free and ſovereign Grace. There <hi>try</hi> to bewail your Sins before GOD; to plead with Him for a Pardon thro' the Blood &amp; Sacrifice of the great SAVIOUR, and for Acceptance into the divine Favour thro' His Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and hopefully to place your Truſt in Him for them. 'Tis a very moving paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, Hoſ. 14.1, 2. <hi>O Iſrael, return to the LORD thy GOD; for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD, ſay to Him, Take away all iniquity and receive us graciouſly</hi> GOD not only allows unworthy guilty Creatures to plead for His Mercy, but He Himſelf puts the very words into their Mouths. And will you not then <hi>try</hi> to look up to Him through CHRIST, and take with you theſe Words of His own preſcribing, and ſay, <hi>O LORD, take away all iniquity, and receive me graciouſly?</hi> Hereupon <hi>try</hi> whether you cannot come to fixed Reſolutions to forſake the broad Way of Sin, and walk in the narrow Way of Godlineſs, with a humble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:003167_0096_0FF088CB769FE300"/>on GOD <hi>to work in you both to will and to do.</hi> And <hi>try</hi> whether He doth not graciouſly enable you to yield the Conſent of your Souls unto it, That your SAVIOUR ſhould unite you to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, take poſſeſſion of you by the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT of Grace, and enable you to live unto GOD, through Him living in you. In this way <hi>hold on</hi> ſeeking to GOD, and waiting on Him, and reſolve to perſevere in this Courſe, 'till you find a new Heart given to you; 'till you are inclined and enabled to forſake every evil Way, and preſs after an univerſal Conformity to the Will of GOD, as revealed to you by CHRIST in the Goſpel; in a Word, 'till you have forſaken the broad Way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and find your Heart inlarged delightfully to run the Way of GOD's Commandments, that narrow Way which leadeth unto Life.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt come to a Concluſion— And now GOD only knows what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment ſuch Exhortations, Warnings, and Directions will find among you. For <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> water; but GOD only can give the Increaſe. Your faithful Miniſters can only ſpeak to the Ear; and muſt leave the Succeſs to GOD:
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003167_0097_0FF088CE9E79E910"/>tho' whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear, they will not loſe their Reward. 'Tis an awful paſſage 2 Cor. 2. 15, 16. <hi>We are unto</hi> GOD <hi>a ſweet ſavour of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. To the one we are the ſavour of Death unto Death; and to the other the ſavour of Life unto Life.</hi> How affecting is it to think of being a <hi>ſweet Savour in them that periſh!</hi> O that we may never be ſent unto you, to make any blind Eyes blinder, and hard Hearts hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er! Wherefore as we would not <hi>ceaſe warning every man, and teaching every man, that we may preſent every man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in</hi> CHRIST JESUS <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. 1.1.</note>: ſo we leave the ſolemn Warnings of GOD with you. You have often had Life and Death ſet before you, and the great Motives of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel earneſtly urged upon you. And if after all, you will go on ſtill in your Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and walk on in the Broad Way of Sin, what a dreadful Account will you have to give up at laſt? You may expect in a little time to find by ſad Experience what the DESTRUCTION is, which your Way leads unto. And GOD only knows how ſuddenly that Portion may be allotted to you: For he will take His
