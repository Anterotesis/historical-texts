            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>To Sir GEORGE SAVILLE, Baronet,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is not only as the brighteſt ornament to the following eſſays, in the cauſe of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the writer uſes the liberty of prefixing to them your name, but being of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that your actions will alſo beſt illuſtrate the principles he wiſhes to inculcate, he hopes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from it all the advantages of a well-ſelected motto. Feeling only for the public, you will ſuffer even your own merits to be made the theme of praiſe, ſo long as the public intereſts ſhall be thereby promoted. It is thus that your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will have its due effect; it is thus that your patriotiſm will be reflected from a thouſand mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and that, inſtead of exerting a ſingle voice in the ſenate, you will harangue from a thouſand roſtrums at once; inciting in all the nations, to whom are known the Engliſh laws and language, a love of virtue, and a reſolution to be free. It is this appeal to diſtinguiſhed worth in real life, that gives the ſureſt efficacy to the precepts of the moraliſt; it is this which induces the lips of the orator with the powers of perſuaſion, and is the kindling incentive to a virtuous emulation. How glorious the privileges of patriotic virtue! Not limited by the ſcanty meaſure of perſonal labours, not confined to one age or empire, they extend to unborn times and nations, and the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014673_0004_0F948C5CC80EF148"/>
patriot is the common bleſſing of human kind. As an Ariſtides, a Brutus, or a Cato, hath oft given birth to Britiſh patriotiſm; ſo ſhall Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, in ſome diſtant period, and future Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, catch the ſame generous flame from the great example of the Saville of theſe days.</p>
            <p>Such indeed is the preſent low eſtate of public ſpirit amongſt us, that a man hath need of ſome fortitude, who, amongſt the generality, would ſo much as contend for the reality of its exiſtence. Nay, it hath not been diſcarded by the bulk of the groſs-minded vulgar only, but our very phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophers too, ſo deep is the taint, have told us, that wiſdom is not the portion of that man, who can ſacrifice his time and his peace, by taking an active part in public affairs; and yet, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the doctrines of theſe epicurean ſages, and as little regarding the united ridicule of the thouſands, and the ten thouſands of their impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit diſciples, I am not aſhamed to acknowledge myſelf one of thoſe weak mortals, who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the eaſe and luxury of life are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of a good man, when his country demands his labours, his counſel, or his ſword. Being of of opinion then, that patriotiſm is a real, an exalted virtue, I muſt neceſſarily think, that to decline its duties, is a meanneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the manly character, and that its wilful violation, is the moſt atrocious of crimes. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too, that this virtue burns with no ſmall ardour in many a Britiſh boſom; nay, I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous enough to think, that beſides the inſtance I have particularly ſingled out, it is to be found
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:014673_0005_0F948C5E18FC29F8"/>
even in the Houſe of Commons: there, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, its growth is not very abundant; for, it is not of a nature to thrive in the ſame ſoil, which the occaſional occupier muſt needs ſow with the noxious ſeeds of proſtitution and bribery ere he can ſecure poſſeſſion. Happy, could we ſay of this ſeed, that <q>it is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in glory:</q> but we are aſſured, by unerring wiſdom, that <q>men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles;</q> and our own experience hath invariably taught us, that in the Houſe of Commons, <q>a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit</q> alone. And until there ſhall be opened clean doors into that Houſe, by which the members may enter undefiled, by the baſe arts practiſed in elections, muſt we not know, that the real patriot, he who is incapable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching or invading the rights of his fellow-citizens, is to be looked for without thoſe walls, and not within them? And except theſe unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted doors ſhall be opened without much farther delay, will not that Houſe, already the ſink of corruption, inevitably become the putrid grave of the conſtitution?—though not, I truſt, its annihilation. How ſevere, or how laſting might be this convulſion, this diſſolution of the ſtate, it is difficult to imagine, but that, as heretofore, it would only periſh for a ſeaſon, like a grain of ſeed-corn, and, like that, be reſtored again, with a reduplication of the principles of life and vigour; I am happy in having an aſſured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:014673_0006_0F948C5E8993FB08"/>
Since I am now addreſſing myſelf to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, Sir George, no leſs than to yourſelf, it is fit I ſhould remind them, that your parliamentary integrity, is only a natural conſequence of thoſe means by which you became a member. In one, as in the other, neither corrupting nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, you ſtand a noble exception to a general rule; in which, we clearly ſee, how valuable would be an independent, an upright parliament. Let but the whole of the repreſentative body be elected by the unbribed, and unbiaſſed ſuffrages of the freeholders, and we ſhould once more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Houſe of Commons an aſſembly of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, the terror, not the tool of bad miniſters; the bulwark, not the abuſers of the people.</p>
            <p>Perhaps too, the public may be more indebted to you than they ſeem to conſider, for having, by an uniform conduct, through a ſeries of years, effectually overturned the darling, but infamous maxim of modern politicians that <hi>every man hath his price,</hi> a ſentiment which could only ariſe in the baſeſt and moſt degenerate heart. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the contrary is a truth, far better eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed than any the moſt notorious hiſtorical fact whatever, all hiſtory being enriched with numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtances of it; and that it might be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated in the humble and unrecorded ſcenes of private life, by every man, whoſe friends are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the wiſe and good; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding every human heart ought to revolt at ſo ſhocking a propoſition, yet, it is certain, ſuch is the prevalence of any opinion, how ridiculous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which falls in with our ſordid devotion to
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:014673_0007_0F948C5F3707EBD0"/>
avarice, that maſter-vice of the times! that we continually find this degrading maxim in the mouths, even of thoſe whoſe characters in the world are yet reſpectable. This ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is very often to be imputed to a weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, or extreme ignorance, and very often to an abſence of thought, or that wretched ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, which, for the ſake of eaſe, always adopts the mode of thinking and ſpeaking which is moſt in faſhion.</p>
            <p>But when men of underſtanding, of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and learning, become the controverſial champions of this tenet; when they enter the liſts in form, make a diſplay of their armour, and their arms, and boldly challenge all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, what are we to think? Little do they ſeem to reflect, that they have no way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off with honour, but by retiring from the field, and wholly abandoning a bad cauſe; for ſo long as they maintain it, do they not, in the very act, proclaim themſelves villains in grain, or at beſt, only negatively honeſt, for want of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be otherwiſe, and tacitly acknowledge, it would be a madneſs in you to intruſt them with any ſecret or depoſit, by means of which they could advance their fortune, without hazard from your reſentment or a gibbet?</p>
            <p>Theſe unhappy men, do not only forfeit by this conduct, all title to truſt and confidence in ſociety, but what is ſtill worſe, they expreſsly exclude themſelves from the benefits of religion, ſaying, in effect, that our Saviour's miſſion, for the purpoſes of teaching morality, and beſtowing
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:014673_0008_0F948C60039622F8"/>
ſalvation on mankind, ſo far from being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of divine wiſdom and goodneſs, was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted like the vague ſchemes of purblind mortals, to no manner of purpoſe; for, ſo long as it is their aſſertion, that every man hath his price; ſo long do they aſſert, that it is impoſſible to obey the laws of Chriſt even in a tolerable degree; and to deny, that chriſtianity is capable of inſpiring her followers with an incorruptible integrity, is not only to betray a total ignorance of its doctrines, but to make war upon fact, and the common conſent of mankind. Thus is this hackneyed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, examined either by the rules of reaſon or religion, evidently involved in palpable abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and in rank impiety.</p>
            <p>For the moſt part, they who propagate this wretched opinion, know not what they do; and would be exceedingly ſhocked, did they perceive, how they were at once ſubverting their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles, and ſapping the very foundations of all integrity in ſociety both public and private. So dangerous, is it, unthinkingly, to ſwim with the ſtream of popular opinion! eſpecially ſince it is become the great maſter-ſtroke of the arch-enemies of religion and virtue, to turn the courſe of this current in their favour, and to make it the vehicle of that poiſon they are for ever pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in at the fountain head, in order to taint a thoughtleſs world, They uſe all the arts of a ſubtile and ingenious addreſs, to withdraw our attention and reſpect from authors of ſterling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to inſinuate themſelves upon us as our only infallible guides. Under the maſk of
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:014673_0009_0F948C60F83CF130"/>
candour, they are moſt deciſive and dogmatical, infecting with arrogance thoſe ductile minds, which before were adorned with humility.</p>
            <p>In a ſtile of Attic elegance, they inculcate a frivolous and vitiated taſte; teachers of intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual abſtraction and refinement, they promote ſenſuality; with an oſtentation of humanity, they looſen the bands of ſociety; profeſſors of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they demonſtrate that it hath no foundation; deep in all philoſophy, they aſſure us that truth is the only thing we ought to purſue; that it is moſt difficult to attain, except with their aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and when attained, they ſhew us as clearly, that it is not worth our pains; and, like ſuperior intelligences, ſo very refined and ſpiritual, (as they would have you believe) as to look down upon human nature as upon a lower order of beings, and to contemplate, with an unmoved indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and compoſure, the blindneſs and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, the little paſſions and anxieties of a fretful and miſerable world, they inform us that wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſiſts in this ſublime apathetic inſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, while they, all the while are, in reality, ſacrificing their own tranquillity, in carrying on perpetual hoſtilities againſt the invincible powers of truth, religion, and common ſenſe, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the guidance of their reſtleſs and indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable pens to pride, ſpleen, vanity, caprice, and ſordid avarice.</p>
            <p>By proſtituting to the worſt of purpoſes a flaſhy wit and ſpecious eloquence, they captivate the ſhallow, the luxurious and the gay; while, for the reliſh of thoſe who have underſtandings

ſome-what ſuperior, but more gloom and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence in their hearts, they ſeaſon their pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compoſitions with a poignant irony and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, which is uſually heightened in proportion as the object is ſacred or divine.</p>
            <p>When referring to the Deity, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible things of heaven and eternity, one might expect, even of a philoſopher, ſome diffidence, ſome ſobriety and decency; but this were too great a condeſcenſion from the mad genius of Geneva, the ſcribbling buffoon of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or that "fatteſt hog of Epicurus's ſtye," the "ſee-ſaw ſceptic from the remoteſt North<note n="*" place="bottom">Heroic Epiſtle to Sir W. Chambers.</note>." With theſe "men of renown," as leaders of the van, and the Walpolian ſtate-proſtitute to conduct the rear-guard; even the diſorderly, the coward clans of vice and ſeduction, are an over-match for the feeble guards of virtue in moſt faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable minds.</p>
            <p>By ſtrengthening the party of the diſſolute, and encouraging the unmanly, unprincipled, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and diſſipated ſpirit, which marks the character of the times, and by making a jeſt of every thing ſerious and noble; they inſinuate themſelves into the unguarded boſoms of that claſs of triflers, and become their oracles. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is now done, for the faſhionable world is the mint, where common opinion firſt obtains its ſtamp and currency; circulating thence throughout the community like current coin, and, like that too, giving conſequence to its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:014673_0011_0F948C63DFC7D570"/>
in proportion to his ſtore of this fictitious, this imaginary wealth.</p>
            <p>Hence it is, that in almoſt every faſhionable circle, from the peer to the 'prentice, from the profound writer of ſtuff, called <hi>Eſſays on the Origin of Evil,</hi> to the novel reading miſs in her teens, we are for ever peſtered with traſh, that is the bane of morality, and the diſgrace of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings. And while the polite praters vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine they are diſplaying their own talents and erudition, their knowledge and liberal way of thinking; they are only the mere ecchoes of thoſe teachers of falſehood; the ſimple and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient tools, by whoſe agency thoſe cunning en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers are undermining all the defences of religion, of public ſpirit, and of private virtue.</p>
            <p>It is matter of no ſmall aſtoniſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to obſerve how much an indifference to moral rectitude, a habit of evading the toil of thinking and this paſſive reſignation to the ſentiments and principles of others, debilitate the human mind, though naturally active and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and ſubject it to the reproach of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the groſſeſt credulity, and even of aſſenting to manifeſt contradictions. Nothing is more common, than for thoſe, who have the Walpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian maxim we have been ſpeaking of always at their tongue's end, to form to themſelves, I know not how, an ideal diſtinction between pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic integrity and private honeſty. While they lay it down, as a fixed principle, that the ſenator may be corrupted by a court bribe, to injure or oppreſs his country they will yet allow, that he
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:014673_0012_0F948C63FB626098"/>
is rigidly juſt in all his private dealings; that he is the kindeſt landlord, the gentleſt maſter, the tendereſt relation, the trueſt friend; ſo very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in ſelf-gratification, and of ſo humane a nature, as to bound his expences very far within his income, and to diſtribute large ſums in ſecret charities, with a minute attention to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of diſtreſs amongſt the objects of his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. And, is it to be believed, that ſuch a man—that a Saville is to be made a traitor?—Ye ecchoes of abſurdity, think and bluſh!</p>
            <p>But whatever hopes may be entertained of the ingenuous majority of miſtaken perſons, I know there is yet a party, whoſe incapacity for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thought, or whoſe malignity is ſuch, that when, by the mention of his name as a ſincere patriot, they have been ſtruck dumb with unelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible conviction, and obliged, in their own deſpite, to confeſs his virtue, have yet ſought to tarniſh its luſtre, by baſe inſinuations, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his underſtanding. Theſe inſidious creatures are not ſparing of cold panegyrics on his general character; but, with much pity for the weakneſs of a well-meaning man, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he ſhould be ſo deluded; they are amazed, forſooth, that he can fancy he is ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public, by oppoſing and embarraſſing the neceſſary and wiſe meaſures of government; they are ſorry, that ſuch a man ſhould keep in countenance others, who only act the patriot, in order to obtain their own fooliſh ends; and they muſt needs ſay, they think him ſomewhat too much attentive to popular clamours and popular
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:014673_0013_0F948C64D27989B8"/>
praiſe, and too much guided by a blind popular zeal.</p>
            <p>But what they are moſt anxious to inform you of, with ſome parade they affect to ſuppreſs. In tenderneſs to him, they do not chooſe to ſpeak freely on that head—there is no neceſſity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain themſelves—they are convinced he is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how much he is impoſed on—but they take care, however, before they have done, by certain circumlocutions, by broken ſentences, and unambiguous givings-out; to inform you, in pretty plain terms, that he is no better than the dupe of a dangerous party, a mere puppet, played off by the crafty leader of a faction, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to his intereſt by flattery alone, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for his own intrinſic importance, but merely to grace the cauſe with a name, upon which the ſilly multitude have thought fit to beſtow an unmerited popularity. What a return for the labours of a life, devoted to the ſervice of that community, of which theſe wretches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a part! But no benefits can touch the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous heart of ingratitude! Nor ſhall malice and envy ever ſleep, while a ſpark of virtue remains to bleſs mankind! Merit, however raiſed to ſuch an elevation, is a mark placed far above the idle efforts of their fever-ſhaken diſtempered nerves. Expoſing their own hideous deſormity, they ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize by the contraſt, that virtue they mean to depreciate, and madden with ſelf-inflicted tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their peculiar curſe. Theſe ingrates to their benefactor, ſtupid as they are, ought to know, that though his character, like things
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:014673_0014_0F948C65870E1378"/>
moſt ſacred, may be profaned, yet that the broad aegis of wiſdom and virtue renders it invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable.</p>
            <p>Forgive me, Sir George, that I ſay theſe things in an addreſs to yourſelf! As humility itſelf, in a private ſtation, cannot decline to make thoſe honeſt boaſts which beſpeak its merit, when that is baſely traduced, or ungratefully forgotten; ſo the public labourer, will not be offended, that his honeſt fame is held up to his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the purpoſes of exalting truth, and ſubduing falſehood, as an incitement to a ſteady and high ſpirited patriotiſm, and an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the timid in the public cauſe: while to thoſe foul harpies, who wallow in the filth of corruption, and batten at the ever-bleeding wounds of their country; and to thoſe minor miſcreants, doomed by their dulneſs, and their abject meanneſs, to remain the drudges of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without its wages; it ſhall ſerve as an ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine mirror, before whoſe brightneſs, if they have the power to open their faſcinated eyes, they ſhall then ſhrink at the withering blaſt, like adders in a conſuming fire; praying, but pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vain, to loſe the bitter conſciouſneſs of their own infamy,</p>
            <p>I ſhall likewiſe hope for your pardon, on this occaſion, becauſe you underſtand the world well enough, to know the endleſs ſhifts and evaſions of the diſingenuous and perverſe, who perſiſt, with unparalleled effrontery, to deny the moſt undoubted truths, until they are borne down by the weight of demonſtration and the force of
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:014673_0015_0F948C66058EF558"/>
facts. They will deny, in turn, the exiſtence of every command in the decalogue; and you will diſpute with them in vain, until you open the bible, and reduce them to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of either giving up their argument or their ſenſes. So, when any one ſhall undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to theſe maligners of mankind, if he content himſelf with proving ever ſo clearly from nature, from reaſon, or religion, that a real patriot may be found, he had as well argue with the ſtones under his feet, unleſs he produce the man, and put it upon his adverſaries to diſprove the fact.</p>
            <p>If by thoſe, who are themſelves incapable of a generous ſentiment, and cannot believe a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted affection can warm the human breaſt, I ſhould be accuſed of an unworthy deſign to flatter you in this epiſtle; I ſhall be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the charge, whenever they prove that I have, in any particular, exceeded the truth or endeavoured to miſlead you into a deviation from the paths of honour. And I would obſerve, that he, who is the profeſſed friend to every virtue, and the declared enemy of every vice, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ought to be applauded; and puts it out of the power of even a Decius (Shakeſpear's Julius Caeſar.) to flatter him—except to acts of goodneſs. Not having any favourite vice to be ſoothed, he is only aſſailable on the ſide of virtue; and the exquiſite ſatisfaction, ariſing from the juſt praiſe of virtue, being one of the

rewards deſigned it by Providence, and intended alſo to animate it, and urge it onward to its final goal with unremitting ardour, to beſtow it where it is due, is therefore as much the duty of every good man, as it <q>is to render unto Caeſar the things that be Caeſar's.</q>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſame motives, which firſt prompted me to publiſh the following letters ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, have, upon farther conſideration, determined me to do it in a collective form. To the generality, it may not, perhaps, be a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of them, when I aſſure my readers, they wholly proceed from a ſtrong conviction of mind, and a zeal for the cauſe of liberty, and not from a view of ſerving, or of diſtreſſing any party or particular perſon whatſoever, except the arguments they contain ſhall make converts to my political creed concerning America; I fear they are not very likely to pleaſe any party, for Britons of all parties and of almoſt all deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ſeem far too unanimous in wiſhing to tyrannize over their brethren on the other ſide of the Atlantic.</p>
            <p>Happy, moſt happy, ſhould the writer eſteem himſelf, could he entertain any flattering hopes, that his plain and humble pen might inſpire his countrymen with more generous ſentiments! But are not his countrymen the brave ſons of freedom? lovers of juſtice, and by nature gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? He will then—he muſt entertain theſe
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:014673_0018_0F948C6874E09348"/>
pleaſing hopes. To know, that he had thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced a ſingle individual, would afford him reflections, that would more than counter-balance the ordinary evils of life.</p>
            <p>If, however, he had no other ſatisfaction on this occaſion, it would yet be ſufficient, that his American kindred ſhould ſay, <q>There was ONE Engliſhman an advocate for our freedom;</q> but I truſt there are, in the private and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent walks of life, many of the ſame ſentiment; and that their numbers will daily increaſe, as a free diſcuſſion of the parliamentary pretenſions to the ſovereignty of America, ſhall more and more diſcover their total want of foundation; and, I am very far from deſpairing, that this truth ſhall, ere long be acknowledged even by the miniſter and the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>We may naturally expect, however, that they will be the laſt amongſt the intelligent to receive this doctrine; for long and eſtabliſhed habits form, even in liberal minds, very inveterate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices. Accuſtomed ſo long to govern, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated to the regular exerciſe of authority, they will find it very difficult to believe, that it ought to be lodged in any other hands; and they muſt be above the common weakneſſes of our nature, could they part with it without an internal ſtruggle, ſince a love of power is, perhaps, the moſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>-rooted of all the human paſſions.</p>
            <p>But, for the honor of human nature, and the glory of this free nation, I muſt believe, that our
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:014673_0019_0F948C68F98115A8"/>
legiſlators will, in the end, gain this noble victory themſelves. Could I ſuppoſe a Britiſh miniſter of State to have a few leiſure moments, from the drudgery of his office, and the worſe drudgery of ſopping the hungry hounds that are forever ready to devour him; from directing the endleſs ſchemes and manoeuvres of the miniſterial cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and from ſuperintending their operation.</p>
            <p>Could I ſuppoſe a miniſter, I ſay, to have ſo much leiſure from all theſe avocations, for ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contemplating the preſent alarming ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his country, and for beſtowing a little fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought upon what will probably be its ſate, in a very ſhort period of time, unleſs ſome great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations take place; and, could I farther ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this miniſter, turning his eyes within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to meditate upon what it is from which he can hope to derive any real ſatisfaction; to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoroughly the cobwebs of all myſterious and arbitrary policy, and the rotten pillars of his ſtate and power; and, when ſufficiently diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their loathſomeneſs and folly, could I then imagine him to revolve in his mind, how pleaſant it would be to carry on the public buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on a liberal and ſimple plan, pure from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and uniformly friendly to freedom; I have not a doubt but he would moſt ardently wiſh to embrace ſuch a plan.</p>
            <p>How gladly, if a man of ſenſe, and a lover of integrity, would he exchange for it, his toils and perplexities, his provocations, his anxieties, and diſtracting cares; but above all, that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:014673_0020_0F948C69B8773B10"/>
of criminality, which no ſtate-neceſſity can effectually craze from the mind of a miniſter, who, wanting the fortitude to forſake the wretched ſyſtem of the baſe-minded Walpole, continues to work the wheels of government by the ſtreams of corruption, and who, by being involved in the labyrinths, unavoidable in all ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems but the right one, and, in order to avoid the moſt fatal of all imputations to a miniſter, that of doing nothing, finds himſelf obliged to commit frequent violations on the moſt ſacred rights of his fellow-ſubjects, ſo that he may get forward at any rate with the work of the day, and keep the people amuſed, by letting them ſee he is doing ſomething.</p>
            <p>Until fair experiment ſhall have convinced me of the contrary, I ſhall never, I believe, think otherwiſe, than that the moſt practicable ſyſtem of government is, at the ſame time the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, upright, coercive and immoveable. Founded in freedom, and the common good of the people, it will cheriſh the ſpirit of liberty as its vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; having no dangerous or ſelfiſh deſigns, it will affect no myſtery: knowing the neceſſity of virtue, and the advantages of integrity, it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance vice, ſuppreſs corruption of every kind, and be inflexible to juſtice; and thus, by affording general protection, it will find unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſupport.</p>
            <p>But, it being our more immediate buſineſs at preſent, to confine our ideas of reformation to
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:014673_0021_0F948C6BCBCEC420"/>
what regards the North-American colonies, which make, at this unhappy time, no ſmall addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that burthen which galls the miniſterial ſhoulder. I have only to add, that I muſt firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold my confidence, that our preſent miniſter would, in the following letters, meet with the neceſſary hints and rudiments, from which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſmalleſt difficulty, he might plan the means for eaſing himſelf of it; to the infinite advantage and glory of his country, to his own honor and ſatisfaction, and to the inexpreſſible happineſs of the whole people of America.</p>
            <p>As I am certain, that no party principles will betray me, to have written from any other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives than thoſe I profeſs; ſo when I aſſure the reader, that the ſtile and manner in which I have done it are my very beſt, I hope he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I have not folly enough to aſpire at literary fame; and that his candour will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the very many imperfections of this little work.</p>

            <p>EVEN the moſt ignorant perceive this to be a criſis of the utmoſt importance to Great-Britain, and to North America: but it doth not appear that the moſt ſage have yet formed a plan of proceedings that is likely to give content to both parties. With deference to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others, and with a ſincere deſire of rendering a ſervice to my country, permit me to offer a few thoughts on the ſubject, and to throw ſome hints in your way, which I do not perceive to have been as yet ſtarted by any political writer. It is moſt deeply to be lamented, that paſſion and prejudice, pride and ſelf-intereſt, have evidently too much influence over the minds of moſt men, to ſuffer them to decide impartially and equitably in ſuch delicate conjunctures as the preſent. We want now to diſcover, and to eſtabliſh a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of laſting union between our colonies and the mother country; while the meaſures of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, the deliberations in parliament, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of political writers, and the language of the people at large, all tend to prove, that the moſt probable event will be mutual jealouſy, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, and ſtrife.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:014673_0024_0F948C71D504A168"/>
It is the misfortune of this country, ſurely without neceſſity, that ſchemes of reformation, and plans of a great and comprehenſive nature, for the general benefit of the people, are rarely or never formed before hand in the peaceful cloſet of a provident miniſter; and, it is as unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for them to attain their completion by diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate contemplation, and the calm determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of wiſdom. On the contrary, we ſuffer every trivial error and irregularity to ripen into miſchief before we think of reformation; when we undertake it at laſt with minds heated to fermentation, and we perform it with raſhneſs and violence. Let not, however, on this great occaſion, any thing ſo intemperate and faulty mark your deliberations, nor leave a ſtain upon your meaſures. Reflect, that the fate of empires is now in ſuſpence, and that the balance is in your hands. No patriots of any age or country ever had a nobler opportunity of immortalizing their ſame; nor, what is infinitely more to be deſired, of obtaining the inward reward of ſelf-approbation for having given happineſs to milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Remember your duty to mankind; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your duty to God. Let not the breath of anger or reſentment ſully your councils; let not jealouſy or ambition poiſon your breaſts, nor hang upon your tongues. Be calm, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, candid, prudent, wiſe; let juſtice and benevolence rule your hearts; in one word, be Chriſtians! embracing with love and charity your American brethren; and conſulting their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs equally with your own.</p>
            <p>The two grand queſtions now to be decided are; 1. Whether or not the Britiſh parliament or
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014673_0025_0F948C73E3E8AC38"/>
legiſlature, hath the right of ſovereignty over North America? And, 2. Whether or not a Britiſh parliament hath a right to tax the North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans (1)?</p>
            <p>Although the latter queſtion be properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the former (2), ſince taxation is a part of legiſlation, yet being extremely ſimple and well underſtood, I ſhall conſider it firſt, in order to get rid of it; ſo as it may not embarraſs our diſcuſſion of the other, which it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to treat with all poſſible perſpicuity. As for thoſe who, with great warmth, maintain the right of parliament to tax the North Americans, ſurely they are rather to be pitied than argued with! Muſt they not be totally ignorant of the principles of that ineſtimable conſtitution, under which they have the happineſs to live? How then ſhall we expect them to be acquainted with the principles of the law of nature, from whence they flow? When I meet a man inclined towards this opinion, I do not contradict him; and I beſeech him to avoid diſputation above all things. I beg of him alſo to diveſt himſelf totally of every previous inclination for ſeeing the point in this or in that light; to conſult immediately the great Mr. Locke, and other authors of note, and after a careful examination of the arguments for and againſt the queſtion, to decide upon it himſelf impartially and honeſtly. I remind him likewiſe, that it is his intereſt, as well as for the advantage of his country, that he ſhould diſcover the truth: but a matter of total indifferency on which ſide it lies. If this fail to ſet him right, I do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with him myſelf, nor do I aſſume the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or manner of an opponent; but I intimate
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014673_0026_0F948C752099BFB8"/>
to him, that, were he of my opinion, it would afford him great ſatisfaction of mind; ſince it gives me a conſiſtency of ſentiment, by which I ſee every right of legiſlation perfectly conſonant with the freedom and the happineſs of mankind; and I then ſimply ſtate my reaſons for holding it. I have ever found this appeal to a man's own heart and underſtanding, the moſt ſucceſsful way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the one, and improving the other. Very few indeed of thoſe with whom I have thus reaſoned, on the preſent ſubject of American tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, have gone away unſatisfied, or found a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reading, in order to be convinced: but ignorance and obſtinacy, heated by former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, have ſometimes rendered my endeavours ineffectual; and ſuch as were notorious for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ambition, or ſervility to the ruling powers, have generally remained immoveable, though without producing one juſt or wiſe argument in ſupport of their ſentiments, or rather their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such men are not aware how much they lay open to the light that part of their characters they always mean to hide; and that there is as much diſhoneſty in that diſpoſition which denies an evident truth, as in that which gives a falſe evidence, or takes a purſe. It would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no learning, but only common ſenſe and common honeſty, to have known that a man hath no property, in that which another 'can <hi>by right</hi> take from him <hi>without his conſent,</hi>' had not the world been peſtered with writers of corrupt hearts, who, for wicked ends, have brought this clear propoſition into diſpute, and involved it in a caſuiſtical jargon, which perſons of plain ſenſe, and too buſy or too indolent for reflection, are apt

to miſtake for learning and ſuperior ſkill; and to compliment it, firſt with doubting, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying upon truſt, what they once underſtood and believed. But I truſt, that characters ſo weak as theſe, ſo profligate as thoſe, will have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence with the Britiſh legiſlature; that its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations will be carried on with too much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and too much dignity to give a hearing to the drivelings of ſhallow and impudent praters; or to ſuffer the unſeemly violence of ſurious and tyrannical ſpirits, to diſcompoſe that ſerenity and diveſtment from paſſion, which ought ever to be obſerved in the preſence of his Majeſty, and in the awful councils of the nation. Here I muſt expreſs my concern, that it ſhould ſeem to be thought by very ſenſible men, that it is neceſſary to appeal to ancient times, in order to aſcertain the right of a free ſubject not to be taxed without his conſent, either in perſon or by repreſentation. With as much reaſon might we go about to prove, that no ancient King had a right to take from every ſubject at his good pleaſure, an eye or an ear. It is ſufficient that we know any maxim in our law, to be at the ſame time a maxim of the law of nature, or demonſtrably deducible from its fundamental principles. What is it to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whether ſuch a maxim was received and acquieſced in only yeſterday, or a thouſand years ago? Truth is not the leſs truth, though man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were in ignorance of it until lately. No mathematician, in demonſtrating an aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal problem, thinks it neceſſary to prove the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a triangle, a circle, or an ellipſis; why then ſhould the politician waſte his time and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs his argument, with proving principles and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014673_0028_0F948BC00DF60150"/>
axioms univerſally aſſented to by all juſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? not but that a maxim carries more weight and authority with it, as this of the neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between taxation and repreſentation, when we find it has been the uniform ſentiment of all ages; and references to antient times, and to various hiſtories, ſerve very properly to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate political arguments; ſometimes facilitating their reception among the timid and ſuſpicious, who are apt to ſhrink at bold and honeſt truths, to which they have not been familiarized.</p>

            <p>TO every man of candour, I apprehend it muſt be evident, that 'Parliament hath not the rights of ſovereignty over his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's American ſubjects.' Every ſpecies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of declamation and ſophiſtry, have been made uſe of in order to ſhew that it hath, becauſe it gratifies the pride of Engliſhmen in general, to think that, that legiſlature, in which they feel themſelves to have a ſhare, ſhould govern half the world: but there are not wanting an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt few who think more juſtly and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. Amongſt this number, a writer who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes himſelf A. B. in the Public Advertiſer of the 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, deſerves the thanks of every friend to freedom. Except in his idea of the country of America, having been by the prerogative the property of the crown, which, in the ſenſe of the paſſage, ſignifies the <hi>King excluſively,</hi> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agree with him in ſentiment. He hath clearly and elegantly refuted the notion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary ſovereignty; he has, with a generous warmth becoming an Engliſhman, appealed to the manly ſenſe and to the virtue of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (1). It would be an endleſs, as well as an uſeleſs work, to follow the many daily writers along all the mazes they wander through, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſſert the ſovereignty of parliament, and to juſtify adminiſtration in the harſh meaſures they are now carrying into execution. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their laboured and fine-ſpun performances, there is in reality no difficulty in the caſe. We
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:014673_0030_0F948BC0F46669D8"/>
have no need of profound learning, nor an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate acquaintance with antiquity, nor even of the hiſtory of the reſpective provinces and their different origins; neither do we want copies of grants, charters, or acts of parliament, in order to judge of the queſtion before us. If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but the moſt well known principles of the Engliſh conſtitution; if we comprehend but a few of the plain maxims of the law of nature, and the cleareſt doctrines of Chriſtianity, all which are ſo ſimple and plain, as to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by hundreds, nay thouſands, of plain men who know not that they are poſſeſſed of ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a treaſure, we have knowledge enough on this occaſion. The only requiſite wanting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, is a heart ſtrictly devoted to truth and virtue, without which we ſhall never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any doctrine that does not ſoothe our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>The goſpel of civil as well as religious ſalvation <q>is hid from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed unto babes;</q> that is, unto thoſe who are not puffed up with vanity and falſe learning, nor blinded by pride, ambition, and ſelf-intereſt, but whoſe minds are in a ſtate of humility and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. But we have our political Popes, who would fain have us diſtruſt our common ſenſe and our feelings, and believe implicitly in their infallibility; nor do I doubt, but they would prove as faithful guardians of civil, as the Roman Pope is of religious, liberty, was it once put into their hands.</p>
            <p>It is a capital error in the reaſonings of ſeveral writers on this ſubject, that they conſider the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of mankind in the ſame light as an eſtate
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:014673_0031_0F948BC1B0D51170"/>
or chattel, and go about to prove or diſprove their right to it by the letter of grants and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by cuſtom and uſage, and by municipal ſtatutes. Hence too we are told, that theſe men have a right to more, thoſe to leſs, and ſome to none at all. But a title to the liberty of mankind is not eſtabliſhed on ſuch rotten foundations: 'tis not among mouldy parchments, nor in the cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs of a caſuiſt's brain we are to look for it; it is the immediate, the univerſal gift of God, and the ſeal of it is that free-will which he hath made the nobleſt conſtituent of man's nature. It is not derived from any one, but original in every one; it is inherent and unalienable. The moſt antient inheritance cannot ſtrengthen this right; the want of inheritance cannot impair it. The child of a ſlave is as free-born, according to the law of nature, as he who could trace a free anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try up to the creation. Slavery in all its forms, in all its degrees, is an outrageous violation of the rights of mankind; an odious degradation of human nature. It is utterly impoſſible that any human being can be without a title to liberty, except he himſelf hath forfeited it by crimes which make him dangerous to ſociety.</p>
            <p>Let us then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> no more of a right in our preſent-conſtituted parliament to govern the Americans, as being derived from any former exerciſe of this ſovereignty, from the original dependence and protection of the emigrants and infant colonies, or from the tenour of grants and charters! The reſpective governments in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014673_0032_0F948BC28C3C0CB0"/>
are no longer dependent colonies; they are independent nations.—Not that I allow they ever were otherways than free (although depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) in the moſt abſolute ſenſe: All their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitutions either were, or ought to have been on the true principles of freedom. They are not to be deprived of it as a man would loſe an eſtate, by a flaw in their title; for I have already proved, that their title can have no flaw. Thoſe who are ſo fond of placing them meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically in the relation of children to a parent ſtate, and thence are childiſh enough to argue for a blind filial obedience, ſhould recollect, that the power of a parent, even during childhood, doth not extend to any act of tyranny or injuſtice; and totally ceaſes when the child arrives at years of maturity. Then, as to the <hi>property</hi> of a child, a parent cannot take it from him even <hi>with</hi> his conſent; and as ſoon as his independency puts it in his power to give it to his parent, he hath alſo the power of with-holding it if he think proper. In ſhort, during infancy, he muſt be protected agreable to the laws of equity; when arrived at manhood, he is free, and becomes his own protector. But analogy not being the ſafe road of reaſon, we reſign it again, after this ſhort excurſion, to thoſe who careleſsly range the fields of politics for amuſement; but are not ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, as we are, of reaching the abodes of truth and freedom.</p>
            <p>The Americans, in common with the whole race of man, have indiſputably an inherent right to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014673_0033_0F948BC497D0F838"/>
liberty; and to be governed by ſuch laws as ſhall beſt provide for the continuance of that liberty, and for ſecuring their property. Theſe are the hinges on which turn the welfare and happineſs of ſociety; theſe are the true, the only ends of civil government. But how are they to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the ſovereignty of a Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Are not the legiſlators of every free ſtate to be bound themſelves by the laws they make? And, muſt they not tax their own purſes, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoſe of their conſtituents? Is there any ſafety for the people without theſe ties upon their legiſlators? Will a member of the Britiſh parliament be bound by any law enacted for, and confined to, America? Muſt the purſes of the Americans be at his mercy, while his own ſhall be exempt from every taxation he may vote? What Engliſh ſchool-boy, ſo ignorant of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to admit theſe abſurdities! He muſt firſt go out into the world, and, by the help of a little political ſophiſtry, unlearn his common-ſenſe, and even his A B C.</p>
            <p>The ſecure enjoyment of liberty and property, in which conſiſt the welfare and happineſs of a people, being the true ends of all civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this is the foundation alone on which we muſt argue concerning who have a right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern. The anſwer is obvious and ſhort. The rights of ſovereignty reſide in the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that is, they have a right to chuſe their own governors. Minds that do not feel the force of ſelf-evidences may deny the truth of this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014673_0034_0F948BC8B181FEF8"/>
propoſition: but they may be aſſured, that if they ſet themſelves about controverting it, they will only bewilder themſelves in their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties without telling us any thing that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit mankind. Don't we all acknowledge, that the Americans are a free people? But how are they free, if they cannot chooſe their own gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; if their laws be not enacted by their own repreſentatives? In what doth our freedom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt if not in theſe very rights as the eſſence of it? In theſe rights which we have ſo often aſſerted, for which we have ſo often bled! That people cannot be free who are <hi>not</hi> governed by their own conſent. Thoſe who are governed by their own conſent, <hi>chooſe their own governors.</hi> This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably requiſite towards the welfare and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of every people; it is an unalterable law of nature; that is, it is the law of God.</p>

               <p>(1) The letter alluded to, is ſo well worth preſerving, and ſo much to our preſent purpoſe, that I ſhall take the liberty of tranſcribing it for the uſe of my reader.</p>
               <p>"The daily papers abound ſo much in idle declamation againſt the northern colonies, that it is not ſurpriſing, ſuch admirable reaſons are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in moſt companies, where the converſation turns upon this important topic, why force ſhould be uſed to bring them to obedience. Neither is it much to be wondered at, that the people of England are ſo unanimous in their opinions.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014673_0035_0F948BC9F0D3F448"/>
The ſame motives, which induce their rulers to abridge their privileges, make the people of England willing to abridge the liberties of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The ſubjects of the King of Great-Britain conſider themſelves as the ſovereigns of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's American ſubjects; for, if the Houſe of Commons have a legiſlative power over the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the people of England muſt have the ſame right ultimately, as the Houſe derive all their power from the people by election. But it would be worth an enquiry how the people of England obtained this ſovereignty. Was it by the free confeſſions of the American provinces? By no means; or, did it reſult from the ſpirit of the Engliſh laws or government upon the migration of oppreſſed religioniſts and their ſettlement in thoſe regions, which, by the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, were the property of the crown, (2) and which the King, by the ſame prerogative, had the power of alienating without the conſent of the people of England, particularly when ſuch alienation was made to a part of his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? It would be difficult to ſhew that this was the caſe, and I believe it has never been attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That the King ſhould have the ſovereignty of the colonies is but reaſonable, is conſiſtent with the ſpirit of the Engliſh laws. If Engliſh ſubjects ſettle upon the lands of the crown out of this realm, with the King's permiſſion and conſent, they do not thereby become a ſtate independent of the kingly power; as they were ſubjects in England, ſo are they ſubjects in their new country;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014673_0036_0F948BCA12BCE7D0"/>
but they do not become ſubjects of ſubjects; deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable indeed would be their ſituation were ſuch the caſe. On the contrary, they have the ſame rights which they had before, and the ſame ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign executive power. The rights of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen are not confined to this little ſpot of land; but they follow the perſon as a ſhadow follows the ſubſtance; however, it may vary its ſituation, whether it goes North, Weſt, Eaſt, or South. The Houſe of Commons can claim no power of impoſing laws on the coloniſts, for they derive no ſuch power by election. The power of the Commons of Great Britain is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; from the ſpirit of the laws, they have only a legiſlative power, and that power, bears relation to the purpoſe for which it was given; which was to impoſe laws upon the people of Great-Britain, but by no means the people of America, becauſe the power of the electors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to themſelves. The three orders united, i. e. the parliament have a moſt extenſive power over the ſubjects of Great-Britain, becauſe every power in the ſtate meets in that body: but conſidered with reſpect to the Colonies, their pretenſion to ſuch a power there claſhes with the legiſlatures of thoſe Colonies, they can never ſubſiſt together in the ſame place. As to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of parent and child, in which Great-Britain and the colonies are ſaid to ſtand by ſome ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, I confeſs it would be a tolerable good figure in a rhetorical flouriſh, or would ſound very prettily in metre; but with ſubmiſſion,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014673_0037_0F948BCACD9D5A00"/>
when the rights of many opulent and populous provinces are in queſtion, ſomething more than a ſimile or alluſion ought to decide it. Let Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have been admired for ages, for their regard to liberty, bluſh, when it is now ſaid, that, by ſuperior force, they would deprive three or four millions of their fellow-ſubjects of thoſe rights and privileges to which they are ſo attached themſelves. How depraved a mind would that individual be ſaid to poſſeſs, who would defend his property at the riſk of his life, exclaim againſt the aggreſſor as a lawleſs invader, and yet, at the ſame time, or a moment afterwards, behave in the ſame unjuſtifiable manner to his neighbour. Is this the people, will foreigners cry, who are ſo fond of liberty? No; we have always miſtaken them: they are ſelfiſh, arbitrary, and tyrannical, fond of the privileges they enjoy; but they would exclude the reſt of the world, nay, their fellow ſubjects, from the ſame advantages—advantages which they have hitherto enjoyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in common with Engliſhmen. Is this the people ſo celebrated for humanity? No; they are moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human: they invade the moſt precious rights a human being can enjoy, and would render the reſt of mankind miſerable ſervile wretches.—'Tis really ſtrange, the national character of Engliſhmen ſhould have been ſo much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken!"</p>

            <p>AT the ſame Time that I hold that "Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hath not the Rights of Sovereignty over his Majeſty's American Subjects," and that "theſe rights reſide in themſelves," I do not mean to promote an ungrateful forſaking of the mother country by her children, to ſever and eſtrange the ſons from the fathers; but where filial duty and obedience ceaſes, to ſubſtitute in its ſtead a brotherly affection, a manly and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent friendſhip, which naturally takes place where the parent hath truly loved and exerciſed his authority for the ſole end of promoting the welfare of the child, without a view to ſelf intereſt, or the gratification of pride, ambition, or other vicious paſſion. I would conſider the American governments, like that of Ireland, as ſiſter kingdoms; and I would cement a laſting union with them as between the ſeparate branches of one great family. (1) We know that it is impoſſible to effect ſuch a family union, if the arrogance of the elder branch expect to govern the others, or even demand their homage; and how much more ſo, if it demand the uſe of their purſes at its own diſcretion, as a return for former aſſiſtance, or under pretence of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honor and intereſt of the whole combined family. But while every one is left independent,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:014673_0040_0F948BCD0B9AC788"/>
and no other influence is made uſe of but that of ſincere brotherly affection, a reciprocation of good offices, and a fair repreſentation of the general advantage of the whole, there is little doubt but that all will be ready to contribute their reſpective ſhares, and that due reſpect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference will ever be paid to the elder houſe. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily pride, no leſs than thoſe advantages which reſult from unions of ſuch a nature, will produce this effect, except we be aſhamed of our family. I hope a ſelfiſh and tyrannical ſpirit in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, will not make the Americans aſhamed of their deſcent: but illuſtration is miſleading us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the tempting, but unſure, path of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. Let us quit it once more before we loſe fight of the direct road.</p>
            <p>Every one of thoſe writers, who endeavour to ſupport the pretenſions of parliament to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of America by any ſhew of abſtract rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, have, ſo far as they have fallen under my obſervation, either ſat out upon defective premiſes, or from good ones, have drawn ſalſe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as needs muſt be in this caſe, until truth become a changeling.

multiplicity of wheels within wheels, pulleys upon pulleys, and ſprings upon ſprings, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the complicated machines of government and trade, inſtead of directing our attention to the firſt principles of motion, and the few maſter ſprings on whoſe movements all the reſt depend in a regular order and ſubordination. By theſe means they endeavour to confound, when they cannot convince us. But theſe are diſhoneſt arts, the common tricks of deſigning men in every ſphere. They are too ſtale and hackneyed, however, to impoſe upon men of ſound and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated underſtandings.

All the ſubtleties and refinements, all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that the wit of men can invent, will never be ſufficient to juſtify and ſpecies of arbitrary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, while we retain a knowledge of this ſhort and ſimple propoſition—"the good of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is the end of civil government." nor will they ever juſtify a diſcretionary taxation by a prince or government, the people being unrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſo long as we know, that "a man hath no property in that which another can by right take from him without his conſent."</p>

One of the moſt ſpecious arguments made uſe of in ſupport of a ſovereign power in parliament over the Americans, is that drawn from a ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed neceſſity of equipping a powerful armament at a ſhort notice, for the protection of the <hi>whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> as theſe gentlemen will have it: hereupon we are aſked, if his Majeſty is to have impoſed upon him the arduous taſk of firſt obtaining a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority in two Houſes of Commons in Europe, and about thirty provincial aſſemblies in America, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can raiſe the neceſſary ſupplies? and the interrogators ſeem to plume themſelves much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the impoſſibility of carrying on the executive part of government under ſuch reſtraints. Let me in return aſk how we draw ſupplies from Ireland? Are they voted in the Britiſh Houſe of Commons? Then, in the firſt place, I anſwer that if an empire be too large, and its parts too widely ſeparated by immenſe oceans, or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, to admit of being governed on the principles eſſentially belonging to all free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is an overgrown empire, and ought to be divided before it fall to pieces. The welfare and happineſs of mankind ſupercede every other poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble claim or pretenſion to govern. When we find ourſelves ſubject to a diſtant power, which cannot poſſibly govern us on any other principles than thoſe of tyranny, we have an inherent right, by the law of nature, and it is an indiſpenſible duty to ourſelves and to our poſterity, to ſhake off ſuch an unjuſt yoke, and to erect a free government amongſt ourſelves. Thoſe degenerate Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014673_0043_0F948BD0B3FE0348"/>
who are now ſeeking to enſlave the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, would ill brook the government of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of Germany, if by any means he ſhould lawfully inherit the crown of theſe kingdoms, and make Vienna the ſeat of government. Would they ſuffer themſelves to be taxed by German miniſters or German diets? Would they not ſay to their ſovereign, <q>either come and reſide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, or delegate to your Vice-roy all the prerogatives of the crown, and leave us, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with him alone, to tax and to govern ourſelves according to our own juſt laws, and the rights of a free people?</q> Can any language be plainer? Can any doctrine be more intelligible or more equitable? But, in anſwer to the above interrogatory, I have another anſwer as intelligible as this.</p>
            <p>Eſtabliſh the mode of governing which theſe perſons contend for, and there will ſtill be the ſame inevitable delay, with regard to the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſupplies, as they would have us believe is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the mode which the people there claim a right to exerciſe. For though a Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might <hi>vote</hi> them with their uſual alacrity, yet we muſt ſend to America to <hi>collect</hi> them. And if our armament cannot go on without firſt ſending ſo far for this collection, its operations might as well be ſuſpended a few days or a few weeks longer, in order to obtain it on <hi>Britiſh,</hi> rather than on <hi>Pruſſian,</hi> principles. But the truth is, we ſhould not defer the equipment of any neceſſary arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one moment on this account (2). Do we
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:014673_0044_0F948BD170195AC0"/>
at preſent wait for the aſſembling of Parliament, and a vote of ſupplies, before we arm in any juſt cauſe in which the ſafety, the intereſt or honour of the ſtate is concerned? Doth not the executive branch of government, by virtue of its own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and in diſcharge of its duty, put the ſtate in a poſture of defence upon every alarm without loſs of time, and then apply to parliament for its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and ſupport? Is it ever with-held in a juſt cauſe? hath the government no reſources, no ways and means of its own, for diſcharging or contracting for the future diſcharge of, theſe prompt expences of the ſtate? If the uncertainty of meeting with like ſupport from America, as they find in Great-Britain, ſhould be a clog upon our miniſters in their warlike projects, might it not be fortunate for the people of both countries? Would it not make them extremely cautious and prudent how they involved us in continental poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and in German wars? No ingenuous man will, however, entertain a ſerious doubt of the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Americans to contribute their ſhare to every neceſſary expence of government, ſo long as they ſhall find themſelves in poſſeſſion of their freedom (3).</p>
            <p>They <hi>muſt</hi> contribute their ſhare; that is to ſay, they muſt preſerve their own exiſtence as a people, and defend their own property, under any form of government whatever. When men tell us, that an enlightened and free people are refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; that they will not contribute their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taxes; that at the hazard of their lives by
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:014673_0045_0F948BD255B41378"/>
the ſword or the halter, they oppoſe and ſeek to ſubvert the government, and this for a ſucceſſion of years; they tell us, with a moral certainly, though perhaps without meaning it, that they feel ſome real oppreſſions, ſome real invaſions made on their rights or liberties; for no other cauſes ever did, or ever will, produce a general and permanent oppoſition in the whole body of a people towards their governors. When we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark likewiſe, that, in the preſent conteſt, there is no religious zeal of perſecution; no national antipathy or rancour, but quite the reverſe; no introduction of a new code of laws by a foreign conqueror; no imaginary pretender to weaken the allegiance of the people towards their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; nor indeed any one cauſe of diſſatisfaction, but the avowed one; and that, on the part of the people, clearly juſtified on the obvious principles of the Engliſh conſtitution, can we heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pronounce what ought to be done? We ought to allow the Americans to tax themſelves as an inſeparable adjunct to freedom.</p>

               <p>(1) It is not my meaning, that the American colonies ſhould feel the effects of that narrow, and, may I not call it, barbarous policy, by which this country hath conducted herſelf towards her ſiſter Ireland. Beſides the liberty of raiſing her own taxes, and that ſhare of legiſlation which ſhe enjoys in her own parliament. I muſt confeſs, I ſee no reaſon why her trade ſhould not be as free as that of Great-Britain. Nature ſeems to have formed her for an union with the greater iſland. This once effected, on a liberal plan of equality in trade and freedom, any future jealouſy would be an inſtance of that folly which is expoſed in the fable of the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:014673_0046_0F948BD31EBBAD00"/>
belly and members. Humanity, wiſdom, and virtue dictate an union. Should Ireland then rival us in trade, (which <hi>I fear</hi> it would never be in a condition to do) I know of no conſequences but good ones. It might poſſibly tend to abate our luxury and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance, by a more equal diviſion of wealth, and of circulating money in the two kingdoms; at the ſame time, that it would excite an induſtrious emulation in commerce, to the mutual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of both countries; and, conſequently, augment the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of uſeful people, the riches and ſtrength of the united ſtate.</p>
               <p>(2) If the Britiſh parliament will not relinquiſh its arbitrary ſovereignty, let it not, however, double the injury by ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, needleſs even to its own unjuſt policy.</p>
               <p>(3) I make uſe of the word <hi>freedom</hi> in this place, although I am arguing on a ſuppoſition of the Britiſh parliament continuing to exerciſe a ſovereign power over the Americans, which I hold to be tyrannical in its principle; becauſe the Americans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are as yet not averſe to it, and univerſally breathe towards it none but ſentiments of reſpect and ſubmiſſion, ſo long as it ſhall not be exerciſed to tax or to oppreſs them. Perhaps I may be aſked, why do I, while the Americans are thus ſubmiſſively inclined towards parliamentary ſovereignty, officiouſly endeavour to withdraw their reſpect and obedience; therefore, as a general anſwer on this head, let me ſay once for all, that it is the dictate of my conſcience; the ſame as it would be to warn any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual againſt ignorantly or heedleſsly acquieſcing in any ſelfiſh, crafty, or unjuſt pretenſions of another perſon, which, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and unavoidable conſequences, muſt end in his own diſtreſs, and the ruin of his children, and all this without even benefiting his oppreſſor; but, on the contrary, rendering him criminal and unhappy, and preparing the way for his haſty downfal. If an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary regard to juſtice, and the duties of humanity, would have required this at our hands, in a caſe where only a few individuals were concerned, how much more is it the duty of a good citizen to ſound the alarm, when he ſees millions, and ſucceſſions of millions thro' future ages, in danger of ſinking into ſlavery, with all it's attendant curſes! and I moreover think it my duty, to ſeize this occaſion, of advancing my opinions againſt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and pretended right of ſovereignty in the Britiſh parliament over America, becauſe too many writers, through misjudgment, diſingenuouſneſs, or a baſe proſtitution to the luſt of tyrannic power, have taken advantage of this acquieſcence on the part of the coloniſts, and of this principle with regard to the ſovereignty being ſo generally acknowledged, as a good political axiom; to deduce from it a right in parliament even to <hi>tax</hi> the colonies. Thus, by preving <hi>too much,</hi> they raiſed a ſuſpicion, that their
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:014673_0047_0F948BD71D1C0E90"/>
firſt principles were unſound, and their leading propoſition a mere ſophiſm; and, upon examination, the reader, I flatter myſelf, finds them to be ſo. Leave our adverſaries but poſſeſſed of this intrenched ground of <hi>parliamentary ſovereignty,</hi> and the event of the conteſt, concerning the right of <hi>taxation</hi> will be doubtful; at leaſt, they will ſo long be enabled to make a ſhew of maintaining the diſpute; but when truth and fair argument have forced this feeble intrenchment, as I cannot but think they have now done, they will ſoon be driven out of the field; and the ſtandard of freedom, ſupported by the hand of juſtice, be fixed there for ever.</p>

            <p>SOME theoriſts make a propoſal to allow the Americans a repreſentation in the Britiſh Parliament, in order to juſtify our taxation of them; but from the ſmall number of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, which I have underſtood to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and their being reſtricted from voting as ſome would have them, in any but American queſtions, I ſhould fear that this propoſal proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a ſenſe of ſhame, as not appearing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve even the common forms of juſtice, rather than from a ſtrict and ſacred regard to juſtice it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or on a ſuppoſition, that this repreſentation ſhould be an adequate one, how would it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the American repreſentatives to ſerve their conſtituents in a proper manner. Could they, during every receſs of Parliament, viſit their reſpective counties, as the members can in Great-Britain? Could they, by a poſt letter, in a day or two, communicate to, or receive from, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014673_0048_0F948BD76FE857E0"/>
all neceſſary intelligence? or, could they meet and conſult with them on all emergencies at a ſhort notice? Muſt they reſide a thouſand or fifteen hundred leagues from their eſtates and compting-houſes, in order to ſerve their country in parliament? Surely ſo weak a ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt have been the viſionary ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a dream! But we may reſt aſſured, that while the Americans are themſelves awake, they will never conſent to it. Will they truſt their property, their freedom, their deareſt rights, their every thing, in the hands of exiles, ſent half way to the Antipodes, in order to ſit in council for their government! Sent to reſide in a luxurious, extravagant country, immerſed in diſſipation and corruption, and expoſed to every temptation to betray them! Believe me, they are not ſo ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In the imaginations of theſe viſionaries, the vaſt Atlantic is no more, I preſume, than a mere ferry.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have thought proper to indulge themſelves in the way of declamation, tell us of the mighty things done for the Americans by the mother country, and make a great cry of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and ingratitude.

               </gap>gable reaſons why the Americans are bound to obey the Britiſh parliament: on this foundation they build our right of ſovereignty. But who ever heard of a ſuit proſecuted in any Engliſh court of juſtice for ingratitude? Is a frugal ſon, out of his little competency, and to the prejudice of his own children, obliged,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014673_0049_0F948BD9582FC1D8"/>
by any law of England, or of nature, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the extravagancies of a proud, luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parent, and in what degree that parent ſhall direct? Do the obligations of friendſhip deprive the perſon obliged of his future freedom and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency? Doth not an attempt to enſlave, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, in a moment, every former obligation? Theſe declaimers ſhould keep in mind, that voluntary good offices are moral and religious, not civil or political, obligations. We may ſafely admit the whole catalogue of them in their full force, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thereby affording parliament the moſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy pretenſion to the rights of ſovereignty over the Americans: but, in juſtice to the character of that people, we muſt poſitively deny their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; for they have been amply repaid in a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table commerce to this country. Men muſt ſurely be loſt to a ſenſe of common decency, who would impoſe upon us as truth, that the part which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment hath ever taken, in ſettling and aſſiſting the American colonies, was ſolely or primarily to benefit the ſettlers; whereby they have been laid under this vaſt load of obligation to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, which nothing leſs than a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their liberty can cancel. Every honeſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced man, who will reaſon, and not wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, muſt acknowledge, that government's firſt object was, as indeed it always ought to be, to extend the commerce of this kingdom. This was the end: the countenance and aſſiſtance giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to American ſettlers, was only the means, and therefore could be no more than a ſecondary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014673_0050_0F948BDA5A2E06C0"/>
When the colonies were in danger of falling a prey to France, was it pure <hi>affection</hi> and <hi>generoſity</hi> towards <hi>them,</hi> or <hi>jealouſy of that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious power,</hi> which cauſed Great-Britain to take up arms <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Did not her own exiſtence depend on the preſervation of her American colonies? ſo that, though we do not mean to ſay affection, for her kindred had no ſhare in moving her to draw her ſword, yet, we preſume, it will be admitted, that <hi>her own</hi> ſafety, <hi>her own</hi> intereſt, <hi>her own</hi> honor, were the only motives that could have engaged her to proceed ſuch lengths, at that juncture; and this will the more evidently appear, when we conſider, that according to her notions of her right to the ſovereignty, ſhe ſaw the protection of her colonies, literally in the light of ſelf-defence, and the more heartily undertook it accordingly. Surely, it muſt be a very bad title to dominion, which is built upon an error of her judgment, and a political ſelfiſhneſs. Had the <hi>Hanoverians</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Pruſſians, Portugueſe,</hi> or <hi>Hungari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> Had even the very <hi>French,</hi> with whom ſhe fought, at that time ſtood in the place of her American colonies, ſhe would, on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, have been as laviſh of her blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their ſupport, as <hi>every one of them</hi> hath heretofore experienced; and yet our opponents in argument, would not have maintained, that ſervices of this kind, done to any ſuch ſtate, would have entitled this kingdom to the ſame right of ruling and of taxing it, as they contend for upon the ſame principle in the caſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014673_0051_0F948BDA8A0BEA28"/>
America, therefore, is not ungrateful; but is not rather Great-Britain unwiſe, ambitious, and tyrannical? The obligations, in fact, were mutual, and as equivalent as the nature of things would admit; ſo that it would be a very nice, perhaps an impoſſible, but certainly an uſeleſs ſpeculation, to decide which party hath been moſt benefited. The attempt is inſidious, and he who makes it, is no friend either to America or Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>Many definitions of government have been given us, and a multitude of arguments employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in order to ſhew the well known neceſſity of one central ſupreme power being ſomewhere lodged in every empire, which ſhall be all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of itſelf to perform the whole of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently taxation, as an eſſential part of it. But this will make nothing for the claims of parliament to the ſovereignty of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. On the reverſe, it only points out more ſtrongly the error which moſt people have fallen into in their notion of the Britiſh empire. They will have it, that the Britiſh empire comprehends within it all his Majeſty's dominions in America; whereas the American governments, except that of Newfoundland, are independent nations, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within themſelves the rights and the actual powers of legiſlation, which cannot be taken from them, and lodged in the hands of Britiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, without a manifeſt wrong, and the ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo many free governments. Here we ſhall be told, that our Kings, in granting them
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014673_0052_0F948BDB434FB7A0"/>
their original charters and privileges, only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed a prerogative which they derived from the conſtitution; wherefore the Americans are ſtill dependent upon, and owe allegiance, not to the King alone, but to the ſtate of Great-Britain. But ſtill I maintain, that the inherent rights of mankind, above all, their freedom, are not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on caſuiſtical niceties and logical diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which, by the way, muſt be falſe, when they would diſprove theſe rights) but are theirs inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of all the Kings, all the governments in the univerſe. Kings and conſtitutions of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are the creatures, not the creators, of theſe rights. They are held immediately of God himſelf, who gave them. Had the original charters to the American ſettlers been granted on the expreſs and ſole condition of acknowledging the ſovereignty of parliament, even all that would not have bettered our preſent title one jot; for freedom, notwithſtanding all that ſophiſtry may ſay to the contrary, cannot be alienated by any human creature; much leſs can he enſlave his poſterity; and, therefore, ſuch a contract could only be binding, ſo far and ſo long as freedom ſhould not be infringed by it; but, with regard to a virtue in it, of depriving a future people, many nations, of their freedom, it would be null and void in its own nature to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and 'tis a mockery to our common-ſenſe, to plead it as an authority to this end.</p>
            <p>It is a miſtaken notion, that planting of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and extending of empire, are neceſſarily
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014673_0053_0F948BDD9C6B5460"/>
one and the ſame thing. Even the <hi>intention</hi> of the planters will not make it ſo, where the rights of mankind, and the nature of things are not adapted to it; where growing colonies are ſo ſituated and ſo circumſtanced, that, in the nature of things, they cannot be governed by the parent ſtate on the principles of juſtice and freedom; it is ſurely paying little reſpect to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſhocks every feeling of a free mind, to aſſert, that they muſt nevertheleſs ſubmit to its oppreſſive rule, Having denied that America, when we drop the popular language, and ſpeak correctly, is a part of the Britiſh empire, it will naturally be expected I ſhould ſay what are, and where are its limits, The Britiſh empire, then, I hold to be confined to the Britiſh Iſles (I), and to the various <hi>ſettlements and factories of our trade</hi> in the different parts of the world, including <hi>the government of Newfoundland;</hi> together with the garriſons of <hi>Gibralter</hi> and <hi>Minorea.</hi> As to the Weſt india iſlands, they, as well as the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal colonies, certainly have a right to their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, whenever they ſhall think proper to demand it, as they contain within themſelves every neceſſary of legiſlation; but, if it be their choice, to acknowledge the ſovereignty of the Britiſh Parliament, as I apprehend it may, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, I believe, it will be their <hi>intereſt,</hi> I ſee no objection in that caſe to its being exerciſed. If it be true, as I believe all writers agree, that they would be depopulated, was it not for annual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of white men as well as blacks, this, and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:014673_0054_0F948BDE361DDDD8"/>
ſome other arguments, drawn from Weſt-Indian manners and ſentiments, ſeem to indicate, that it is not in their nature, nor perhaps in their wiſh, to ſupport an independency; nor ought we to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that their ſoil itſelf points out to them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, ſupplying only the means of effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, luxury, and intoxication, while for <hi>bread,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſaries of life,</hi> its inhabitants muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon other countries. It matters not how much, in the nature of trading ſettlements, our firſt colonies might have been, (though were not in fact) nor at what period they might be ſaid to become independent nations: it matters not that they were orginally planted and protected by the government of this country, (I admit this plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I make no reſervation of thoſe who fled from <hi>perſecution</hi> and <hi>want</hi>) nor what were the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of government in ſo doing; for, having in them (the people of thoſe colonies) the inherent and unalienable rights of freemen, they had therein the rights of independency, whenever they ſhould think proper to aſſert them. Doth a man, who furniſhes a young indigent relation with every neceſſary, who ſettles him in a trading accompting-houſe, who ſupplies him with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſupports him with every ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection whereby he proſpers in the world, and raiſes a fortune; doth the man, I ſay, to whom he owes all this, obtain thereby a right, a legal title, to take from him, without his conſent, a ſingle ſhilling of this fortune? men of ſlaviſh principles would have us believe, that the rights
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:014673_0055_0F948BDEF1CDB5C8"/>
of private perſons, of ſubjects, being mean and inſignificant conſiderations, are level with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of, and may be conprehended by the people; but that the ſublime and myſterious rights of empire are only to be judged of, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon, by thoſe who govern, and by thoſe to whom theſe myſteries are confidentially revealed, in order to be treated of with due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity and unintelligibility, not to enlighten the people, but to impreſs them with a proper reſpect for things ſo awful and ſacred. True enough it is, that what hath too frequently been written concerning them, hath not been level with the capacities of the people, nor with any other capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities; for no man can underſtand what hath no ſenſe or meaning, what is palpable nonſenſe.</p>

            <p>IT is demanded, with an air of confidence and imaginary triumph, <q>Were not the firſt ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in America Britiſh ſubjects? Did they not ſettle under the ſanction of grants and charters? Hath not the kingdom, at all times, put itſelf to great expences in their ſupport, and favoured them with many peculiar advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in trade? Was not the laſt moſt expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war undertaken ſolely on their account? Can any one be ſo abſurd, as to imagine the kingdom intended to nurſe and erect ſo many independent nations inſtead of enlarging her own dominion? Ought not the Americans to repay us part of the expences of the war in particular, in order to enable us to diſcharge ſome part of that enormous debt it occaſioned? and contribute their proportion towards the general expences of the whole empire?</q> To moſt of theſe queſtions, my arguments have already anſwered. Now, let me aſk, in my turn,—Have any of the nations of the earth, eſpecially the free one<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, become what they are, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>intentions,</hi> and by a regular plan for that purpoſe, of the governments of thoſe countries from which they are reſpectively deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended? When we ſpeak of the Greeks as an Egyptian colony, or of the Carthaginians as a colony of Phoenicians, do we the leſs conſider them as free nations? or imagine that the mother
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014673_0057_0F948BE06F8037A0"/>
countries had a right to govern or to tax them, becauſe the firſt ſettlers had once ſtood in the relation of ſubjects to thoſe ſtates? Let the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of government, in planting a colony, be what it may, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould take away an <hi>inherent unalienable</hi> right; ſuch, for inſtance, as freedom. But what Britain principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſhe hath certainly obtained—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of commerce. Again, let me aſk, hath not Providence uſually carried on its gracious deſigns of making great nations, and peopling new regions, contrary to the councils of the wiſe ones of this world? While we are plotting and contriving, toiling and ſweating, treating and waging war, in order to gratify our own ſelf-intereſt and pride, by extending our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and enlarging our empire beyond all bounds, Providence takes care to fruſtrate our fooliſh and wicked projects, and often brings about the reverſe of what we think to inſure by the depth of our policy, and the ſtrength of our arm. Let us take care that we do not provoke it to make us a ſcorn and a reproach to America, inſtead of its arrogant ruler. By adhering ſtrictly to the principles of juſtice, and the rights of mankind, we may firmly unite and cement toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our own intereſts with thoſe of our ſiſter nations in America, and remain ourſelves to the end of time, a powerful and independent ſtate: but let us dread, by a violation of theſe ſacred duties, to pull down upon our devoted heads the mighty ruins of an over-grown empire. Let it be the peculiar glory of this free, this enlightened.

this chriſtian kingdom, to extend the influence of her religion and laws, not the limits of her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire! Nor let her entertain one anxious thought concerning the hackneyed notion of the progreſs of empire weſtward. Who are theſe preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous unfolders of the decrees of fate, theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealers of the hidden councils of God, that doom Great-Britain to a ſpeedy fall, when empire ſhall have fixed it's ſeat in America? Are the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Divine Providence ſo uniform and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as to become the object of ſcience and proud philoſophy?—to be foretold by man, or calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated like the movement and appearance of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met? Our <hi>philoſophical prophets</hi> pretend to judge from ſimilar cauſes producing ſimilar effects: but they ought to know, that in <hi>all eſſentials,</hi> there is <hi>yet</hi> very little or no ſimilitude between the ſtate of Great-Britain and any antient empire what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and I am not without faith, that there will always be wiſdom and virtue enough in this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py iſland, to prevent its ever coming within that predicament. It behoves her, however, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to have a conſtant retroſpect to them and their fate. Let her maturely reflect on the infatiable avarice and ambition, the enormous, the gigantic wickedneſs of bloody Rome. Let her conſider alſo the Grecian, the Perſian, and Aſſyrian empires, and carefully mark the grand cauſes of their overthrow. They were all erected on the rotten foundations of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>tyranny,</hi> (the very ſeed-plots of hell) they all fell the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of their own mad ambition, and a luſt of rule, that nothing could ſatiate leſs than the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014673_0059_0F948BE6277ADF60"/>
of the whole earth. Where is the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude! Our religion, being a divine revelation, is confeſſedly perfect; and the law of nature, no leſs divine, being the immoveable baſis of our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fabric, the very ſoul of our conſtitution, this alſo is <hi>perfect.</hi> I ſay perfect, abſolutely perfect; for, whenever it hath the appearance of being otherwiſe, it is only from the want of a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, or a cloſe adherence to its true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. It is this immutable, this divine ſtandard, we have to refer to in all our deviations, that hath preſerved our conſtitution through all ages, and improved it till it is become the admiration and envy of all nations (1). This is a principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation and recovery from all corruption and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays; this is a principle of immortality! No other conſtitution ever had the ſame, or at leaſt never preſerved it until it was ſufficiently underſtood, and properly valued by the people. This has, under a moſt ſingular Providence, been our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar bleſſing. I truſt it will be the bleſſing of our poſterity to the lateſt generations; and that, when we ſhall have given birth, and the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights of freemen, to as many independent ſtates as can find habitations on the vaſt American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, that Britain ſtill will be great and free; the reſpected mother, the model, the glory of them all! and I will, I muſt indulge the fond hope, that the pure religion, and the perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Britain, will gradually ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over all America; and in every other part of the globe (2) ſo enlighten and operate upon the minds of men, as to become the chief inſtruments
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014673_0060_0F948BE76D86B960"/>
in the Hands of Almighty God of bringing about, in his due time, that univerſality of chriſtianity, that harmony and happineſs among the nations of the earth, which are intimated in the prophetic writings. Thoſe prophetic intimations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the peculiar fitneſs of the cauſes to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, together with a great variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that ſeem evidently tending towards this point, convince me, that it may be rationally hoped for; while all the arguments brought to ſhew the probability of America becoming the ſeat of a mighty conquering empire, to which Britain ſhall, in length of time, be a province, appear to my apprehenſion, to be deſtitute of any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſmalleſt degree of probability.</p>
            <p>We are told, that empire hath been obſerved to make its progreſs weſtward; that every empire hath had its infancy, its youth, its vigour, its declenſion, its death; and that they neceſſarily follow each other with the ſame certainty as in the frail life of man; and laſtly, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, that Great-Britain hath paſt her meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and empire is now riſing faſt in America. To the firſt, I anſwer, that empire muſt needs have travelled weſtward from its ſource, except Europe had remained a deſart; that it alſo travell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eaſt, South, and North, as well as Weſt, witneſs China, Indoſtan, Abyſſinia, Ruſſia; and that it hath already been in America, witneſs Peru and Mexico; and that it hath alſo taken retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade courſes, witneſs Turky and the Perſian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire under Nadir Shah; and with regard to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Europe, I can ſee no probability why it
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:014673_0061_0F948BE7F7162C40"/>
may not remain to the end of time, divided in proportions, not much differing from the preſent. To the ſecond argument, I have only to ſay, that analogical reaſoning is always very fallacious, and that there is no analogy between things <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>immortal.</hi> To the third, I muſt repeat, that Great-Britain, having in her conſtitution the principles of renovation and recovery, from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and decay, and the ſeeds of immortality (which no other ſtate ever had) is in no great danger of a declenſion, ſo long as this World is likely to laſt; and that the Britiſh North American ſtates having, all of them, chriſtianity void of perſecution, as a light from Heaven; Britiſh freedom as a ſoul, and a ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce as the breath of life; it muſt be thought next to an impoſſibility that any one of them ſhould ever ſwallow up all the reſt, and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend its conqueſts beyond the Atlantic and Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic Oceans. The times for "heroes and demi-gods" are paſt; and the phrenzy for univerſal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is ſomewhat out of date and out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. They prevailed, and only could prevail, when the minds of men were in a proper tone for ſuch extravagances; when <hi>the advantages of commerce, the true principles and ends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the religion of peace and pure virtue,</hi> were either wholly or very imperfectly known: beſides, no ſearcher into prophecy hath yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the womb of time, an empire that is to be ſo formidable to the liberties of the world; and, if it be true, that the ſpecies, as well as the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals of mankind, obtains knowledge, wiſdom,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014673_0062_0F948BE8C1290EE0"/>
and virtue progreſſively, its latter days will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of things, and by means of the divine aſſiſtance that hath been vouchſafed it, to all appearance, be more wiſe, peaceable, and pious, than the earlier periods of its exiſtence. To this end let every one labour; and his own happineſs at leaſt, if not the general happineſs of mankind, will moſt aſſuredly be his reward.</p>

            <p>WHEN we talk of aſſerting our ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the Americans, do we foreſee to what fatal lengths it will carry us? Are not thoſe nations encreaſing with aſtoniſhing rapidity? Muſt they not, in the nature of things, cover in a few ages that immenſe continent like a ſwarm of bees? Do we vainly imagine, that we can then hold the reins of government, and hurl our thunders on the heads of the diſobedient? Where are we to ſtop? or, ſhall we pretend to circumſcribe America populations? To ſay, 'thus far ſhall ye go, and no farther?' No! Swollen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed muſt we be with the pride of dominion, and drunk with the fumes, if we can fooliſhly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine theſe things (1). It is high time that we opened our eyes to the unintentional encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have been making upon the liberties of mankind, and to the neceſſity of ſetting bounds to our dominion. Without the American conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the Britiſh empire will be large enough in all reaſon. But if government perſiſt in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our ſovereignty there, it may poſſibly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion our own deſtruction, but can be produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of no good to us, either preſent, or future. After all that has been done to alarm the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans for their rights as free men, and calling up their attention to a thorough inveſtigation of them; after the flame of oppoſition hath been
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014673_0064_0F948BEA2ECD4708"/>
kindled in every breaſt, and now annimates them as one man, it will be in vain to ſteer any middle courſe; to adopt meaſures for <hi>light oppreſſions,</hi> and compelling obedience to laws <hi>moderately tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</hi> We muſt either relinquiſh at once our claim to ſovereignty, or fix on their neck with ſtrong hand the galling yoke of ſlavery. We muſt either conquer ourſelves or them. Juſtice, wiſdom, humanity, and religion leave us without a doubt which to prefer; and, ſhould the latter be determined on, woe be to Great-Britain! We may, indeed, by means of fleets and armies, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a precarious tyranny over the Americans for a while; but the moſt ſhallow politicians muſt foreſee what this would end in (2). It would expoſe us to the certain attacks of all our Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an rivals; and, when we found the neceſſity of courting the aſſiſtance of the Americans, we ſhould deſervedly find them the bittereſt of our enemies. With the nations of Europe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for commerce, for glory, and ſome imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry objects; with thoſe of America, the conteſt would be for the deareſt rights, the very dignity of humanity. After the ſtruggles of intereſt and proweſs, a tolerable reconciliation may take place, but eternal enmity and hate always ſucceed thoſe between a free people and their tyrants. From the ſpirit of freedom, which hath in all ages glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſoms of true Engliſhmen, and which hath brought to its preſent perfection our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtitution in defiance of every attempt to cruſh it; we ought to know, that until we can extinguiſh this ſpirit in the breaſts of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014673_0065_0F948BEDE9844BC0"/>
and eradicate from their very nature its firſt and nobleſt principles, ſelf-preſervation and free-will, that all our efforts to bow them down in ſubjection to our authority muſt finally be ineffectual, and will recoil ſooner or later perhaps with tenfold retribution upon ourſelves. There are ſome politicians who think, that preſent expediency is a ſufficient juſtification of any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and who, from the ideas of re-imburſing ourſelves for the charges of the laſt war, of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the preſent exigencies of the ſtate, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our power over the American commerce, make no ſcruple to bid us draw the accurſed ſword, and enſlave our children and our brethren. But, be it known to them, that though our very exiſtence as a nation, depended on violating the expreſs laws of God, it muſt not be done. And if their ignorance, which may be implied from the folly of their propoſal, hath not yet made the diſcovery, let them be told that policy, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional as well as individual, muſt have juſtice and the laws of God for its baſis, or, 'tis the policy of villains, the policy of ſots and fools. Can the legiſlature of Great-Britain, I once more aſk, govern the Americans on the true principles of freedom? For the reaſons I have already given, I believe it to be impoſſible (3). As to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſing us the ſums of money ſpent on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the laſt war, they will do it, if we act wiſely and juſtly, in the only way it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould, and in the only way we expected of them when we undertook the war; that is, by a commerce beneficial to this kingdom. And by
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014673_0066_0F948BEE1433E000"/>
leaving them to their own independency, the charges of government may be greatly retrenched.</p>
            <p>Thus far had I written, when the political tracts of a reverend Dean fell into my hands. They amply ſupply all the examples and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations neceſſary to illuſtrate my principles, and and ſhew to a demonſtration the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, in a political light, of relinquiſhing our claims to the ſovereignty of America; to which the whole tenour of my letters point, and with which they are to conclude. But I am far from ſubſcribing to this gentleman's doctrine as to the rights of ſovereignty. If I could acknowledge the truth of that, I ſhould very much doubt of the propriety of his propoſed ſeparation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica from Great-Britain; for giving up one's right, cannot be thought a good rule for promoting his intereſt. But in this caſe, as is very frequent, his common-ſenſe hath been obliged to ſubdue his learning before he arrived at truth. While metaphyſical refinements teach him to think, that Britain hath a right to govern America, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible force of truth extorts from him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment that ſhe muſt, if governed by true policy, relinquiſh it. 'Tis a pity ſo able a writer had not diſcovered that the Americans have a right to chooſe their own governors, and thence inforced the neceſſity of his propoſed ſeparation as a religious duty, no leſs than a meaſure of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal policy. In ſo doing, he would have been conſiſtent; there would then have been no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity nor would his ſentiments of right and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency have been at variance; but his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014673_0067_0F948BEF17800D60"/>
would naturally and evidently have flowed from his premiſes, ſupported by that trite, but true and moſt excellent maxim, that honeſty is the beſt policy. But, perhaps, ſome may be of opinion, that the propriety of a ſeparation is more ſtrongly enforced, by its appearing to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſult he could poſſibly arrive at through the medium of opinions that pointed the direct contrary way, The ſame opinions have, in all other writers, led them only to conſider, by what means the unity of the whole Britiſh empire (taking in America) might be beſt preſerved; how the ſupreme legiſlative power might be beſt ſupported, and enforce obedience to the utmoſt bounds of this vaſt dominion. Every project for this purpoſe (without a ſingle exception) being embarraſſed with a ſundamental incompatibility, a radical error in ſuppoſſing a right, where, in truth, there is none, hath been viſionary, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, ſanguinary, and totally impracticable; ſo difficult it is to ſtrive againſt the ſtream of nature and truth.</p>
            <p>The Dean, with more good ſenſe, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive inſight into the human heart and the ſprings of commerce, and with the temper of a philoſophic, unintereſted looker-on, hath nobly abandoned the full perſuaſion of his own mind on the point of right; and, while he thinks we are entitled to govern, foreſees and demonſtrates the fatal conſequences of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. He accordingly adviſes us to ſeparate in good humour, and truſts to our mutual intereſts for its producing, in fact, a real and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014673_0068_0F948BEF740B2A78"/>
ſincere union, and this, he ſays, is "the only means of living in peace and harmony with them."</p>
            <p>In the whole courſe of his work, wherever the diſpute of right is not immediately in view, his reaſonings flow ſpontaneouſly, and in ſpite of himſelf, from the feelings of right in his own heart. In page 12, he ſays, <q>For I am not for charging our colonies in particular with being ſinners above others, becauſe, I believe, (and if I am wrong, let the hiſtories of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, whether antient or modern, from the days of Thucydides down to the preſent time, confute me if it can; I ſay, 'till that is done, I believe) that it is the nature of them all to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after independence, and to ſet up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as ever they find that they are able to ſubſiſt without being beholding to the mother-country. And if our Americans have expreſſed themſelves ſooner on this head than others have done, or in a more direct and daring manner, this ought not to be imputed to any greater malignity, or ingratitude in them than in others, but to that bold, free conſtitution, which is the prerogative and boaſt of us all. We our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves derive our origin from thoſe very Saxons who inhabited the lower parts of Germany, &amp;c. </q>What can more fully prove the right of independence in colonies, too far removed to be governed on the principles of freedom by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, than this univerſal, this uniform, invariable feeling of all mankind, in all ages, than that <q>it is the nature of them all to aſpire
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014673_0069_0F948BF034F16FB0"/>
after it.</q> Shall we reject the unvarying teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of nature ſpeaking home to our hearts, and pin our faith upon the fine-ſpun, cobweb ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our learned caſuiſts and court-lawyers? or ſhall we, with more ſafety, rely upon the letter of an old muſty charter, penned before this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo much as thought of? Hath nature left herſelf ſo much without a witneſs to the truth in the human breaſt, that we muſt give ourſelves wholly up to the direction of ſuch blind guides as theſe? Fie! fie! If much learning hath not made us mad, it hath at leaſt in this, and many ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſes, made us ignorant. It is to be lamented, that ſuch a blaze of truth, as there is in the above obſervation, did not diſcover to the writer the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laciouſneſs of his original poſition of parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right to govern the colonies; when all the while, it is the expreſs, the ſole purport of this work to prove, that parliament in continuing to aſſert this right, cannot promote either the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Great-Britain or America.</p>

Provided Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had no people to ſpare, for ſending out colonies to occupy that deſolate country, I can ſee no right ſhe had to hinder the American ſtates from ſo doing, except by <hi>voluntary agreement between her and them,</hi> unleſs ſhe claim a power of counteracting God's firſt benediction to mankind.—<q>Be fruitful and multiply, and repleniſh the earth and ſubdue it.</q> But notwithſtanding it is the language of this act, that <q>immenſe tracts of the earth ſhall remain deſart and unpeopled, in order that the Britiſh parliament may maintain an uſurped ſovereignty over a multitude of populous nations, beyond one of the grand watery diviſions of the Globe;</q> yet in the end, it will prove to to have no more virtue in it, towards ſtemming the overflowings of the Colonies, than had the royal mandate of the wife Canutus, when in order to confound his evil counſellors, he magiſterially forbid the ſwelling tide of the ocean to approach his feet. A chain of feeble forts in a wilderneſs, or the pronouncing this wilderneſs to be part of the province of Quebec, will form a mighty barrier truly, againſt the ſwarms that will one day pour weſtward, from the too populous ſtates upon the ſea coaſt! I do not, however, deny, that even <hi>this</hi> mode of preventing anarchy, bloodſhed, and cruelty for the preſent, is not better than none; but I think this is not the <hi>right</hi> way. To have conſented, under our own guaranty, to a partition of this country amongſt the bordering colonies, according to their reſpective ſituations, and as far as the juſt claims of the Indians would admit, would have been at once an act of juſtice and wiſe policy; or, if the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe reſpective colonies would be impolitic, on account of the future balance of power of that continent, and the general arbitration of Great-Britain hereafter ſpoken of, then it might have been ſtipulated with them, that their ſeveral emigrants into this deſert country, ſhould be independent of them, and left to form a new ſtate or new ſtates, under laws to be given them for a free government on their firſt ſettlement, and ſuitable limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of country, for the ſake of preſerving the future equilibrium and general peace. There cannot be a worſe, or more narrow policy, than to give any check to American population; for, by thoſe means, Britain will loſe ſo many cuſtomers for her manufactures, and the colonies, by having their emigrations

No man of ſenſe ever doubted the <hi>preſent</hi> power of Great-Britain, to cruſh any one oppoſing colony, or, poſſibly, to trample on the united necks of them all; but this arrogance and injuſtice ſhe will aſſuredly repent. I wiſh it may not be in ſackcloth and aſhes—I wiſh it may not be very ſoon.</p>
               <p>(3) In framing the Quebec Act, it were much to have been deſired, that none of the other Colonies had been ſo much as thought of, it might then, perhaps, have breathed pure wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and benevolence; but, having interwoven in it that fatal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy. which is daily ſowing the ſeeds of diſcord between Great-Britain and America, I am inclined to think, it is juſtly cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a high degree; and that it is far leſs beneficial to the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians than it ought to be, although it may be very true, that they are at preſent incapable of receiving all the rights and privileges, and the full liberty of Britiſh ſubjects, yet that will be no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of us, for intailing on their poſterity ſo much ſervitude to an arbitrary power, as by this act is veſted in the governor and council; all at the appointment of the crown <hi>during pleaſure.</hi> To have had an aſſembly, wherein the people ſhould have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, they had an undoubted right; to deny it them is ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical, and a mere evaſion, to inſinuate the impracticability of ſuch a plan. Surely that power, which now totally deprives them of this eſſential to freedom, had been exerted more agreeable to the principles of juſtice and humanity; had it granted them but the rudeſt model of an aſſembly, containing within it the ſeeds of freedom, to have germinated and expanded with their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their advancement in arts and knowledge! Thoſe who aſſert the contrary, muſt be little acquainted with the origin and riſe of almoſt all the free ſtates that have flouriſhed in the world, and muſt conceive the Canadians to be more ſtupid and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the Hottentots or Samoiedes. As to any intention of our miniſters to promote in this act the intereſts of Popery, I think they may ſtand freely acquitted of them; and though I am of opinion, the religious part of it might be amended, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſmile at the terrors that have been expreſſed on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if his Holineſs was at the very door of St. Paul's. No; the error of the legiſlature hath been in not ſeeing, that the moſt perfect freedom in America, is not only compatible with, but is now become neceſſary to, the proſperity of Great-Britain; and its crime, if a crime hath been committed, in ſeeking to ſupport a tottering tyranny over the antient colonies, by erecting an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary government in Quebec. For the ſake of Britons on both

ſides of the Atlantic equally; for the ſake of the Canadians, and for the ſake of freedom's holy cauſe univerſally, I ſincerely hope a little reflection on an end ſo abominable, and the ſtill more abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means, will diſpoſe our legiſlators to retrieve, e're it be too late, ſuch an unconſtitutional and alarming ſtep. The act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which we have been ſpeaking, as well as two other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable ones, paſſed ſince the writer firſt began to publiſh theſe letters ſeparately in a news-paper, are thought by ſober and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting men, to be melancholy records of human paſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; affording us moſt ſtriking admonitions, that in national conduct, as well as in that of individuals, a miſtaken principle of action, if not forſaken, or one falſe ſtep, if unretrieved in time, may eaſily hurry us on to lengths of folly and wickedneſs, at which we ſhould once have ſhuddered with horror, but can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perſiſt in to our utter deſtruction, regardleſs of all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we at the ſame time bring upon others. Will rational and moral beings never learn, that without juſtice, 'tis impoſſible there ſhould ever be wiſdom in the councils of a nation? or can ſtateſmen believe it will obtain their acquittal at the laſt tribunal, to plead, that in their private capacity, "they did juſtice and remembered mercy," though in their public ſtations, they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated theſe ſacred regards; and through a falſe notion of ſerving and aggrandizing their country, they endeavoured to eſtabliſh ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and to intail on millions and millions, the deadlieſt curſe that can imbitter life? In what light muſt a truly good and wiſe man behold a law, which is at once a yoke of bondage to one colony, and a ſcourge to the reſt! Although greater miſeries, previouſly endured, together with an ignorance in the value of, and the requiſites to, freedom, may cauſe the poor Canadians, in their preſent circumſtances, to receive it with joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; will that juſtify towards them, ſo ungenerous, ſo mean a policy?</p>

            <p>SINCE, my laſt letter was ſent to the Printer, I have a ſecond time looked into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication therein referred to; and finding it likely to make a ſtrong impreſſion on its readers, as well as that there is the moſt ſtriking inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency between its foundation and ſuperſtructure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I perceive that I cannot well paſs it over without a regular though conciſe examination of its third and fourth tract. Theſe alone being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the point, I ſhall confine my obſervations to them, without taking notice of the reſt of the book.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the third tract, entitled, <q>A Letter from a Merchant in London to his Nephew in America,</q> I am ſorry to obſerve an appeal to <hi>the ſpirit of our conſtitution</hi> treated with ridicule, and an attempt made to ſubſtitute in place of this only genuine authority, <hi>the letter of the ſlatutes,</hi> or even of Magna Charta itſelf; for theſe may all be imperfect, though as I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a former letter the ſpirit of the conſtitution cannot. A proceeding of this kind in an anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous writer, or one of no credit, would, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, have given me an alarm of danger, and a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of ſome deep deſign againſt the cauſe of truth: it certainly is very far from being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the preſent work. May we not aſk what is meant by removing the appeal from <hi>the ſpirit of the conſtitution,</hi> to ſomething
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014673_0074_0F948BF594FBCBB0"/>
which is called "the conſtitution itſelf," (page 93 94) and what that ſomething is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not defined, nor can I underſtand what it is, unleſs it be a ſomething which hath its ſole exiſtence in the varying and unſteady letter of the ſtatute law, and therefore may be one thing to-day, and another to-morrow, as it was once tyranny and popery, and is at preſent freedom and true religion. If the author will be candid, he muſt acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that his diſtinction of "the conſtitution itſelf," from the ſpirit of the conſtitution, is unlogical, and a palpable contradiction. How can any thing be ſet in contradiſtinction to its eſſence? That <q>Magna Charta is the great foundation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh liberties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the baſis of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</q> I muſt poſitively deny. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a glorious member of the ſuperſtructure, but of itſelf would never have exiſted, had not the conſtitution already had a baſis, and a firm one too. And as to this charter being the "foundation of Engliſh liberty," that was evidently otherwiſe; ſince it was an exertion of this very liberty that produced the charter; extorting it from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching King, as a meer formal declaration of rights, already known to be the conſtitutional in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of every Engliſhman. Beſides I have elſewhere obſerved, that the original and only real foundations of liberty were, by the Almighty architect, laid together with the foundations of the world, when this right was ingrafted into the nature of man at his creation; and therefore it cannot be held, after the manner of an external property or poſſeſſion, by charters and titles of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014673_0075_0F948BF79EA18998"/>
human fabrick. We ought to be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a goſpel purity in our civil as in our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtitution; for they are both founded on the word of God. If the religious be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and clear, the civil is more ancient, and no leſs divine, though only revealed to us by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and fainter impreſs on the mind and heart of man. If the Dean will not admit the decrees of Popes and councils as of equal authority with the word of God, he will not ſurely maintain, that a Magna Charta ought to come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſpirit of a conſtitution, whoſe baſis is <hi>internal juſtice and inherent liberty;</hi> a Magna Charta, notoriouſly known to have been extorted by the ſword, and formed and ratified in the heat of a hoſtile contention. Nor will he, it is to be hoped, plead "the public ſtatutes of the realm," (p. 4.) when they militate againſt the ſpirit, or goſpel purity of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt remark, that his quotations of them, in order to prove the ſovereignty of parliament, have not the weight of fair evidence in the trial now before the tribunal of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic; ſince they ſtand in the place, and in the nature of parties concerned. It is theſe very "public ſtatutes of the realm," arrogating a right to govern and to tax the Americans which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in queſtion; therefore their teſtimony goes for nothing, If the cauſe be given in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, then it will be time enough for them to operate; but if it goes againſt them, they muſt all be condemned as uſurpations. We are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing what is juſt and right, and <hi>ought to be</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:014673_0076_0F948BF7B9E98408"/>
practiſed, not what <hi>has been</hi> practiſed by thoſe who had the power in their hands; not what they have been pleaſed, in their declarations to <hi>call</hi> juſt and and right. Although Parliament ſhould enact, that reaſon and truth ſhould no longer be reaſon and truth, yet plain and honeſt people would be apt to call them reaſon and truth ſtill, and to rely upon them with the ſame aſſurance they do at preſent. Hence it is, and ever will be, a truth as evident and as uncontrovertible as any law of nature can be, that "an American," not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ingenuity of this author, and all that has been, or can be ſaid to the contrary, has a right to inſiſt, <q>that according to the ſpirit of the conſtitution, he ought not to be taxed without his own conſent, given either by himſelf or by a repreſentative in parliament;</q> I will not add "choſen by himſelf;" becauſe that, with regard to each individual, were we diſpoſed to cavil, would lead us into uſeleſs and puerile diſputations, (p. 93.) Every man of ſenſe admits of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of virtual repreſentation, ſo far as it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the ends and purpoſes of a real one, <hi>but no farther.</hi> I am ſincerely ſorry to obſerve a writer, ſo much entitled to reſpect as the Dean of Gloceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, employ his talents in an endeavour to miſlead us into an opinion, that the Americans are virtually repreſented in the Britiſh parliament. It were a ſuitable and an innocent exerciſe of parts in a young diſputant at college; but will it bear to be gravely debated upon by a political writer! Well might a noble Lord exclaim, <q>for as to the diſtinction of a virtual repreſentation, it is ſo
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:014673_0077_0F948BF887148FA0"/>
abſurd, as not to deſerve an anſwer; I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs it over with contempt.</q> And if au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities are to have their weight, that, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume of this noble Lord, who preſided with ſo much dignity and luſtre, in the nobleſt court of equity in the world, will be allowed to preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt the Dean's, at leaſt in the judgment of every one who reads the tracts before us. If our author had duly weighed the a guments he has quoted from Judge Foſter, in his 4th tract, (p. 27.) he would have found, that they made nothing for ſuch a virtual repreſentation <hi>as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for.</hi> The Judge, it is plain, was not ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational as to think of the welfare of <hi>two ſeparats nations</hi> (for ſo we may ſurely eſteem Britain and America, think as we will of <hi>empire</hi>) inhabiting, with reſpect one to the other, <q>the ends of the earth,</q> as being a fit object of conſultation to a ſingle national aſſembly; and that the deputies of one of theſe nations could be eſteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the other. As to the imagination of Great Britain and America being <hi>one empire,</hi> theſe are only words that ſerve to blind, to amuſe, and to confound inconſiderate reaſoners.</p>
            <p>How often muſt it be repeated, that pride, ambition, and luſt of dominion, are not, <hi>on any pretence whatſoever,</hi> to be gratified at the expence of nations; and that the <hi>ſole end</hi> of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to promote the good of the people? If an empire become too wide and unwieldy for this purpoſe, I do aſſert, that by the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, <hi>it is no empire,</hi> that is to ſay, not a <hi>juſt</hi> empire. It therefore muſt
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:014673_0078_0F948BF9312281A8"/>
be divided, unleſs we admit that tyranny can be rightfully eſtabliſhed, which God forbid! In our own caſe, I only want it to be done in form, as it is already done in fact, in which the Dean agrees with me; <q>for ſays he, (p. 12) an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted fact it is, that from the moment in which Canada came into the poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, an end was put to the ſovereignty of the mother-country over her colonies (1).</q> I muſt now take notice of one argument, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of virtual repreſentation, that our author ſeems to value himſelf upon, as of ſufficient force to decide the general diſpute with the Americans, and, at the ſame time, the much litigated queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Middleſex election.—We find it in a note, (p. 29) <q>Surely the nation might have expelled Mr. Wilkes, or have ſtruck his name out of the liſt of committee, had it been aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and had it thought proper ſo to do. What then ſhould hinder the deputies of the nation from doing the ſame thing? and which ought to prevail in this caſe, the nation in general, or the county of Middleſex?</q> Now, this argument is evidently fallacious; for the Houſe of Commons doth <hi>not</hi> anſwer to the <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined committee</hi> of Judge Foſtter, to which it is here compared; for that was a ſimple <hi>democratical</hi> council. Our national committee conſiſts of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> as well as Commons? and therefore, according to the Dean's premiſes, that "the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have expelled Mr. Wilkes," it is the neceſſary concluſion, that nothing leſs than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional committee, namely, our compleat legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:014673_0079_0F948BFA425749F8"/>
of King, Lords, and Commons, had a right to ſtrike his name out of the liſt. I entirely agree with this writer, that the member choſen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by certain individuals, is the repreſentative of the whole nation; ſo that what is generally called a virtual, is, in fact, a real repreſentation; but, at the ſame time, I muſt ſay it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be very conſiſtent with <hi>the ſpirit of our conſtitution,</hi> (if that expreſſion will not give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) that a Dunwich or an Old Sarum, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a dozen cottagers, ſhould have the chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of as many of theſe national repreſentatives as a Norwich or a Briſtol; nor that a Weymouth ſhould return as great a number as the metropolis, whoſe citizens, according to our author, (p. 99) form <q>a body as reſpectable as the greateſt of our colonies with regard to <hi>property,</hi> and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to many of them with reſpect to <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this an abuſe that calls aloud for reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Can any thing be more notorious, than that a great majority of the national repreſentatives are elected by a ſmall number of indigent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt men, who profeſſedly make a trade of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and who gratify, in the very act, a ſordid ſelf-intereſt, in direct violation of the rights and intereſts of the nation collectively. Theſe electors being <hi>primarily</hi> the repreſentatives of the nation, may be called the <hi>elective repreſentatives;</hi> and are anſwerable to the nation for the exerciſe of that great truſt. If they pervert it from the end for which it was given them, and transfer it to bad men for their own ſelfiſh purpoſes, it is fit
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:014673_0080_0F948BFC8B63F078"/>
               <hi>they ſhould be deprived of it,</hi> in order to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a more juſt and ſafe mode of electing the <hi>legiſlative repreſentatives</hi> of the nation. But to return; I am of opinion, the Dean might as well have ſpared his reproaches of "folly and abſurdity" upon the poſitions of the Americans, concerning their want of an adequate repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (p. 98) and have omitted his compariſon of the ſtate of the city of London, although it <q>hath long enjoyed, before the colonies were ever thought of, the three-fold power of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, legiſlation, and taxation <hi>in certain caſes;</hi> for, if no man in his ſenſes ever yet ſuppoſed, that the city of London either was or could be exempted, by her charters, from parliamentary juriſdiction, or parliamentary taxes;</q> it is full as evident that no man in his ſenſes can ſee any juſt ſimilitude, with reſpect to parliamentary juriſdiction and taxation between <hi>a metropolis,</hi> the very central point of a nation, and <hi>an entire kindred nation,</hi> which hath ariſen in the new world, at the diſtance of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles from the parent ſtate, and beyond the vaſt Atlantic Ocean. <hi>It is conſiſtent with the ſecurity of the liberty and property of the citizens of London,</hi> to be ſubject to parliamentary juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and taxation! but this ſubjection <hi>would not be conſiſtent</hi> with the ſecurity of the American nations. May not a man in his ſenſes believe, that a kindred nation, or a colony, if you pleaſe, may be capable of managing its own concerns; and that it is full as likely to do it faithfully as the legiſlators of its mother country? May not a
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:014673_0081_0F948BFCF2565E28"/>
man in his ſenſes believe, that ſuch a ſtate hath <hi>a right</hi> to appoint the guardians of its own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and properties, and to defend them againſt all invaders, even the legiſlators of its mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without involving himſelf in either "folly or abſurdity?" Would the independency of any colony or kindred nation in America, neceſſarily create any ſuch confuſion, any ſuch inconſiſtency in the government of Great-Britain, as would follow from the independency of, and a ſeparate ſupreme legiſlation in, the capital city?</p>

            <p>WHEN our reverend author is not in a jeering humour, he will acknowledge that it is, in reality, <q>unreaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and cruel,</q> to tax an unrepreſented people (for I deny that America is repreſented at Weſtminſter) againſt their own conſent. (P. 100.) But <q>ſtrange, exclaims the Dean, that you did not diſcover theſe bad things before! Strange, that tho' the Britiſh parliament has been, from the beginning, thus <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> thus <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>cruel</hi> towards you, by levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxes on many commodities, outwards
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:014673_0082_0F948BFF09E0AFC0"/>
and inwards; nay, by laying an internal tax, the poſt-tax, for example, on the whole Britiſh empire in America; and, what is ſtill worſe, by making laws to affect your property, your paper currency, and even to take away life it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if you offended againſt them: ſtrange and unaccountable, I ſay, that after you had ſuffered this ſo long, you ſhould not have been able to have diſcovered that you were without repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives in the Britiſh parliament, <hi>of your own electing,</hi> till this enlightening tax upon paper opened your eyes! And what a pity is it, that you have been ſlaves for ſo many generations, and yet did not know that you were ſlaves until now.</q> Now, ſtrange and unaccountable as this may appear to the Dean, it has been by means of the very ſame kind preciſely that our eyes have been ſucceſſively opened to ſee the juſt rights of the people, the due limits of authority in their rulers, in every particular in which they are now legally aſcertained. A rude and infant nation of huſbandmen, having no preſſing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is not very logical or critically learned in the law, and all its remote conſequences.

their governors keeping ſtrictly within the pale of juſt and legal authority. Even ſelf-evident truths are not diſcerned, until the attention of mankind is called upon by neceſſity, or ſome other powerful cauſe, to examine the ſubject in which they exiſt. The divine right of Kings, and their abſolute power too, might have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the creeds of all nations to this day, had not too liberal an exerciſe of theſe powers taught them to reaſon by making them <hi>feel.</hi> No man in any country, ever thought of ſcrupulouſly defining the proper powers of taxation, while he poſſeſſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth taxing; nor of limiting the exerciſe of ſuch powers, ſo long as the contributions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired were trifling to him, the occaſions of raiſing them apparent to all men, and the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them known to, and approved by, every individual. It is, when a ſtate begins to riſe into ſome degree of political conſequence, and the operations of its government are become too ſecret and complex to be penetrated by the vulgar eye, and at the ſame time grow expenſive to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they, not knowing what is going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſuſpicious of ſome ill towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, begin to inveſtigate the legal powers of taxing, and how far they ought to be exerciſed; nor ſhall we exceed the truth, if we add, that all their jealouſy and vigilance have been little enough, in the happieſt age and nation, for guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the king-craft and tyranny of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. While too inſignificant to become the objects, or the tools of ambition, they remain in ignorance; it is the alarm of chains, and the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:014673_0084_0F948C0147C9A318"/>
diſlike of burthens, that <q>enlighten them and open their eyes.</q> After what has been ſaid, I ſhould hope it was quite unneceſſary to refute the feeble arguments we find in p. 101, 102, 103, drawn from the freedom which an American now is permitted to enjoy, of voting for a member of the Britiſh parliament. We muſt remember, however, that he cannot do this without being a <hi>Britiſh</hi> freeholder, or holding ſome property which makes him at leaſt a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubject; and it is therefore <hi>as a Briton,</hi> not <hi>as an American,</hi> he is repreſented. But to trace this rope of ſand any farther, would really be to mock my readers, and I have already ſufficiently replied to all ſuch ſorry ſubtleties. If the true and proper relation, in which this country ſtands with regard to the colonies, hath not, in all particulars, been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately defined by mutual agreement and declaratory laws; but there are to be found ſome little incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtencies, as there needs muſt be in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection ſo long as Great-Britain, through a love of rule, finds means to evade a fair diſcuſſion of <hi>the queſtion of right;</hi> which, I pray, is the courſe that a wiſe and good man ought to purſue, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reconcile all contradictions, and to obtain a juſt idea of what is fit to be done for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying theſe inconveniences? Ought not the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the whole people, without any partiality for countries, to out-weigh, in his mind, every other conſideration? Muſt it not be his polar ſtar, whenever he ventures upon the dark and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſea of caſuiſtry? Will he, for a moment, believe in the truth of any poſition or maxim,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:014673_0085_0F948C025426F368"/>
how antient, how ſpecious ſoever, that is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently incompatible with this object? Surely he will not loſe ſight of the true, the only ends of government, and labour to harden the heart and ſtrengthen the hands of tyranny! Nor will he, ſurely, diſregard the plain and obvious dictates of reaſon and nature, and, in defence of a bad cauſe, ſtoop and ſtrain to catch at every little flaw and defect in forms and precedents! But one falſe ſtep in reaſoning, frequently miſleads a good man into opinions and diſputations prejudicial to truth. However, when the good of the public ſhall ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately appear to be the end he aims at, we muſt make charitable allowances for his miſtakes. Such allowances I am diſpoſed to make to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the tract; but yet as a well-wiſher, and in perfect good humour, I muſt needs ſay he has indulged too freely a ſpirit, I will not ſay a talent, of ridicule; he is too ſupercilious even to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and is apt to ſneer ſomewhat out of ſeaſon, and when a ſatirical opponent might very eaſily retort it upon him with double force. Neither doth he appear to me quite ſo cool, diſpaſſionate and impartial, as becomes a man who takes upon him to elucidate a diſputed queſtion on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the welfare, perhaps the exiſtence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He muſt have been a poor caſuiſt, indeed, not to have obtained a victory over an antagoniſt of his own making: but we need not quarrel with him for beating him, ſince he ſhewed him ſo much mercy and good manners. But doth it not rather ſavour of diſingenuouſneſs, to put the maimed and mutilated arguments of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:014673_0086_0F948C045F1C8DC8"/>
into the mouth of a wrongheaded ignorant boy? Had it not been more to the advantage of his knowledge and eloquence, to have impreſſed conviction upon the mind of an experienced and able man, one who was well acquainted with the hiſtory, the laws, and the conſtitution of both Great-Britain and the colonies? But in that caſe, decency would have confined him to argument, inſtead of ſneer and ridicule, and to a carriage ſuited to an equal, inſtead of that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious ſuperiority aſſumed over the booby ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew; and this would have deprived his letter of its principal force and ſpirit. <q>But let that paſs,</q> and let us proceed to what is more to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Our author proves, very ſatisfactorily, that the cauſe of contention between us and the colonies, is no recent affair—not the factious contrivance of a Lord Chatham, or a Lord Cambden, as the hiſtorians of the day would have it, but exiſted in no ſmall force ſo early in the laſt century as 1670, (p, 5,) and in 1696, (p. 6,) gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to a very remarkable act, for the very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe chiefly of aſſerting the ſovereignty of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Acts of Parliament do not take place on ſuch occaſions until the miſchief to be remedied is already at ſome degree of ripeneſs; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it appears, that the colonies had for a conſiderable time previous to 1696, ſhewn a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to doubt, to diſpute, and in ſome ſort to oppoſe the authority of the Engliſh Parliament. Their eyes began to be open, and nature made them feel their inherent rights as men, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:014673_0087_0F948C04B997C640"/>
they could define them. On the other hand, falſe definitions of law and right, have as long ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the feelings of equity in the minds of thoſe poſſeſſed of the power. Let us make true definitions, and conſult our true feelings, and we ſhall then no longer doubt of the right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence in the Americans; I ſay true feelings, becauſe, without we are circumſpect, we are continually acquiring falſe ones, as well as falſe opinions; and the latter has a wonderful power in generating the former. Witneſs the daily and perpetual ſeverities we ſee practiſed towards chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the injury both of body and mind, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious parents, who yet want neither humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor tenderneſs, and who act upon principle. A falſe ſyſtem begetting falſe feelings, while they are injuring and puniſhing their children, they think they are ſerving them and conſulting their true happineſs; and they conſequently feel ſelf-approbation for a conduct that ought to inſpire horror and ſelf-reproof. Now, with regard to our American children and kindred, let us diveſt ourſelves of every intereſt, of every paſſion, of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudice; let us pluck from our hearts that deep-rooted love of rule, and for a moment put ourſelves in their places; and then, deliberately and ſolemnly laying our hand upon our heart, remembering that we are chriſtians, and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the awful tribunal of the Deity for our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts; let us aſk ourſelves theſe plain queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: is not the end of government to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans the ſame as to all other people, that is to ſay, the welfare and happineſs of the ſociety?
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:014673_0088_0F948C05333D4F40"/>
Can there be welfare and happineſs without free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Can freedom exiſt under a taxation, at the diſcretion of the legiſlature of another, and that a diſtant, a luxurious, a neceſſitous country? Is it agreeable to common-ſenſe to imagine, that an American repreſentation in the Britiſh-Parliament could anſwer the true ends of repreſentation to the people of that country? or, is it poſſible, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to any plan which human wiſdom hath yet conceived, that the Parliament of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhould govern the many and multiplying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of America on the true principles of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or without a certainty of ſinking herſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of empire? And is it fit that, on the authority of a few logical diſtinctions, (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting they were juſt, which, by the way, they are not) and for the ſake of proudly maintaining an abſolute, a deceaſed claim to an empty ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, (for ſo it is confeſſed to be, by its advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Dean) that we ſhould forget all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, all the ties of conſanguinity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, all the feelngs of humanity, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine leſſons of our holy religion, and enforce the obedience of the Americans to an odious tyranny by fire and ſword?</p>
            <p>It is matter of the greateſt aſtoniſhment to me, that a writer, ſo learned and ſo clear ſighted as the Dean, ſhould have ſo far over-looked all arguments of this nature, as to have left himſelf without a juſt, a moral reaſon, as well as a political one, for his propoſed ſeparation. As to the matter of fact, concerning the poſſibility of keeping the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty in our hands he and I are well agreed,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:014673_0089_0F948C05F807B830"/>
as I have already ſhewn in my quotation from p. 12; nay, we both agree, that we have it not to keep, that it is already gone, never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered but by conqueſt, never more to be held but with greater armies, and at a greater expence than ever this country ſupported in any war. I have alſo, in a former letter, q<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ed, what he ſays in the ſame page, (12) in order to ſhew, that it hath ever been the nature of all colonies, in all ages, to aſpire after independence, and made my reflections thereupon, ſo that we may now haſten to the conſideration of his five propoſals, and to the concluſion of the taſk we have aſſigned our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. If I have treſpaſſed upon the reader, by a repetition of the ſame arguments in different pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I would obſerve, that the ſew plain and clear arguments, on which this queſtion depends, need to be repeated again and again, and never to be loſt ſight of; for the enemies of liberty, like the diſingenuous foes of religion, are a ſort of people, who, conſcious that they cannot convince, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to wrangle, do not ſcruple to advance the ſame ſtale arguments that have been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and a thouſand times refuted before, and if not refuted again, as often as they have the ſhameleſſneſs to revive them, they inſult their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries with affected ſhouts of victory and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
            <p>But my manner of treating the ſubject may, nevertheleſs, need many apologies. I ſhall, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, only plead, that theſe letters have been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as leiſure would permit, and ſent away to the Printer, without reſerved copies to refer to: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:014673_0090_0F948C06B01DDF00"/>
which it may be proper to add, that at the time I am writing this eighth, no more than the two firſt have made their appearance in the paper. As for the preſumption of entering on a ſubject, without abilities equal to the attempt, I ſhall only offer, in my defence, that I have been prompted to it through a warm, a paſſionate love of liberty, and a ſincere deſire of promoting its cauſe.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be my ſucceſs, I ſhall never want the pleaſing reflection of having done my duty conſcientiouſly, as a member of ſociety, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a ſubordinate degree to greater work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: and, I hope, it is not uncharitable to think, that if every writer would reſign his pen to the ſame guidance, we ſhould all be agreed very ſoon, as nearly as would be requiſite, and that mankind would then reap ſuch benefits from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical diſquiſitions, as I fear are not likely to take place, while controverly is carried upon other principles.</p>

            <p>WE come now to the conſideration of our author's final ſettlements, and in p. 14, we find him thus expreſſing himſelf:—<q>Enough ſurely has been ſaid on this ſubject, and the upſhot of the whole matter is plainly this:—that even the arbitrary and deſpotic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of France and Spain (arbitrary, I ſay, both in temporals and ſpirituals) maintain
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:014673_0091_0F948C078FDDD808"/>
their authority over their American colonies but very imperfectly, in as-much as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtrain them from breaking through thoſe rules and regulations of excluſive trade, for the ſake of which all colonies ſeemed to have been originally founded. What then ſhall we ſay in regard to ſuch colonies as are the offſpring of a free conſtitution? And after what manner, and according to what rule, are our own in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be governed, without uſing any force or compulſion, or purſuing any meaſure repugnant to their own ideas of civil or religious liberty? In ſhort, and to ſum up all in one word, how ſhall we be able to render theſe colonies more ſubſervient to the intereſts, and more obedient to the laws and goverment of the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than they voluntarily chuſe to be? After having pondered and revolved the affair over and over, I confeſs there ſeems to me to be but the five following propoſals which can poſſibly be made, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Firſt, To ſuffer things to go on for a while as they have lately done, in hopes that ſome favourable opportunity may offer for recovering the juriſdiction of the Britiſh legiſlature over her colonies, and for maintaining the authority of the mother country; or, if theſe temporizing meaſures ſhould be found to ſtrengthen and confirm the evil inſtead of removing it, then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To attempt to perſuade the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to ſend over a certain number of deputies, or repreſentatives, to ſit and vote in the Britiſh parliament, in order to incorporate America
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:014673_0092_0F948C09435E7510"/>
and Great Britain into one common empire; or, if this propoſal ſhould be found imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, whether on account of the difficulties attending it on this ſide the Atlantic, or becauſe that the Americans themſelves would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in ſuch a meaſure; then,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to declare open war againſt them as rebels and revolters; and after having made a perfect conqueſt of the country, then to govern it by military force and deſpotic ſway; or if this ſcheme ſhould be judged (as it ought to be) the moſt deſtructive, and they leaſt eligible of any; then,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To propoſe to conſent that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhall become the general ſeat of empire, and that Great-Britain and Ireland ſhould be governed by viceroys ſent over from the court-reſidencies either at Philadelphia or New-York, or at ſome other American imperial city; or, if this plan of accommodation ſhould be ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted by home-born Engliſhmen, who, I will venture to affirm, would never ſubmit to ſuch an indignity; then,</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to propoſe to ſeparate entirely from the colonies, by declaring them to be a free and independent people, over whom we lay no claim, and then by offering to guarentee this freedom and independence againſt all foreign invaders whomſoever.</p>
               <p>Now, theſe being all the plans which, in the nature of things, ſeem capable of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, let us examine each of them in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            </q>
            <p>

I ſhall not need myſelf to accompany the Dean throughout this examination, in order to point out the fatal policy of attempting, and total im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of executing, any one of the four firſt of theſe ſchemes, ſince he has done it ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually himſelf as to need no aſſiſtance. But though I agree with him in the reſult, that they are all both impolitic and impracticable, yet I differ widely from him in ſeveral arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the diſcuſſion, and no leſs in the fundamental principles he frequently argues from. When he talks of the mother country governing 'in the manner ſhe ought to do;' (p. 18) and according to the original terms of the conſtitution, I preſume we are to underſtand the conſtitution to be ſome one individual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between the mother country and her race of colonies, ſome certain deed ſigned and ſealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and her in due form. Is this the ſame conſtitution he told us of in p. 94, of which Magna Charta was the baſis? But if terms or conditions be the marks of our conſtitution, it may indeed be a colony charter, a marriage act, a ſtamp act, or, in ſhort, any act of Parliament, or of the crown either, ſo that it will be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of very little conſequence, whether it have Magna Charta for its baſis, or any baſis at all, beſides that of the ſtatute in being. Since he lays ſo much ſtreſs on thoſe original terms, by which the colonies are bound to ſuffer their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable mother to govern as he thinks <q>ſhe ought to do,</q> let us warn him not to rely too much upon analogical reaſoning, ſince it is apt
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:014673_0094_0F948C0E8CEAA018"/>
to prove too much. If he means that Great-Britain ought to be obeyed by her colonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is their mother, becauſe ſhe produced them, and gave them their law, and that her contracts with them, when in their infancy ought to bind them forever, he would do well to remember, that no civil contract, between a parent and an infant child, affecting the future property of that child, can poſſibly have any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, becauſe of the child's being, at the time, in the power of the parent; becauſe it dares not object to it, it cannot reject any terms ſhe may pleaſe to dictate. I need not tell our author, that in the eye of the law, and agreeable to the ſpirit of the conſtitution, ſuch a contract is eſteemed no better than a fraud, or an act of the groſſeſt tyranny.</p>
            <p>Before I take my final leave of the four firſt of our author's propoſals, I muſt make two obſervations upon what appears on the face of them. In the firſt place, let me requeſt the reader to mark attentively the obvious ſentiment, the unambiguous language of the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. When the Dean is off his guard, and when the miſtaken principles he adopted, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſovereignty of parliament over America, are for a moment out of ſight, ſee how naturally, how unavoidably he allows all I contend for!—Here he admits, by direct and unavoidable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, that parliament hath not the rights of ſovereignty over America; he admits, that Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica is not a part of the Britiſh empire, or he could not poſſibly propoſe <q>to atempt to perſuade
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:014673_0095_0F948C0EF3B64030"/>
the colonies to ſend repreſentatives to ſit in the Britiſh parliament, in order to incorporate America and Great Britain into one common empire.</q> In the next place, I want to know, when, under the idea of an union, he has propoſed to conſent, that the ſeat of empire be transferred from Great Britain to America, why <q>every home-born Engliſhman</q> ſhould conſider it as <q>ſuch an indignity,</q>—The anſwer is plain, becauſe he would become a ſlave; and while America ſhall be governed at Weſtminiſter, the Americans will be ſlaves. If our dignity conſiſt in governing other nations againſt their wills, it is a dignity we ought to be aſhamed of; but if it be the genuine offspring, and the aſſociate of our liberty and independence, in God's name let our American kindred enjoy it as well as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>We now come to the conſideration of the Dean's fifth and laſt propoſal of an amicable and friendly ſeparation, concerning which he very juſtly demands p. 50, <q>and, in fact, what is all this but natural, and even the neceſſary corollary to be deduced from each of the former reaſons and obſervations?</q> For, if we neither can govern the Americans, nor be governed by them; if we can neither unite with them, nor ought to ſubdue them, what remains, but <q>to part with them on as friendly terms as we can?</q> This propoſal, and the invincible arguments in its ſupport, make ample amends for all the errors in the foregoing parts of his work. He ſhews himſelf to be maſter of this
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:014673_0096_0F948C0FB340C5F8"/>
part of his ſubject; and it cannot be too much recommended to thoſe whom I addreſs in theſe letters, and to the people in general, to make themſelves well acquainted with what he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. His much ſuperior knowledge of our American commerce, places the good policy of a ſeparation from America in a much ſtronger point of light than it was in my power to have done: but I flatter myſelf, I have ſufficiently proved, that we could not have kept that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in ſubjection without being tyrants. When juſtice and policy both point the ſame way, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but determined wickedneſs, or a wilful blindneſs can occaſion us to take a wrong courſe. With the favour of the reader, I muſt here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat one of the firſt obſervations I made on the Dean's work, as it ſtrikes me afreſh with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled force every time I conſider it, and and that is, that the propoſed declaration of the independence of America, is a concluſion in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to his original premiſes. In his abſtract reaſonings on government, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of colonies to the parent ſtate, he falls—the common fate of genius on flippery abſtract ground, into an error in fundamentals, laying it down as a principle, that 'parliament hath the rights of ſovereignty over America;' and conſequently, that 'America is actually a part of the Britiſh empire.'</p>
            <p>Theſe are the principles he ſets out upon; but behold the reſult of all his ſubtle, all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured reaſonings!—At the end of a ſecond work upon the ſubject, and after exhauſting the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:014673_0097_0F948C10D20ACE10"/>
chaotic treaſuries of ſophiſtry for arguments in ſupport of theſe principles, he concludes with a propoſal to the legiſlature, to declare that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament doth not claim theſe rights. Nay, but a minute before, and, as I have obſerved when off his guard, he acknowledges that parliament hath not theſe rights, and even propoſes 'to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to perſuade the colonies to agree to an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.' There is ſomething too irreconcileable in the idea as before remarked, of giving up one's rights, in order to promote one's intereſt; but falſe principles will ever produce fallacious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings. How can we poſſibly ſay more for an amicable ſeparation from America, than that the abſolute neceſſity of it took, as it were by ſtorm, a mind naturally ſtrong and vigorous, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with all the powers of art againſt the attack! The Dean, in journeying to the great, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial city of truth, whoſe eternal foundations occupy a rock that overlooks the country around, unfortunately ſets off in a miſt of prejudice.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he takes a direct contrary courſe; ſometimes intervals of a clearer light keep him ſteady in the right road; but then again, as the denſity of the miſt either totally obſtructs his view, or diſcovers truth in faint glimmerings, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deviates into bye paths and hollow ways, to the danger of being loſt, even when near his journey's end. At laſt, however the ſun of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction burſts forth in meridian blaze, the miſt is gone, and he arrives at the eternal city. But after having thus propoſed a ſeparation, <q>as the the only means of living in peace and harmony

with the colonies:</q> and, after having given reaſons for it, in oppoſition to which, I muſt needs think no man can remain an infidel, who is not at the ſame time an ideot; our author is, in my opinion, far more faithleſs, far more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, than at this time there ſeems cauſe to be with regard to the execution of his plan. His plan I call it, ſince he is for aught I know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the firſt who hath taken the pains to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it publicly, and to explain its advantages, although it has been for ſome time paſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiment amongſt diſcerning and liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded men, and to propoſe it was the firſt motive to the writing, and the main drift of theſe letters. It has been more particularly a common ſentiment (for indeed invention itſelf cannot hit on any other plauſible expedient) ever ſince the late noble and indignant conduct (1) of the Americans in defence of their almoſt-undermined liberty, as this affords a ſufficient demonſtration to all intelligent minds, in which the love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and juſtice retained their influence, that the time is come, that they are determined to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of Great-Britain, whether it be with her conſent or not.</p>
            <p>'I frankly acknowledge,' ſays our author, p. 63, <q>I propoſe no <hi>preſent</hi> convenience or ad-advantage to either adminiſtration or anti-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; nay, I firmly believe, that no miniſter, as things are now circumſtanced, will dare to do ſo much good to his country:</q> whereas I, on my part, firmly believe, that Lord North is the miniſter who dares to do this great
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:014673_0099_0F948C12009327E0"/>
good to his country. He took the helm in a ſtorm, when no other miniſter was to be found who could guide it; and he has given us through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his adminiſtration, very ample proofs of his intrepidity? Are we not, at this moment under a general conſternation at what may be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his intrepidity? Shall he dare in a ſingle act that has no precedent, to ſhock this whole nation? Shall he dare to hurl a raſh and miſguided vengeance on the town of Boſton, and bid a bold defiance to all America, and yet want courage to adopt a meaſure of the greateſt wiſdom and goodneſs; a meaſure which, to execute, he may eſteem the glory of his life? The idea is too contradictory for a character ſo conſiſtent as his.</p>
            <p>There are conjunctures in the affairs of king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms when none but an intrepid ſtateſman can ſtem a head-long torrent of popular zeal, or avert a gathering ſtorm which threatens his authority. If the urgent neceſſity of the caſe ſhall not admit of temperate meaſures, but ſhall demand a daring act of temporary violence, ſuch a ſtateſman, if he be wiſe and virtuous alſo, will avail himſelf of the ſhort-lived calm that ſucceeds the conflict, and before the diſcontents of the people can break forth afreſh with redoubled and irreſiſtable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity, he will effectually remove them, by removing their cauſes, and by giving them a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt future alarms. I hope that the late bill (2) will prove only a temporary violence, and that theſe moments, which are generally thought to be a ſullen calm, foreboding ſome
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:014673_0100_0F948C14132EC058"/>
dreadful political convulſion, may be pregnant with more ſalutary meaſures and plans of peace (3) The remembrance of it will, in a moment, be done away, when Great-Britain ſhall once have done juſtice to the Americans, by an open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their independence, and by offering them her friendſhip. Our mutual jealouſies will be buried in oblivion, and, as the Dean foretels, the Americans will then conſider us as their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, mediators, benefactors.</p>

They have all been paſſed before the minds of the miniſters have had time to cool.</p>
               <p>(3) I would not have the reader imagine, I mean to juſtify every tarring and feathering rioter at Boſton, and all diſorderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in America indiſcriminately. Some of the people, I doubt not, may have been to blame; for the commonalty of that country muſt have had a portion of wiſdom and patience, which hath not at any time before been found in the world, had all their expreſſions of reſentment for ill uſage, been confined within the bounds of moderation. When governors become tyrants, ſhall we wonder, that an injured and inſulted people become riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unruly! Have ambitious and encroaching rulers ever yet thought of rendering <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> of making <hi>reparation,</hi> for the cruelleſt injuries they have ſo conſtantly committed; and have they not always thought themſelves wonderfully gracious and condeſcending, when they have merely <hi>ceaſed to oppreſs?</hi> but if a free people, finding their humble petitions, and moſt dutiful remonſtrances ſcattered to the winds with contempt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtung with a ſenſe of accumulated wrongs, and feeling an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at being treated like ſlaves and villains, do but aſſault the meaneſt miſcreant in the train of power; 'tis rebellion! felony! treaſon! Goals and gibbets, ball and bayonet, muſt here be the correctives. Is this human polity! Are theſe the proceedings of men, of fellow creatures, of fellow chriſtians?
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:014673_0101_0F948C149B188218"/>
When merely <hi>ceaſing to oppreſs,</hi> is all the reparation required for a long train of injuries and inſults; ſhall authority, with whom wiſdom ought ever to reſide, become deaf to that voice which called her into being, and think it meritorious to perſiſt in doing wrong?</p>
               <p>So univerſally have I heard the Boſtonians condemned for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the <hi>tea,</hi> and the action pronounced illegal and rebellious, that I have taken ſome pains to examine all the particulars of that affair. Now, to my agreeable diſappointment, and to the beſt of my judgment, inſtead of an act of rebellion, I find it one reflecting honour, and ſtamping the character of good ſubjects, on thoſe who performed it; inſtead of being illegal it appears to me to be warranted by the law of nature, the great original of all human laws, when juſt. Thoſe who would wiſh to think juſtly, and to ſpeak honeſtly of this matter, will do well to examine for themſelves. When they ſhall have ſo done, with care and candour, and admitting on my part, for the ſake of taking no advantage in the argument, the Boſtonian character to be as black as malignantly repreſented, I ſhould be glad to propoſe to them this plain queſtion: <q>What was poſſible for the moſt wiſe and virtuous perſons on earth, in the place of the Boſtonians, to have done, in order to have performed their duty to the utmoſt towards God and their Country?</q>—To have ſhewn a paſſive obedience to an unjuſt act of parliament, in a caſe of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of ſo critical a nature, would have been treaſon to their country, and therefore not acceptable, I imagine, to God. I have introduced in various converſations, with ſenſible men, the ſame queſtion I here propoſe, but never yet, I can aver with the ſtricteſt veracity, have I met with a ſolution of it, which did not confirm me in an opinion, that as wiſe and virtuous men, as good citizens, and true patriots, <hi>they could not poſſibly have acted otherwiſe than as they did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had only this one alternative; they were driven to this dilemma by their magiſtrates, <hi>either to ſuffer an inſidious attempt againſt their ſacred rights and liberties to take effect, or to deſtroy the hated inſtrument.</hi> Having had <hi>no other choice,</hi> they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have either <hi>done</hi> this, or <hi>ſuffered</hi> that. Which ought to be have been choſen by every brave and honeſt man, I leave the reader to determine. 'Tis viſionary, even to childiſhneſs, to ſay, they might have permitted the tea to have been landed, and yet have defeated the tax, by unanimouſly refuſing to have purchaſed it. The conductors of that noble action muſt have been patriots indeed, and moſt wonderfully wiſe, to have left their country, by going this way to work, at the diſcretion and mercy of the moſt ignorant and vicious of its inhabitants, to have relied upon the prudence and ſelf-denial of every tea-drinker in America! Beſides
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:014673_0102_0F948C14F458B608"/>
that the wiſdom of each well-meaning individual was not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on for foreſeeing all the ill conſequences of purchaſing a pound of tea, nor their reſolution in preventing them; I fear there might have been ſome traitors to the public cauſe, ſome tools of government or the India Company, or ſome ſuſpected perſons at leaſt, in whom to have confided, for not ſetting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and uſing all their cunning to ſeduce others, would not have argued any extraordinary degree of prudence.</p>
               <p>What teacher of morals or politics, ever was lunatic enough to build all his hopes of ſerving his country, on an expectation of bringing <hi>every individual</hi> of it to be of one mind, and as unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to act up to the ſame rigid principle of virtue? and which of us would care to riſk the ſafety of the city of London from ſome dreadful calamity, on a confidence that every female, from the fine lady to the waſherwoman, every man, from the miniſter of ſtate down to the blackguard, might be prevailed upon totally to abſtain from the uſe of tea, porter, or gin, <hi>except the temptation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of their way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all my readers, except thoſe unhappy ones, who have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fatal art of occaſionally cloſing the mental eye, ſo as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit juſt ſo much, and no more of the light of truth as their paſſions and prejudices will bear; I muſt needs think, it would be reflecting upon their underſtandings and their ingenuouſneſs, to attempt any farther proof of my propoſition, that the Boſtonians did what was ſtrictly conſonant to right and juſtice in deſtroying the tea; but, in order to open the ſelf-cloſed, winking eyes of the prejudiced, I will propoſe one more compariſon, which, I apprehend, will be admitted as a fair one, ſince it is agreed on all hands, except by the calm advancers of direct falſehoods and lies, and the bold denyers of demonſtration, that with regard to taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the coloniſts, as legitimate ſhoots from a parent ſtock of freedom, have at leaſt an equal right to be their own tax-maſters as the people of Ireland, which was a conquered, and every one knows, a very rebellious kingdom for many ages.</p>
               <p>Let then the reader only ſubſtitute Ireland and Dublin, for Maſſachuſett's-Bay and Boſton, and try the cauſe over again in his own mind. If he pleaſes, we will ſuppoſe, that inſtead of a duty on tea, we ſhould attempt to touch the pockets of the Iriſh, by a duty on certain ſtamped papers, being publications of groſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities and blaſphemies, tending to debauch the minds of the people, and fit them for ſlavery; and that an aſſocation of honeſt citizens of Dublin, more mindful of their duty to God and their country, than of obedience to an ordinance they held to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of their liberties, ſhould find this precious cargo, preciſely in a ſimilar ſituation with the tea at Boſton; that the Lord Mayor, the magiſtrates, and revenue myrmidons, like the Boſton governor
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:014673_0103_0F948C15B3F70250"/>
and officers of Cuſtoms, ſhould all abſolutely refuſe their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and clearances for its departure from the port, and the ſhip ſhould be well impriſoned by ſurrounding batteries; then, what is to be done? what courſe is to be purſued? Shall thoſe, who ought to be the guides and guardians of the city, admit theſe pernicious compoſitions within their walls; patiently behold them diſplayed in the ſhops, hawked about the ſtreets, and diſperſed throughout the country, with every art of invitation to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to purchaſe?</p>
               <p>Is the city to be deluged with theſe impieties, and it's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, morals, and liberties undermined, rather than <hi>an united company of merchants trading in miſchief</hi> ſhould loſe their property? a property not only detrimental in itſelf, but in this caſe made a venture, with the direct intention of betraying a brave and generous nation into obedience to a deſpotic ordinance, containing in it the ſeeds of a more complete tyranny, and uſed as the moſt tempting bait to lure the ſilly multitude into the political mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap; and therefore, on the principles of ſelf-preſervation, and agreeable to the ſpirit of the law of nature and nations, ſubject to be deſtroyed, <hi>if not removed upon fair warning.</hi> Are the city guardians, I ſay, to obſerve all this, and content themſelves all the while with a patriotic reſolve, not to buy or to read a ſingle paper, and with preaching to the unliſtening people to follow their example? If this, in the enlightened and virtuous city of Dublin, would be an experiment, that even a driveller would hardly dream of making; how much leſs ſafe would it have been for the American patriots to have hazarded their all, on the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal good ſenſe, on the piety and public ſpirit of the people, in the <hi>ſtupid,</hi> the <hi>hypocritical,</hi> the <hi>impious,</hi> the <hi>ungrateful,</hi> and <hi>rebellious</hi> town of Boſton!</p>
               <p>What then, I once more aſk, ought the patriots of Dublin or of Boſton to have done? What! but with indignation to have caſt the hated inſtrument of tyranny into the ſea! whither its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors deſerved alſo to have followed it headlong. Is it for this wiſe, brave, and generous action, that not only the actors of it, but the whole people of Boſton, are now ſmarting under the heavieſt vengeance of Great-Britain! of a people who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto juſtly prided themſelves in being the undaunted reſiſters of tyrants! Fie, boaſters, fie! Britannia bluſhes for your degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſhe diſowns ye for her ſons. When a pawnbroker knowingly puts arms into the hands of a highwayman or ruffian, does any law inſure to him payment for the ſame, at the hands of any one who being aſſaulted, ſeized and deſtroyed them? Are not all deadly weapons, all ſnares, traps, and poiſons, made uſe of in violation to the laws of civil ſociety, for injuring any man in life, limb, or property, a <hi>lawful ſpoil</hi> to the injured party? When the miſcreant,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:014673_0104_0F948C1672CEE988"/>
pick-pocket Jew, in the ſervice of iniquity, was once driving a trade amongſt the Weſtminſter ſchool-boys, with a parcel of TEA, out of the <hi>green canniſter</hi> of the celebrated Mrs. <hi>Phillips,</hi> who, that had a ſpark of virtuous indignation, but applauded the <hi>illegal proceedings</hi> of the ſpirited maſter, when, diſregarding the <hi>laws of property,</hi> he threw into the fire all of this <hi>tea</hi> he could lay his hands on; and, as little confidering the penalties for an aſſault, horſed the vile factor, and ſcourged him to the quick?</p>
               <p>I muſt therefore repeat, that the deſtroyers of the tea at Boſton were, in my opinion, a band of virtuous patriots, whoſe names, when once made public, will doubtleſs be held in eternal venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by their countrymen; and that the glorious <hi>illegality</hi> (if every ſtatute, <hi>whether juſt or unjuſt,</hi> be properly comprehended in the word law) they atchieved, was an act of abſolute moral and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and therefore exempt from even good laws; of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular wiſdom, of ſtrict juſtice, and remarkable temper and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, conſidering their provocations ſince it was done in <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> with the greateſt good order and decency, and unaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with incivility to any one, or the ſmalleſt damage to any thing in the ſhips beſides the treacherous tea. I muſt likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, that this tea, for the reaſons I have given, and agreeable to the ſpirit of the law of nature and nations, was juſtly forfeited to the injured Americans; and that the Eaſt-India Company are not entitled to any ſatisfaction or payment for the ſame.</p>

            <p>NOTHING now remains to be ſpoken of but the act of parliament neceſſary to that ſeparation, propoſed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend author of the tracts, and ſeconded in theſe letters; and that General treaty between Great-Britain and the ſtates of America, which will be the neceſſary, and doubtleſs the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it. When Parliament ſhall have du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed this great, this important matter,—the greateſt by far that ever came before any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional council whatever!—with the attention it merits, and in the temper recommended in my firſt letter, we may hope to ſee a <hi>nemine contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente</hi> act, whoſe preamble ſhall run in ſome ſuch form as the following <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas, at the time of the original planting and ſettling of colonies on the continent of North-America by the people and the crown of theſe kingdoms; and afterwards, during the infancy of the ſaid colonies, the future ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of their ſubmiſſion to, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence under the authority of parliament were not, by reaſon of their then infant and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtate, and the general inexperience in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that kind, either foreſeen or duly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; and whereas, through the growing of theſe once ſmall and helpleſs colonies to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their becoming populous, opulent and reſpectable ſtates, having each within itſelf the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:014673_0106_0F948C190B3D9FE0"/>
natural rights and proper powers of legiſlation, the exerciſe of parliamentary authority hath been found to claſh in the moſt eſſential points with their reſpective internal legiſlatures, and hath tended for a conſiderable time paſt, but more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of late years, to create diſſatisfactions between the ſaid internal legiſlatures and parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and between the people of the ſaid colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and the people of theſe kingdoms; and whereas theſe matters having been taken into conſideration, and it appearing upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of natural juſtice, and agreeable to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed maxims of civil government, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the welfare of the people of the ſaid colonies or ſtates, and prejudicial to their natural inherent rights as men, to be governed by the parliament of Great-Britain, or any other power foreign to themſelves reſpectively: be it therefore enacted, &amp;c.</q> In the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their names, none of them (fifteen, I think, lying between the Gulph of St. Lawrence and the mouth of the Miſſiſſippi) will, I hope, be omitted, but thoſe obtained partly by war and treaty inſerted as well as the reſt; and that in the clauſe, it ſhall be fully expreſſed, that <q>they are all held and declared to be free and independent ſtates, each to be ſubject to ſuch law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment only as now ſubſiſts, or ſhall hereafter be enacted and conſtituted within itſelf by its own proper legiſlature; and that of each and every of the ſaid independent ſtates, his Majeſty is, and ſhall be held to be the ſovereign head, in like manner as he is of the legiſlature of Great-Britain.</q>
               <pb n="109" facs="unknown:014673_0107_0F948C1D0526E0D0"/>
In another clauſe, I could wiſh it might likewiſe be expreſſed, that <q>the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Britain doth farther declare itſelf to be the guardian and protector of the whole, and of every of the ſaid ſtates or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, collectively and individually, againſt every foreign power whatſoever, as well as the guarantee of the independence of the ſaid ſeveral colonies or ſtates, one of another reſpectively and reciprocally, as well alſo of the rights and independencies of the ſeveral tribes or nations of Indians in amity with, or under the protection of the crown of theſe kingdoms, until theſe points ſhall be more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted by treaty.</q> Another clauſe would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly provide, that <q>commiſſioners on the part of the parliament of Great-Britain, ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to enter into treaty with deputies of the legiſlatures of each of the ſaid colonies or ſtates, in order that a firm, brotherly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual league may be concluded between Great-Britain and them for their mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial benefit, and their joint ſecurity againſt all other kingdoms and ſtates, as well as for the preſervation of that warm affection and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which ought ever to ſubſiſt between a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country and her offspring, or kindred ſtates, equally acknowledging one perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and one perfect religion, as their rule of life in temporals and in ſpirituals.</q> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners will be nominated of courſe. Other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and proviſions may be contained in this act, as parliament ſhall ſee good; but we ſhould
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:014673_0108_0F948C1E4A0D5188"/>
hope, as an indiſpenſible requiſite towards the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the general liberties, that it be enacted, that <q>no part of the revenue of any one of the ſaid American ſtates ſhall, by his Majeſty, his viceroy, or miniſters, be removed out of, or received into, any other of the ſaid ſtates, or into Great-Britain for his Majeſty's uſe; and that in like manner, no part of the revenue of theſe kingdoms, ſhall be remitted to America on that account; but that the revenue of Great-Britain, and of each reſpective ſtate in America, ſhall be wholly and ſolely applied to defray the expences of government, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the regal dignity in that country in which it ſhall be raiſed, and no other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Although, by thoſe unhappy perſons, who have no juſt ideas of right and wrong, and who have not intellects for perceiving, that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power of Great-Britain over her colonies, is on the point of expiring beyond all help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, parliament may be ſuppoſed to be a loſer by the propoſed ſeparation; yet all muſt confeſs that his Majeſty will be a gainer, inaſmuch as he will thereby receive fifteen independent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in exchange for as many dependent, and <hi>hardly dependent</hi> provinces, and become the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three millions of free and happy ſubjects, inſtead of reigning joint tyrant over ſo many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſlaves, or loſing by revolt ſo many of his people. What a divine glow of ſatisfaction muſt expand the royal boſom on an event ſo full of bliſs, ſo conſonant to humanity and to virtue!—an event more full of real luſtre—more aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:014673_0109_0F948C1EC699ED18"/>
by many degrees than ever before was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced by any earthly monarch—How poor, how contemptible, how hateful the triumphs of butchering conquerors compared to this ſolid glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! May ſuch a tranſcendant glory, be the glory of George the third.</p>
            <p>We muſt not be ſurprized if ſhallow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men, ſome with real, ſome with affected ignorance, ſhould cry out, <q>What! enter into treaty with fifteen independent ſtates, and expect them unanimouſly to join with you in one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral league for mutual advantage and ſecurity!</q> How chimerical and viſionary the project! (1) And I do not doubt, but that the ſwarm of hireling and proſtitute ſcribblers, whoſe food is confuſion, and whoſe very exiſtence, like the vermin in an ulcer, is ſupported by the diſeaſes of the ſtate, will pour forth all their malignity, in order to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and to damn if poſſible, a plan ſo wiſe and ſalutary. But their baneful influence will not, I truſt, extend itſelf farther than to diſturb, for a ſhort time, the confuſed minds of our coffee-houſe politicians.</p>
            <p>It will ſtill be obvious to all ſenſible men, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to thoſe who compoſe the national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, that when Great-Britain ſhall have done the nobleſt act of juſtice towards the Americans, that the annals of mankind can produce, they will, as one man, fly to her for protection, court her friendſhip, ſubmit themſelves to her advice, and be ready to put into her hands a chart blanche; and ſo long as ſhe continues to act upon the ſame principles, ſhe may undoubtedly influence each

ſeparate ſtate, and dictate the terms of general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation without any fear of even <hi>future</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactions. To deny theſe concluſions, would be to deny that effects follow their cauſes.</p>
            <p>The author of the tracts has already proved, that it is not our power, but the ſuperior advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our trade, which ſecures to us the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the Americans, or that can ſecure it to us. We ſhall ſtill have the ſame power to awe America into a faithful obſervance of her treaties, that we now have, to enforce a diſputed and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſovereignty, and with this manifeſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that treating with each ſtate ſeparately, we ſhall only have one at a time to contend with; whereas we have experienced by our ſtamp and tea projects, that while we pretend to govern the whole, the whole will unite to reſiſt us.</p>
            <p>That bond of union once diſſolved, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and neceſſary jealouſy of each other taking place, Great-Britain, as the common umpire, will become in effect the general ſovereign, ſo long as ſhe interpoſes her good offices for maintaining the common independence; and this her own intereſt will always dictate. Great Britain, will of courſe take care, in the firſt place, to recover all her debts in America, which, inſtead of bad debts, as they are now too juſtly eſteemed to be, will, in the tranſports of their gratitude for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and guaranteed independence, be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally paid, though with their laſt ſhilling. Not to mention that fear of offending, (for Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will then become truly formidable to each ſeparate ſtate) would effectually produce this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:014673_0111_0F948C2097A9EC20"/>
we ſhall, by the league ſecure on the moſt laſting foundation, every advantage of trade with America we now enjoy, and by the ſeparation relieve ourſelves from many heavy expences it now coſts us; for a proof of which, I again refer to the Dean's work: we may then diſband ſo much of our expenſive and unconſtitutional ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army, as we now keep up on account of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and inſtead of being execrated, as we now are, for that fleet which blocks up their ports, and is commiſſioned to humble Boſton to the duſt, and through her ſides, to gall every province on the continent, they will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to its preſence for ſeeing to the exact ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of their treaties, and they will then look upon it with a friendly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an affectionate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful eye, while they conſider it as their ſure protector againſt invaſion, their refuge in diſtreſs, and the avenger of their wrongs.—Not being able to pay Great-Britain in ſubſidies of ready money for her protection and friendſhip, they will grant her an equivalent in <hi>excluſive trade;</hi> and they will enter into ſome general ſtipulation for the mode and the meaſure of payment for any ſuch extraordinary aſſiſtance of ſhips as they may at any time ſolicit, or we, penetrating the deſigns of our common enemies, may ſend to their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>As for troops, a country containing millions of inhabitants, never can want any: let them rely upon the natural, the beſt reſource—a national militia; but, for heaven's ſake! never more let
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:014673_0112_0F948C211325B3F0"/>
the face of a Britiſh ſoldier be ſeen in North-America.</p>
            <p>A Flanders or a Germany, on the other ſide of the globe would be a grave wide enough to ſwallow the whole ſtrength and treaſure of this kingdom. The Americans are in no condition to ſet themſelves up as a maritime power, or to ſupport a navy fit to guard their own coaſts, but muſt rely upon Great-Britain for their ſafety by ſea, as indeed it will ever be their intereſt ſo to do, knowing by experience, that with regard to them, <hi>ſhe is not a conquering,</hi> but a commercial ſtate; and having reaſon to conclude, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of their maritime ſtates would probably terminate, like that of Greece, in wars upon one another, and be perverted to anſwer the ends of ambition to ſome one, inſtead of protection to all. After what has been ſaid, I need not point out (but for the ſake of my timid and uninformed reader) that it will be totally unneceſſary, and unbecoming the dignity of parliament, to heſitate a moment in paſſing the act of declaration, for fear the Americans ſhould not afterwards conſent to the league. 'Tis abſurd to imagine they will act in contradiction to the principles of <hi>ſelf intereſt and ſelf-preſervation,</hi> merely becauſe they ſhall be free from controul; nor is it more poſſible to conceive, how they ſhould object to a treaty with Great-Britain, merely becauſe ſhe had juſt done them an act of magnanimity and generoſity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled in hiſtory, and given them an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable proof, that ſhe was intitled to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence, particularly in its not being
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:014673_0113_0F948C220B4CF5A8"/>
poſſible ſhe ſhould have <hi>any deſign upon their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</hi> Beſides Great-Britain, until ſhe have reſigned her aſſumed ſovereignty as the mother country, cannot, on the principles of equity, as before illuſtrated, give any validity to a contract with her children, while held in ſubjection to her authority. No! the generous ſpirit that ſhall ſet them free, will diſdain the meanneſs of a proceeding ſo little and ſo diſtruſtful; and that wiſdom which could form ſo comprehenſive a plan, will deſpiſe the crookedneſs and folly of ſuch a narrow policy.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given a faint ſketch of the many and great benefits of an American league—the reader's imagination and judgment will finiſh the picture. If then he can think, that they do not infinitely preponderate againſt the advantages to be hoped for from perſiſting to aſſert our odious ſovereignty, and plundering the colonies by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary tax-gathers, I have only to ſay, that he and I can ſcarcely be made of the ſame common materials of humanity; but I ſhall begin to liſten to thoſe profound ſages, whoſe acute penetration, aſſiſted by a certain microſcopic ſpecies of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, hath diſcovered, that the Moſaic revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a fable, and that, inſtead of one, there are indeed many different races of men. On the one hand, the moſt we can expect is a forced and reluctant ſubmiſſion, with ſome advantages in trade; but theſe even for a very, <hi>very ſhort period.</hi> Mean while, diſcontent and deteſtation, brooding in the boſoms of the coloniſts, will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally generate a rancorous hate and abhorrence;
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:014673_0114_0F948C240F1D08A8"/>
which, aided by our reſtleſs enemies the French, will ſhortly terminate in defiance and revenge. On the other hand—but repetition is needleſs. In ſhort, the multiplying millions of America, muſt either be our deadly foes, or our ſteadfaſt friends. Great-Britain, take thy choice!</p>
            <p>What remains, but that we renew our appeal to the manly ſenſe and magnanimity of the great council of this kingdom; a kingdom, great and happy above all the kingdoms of the earth; a council the moſt auguſt in the whole world, as nurſed in the boſom of freedom, and trained in the true principles of juſt government and pure religion, of which they are the guardians! If men, thus favoured of heaven, thus enlightened, thus elevated, ſhall not ſet examples of ſterling virtue, where, alas! ſhall we find it? Conſult then your own hearts, ye legiſlators of Great-Britain! Be true to your own feelings, and let the moral ſenſe prevail. If ye are conſcious of a love of power, know that 'tis the genuine offspring of the love of liberty. This the root, that the branch. If your hearts be held in the curling branch's cloſe embrace, think how, in the hearts of all men, the tenacious root ſtrikes to the bottom, and twines it's claſping ſibres around the very ſprings of life, never to loſe their hold!</p>
            <p>Remember that ye are now to decide on the fate of nations—perhaps your own. Remember the great legiſlator beholds your doings. Be your doings like unto his doings. Be tender to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; be firm to freedom; be inflexible to juſtice. Emancipate in one god-like act, a long
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:014673_0115_0F948C24EC4490B8"/>
roll of nations, whoſe names it is tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. In one act, lift up the well-pleaſing name of Great-Britain to Heaven, and ſpread her matchleſs fame to the ends of the wondering earth. The depth of her wiſdom, the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of her virtue, ſhall be unexampled, and this act remain a monument of her great feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, an everlaſting model of juſtice, and a theme of praiſe to all nations, and to all ages. Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates have, unto dethroned Princes reſtored their raviſhed dominions; renowned monarchs, ſated with ambition, and the abuſe of authority, have, in the plenitude of their power, abdicated thrones; heroes and patriots have given freedom to their native countries; but for the preſent legiſlators of Great-Britain was reſerved the ſuperior, the ſupreme glory of beſtowing in a foreign ſoil, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty on millions!</p>

ſhould be any inſuperable difficulties ſtarted by them, when they ſhould come to enter into their reſpective ſeparate treaties.</p>
               <p>How the trade of a colony can be limited, and its manufactures reſtricted by the mother-country, on the principles of juſtice, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with its own free conſent,</hi> I confeſs I have not eyes to diſcover. If it can be made appear, that the Britiſh Parliament hath a right to ſay to an American, <q>
                     <hi>you ſhall not</hi> make a hat to cover your head, nor a ſhoe to defend your foot; <hi>you ſhall not</hi> manufacture a piece of cloth to keep out the cold, nor a knife wherewithal to cut your victuals; why, I pray, may it not likewiſe ſay, give us the money out of your pocket?</q> To obtain a little money may be thought, and by Mr. Grenville and his diſciples was thought, as <hi>convenient</hi> to the ſtate, as the employment of our manufacturers.</p>
               <p>Obſerving, that not only the unreaſoning multitude, but the members in both houſes of Parliament, minority as well as majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not even excepting the honeſt oppoſers of American taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all ſeemed to agree, that Great-Britain hath a right to bind the colonies by her regulations and reſtrictions in and upon their trade, navigation and manufactures; I, for a long time, ſuffered my own reaſon to be borne down, and my feelings ſuppreſſed by the weight of ſuch reſpectable, though not infallible authority; but, the ſelf evident fallaciouſneſs of this propoſition for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring upon me, and ſtriking my mind with redoubled force every time I conſidered it, I was at laſt obliged to yield to the force of an irreſiſtible internal conviction, and to reject that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as erroneous, and as a national prejudice, ariſing from <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> eſtabliſhed by the mother country, when her children were helpleſs new born babes, and carefully inſtilled into their minds while growing up, as among the ſacred precepts of filial piety; from the ſelf-flattering and ſelf-intereſted ſuggeſtions of Britiſh minds; and from the general acknowledgement of the Americans themſelves. One of their judicious and truly patriotic writers (before referred to p. 30. in a note to the firſt letter) on this head, expreſſes himſelf thus:—<q>Great-Britain has prohibited the manufacturing iron and ſteel in theſe colonies, without any objection to her <hi>right</hi> of doing it. The like right ſhe muſt have to prohibit any other manufacture among us. Thus ſhe is poſſeſſed of an undiſputed <hi>preceaent</hi> on that point. This au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhe will ſay, is founded on the <hi>original intention</hi> of ſettling theſe colonies; that is, that ſhe ſhould manufacture for them, and that they ſhould ſupply her with materials. The <hi>equity</hi> of this policy, ſhe will alſo ſay, has been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged by the colonies, who never have made the leaſt objection to ſtatutes for that purpoſe; and will further appear, by the mutual benefits ſlowing from this uſage, ever ſince the ſettlement of theſe colonies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Our great advocate, Mr, Pitt, in his ſpeeches on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, concerning the repeal of the <hi>ſtamp-act,</hi> acknowledged,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:014673_0117_0F948C265DB63F38"/>
that Great Britain could reſtrain our manufactures. His words are theſe:—This kingdom, as the ſupreme governing and legiſlative power,</q> [even this great man hath not got over the little idea of nations remaining in perpetual ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to nations from which they ſprang] has ALWAYS <q>bound the colonies by her regulations and RESTRICTIONS in trade, in navigation, in MANUFACTURES, in every thing, <hi>except that of taking the money out of their pockets,</hi> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. Again, he ſays, we may bind their trade, CONFINE THEIR MANUFACTURES, and exerciſe every power whatever, <hi>except that of taking their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of their pockets,</hi> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.</q> [Theſe are pretty large conceſſions to the pride and ambition of Great Britain, and yet ſhe is not ſatisfied with them.] <q>Here then, my dear countrymen, ROUSE youſelves, and behold the ruin hanging over your heads. If you ONCE ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that Great Britain may lay duties upon her exportations to us, <hi>for the purpoſe of levying money on us only,</hi> ſhe will then have nothing to do, but to lay thoſe duties on the articles which ſhe prohibits us to manufacture,—and the tragedy of American liberty is finiſhed. We have been prohibited from procuring manufactures, in all caſes any where, but from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> (except linens, which we are permitted to import directly from Ireland.) We have been prohibited, in ſome caſes, from manufacturing for ourſelves, and may be prohibited in others. We are, therefore, exactly in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a city beſieged, which is ſurrounded by the works of the beſiegers in every part <hi>but one.</hi> If that is cloſed up, no ſtep can be taken, <hi>but to ſurrender at diſcretion,</hi> If Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain can order us to come to her for neceſſaries we want, and can order us to pay what taxes ſhe pleaſes before we take them away, or when we land them here, we are as abject ſlaves as France or Poland can ſhew in wooden ſhoes and with uncomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hair.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Perhaps the nature of the neceſſities of dependent ſtates, cauſed by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated by a fact mentioned in hiſtory. When the Carthaginians were poſſeſſed of the iſland of Sardinia, they made a decree, that the Sardinians ſhould not raiſe <hi>corn,</hi> nor get it any other way <hi>than from the Carthaginians.</hi> Then, by impoſing any taxes they would upon it, they drained from the miſerable Sardinians any ſums they pleaſed; and whenever that oppreſſed people made the leaſt movement to aſſert their liberty, their tyrants ſtarved them to death, or ſubmiſſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But why, I want to know, are the colonies to be held for ever in the ſituation of <hi>cities beſieged?</hi> Why is the mother-country to be the <hi>ſole judge</hi> of ſuch reſtrictions as may be conſiſtent with the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:014673_0118_0F948C26F497C690"/>
intention</hi> of ſettling colonies; ſeeing that this original inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not, in ſome caſes, the intention of the <hi>legiſlature,</hi> but the intention of <hi>the emigrants themſelves,</hi> when they fled from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, miſery, and want, to take ſhelter in the more friendly wilds of America? Why are the ſelfiſh and arbitrary terms pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>one party,</hi> to be implicitly received by the <hi>other,</hi> in a commercial affair of <hi>mutual concern,</hi> and profeſſed by the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating party, to be for their <hi>mutual advantage? Voluntary conſent</hi> and <hi>agreement, independent bargain</hi> and <hi>contract,</hi> are in the very eſſence of all <hi>equitable</hi> dealings in trade. I preſume the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans may be as good judges, as the people who ridiculouſly <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the right</hi> of judging for them, what it is <hi>their</hi> advantage to reſtrict themſelves to in manufactures and trade; and will be ready to take care to confine themſelves to ſuch branches, as will be moſt conſiſtent with that firſt political maxim, of ſecuring at all events, <hi>the protection of Great-Britain,</hi> and her <hi>valuable trade,</hi> from which they have benefits to expect, that no other European market can yield them. To acknowledge their independency, and to form with them a friendly league, is therefore the only method, <hi>on the principles of equity,</hi> of laying them under reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in trade and manufactures, for the excluſive advantage of their protectors; but continuing to impoſe theſe reſtrictions by <hi>our own authority</hi> and by <hi>force,</hi> as it deeply affects them in their property, by <hi>preventing money coming into their pockets,</hi> (which is very nearly allied, when done unjuſtly, to <hi>taking it out of their pockets without their conſent</hi>) is undoubtedly tyrannical.</p>
               <p>When our legiſlators, and others, diveſting themſelves of every ſelfiſh and arbitrary bias, (the characteriſtics of little and uncultivated minds) and guarding againſt all ſuggeſtions, but thoſe of truth, juſtice, and benevolence, ſhall have duly reflected on this very important queſtion, I flatter myſelf they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the wiſdom of our <hi>anticipating</hi> the Americans in a candid diſcuſſion of it, and will agree with me, in ſentiment, that America cannot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to any ideas of juſtice or freedom, be laid under reſtrictions of any kind, for the purpoſe of ſtrengthening and aggrandizing the ſtate or legiſlature of Great Britain, <hi>except with her free-will and conſent,</hi> independently and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily given by expreſs ſtipulation and contract; and conſequently, that they will ſee the moral as well as the political neceſſity, for the propoſed DECLARATION and LEAGUE; and that, in fact, it remains for Great Britain to chooſe, whether by acting the deaf and haughty tyrant, ſhe ſhall ſink herſelf into poverty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or, by a conduct worthy herſelf and her boaſted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and love of freedom, ſhe ſhall render herſelf, not only the all-powerful guarantee of the independence, and monopolizer of the trade of America, but at the ſame time the dreaded, the dictatorial arbiter of Europe.</p>

And a Poſtſcript, containing new Agruments on the Subject; a Draught of a Bill propoſed to be brought into Parliament for reſtoring Peace and Harmony between Great-Britain and Britiſh America, and for perpetuating the ſame.

            <p>Of the former edition of this performance an account was given in our Review for November laſt. Reſpecting the Appendix, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to obſerve, that in the letter to Mr. Burke our Author's general opinions of the right of the Coloniſts are applied in oppoſition to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which had been alledged to ſupport the American Declaratory Act. The propoſed Bill for rendering the Colonies independent of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority of Parliament is founded on thoſe principles of which we before gave a general account; but the particular application of them in the 'draught' before us well deſerves conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The latter part of the Poſtſcript contains ſeveral important additional propoſals, reſpecting the future adminiſtration of government in the ſeveral ſtates, as parts of the propoſed 'Grand Britiſh League and Confederacy,' among which we ſhall extract the following:</p>
            <p>"And for the more effectually preſerving the future balance of power between all the ſtates of that immenſe continent, might it not be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that the limits and boundaries of each, which they ſhould never hereafter paſs, ſhould

be newly defined by the Grand Britiſh League and Confederacy; and ſome of their nominal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior boundaries now lying very far within the wilderneſs, be changed for others at a nearer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?—For the ſame good purpoſe and other apparent good reaſons, might not the remainder of the wilderneſs be partitioned out into certain determinate and limited tracts, according to ſoil and ſituation; each of which ſhould be conſidered as the territory of ſome future ſtate which in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time might be therein directed. And I would propoſe that no interruption ſhould be given to the growing of ſuch new ſtates (other than every government has a right to give by wholeſome laws within itſelf to prevent as much as may be a ſpirit or practice of emigration;) but that until the ſettlers within any ſuch partitioned tract of the wilderneſs ſhould be increaſed and multiplied to the number of fifty thouſand ſouls, they ſhould be conſidered as incapable of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an independent political ſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be ſubject for the intermediate time to the government of Great-Britain. But as ſoon as their numbers ſhould amount to fifty thouſand <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>"During the ſhort ſpace of time indeed that remains of that winter's day, to the evening of which we may hope to continue the deſpotic lords of North-America, thoſe immenſe diviſions of country we have affected to make by our char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and by act of parliament on a late memorable occaſion, may, like all other arbitrary compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums, be <hi>convenient to us,</hi> ſo long as we deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to continue arbitrary rulers; or it might hereafter be favorable to the ambition of ſome one American ſtate hungering to ſwallow up its neighbours, to have its territory like that of the ambitious Catherine reaching from the ſalt ocean to the freſh water ſeas in midland, and thence to the ſalt ocean again quite acroſs the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; but in neither caſe would it be deſirable or good for <hi>the people of thoſe countries."</hi>

riſe into being to front the lakes and great rivers St. Lawrence and Miſſiſſippi, as the preſent ones do the Atlantic ſea. We have already enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foregoing draught for an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eighteen ſtates already formed; and by ſuch a diviſion of the remaining country by the grand confederacy as we have propoſed, proviſion might be made for the future gradual and quiet eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of nineteen more at leaſt, all of ample extent, and every one having a very conſiderable frontier acceſſible to ſhipping and upon waters which are at this time navigated by the Britiſh navy."</p>
            <p>"Thus each of theſe numerous ſtates, by the ſame means that would enable it through com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to become a reſpectable member of the grand Britiſh confederacy, would be effectually ſubject to the controul and influence of Great-Britain, their common maritime protector and umpire, ſo neceſſary for preſerving the harmony of the whole.

His arguments are chiefly derived from the ſpirit of our Conſtitution, and the liberal principles of reaſon and equity, on which he contends, that communities governed by a power in which they have neither controul or participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are in a ſtate of ſlavery.—That the freedom and happineſs of a people ſuperſede every poſſible claim of government—That mankind have a better right to preſerve their liberties than any power can have to abridge them—That the diſtance of the colonies ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it impoſſible to govern them by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of parliament, without ſubverting the principles of all free Governments.</p>
