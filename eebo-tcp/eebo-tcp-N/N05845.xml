            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN we conſider, that ſoon after the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the eternal Father, having brought forth this whole Creation of his, ſat on a Throne, glorious, exalted and lifted up on high, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by Hoſts of exulting Angels (thoſe Morning Stars that ſang together, thoſe Sons of God that ſhouted for Joy) viewing every Thing he had made, pronouncing it all, <hi>very good;</hi> and we do then reflect on the preſent Situation of Affairs among Mortals, we muſt condole the Fate of our Globe, as being changed from a Garden of God, an Eden, a Paradiſe of Holineſs, Joy and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, into a Haunt of impure Spirits, a Scene of Sin, Horror, Woe and Diſappointment, a Lazar-houſe of Anguiſh and Torture, infeſted with Wars and Rumors of Wars, Famines, Earthquakes, Inundations, Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations, Diſeaſes, Peſtilences, Deaths. And, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Reflection, gloomy as it is, we would be very fooliſh indeed, if we thought the infinitely wiſe, and great JEHOVAH, to whom all his Works are known from Eternity, had been fruſtrated in his Scheme, he concerted to demonſtrate the Glory of his eternal Power and Deity;—he who calleth the Things that are not, as if they were, can bring forth Light out of Darkneſs, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007421_0003_102D83E4E2CB5D28"/>
Life out of Death;—he is both wiſe and able, by his abſolute and irreſiſtable Providence, ſo to over-rule the greateſt Evils, that they ſerve the wiſeſt and moſt glorious Purpoſes.—Had there been no Fall, no Need had there been of a Redeemer; nor ſhould the Saints in Glory ever have had Reaſon to adore the Love, Mercy, and free Grace of God, which ſaved them from ſo great Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Veſſels of his Wrath and Indignation, ſhall ſuffer in the horrid Abyſs, burning with Fire and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher unconſumed, prepared for the Devil and his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Crew. It is indeed an awful Reflection, that this our Globe ſhall, in the laſt Conflagration, be all in a Blaze of Fire; but that it will ſerve to purify and renew it, makes more than ample Amends.—And do we animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon the Calamities and Tribulations that befall a ſinful World, we ſhall ſoon perceive that they ſerve wiſe Purpoſes, <hi>to wit,</hi> that Sinners may learn Righteouſneſs, and that Saints by their Patience and Reſignation to the eternal Decree of Heaven, by their Courage and godly Heroiſm, may glorify the heavenly Father, when they fight the Battles of the Lord Sebaoth.</p>
            <p>Therefore our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, with ſo much Calmneſs and Compoſure of Mind, fore-tells his Diſciples, what great Changes ſhould happen on the Earth, before the End of the World come—The Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, that not one Stone be left upon the other, <hi>Judea</hi> laid waſte and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State aboliſhed.—As they were nearly concerned in this (and the human Mind is always inquiſitive) they came privately unto him, and ſaid, Tell us, Lord, when ſhall theſe Things be? And what ſhall be the Sign of thy coming, and of the End of the World?—Jeſus cautions them againſt the Deluſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

he reveals unto them the Fate of the World, before the great and tremendous Day of Conflagration, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all Things come; <hi>to wit,</hi> that there ſhall be terrible Calamities and doleful Tribulations on Earth, occaſioned by Wars, Famines, Peſtilences, Earthquakes, Perſecutions and Impoſtures.—Againſt all which Jeſus exhorts them to ſtand, not only with manly Reſolution and Courage, but alſo with godly Heroiſm and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of Soul, ſaying, Ye ſhall hear of Wars, and Rumors of Wars: See that ye be not troubled; for all theſe Things muſt come to paſs, but the End is not yet.</p>
            <p>So that the Words of my Text contain a Prediction of our bleſſed Lord, wherein he foretells his Diſciples, that it ſhould be the Fate of the World to be moleſted with Wars and Rumors of Wars, at the ſame Time commanding and charging them not to be troubled thereat, but to have good Courage, and to be inſpired with godly Heroiſm and divine Magnanimity, from a Conſideration that theſe Things were ordained and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſo to be, and ſo to happen, before the End of the World come.</p>
            <p>If ever any Words were appoſite to an Occaſion, theſe are ſo to our preſent Situation, while we not only hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, at a Diſtance, but are upon an Expedition, to remove the Encroachments our antichriſtian Neighbours, who alſo are our great Enemies, have made on our Borders: For which End this Army, in the Midſt of which I ſtand, is raiſed, and now ſoon to go forth to meet their Adverſaries in an awful Inſtant, in a critical Conjuncture, and in a portentous Interval, that muſt determine our great Diſpute.</p>
            <p>I do then bend my Knees; I lift up my Eyes to the open Canopy of Heaven; I ſpread out my Hands unto the Lord, my God, and pray from the Bottom of my Heart; give Eear, O Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou that leadeſt <hi>Joſeph</hi> like a Flock, thou that dwelleſt between the Cherubim, ſhine forth before <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007421_0004_102D83E7170F6970"/>
and <hi>Manaſſah,</hi> ſtir up thy Strength, and come and ſave us. O Lord, God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry againſt the Prayer of thy People? Turn us again, O God of Hoſts, and cauſe thy Face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>In order that I may lay open and unfold the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Lord, I ſhall ſtand up and ſpeak, as the Lord pleaſeth to grant me Utterance (and O Lord, do thou enlighten me by thy holy Spirit, ſtrengthen and ſupport me by thy omnipotent Hand. Let one of the celeſtial Seraphims come with a live Coal from thy Altar, and touch my Heart and my Mouth, that I may ſpeak as it becometh me to ſpeak) of theſe three great Things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is the Fate of the World, to be moleſted by Wars and Rumors of Wars.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the People of God muſt ſee to it, that they be not troubled thereat; but be inſpired with good Courage and godly Heroiſm.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That theſe Things are ordained and decreed, ſo to be, and ſo to happen, before the End of the World cometh.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt; we muſt remark, that he who here ſpeaketh, is our bleſſed Lord, who ſpeaketh not as Men ſpeak, often by meer Conjecture, or from external Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Things, but with divine Infallibility, and never-erring Authority. All Things, paſt, preſent, and to come, are known to him: And it is his Province to reveal unto his Prophets and Saints, whatſoever he ſees fit they ſhould know. Wherefore he doth here lay open and unfold to his Diſciples, the Fate and Lot of the World in general, and that of <hi>Judea</hi> in particular; which is, that they ſhould <hi>hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars:</hi> Wars preſent, and Wars at a diſtance, but in Proſpect; a Succeſſion of Wars and Rumors of Wars: Scarce was the one paſt, but the other was near at Hand, even at the Doors.—And it hath Weight with me, that to Wars, here are added Rumors of Wars: Becauſe it
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007421_0004_102D83E7170F6970"/>
is with Wars, as with other temporary Evils we fear and dread, that the Proſpect of them oftentimes is more terrible and more alarming, than the Experience of the very Thing itſelf; though not always, but ſometimes the reverſe—We have at preſent no more than Rumors of Wars, and it hath put us to ſuch Preparation (which it ought to do) to ſuch Expences, to ſuch Labour and Toil, that we wiſh for War itſelf; nay, we conceive, if War in Fact do not come, the Rumors of War we have had, would preſs very heavily upon us—And be felt throughout our whole Land a long Time.</p>
            <p>Do we endeavour to trace the firſt Origin of Wars, we may find that they deſcend from a grand Battle that was fought in Heaven, when Satan threw of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance from the eternal Father, and with his Apoſtates waged War againſt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels—Satan loſt the Battle (for how ſhould he ſtand againſt the Almighty?) And was doom'd to the infernal Abyſs, there to ſuffer with his apoſtate Crew, the everlaſting Condemnation of Hell-fire, as Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle, and the Angels which kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting Chains under Darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day— Satan notwithſtanding, by the Sufferance of Heaven, found Means to come upon this earthly Globe; on which Man was created, good and upright, after the Image and Likeneſs of his great Maker, whom the arch Enemy of God and Man beguiled, deceived and perverted, to fall off from his Creator, and to enter into Allegiance with him—And hence ſpring Wars and Rumors of Wars on Earth.—</p>
            <p>There is not only Enmity ſat between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, but Mankind in general is become hateful and hating one another: From which Motive it came to paſs that <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his Brother <hi>Abel</hi>—The Antidaluvian Giants were Men of Renown, and mighty in Feats of Arms, and withall exceeding

Children butchered like innocent Lambs, deſtinated to the Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; tender Babes and ſuckling Infants, torn from their Mothers Breaſts, and daſhed againſt the Stones;—anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Parents dragged by their hoary Hairs, and ſtabbed to the Heart—Our Habitations conſumed by Fire, and all our Effects ruined and deſtroyed:—Our Land, Cities and Towns taken from us, and poſſeſſed by the Enemy, while we ourſelves are left deſtitute and forlorn—Nay, by Wars we may be deſpoiled of our ineſtimable reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and civil Liberties, and be conſtrained to ſpend our Days under Tyranny and Perſecution, Bondage and Servitude; Error, Hereſy, Idolatry, Superſtition and Thraldom—Yea, Wars are often accompanied by a long Train and Retinue of malignant Diſeaſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Diſtempers, and may end in Famine and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence—All theſe Evils, and many more too long to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate, we may ſuffer by Wars.—</p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding all this (and more than I have

            <p>We muſt ſee to it, that our Cauſe be juſt and good. We are not to engage in War from Motives of Luſt, from Principles of Pride, Ambition, Rapacity, Cruelty, Covetouſneſs or vain Glory. This would be eſpouſing the Cauſe of the Devil, the Deſtroyer and Murderer of Mankind—But for our Lives, our Liberties, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and our moſt holy Religion.—When wicked Men will rob us of thoſe Bleſſings, the Lord hath been pleaſed to beſtow upon us, then is our Cauſe a juſt one, and becomes God's Cauſe, unto whom we may ſafely appeal to decide the Controverſy, as did <hi>Jephthah</hi> the <hi>Gileadite,</hi> when he was conſtrained to engage in a War, againſt the King of the Children of <hi>Ammon;</hi> ſo now, ſaith he, the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath diſpoſſeſſed the <hi>Amorites</hi> from before his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhouldeſt thou poſſeſs it? Wilt not thou poſſeſs that which <hi>Chemoſh</hi> thy God giveth thee to poſſeſs?

            </p>
            <p>We muſt ſee to it, that in our Wars we engage in the Name of the Lord—In the Name of our God we muſt ſet up our Banners—And above all Things, we muſt enliſt-under <hi>Emmanuel</hi>'s Banner for ſpiritual Warfare, that we may have Peace with God, and be in his Favour; that whether we live, or whether we die, we may be the Lord's.—We muſt begin, carry on, and end our Wars

with God, and not with Belial—We muſt implore his Approbation, his Aid, his Bleſſing and Succour, to our Enterpriſe, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> his faithful Servant beſought; if thy Preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence— Let us Remember what <hi>Samuel</hi> did, when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was penitently gathered together at <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> imploring Heaven for Deliverance from the Hands of the <hi>Philiſtins; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> cried unto the Lord, for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lord heard him: And the Lord thundered with a great Thunder, on that Day, upon the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and diſcomfited them; and they were ſmitten before <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So that <hi>Samuel</hi> had Reaſon to erect a Monument Stone, calling it <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> hitherto hath the Lord helped us—And thou pious King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though thou hadſt thy Failings and Weakneſs, art an Example of Imitation unto us, in thy Prayer, which, out of the Fulneſs of thy Heart, thou didſt ſend up to Heaven, when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> reproached the living God! then didſt thou pray, O Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who dwelleſt between the Cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, thou haſt made Heaven and Earth. Now, therefore, O Lord our God, I beſeech thee, ſave thou us out of his Hand, that all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even thou only.—And behold God's gracious Anſwer of this Prayer: And it came to paſs that Night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> an Hundred and Fourſcore and five Thouſand: And when they aroſe early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, behold, they were all dead Corpſe.—</p>

            <p>We muſt ſee to it, that we refer the Iſſue wholly to the Supreme Being, firmly believing that an omnipotent, infinitely wiſe, good and righteous God, over-rules all Events, according to his own good Pleaſure, ſubmitting ourſelves to his ſovereign Diſpoſal, as <hi>Job</hi> exhorted the Army of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were ſore beſet on all Hands; be of good Courage, and let us behave ourſelves valiently for our People, and for the Cities of our God; and let the Lord do that which is good in his Sight.—If we are conquered, we muſt ſay, the Will of the Lord be done; if we conquer and overcome, we muſt give the Glory to God.—</p>
            <p>And all this for a good and ſufficient Reaſon; becauſe, all theſe Things are ordained and decreed, ſo to be, and ſo to happen, before the End of the World come, as in the third and latter Part of the Text; <hi>for all theſe Things muſt come to paſs.</hi>—Such is the eternal, the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokable and irreverſible Decree of Heaven—And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is decreed in Heaven, will not remain pendent in the Clouds—Such is the Will of the eternal Father, unto whom all his Works are known from Eternity, who hath concerted the whole Scheme, and laid the Plan of the Univerſe: And his Will muſt be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.—All Things are decreed by God, and the whole of our Fate is ordained by him, and it

ſhall happen unto us as he hath decreed it.—We muſt with patient <hi>Job,</hi> confeſs, Lord-our Days are determined, the Number of our Months are with thee, thou haſt appointed our Bounds, which we cannot paſs.—We muſt ſay, the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord:—Let him bring upon me that which is appointed for me! We muſt deny our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take up our Croſs, and follow Jeſus.—We muſt even loſe our own Lives in ourſelves, that we may find them in God.—This is godly Heroiſm and ſpiritual Warfare, by which we conquer ourſelves, and all the Powers of Hell and of this World; and whereby we are of a Truth rendered capable to fight the Battles of the Lord of Sabaoth. <hi>Fortior eſt qui ſe quam qui fortiſſima vincit Moenia, nec Virtus altior ire poteſt.</hi>—He who conquers himſelf, is ſtronger than he that conquers the ſtrongeſt Walls, and Virtue can go no higher.—</p>
            <p>We muſt then, as rational Creatures, be earneſtly engaged in the Uſe of all good and lawful Means, which the Lord hath been pleaſed to put in our Way, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Happineſs, in this and in the eternal World: But at the ſame Time ſubmit, with an holy Complacency in the juſt and good Will of God, to all that he hath decreed over us.—Whether we ſink or whether we ſwim, whether the Lord kills us, or whether he preſerves us alive, when we are in a Way of dutiful Obedience to him, it muſt be Matter of holy Indifference to us, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever be his Diſpoſal.—</p>
            <p>Human Nature, alas! in its lapſed State, is but too prone to murmur and cavil at the Diſpenſations of God's Providence. Godly <hi>Aſaph,</hi> when he ſaw the Proſperity of Fools, and reflected on the Adverſities of the Wiſe and Pious, breaks forth into Complaint: But as for me, my Feet were almoſt gone: My Steps had well nigh ſlipt: For I was envious at the Fooliſh, when I ſaw the Proſperity of the Wicked.—But at length, when he went into the Sanctuary of God, and ſaw the End, his

Mind became ſerene and calm, and his whole Soul wrapt up in an Extaſy of Devotion, chuſing God for the only and eternal Portion of his Soul, and entruſting his all with him.—</p>
            <p>While it hath been my Buſineſs to ſee the Viſions of the Almighty, I have ſeen horrible Sights.—I have ſeen Impiety and Oppreſſion ſucceſsful; Innocence I have ſeen oppreſſed and abuſed. Thoſe who feared the Lord, and eſchewed Evil, I have ſeen agonizing under Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Affliction, while at the ſame Time, ſuch as had not the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon their Hearts, were elevated with Proſperity.— The wicked and ungodly I have ſeen raiſed to Wealth and Honour, to Poſts and Profits, while the ſincere Worſhipper of the Deity, was as a deſpiſed Lamp, as one mocked of his Neighbour, and laughed to ſcorn.— Such as were a Burthen to the World, I have ſeen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued beyond the common Period pf Life, and ſuch as ſeemed a Bleſſing; even Stars of the firſt Magnitude, I have ſeen taken away by Death out of their Spheres, in the bright Morning of Youth.</p>

            <p>Although now this holy Submiſſion to the Will and Decree of Heaven, be what our Dependence upon the Supreme Being makes our Duty, yet is there another weighty Reaſon for it, <hi>to wit,</hi> our own Advantage: For if we do not ſubmit ourſelves to the Diſpoſal of Heaven, it will not take away our Adverſities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, but rather increaſe them; for then we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to bear both the Evil and the Murmurings of our Minds againſt it, which is a double Evil; whereas if our Souls are inſpired with Reſignation to, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in the Will of God, we have at worſt, no more to ſuffer than one bare Evil; nay, ſcarce any Evil at all, that divine Frame of godly Heroiſm changing Evil into Good; ſo that were it poſſible one inſpired therewith, ſhould be ever in the Place where the damned ſuffer ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments, it would make that Hell a Heaven to him.—</p>
            <p>Moreover, we often ſee, how thoſe, that with godly Heroiſm reſign themſelves to the Diſpoſal of Heaven, are remarkably preſerved and delivered by his marvellous Providence, while others behaving with the moſt abject Puſilanimity, and inglorious Timidity, have periſhed.— Perſevering <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> who would rather hazard his Life, than pollute his Conſcience, how was he from the Dungeon, exalted to Honour and Dominion, while the King's Baker was hanged betwixt Heaven and Earth! Heroic <hi>David,</hi> how didſt thou in thy great Diſtreſs, when thy temporal all was taken Captive, and thy own People ſpake of ſtoning thee, encourage thyſelf in the Lord thy God, and obtain marvellous Conqueſt and ſurpriſing Victory over thine Enemies! But, poor <hi>Saul,</hi> who was

wont to be victorious when he truſted in God, how doth he now, when he was forſaken of God, and had with, Fear and great Diſmay, conſulted the Sorcereſs at <hi>Endor,</hi> fall upon Mount <hi>Gilboa,</hi> as if he had not been anointed with Oil! Ye leprous <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who ventured out into the <hi>Syrian</hi> Camp, ſaying, Why ſit we here until we die? If they ſave us alive we ſhall live; and if they kill us, we ſhall but die; how were ye, when ye returned, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers of good Tidings! But that wretched Lord, or Miniſter of State, on whoſe Hand the King leaned, who ſaid to the Man of God, Behold, if the Lord would make Windows in Heaven, might this Thing be; how was he by the People, trod upon in the Gate that he died, ſeeing but not enjoying what he at firſt would not believe, though foretold him by a Man of God!</p>
            <p>There is yet at laſt, one great Comfort in the Text, for the People of God, which is this; <hi>But the End is not yet.</hi>—Although it be the general Fate of the World, to be moleſted by Wars and Rumors of Wars; yet ſhall there, before the End be, come a glorious State of the Church, in which ſhall dwell Peace, Joy and Reſt, for the People of God: When <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall be one People, rejoicing every where in the Salvation of the Lord; for his Name ſhall be great, from the riſing of the Sun, unto the going down of the ſame, and every where ſhall Incenſe be offered, and a pure Offering.— The Fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall come in, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> be ſaved.—Antichriſt ſhall fall, ſo that the Nations ſhout with Joy, ſhe is fallen, ſhe is fallen, <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City.—Satan the old Serpent, ſhall be bound a Thouſand Years, that he deceive not the Nations.—Then will <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the beloved City, be the peaceable Habitation of the Saints of both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> while our glorious Redeemer ſways his Sceptre over all.—<hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> will indeed, when Satan is to be loſed a little while, with innumerable Numbers, compaſs and beſiege the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City: But Fire will come

down from God out of Heaven, and devour them.— This Millennium of Peace, Joy and Reſt to the Church militant, is a great Conſolation to the People of God:— And it muſt certainly come before the End be; for while we hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, the End is not yet: There muſt be a Thouſand Years of Peace, a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of Reſt, before the End come.—</p>
            <p>Nothing is more certain, than that the End of the World ſhall come, but the preciſe Time when it is to be, is as uncertain.—Of that Day and Hour, knoweth no Man; no, not the Angels of Heaven.—Some have thought the World is to ſtand ſix Thouſand Years: Two Thouſand Years before the Law-giving, two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand under the Law, and two Thouſand under the Goſpel.—It hath been about two Thouſand Years before the Law was given in Form, and from thence to the Goſpel Diſpenſation, alſo about two Thouſand Years; but I think, if we endeavour to pry into the Gloom of ſacred Prophecy, it will appear probable, from the great Things that muſt yet come to paſs, that the World is to ſtand two Thouſand Years under the Goſpel, before the glorious State of the Church come; which is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a Thouſand Years, and makes three Thouſand Years under the Goſpel; in the whole, ſeven Thouſand Years of the World's ſtanding.—After this there is to enſue a Period of Time of univerſal Defection and Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſy, when the World ſhall be as much ſunk in Irreligion, Impiety and Senſuality, as in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the Deluge over whelmed the World; ſo that the Son of Man, when he cometh to judge the Quick and the Dead, ſhall ſcarce find Faith on Earth.—But how long this Time of Apoſtaſy will laſt, no one of God's Creatures can tell.—</p>
            <p>As of old, the World paſſed through the Water, ſo is it, in the laſt Conflagration and Conſummation of all Things, to paſs through the Fire, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith; the Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe, and the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007421_0015_102D8403ACF82178"/>
Elements ſhall melt with fervent Heat; the Earth alſo, and the Works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up.—But whence this Fire is to proceed, we know not.—Some think it is to be done by the elementary Fire that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds our Globe; others think, the Earth will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of her Center, and be ſwallowed up by the Sun, that vaſt Ocean and Furnace of Fire: Others more plauſibly think, there is a fiery Conſtellation, which in its Courſe is to meet our terraqeous Globe, through which the Earth is to paſs, in order to be purified by Fire.— How uncertain ſoever theſe Conjectures may be, this is certain, that the Conſummation of this World, is to be by Conflagration; which is not to annihilate, but to purify and to renew it, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith alſo, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we, according to his Promiſe, look for new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs. —How then the Conſtitution of the Earth will be, I am at a Loſs to tell, but that it ſhall be as the Garden of God, even as <hi>Eden,</hi> a Paradiſe, I doubt not in the leaſt. —The wicked ſhall then be caſt away into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.—And the Saints ſhall enter into Life eternal.</p>
            <p>And at laſt, it muſt be Matter of Conſolation exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great to the Saints, that their Exiſtence is not to end with their Tribulations; but that there remaineth a Reſt for the People of God, in the other World, in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial ever bleſſed Paradiſe.—Their Tribulations will not laſt always, but ſhall ſoon have an End; and their Peace and Joy, exceeding full of Glory, ſhall endure for ever, in the Kingdom of their Father.</p>
            <p>So ye ſee, my dear Hearers, I have laid open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to you, as well as the Lord hath granted me Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, the Fate of the World, as predicted by our Lord, to the Encouragement of all thoſe that Love him to the End of Days.—I have held forth to you the high Decree of Heaven, as much as it was permitted to me his Creature.—I proceed now to make ſome Application

            <p>The Words of our Lord, Ye ſhall hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, are now verified among us.—The <hi>French</hi> King, and Court, ſeem to be much bent on ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing their Monarchy, that nothing can ſatiate their unbounded Ambition, or preſcribe Limits to their enterprizing Diſpoſition, than univerſal Empire on Earth; and perhaps not that neither. It may be, if they had made a Conqueſt of the whole World, they would wiſh for more Worlds to conquer alſo. <hi>Quid non mortalia Pectora cogis Auri ſacra Fames?</hi>—This worſe than enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Genius in the <hi>French,</hi> was the Source of their late Wars in <hi>Europe</hi> and in <hi>America;</hi> in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they were remarkably fruſtrated and baffled: <hi>Louiſburgh,</hi> at <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> was taken from them, and their Navy went to Wreck.— But as they who have an Enterprize much at Heart, are not diſcouraged by one Diſappointment, having when one Project miſcarries, another in Embryo; ſo the <hi>French,</hi> conſidering the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt they had apparently obtained among the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations in <hi>North-America,</hi> have now transferred the Scene of War from <hi>Europe</hi> to us, hoping to accompliſh in the New-found World, what in the old, they could not. They have then ſince the Proclamation of the late Peace, diſcovered a particular Inclination to encroach upon our Borders.—His Majeſty King GEORGE, our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign, always taking tender Care of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of his liege, loyal and loving Subjects, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed, having the Intereſt of his Dominions in <hi>America</hi> much at Heart, to ſend the Earl of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> and Governor <hi>Shirley,</hi> in an Embaſſage to <hi>France,</hi> to ſettle the Boundaries between the two contending Nations in <hi>North-America:</hi> But by the Prevarications and Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the <hi>French,</hi> their Negociations were rendered

The Reſult of which Confederacy, I believe, is the preſent Expedition.—The <hi>French,</hi> to prevent us, I ſuppoſe, from ſending any Forces to <hi>Ohio,</hi> ſtimulated their <hi>Indians</hi> to do Miſchief in ſome of our Governments, by cutting off the greateſt Part of <hi>Hoſac,</hi> and by killing, ſcalping, and captivating ſome People, hereabouts, and in <hi>New-England:</hi> And by Conſpiracy (as the Report goes) perhaps to prevent <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> from ſending Forces to <hi>America,</hi> threatned her with an Invaſion.—But as the Lord often takes the Crafty in their own Devices, ſo have all theſe Doings of the <hi>French</hi> greatly tended to our awakening.—At Home, a great Armada is prepared; and his Majeſty hath ſent General <hi>Braddock</hi> abroad, with an Army to the <hi>Ohio,</hi> there, if it pleaſe God, to diſlodge the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Southward.</hi>— Colonel <hi>Winſlow,</hi> with an Army of <hi>New-England</hi> Heroes, is engaged to drive the <hi>French</hi> from their Encroachments in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and to bring the treacherous Neutrals to Terms of good Behaviour.—General <hi>Pepperell</hi> (ſo ſay the public Prints) intends with an Army <hi>Northeaſtward,</hi> to <hi>Kenebec River,</hi> and farther into <hi>Canada.</hi>—In our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Governments, Forces have been raiſed, ſome under the Command of his Excellency General <hi>Shirley,</hi> to act their Part in the <hi>Weſtward,</hi> on Lake <hi>Ontario</hi> and at <hi>Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara.</hi>—Others, under Command of Major General <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and Major General <hi>Lyman,</hi> to remove Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

            <p>By what we have already ſeen and felt of the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatment and Oppreſſion, the Violence and Cruelty of our Antichriſtian Neighbours, and their Barbarians, we may judge, what they would do, if we permit them to go on; and if we were unſucceſsful in our preſent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, for removing their Encroachments, boundleſs and uncontroulable would be their Inſolence; let us purſue them, would they ſay, to the Ends of the Earth; at leaſt, let us never ſtop until we have driven thoſe Hugonots, thoſe peſtilent Hereticks, clear off from the Continent of <hi>America.</hi>—In vain did we ſeek univerſal Empire over the whole Earth, by Wars in <hi>Europe;</hi> it is to be obtained on this Side of the Atlantic Ocean.—We muſt tranſport as many of our People as we can, from <hi>France,</hi> and by them ſet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> adri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in which, when we have been once ſettled a little while, we will puſh our good Fortune farther, (for the Northren Nations have always been an Over-match for the Southern) and play the ſame Trick upon the lazy and indolent <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> we have done upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which will make us Maſters, ſole Maſters, of the Silver and Gold Mines in <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico;</hi> and if we once get them, the whole World is ours.</p>
            <p>This, it is likely, would be their Scheme; when our Condition would be woful indeed. We muſt then either die, or ſubmit to Servitude and Tyranny, to Idolatry, Superſtition and Thraldom, far worſe than the moſt cruel Death! Or muſt we tranſport ourſelves, naked and forlorn, beyond the Ocean? Or in what in hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of this Globe, ſhall we pitch our fugitive Tents, and lament with bitter Remembrance of our former State? Farewel now thoſe fertile Lands; farewel thoſe fruitful Fields; farewel ye fat Meadows, and fructiferous Vallies! Vales, Hills, Mountains, Woods, farewel! Farewel ye pleaſant Rivers, ye populous Towns, farewel; farewel ye joyous Cities, goodly Poſſeſſions, farewel; adieu all!</p>
            <p>And while we thus lament, will not <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have Reaſon to utter her mournful Complaint? Our Trade is loſt and gone!

God, and that therefore we have been forſaken by him, ſo that our Eyes were ſtruck with Blindneſs, our Hearts with Languor, and our Hands with Weakneſs.—Yea, all <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall fell the Conſequence, and condole with us that the Balance is broke, and our friendly Allies ſwallowed up by the grand Monarchy.—The <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> the <hi>Danes,</hi> and the Reſt, are all inevitably to ſhare our unhappy Fate.—Thus ſhould <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and all her Allies complain.—</p>
            <p>But let us alſo conſider, how happy our Situation ſhould be, if it pleaſed the Lord to crown our Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, unto which we are conſtrained, with good Succeſs: —If we, in the mean While, that there are only Rumors of War, remove the <hi>French</hi> Encroachments along the <hi>Ohio,</hi> on Lake <hi>Ontario</hi> and <hi>Erie,</hi> at <hi>Niagara,</hi> and at <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> that fatal Place; and then War ſhould be declared at Home, and a Fleet ſail up the River of <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> to attack <hi>Quebec,</hi> and our Armies march up by Land to <hi>Montreal,</hi> and farther into <hi>Canada,</hi> we may, with the Bleſſing of Heaven, do to the <hi>French</hi> what they thought to have done us; that is, drive them quite off from the Continent of <hi>America,</hi> (for when <hi>Quebec,</hi> the Root, is eradicated, the Trunk and Branches muſt fall of their own Accord) and until that happen, there can be no Peace in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> unleſs the <hi>French</hi> change their Religion, their Policy and their Genius: No Wall of Stone, were it one of the Worlds prodigious Wonders, as that between <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Tartary,</hi> no unfordable Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, profound Lakes and rapid Streams of Rivers, no inſurpaſſable Alpian Mountains, and craggy Clifts of Rocks, and Promontories, no impenetrable Woods and wild Deſarts, can be a ſufficient Boundary between us: (As to Treaties and Covenants, they are their Sport.—) They and their Savages bent on Bloodſhed, would wade, or ſink or ſwim, and creep and leap through, and over all, to annoy us, and we ſhould endeavour to be avenged on them for their Inſolence.—And thus muſt we be kept

in continual Alarm, and at all Times have our Lives in our Hands; or being teized and worried out beyond Patience, quit the Land to them at length; which God forbid. <hi>(Delenda eſt Carthago.)</hi>—But were we ſo happy in our removing of Encroachments, as to remove the <hi>French</hi> quite out of <hi>North-America,</hi> then would we be bleſſed with an happy Situation, in a good Land, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Milk and Honey, abounding with every Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and many Comforts (if ſuch any earthly Thing can be) of Life.—Then would we be delivered of thoſe moſt inhuman Barbarians, thoſe Canibals, the preying, the murdering, and ſcalping <hi>Indians.</hi>—Then might we ſit in Peace and Quietude under our Vine and Figtree.— No Reaſon ſhould we have to envy the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> their Gold and Silver Mines; we ſhould get more than enough of that Duſt, by Mortals dignified for the Produce of our own Country.—</p>
            <p>There is ſomething very much to our Encouragement, which is, that Antichriſt muſt fall before the End come; and that there muſt be a peaceable and glorious Kingdom, or Hierarchy on Earth, a Thouſand Years, when the Name of the Lord ſhall be great, from the riſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If we look into the Hiſtory of Antiquity, and remark the Ways of God's Dealings with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> his favourite People of old, we ſhall find, the Diſpenſations of his Providence towards them were ſuch, that when they loved and ſerved their God, he gave them Victory over their Enemies; but when they polluted their Souls with the Abominations of the Heathens, they were left a Prey to their Adverſaries, who butchered them as Brutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to the Slaughter, domineered and tyrannized over them.—Our Antichriſtian Neighbours, it is true, are as far remote from the Favour of Heaven, as we, and farther too, if poſſible; they worſhip Idols in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Senſe, and adore the Works of their own Hands; but ſo did the Nations alſo, that lead <hi>Iſrael</hi> captive. There is more expected of a Nation bleſſed with the Light of Truth, than from one groping in the Darkneſs of Ignorance, of Superſtition and Idolatry.—O that we were wiſe! That we underſtood this!

            <p>Before then, my dear Hearers, I exhort you to the Enterprize ye are now going upon; I beſeech, I pray,

The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lord ſeizes impious Men: When Death is before their Eyes, the World of Spirits then open to their View, overſhadows their Souls with gloomy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, foreboding the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever. Infernal Vultures of Prey hover over their Heads, to ſnatch away their guilty Souls to doleful Shades.—But there ſtands the Man, who firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves God's eternal Predeſtination; who doth wholly acquieſce in his irreſiſtable high Decree, who hath made his Peace with God; Angel Guards attend him, to conduct his parting Spirit into the celeſtial ever bleſſed Paradiſe.

Here will we find the

            <p>My Brethren of the Clergy, ye Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> who are a going up with this Army:—May ye ſee the Viſions of the Almighty! His Urim and Thummim be with you.

            <p>Ye Doctors of Phyſic, be ye tender of the Health, of the Lives and Limbs of theſe our Friends and Brethren, that are going forth to fight the Battles of the Lord, for their King and Country, and for our moſt holy Religion. Caution them againſt every Thing that may be hurtful to their Healths, and may have a Tendency to bring on Indiſpoſitions, Diſeaſes and Diſtempers to Body or Mind. —Apply faithfully the reviving Medicine, the aſſuaging Opiate, and the healing Balſam, to the Sick and Wounded.—It is indeed better to pluck out an Eye, to cut off a Limb and Member, than that the whole Body die, and rot and periſh; yet are they not to be lopped off and deſtroyed, without the moſt abſolute Neceſſity, and

that God is able to preſerve you, if it be his holy Will; and ſhould you die, if you are but in God's Favour, it will be an happy Exchange of Mortality, for Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; of Corruption, for Incorruption.—Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be of good Courage, and let us behave ourſelves valiantly for our People, for our Land, and for the Cities of our God; and let the Lord do that which is good in his Sight.—This is a critical Conjuncture, this is a portentous Interval, that muſt determine much of what unto us is valuable in this miſerable World: Our Lives, our Liberties, our moſt holy Religion, are at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

inſoever you can.—Ye ſee already the vaſt Difference there is in Expeditions, when begun with the Lord, and when with Belial.—The Time was, that Forces came up to us on a ſhadowy Expedition, not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor his Greatneſs upon their Hearts, (ſad Preſages theſe of an unſucceſsful Event, and of blaſted Expectations!) Now you ſee Worſhippers of the Deity, in Spirit and in Truth.—The Time was, that Forces came up to us, without Urim or Thummim, without Prieſt or Levite, to ſhew them the Way of the Lord.—Now ye ſee Prieſts of the Lord, with whom is Urim and Thummim, of which there is one come while I have been ſpeaking, whom I bid welcome in the Name of the Lord.—The Time was, that you heard and ſaw nothing but curſing, ſwearing, drinking, carouſing, dallying, playing, and all Manner of Impiety and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs; now you hear and ſee Prayers put up to the Supreme Being, as conſtantly as the Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice was offered up by the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (Do ye the ſame in your Families?)

the Enemy, that, as they had yet ſomething of Religion, of which others ſeemed to have made a total Abjuration, they ſtood, where others fled; nay, where others dared not to ſet their Feet, they have kept the Field.—So than, if I prognoſticate any Thing aright, the Omens are at preſent inclining to the fortunate Side, and we may, with the Bleſſing of God, hope for ſomething great and good for our Land, to deliver us out of the Hands of our unjuſtly encroaching Enemies.—It may be, that on Account of our Sins, Heaven hath yet more Chaſtiſements for us in ſtore, and that theſe our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who all the While will be but unequally yoked with Unbelievers, being overpowered by hoſtile Force and Numbers, are put to the Worſt; but this I dare propheſy, they ſhall not fall unavenged of our Enemies, nor without making many of them bite the Ground, as an Attonement for the innocent Blood they have ſhed.— And therefore, what I have ſaid once, I ſay again; let us be kind and loving to theſe our Friends and Brethren, as they are to us; and let us lend them an helping Hand when and whereſoever we can.—And the Lord ſpeed and ſucceed them, with his Bleſſing from on High!— Say ye all in your Hearts, Amen, ſo be it.—</p>
