         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A brief Account of the State of the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> Civil and Eccleſiaſtical.</head>
            <p>IT was not very long after the beginning of the former <hi>Century,</hi> That a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Subject of the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by the Allowance, and under the Countenance and Protection of the Supream Authority, did Tranſplant themſelves, Families and Eſtates into the remote Regions of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE firſt Planters were known to be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not only of approved Piety to GOD, but of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Loyalty to the Throne and Government they belonged to, and brought theſe Principles of affection and duty to their Prince into theſe His diſtant Dominions, and their care was to tranſmit the ſame Loyal Principles and Spirit to their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>TO encourage and ſtrengthen them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the many Toils, Hazards and vaſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in Subduing and Planting a Wilderneſs. They were favoured with the Royal Grant of a CHARTER, by which they were veſted with ſeveral Powers, Liberties, and Priviledges for their good Order and Government.</p>
            <p>UNDER the Protection of the Royal CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001896_0003_0FB9D5CB91EE7058"/>
in which they intirely confided for the ſecurity of the Liberties therein granted, they were animated chearfully to undergo, unknown Perils and Hardſhips, which were unavoidable in their firſt Plantations: By which a valuable acceſſion has been made to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the Commerce of <hi>Great Britain</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, without any Charge to the Crown.</p>
            <p>IN the latter end of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, this <hi>Charter</hi> was vacated by a Judgment in the High Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> which Judgment was reſpited till the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, when this Corporation were disfranchiſed, and actually diveſted of all the Powers, Liberties &amp; Priviledges that had been granted to them.</p>
            <p>AFTER the happy Revolution thoſe Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> &amp; Queen <hi>MARY</hi> of Immortal Memory, were pleaſed in their Princely Wiſdom and Grace, by their Royal CHARTER to Unite, and Erect into One Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Colonies of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay, New-Plymouth, &amp;c.</hi> by the Name of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> which was to be Governed by a Governour, Council and Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>BY this Royal CHARTER many valuable Priviledges and Immunities are veſted in the Body of the People inhabiting ſaid Province, their Properties ſecured, and all the Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Liberties of natural Subjects born in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001896_0004_0FB9D5CDB17BBD68"/>
the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> are granted and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.</p>
            <p>HEREBY alſo Powers are veſted in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly of Electing Annually ſuch as ſhall aſſiſt in Council, to Conſtitute and Settle all Civil Officers, under certain Reſtrictions and Reſervations: To Erect Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, To Levy Taxes upon ſaid Inhabitants for the Support of the Government, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Province. And to make Laws from time to time not repugnant to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> for the good Government of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Province by its preſent CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, effectual Proviſion is made to maintain their intire dependence on, and to ſecure in all points the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown.</p>
            <p>THE Nomination and Conſtitution of the Governour, Lieutenant Governour, Secretary, and all Officers of the Admiralty, is wholly reſerved to the Crown.</p>
            <p>THE Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> is wholly in the hands of His Majeſty's Governour, as Captain General.</p>
            <p>ALL Judges and Juſtices, of a Superiour and Inferiour Order, and Sheriffs, to whom the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Laws are Entruſted, are nominated and appointed by the Governour, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Conſent of his Majeſty's Council.</p>
            <p>THE Governour has a Negative upon all Laws, Elections, and Acts of Government of the General Aſſembly and Council.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001896_0005_0FB9D5CF38115138"/>ALL Laws Enacted by the General Aſſembly and approved of by the Governour are to be tranſmitted Home for the Royal Approbation and if diſallowed within the ſpace of Three Years, to be utterly void.</p>
            <p>HIS Majeſty's Liege People of this Province have ſince the Enjoyment of their preſent CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER been expoſed to many inconceivable Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips by two long and bloody Wars with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Salvages, in which with great Unanimity and Alacrity, they have defended theſe His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Dominions with great Expence of Blood and Treaſure.</p>
            <p>THE Inhabitants of this Province have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had a juſt value for their Civil Liberties. But the free and ſecure Enjoyment of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Priviledges, has ever been moſt dear to them: and eſteem'd a plentiful Reward of all the Dangers and Difficulties they have been ſtrugling with, from their firſt Plantation to this Day.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Planters of theſe His Majeſty's Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, were as to their Perſwaſion in Religion, ſuch as in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation were called Puritans, who deſired and ſought, what was in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion a further Reformation, in point of Diſcipline, and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>THAT they and their Poſterity after them might Enjoy the Liberty of their Conſciences in theſe Points, and Worſhip GOD according to their beſt Light, with leſs hazard to themſelves and leſs offence to others, They ſought a place of reſt in theſe remote Regions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001896_0006_0FB9D5D19D395A90"/>NOTWITHSTANDING their conſcientious diſſent from the Church of <hi>England</hi> in ſome leſſer Points, yet in their Removal they paid all juſt Regards to Her, they dutifully askt her Prayers and Bleſſing in their Settlement, &amp; heartily prayed for the Proſperity of Religion in her Communion.</p>
            <p>BY the Care and Zeal of theſe firſt Planters, the Kingdom of CHRIST was firſt Planted in theſe His Majeſty's diſtant Dominions, Churches Erected in their ſeveral Towns &amp; Plantations, in which the Goſpel is Diſpenſed, &amp; the Ordinances of GOD's Houſe, Adminiſtred, without any Terms of Communion, but what according to their beſt <hi>Light,</hi> were plainly preſcribed in the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Doctrines of Faith profeſſed in theſe Churches are entitely <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> moſt agreeable to the Doctrinal Articles and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to the Confeſſions of the Reformed Churches abroad.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>Churches</hi> in point of Diſcipline &amp; Mode of Worſhip are mainly <hi>Congregational</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> of one Profeſſion &amp; Principle, with the United Brethren the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>South-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Uſe and Power of Eccleſiaſtical Councils &amp; Synods is here acknowledged, &amp; the Right not only of the Churches, but alſo the Power of the Civil Government to Convocate ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, when the neceſſities of the Churches ſhall call for them, is Aſſerted.</p>
            <p>IT is required that the Paſtors of theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, be Perſons of approved Sanctity of Life,

Orthodoxy in the Faith, of good Learning and known Miniſterial Abilities: Theſe are Elected by the People, They take the Charge of; &amp; are ſet apart to the Paſtoral Office, by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hands of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO provide for a Succeſſion of ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox &amp; Learned Miniſtry in theſe Churches, <hi>Grammar-Schools</hi> were Erected in the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Towns through the Province, and a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> early was Founded, where the Liberal Arts and Sciences are publickly taught, and nothing required to qualify for Academical Honours, and Priviledges, but a proficiency in Learning and good Morals.</p>
            <p>BY the Favour of Heaven upon this Seminary of Piety, &amp; good Literature, theſe Churches, have hence been fully ſupplied from time to time to this Day, with a well qualified Miniſtry, who have taught them the good Knowledge of GOD.</p>
            <p>THESE Churches, tho' not formed in all points, in exact Conformity to the Eſtabliſht Church of <hi>South-Britain,</hi> yet have their Conſtitution and Priviledges ſecured to them, not barely, by an Act of Toleration, but a Legal Approbation and Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>MANY good Laws have been Enacted by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Aſſembly, by which theſe Churches are Protected &amp; Encouraged in the peaceable and regular Profeſſion &amp; Practice of their Religious Priviledges, their Form of Worſhip, Church Order &amp; Diſcipline. By which alſo the Method of Calling &amp; Setling Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the ſeveral Congregations through the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, is Legally ſtated and eſtabliſhed, and Legal Proviſion made for the Honourable Support and

Maintenance of the Miniſters thus Called &amp; Setled.</p>
            <p>ALL which Laws have been Confirmed, by the Approbation and Sanction of the Crown in the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reign of King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> of Bleſſed Memory.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the Bleſſing of Heaven theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches under their preſent Securities, have greatly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and increaſed, That at the preſent Time, there are above an <hi>Hundred</hi> Religious Aſſemblies and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in this Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> beſides about <hi>Thirty</hi> Aſſemblies of Chriſtianized <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who profeſs the Faith, Order and Worſhip here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in acknowledged.</p>
            <p>AND at the ſame time there are through the whole Province not above <hi>Three</hi> Congregations that in their Form of Worſhip and Diſcipline, profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Perſwaſion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> Though Perſons of that perſwaſion are under no Reſtraints, or Diſcouragements, but are ever Treated with all Chriſtian Reſpect.</p>
            <p>IT muſt in Juſtice be affirmed to the Honour of theſe Churches of the <hi>Congregational</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Denomination, that there is not one Miniſter or one ſingle Perſon known in their Communion, but what are full of Duty, Zeal and Affection to the Succeſſion of the Crown in the Illuſtrious Proteſtant Houſe of <hi>HANOVER,</hi> and do account themſelves under the ſtrongeſt ties, to Bleſs GOD for the happy Acceſſion of His preſent Majeſty King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> to the Throne of his Anceſtors, and both Paſtors and People do utterly abhor the late Impious and Rebellious attempts, to diſturb His Peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. They Adore and Praiſe the Hand of Heaven in giving ſuch a ſignal Blaſt to the deſigns of thoſe wicked Sons of Violence. And their Prayers are ever going up, for the long Life and Proſperity of His Majeſty, and the whole Royal Family.</p>
