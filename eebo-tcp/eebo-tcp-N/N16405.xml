            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOUR <hi>Creator endued you with shining talents, and cast your lot in a field of action, where they might be most happily employed: In the progress of a long and industrious life, you devoted them to a single purpose, the elevation of your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter above his. For the accomplishment of this purpose, with a diligence and uniformity which would have adorned the most virtuous pursuits, you opposed truth, religion, and their authors, with sophistry, contempt, and  obloquy; and taught, as far as your example or sentiments extended their influence, that the chief end of man was, to slander his God, and abuse him forever. To whom could such an effort as the following be dedicated, with more propriety, than to you. The subject it cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates is the most pointed attack upon your old enemies; an attack more happily devised, at least, than any of yours; as yours were more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concerted than the efforts of any of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors. Reasoning is an unhappy engine to be employed against christianity; as, like elephants in ancient war, it usually, in this case, turns upon those who employ it. Ridicule is a more convenient weapon, as you have successfully evinced; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious

               <l>ERE yet the Briton left our happy shore,</l>
               <l>Or war's alarming clarion ceas'd to roar,</l>
               <l>What time the morn illum'd her purple flame,</l>
               <l>Thro' air's dread wilds the prince of darkness came.</l>
               <l>A cloud his gloomy car; his path around,</l>

               <l>Before him dragons wound their bloody spires;</l>
               <l>Far shot behind him death's Tartarean fires:</l>
               <l>To image heaven's high state, he proudly rode,</l>
               <l>Nor seem'd he less than hell's terrific God.</l>
               <l>While, full before him, dress'd in beauteous day,</l>
               <l>The realms of freedom, peace, and virtue lay;</l>

               <l>Shall bid new Edens dress this dreary ball;</l>
               <l>He frown'd; the world grew dark; the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains shook,</l>
               <l>And nature shudder'd as the spirit spoke.</l>

                     <p>Such advantages does Infidelity enjoy over Revelation, that both sides of moral questions will equally support that, and weaken this. Thus one Infidel will overthrow Revelation by proving that there is not one honest man living; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other will as successfully attack it by asserting, and the assertions of Infidels are always to be taken for proofs, that there are honest men of all religions and opinions. One sees intuitively that God never did, nor can, reveal his pleasure to mankind. Another finds the Koran and Shahstan in the list of Revelations. Plato's devotion of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a courtizan, and Socrate's to Alcibiades were the effusions of honest, virtuous hearts; but Paul's dedication of his life to the Redeemer was a reverse of enthusiasm. God also, tho' dishonoured by adoration, presented to him in the character of a holy sin-hating God, and incapable of being pleased, when invoked in the name of Jesus Christ, is yet glorified, when honest votaries address him, in the elevated character of an ox, an onion, or a snake, and is highly delighted with invocations, when offered in the pleasing and prevailing name of the devil.</p>

Which yields, to heaven, the soul from guilt refin'd,</l>
               <l>And, tho' it mars the devils, mends mankind.</l>
               <l>And thus the matter stands. When God makes man,</l>
               <l>He makes him <hi>here</hi> religious, if he can;</l>
               <l>If he cannot, he bids him farther go,</l>

               <l>But as his failure is his fault, ordains</l>
               <l>His soul to suffer dire repentance' pains,</l>
               <l>Repentance, fearful doom of sinners vile!</l>
               <l>The law's whole curse, and nature's highest ill!</l>
               <l>If there the wretch repent, the work is done;</l>
               <l>If not, he plunges to a lower zone,</l>
               <l>A lower still, and still a lower, tries,</l>
               <l>'Till with such sinking tir'd, he longs to rise;</l>
               <l>And finding there the fashion to repent,</l>
               <l>He joins the throng, and strait to heaven is sent.</l>
               <l>Heaven now his own he claims; nor can the sky</l>
               <l>Preserve its honour, and its claim deny.</l>
               <l>Thus stands the fact; and if the proof should fail,</l>
               <l>Let Heaven, next time, some better proof reveal.</l>
               <l>I've done my part; I've given you here the pith;</l>
               <l>The rest, the bark and sap, I leave to *****</l>

            <lg>

               <l>Roll'd up to heaven, and roar'd the plains along;</l>
               <l>Conscience, a moment, ceas'd her stings to rear,</l>
               <l>And joy excessive whelm'd each rising fear.</l>

               <l>Spread out fell sin; and all her horrors bar'd;</l>

               <l>More freely cheated, lied, defam'd, and swore;</l>
               <l>Nor wish'd the night to riot, drink, or whore;</l>
               <l>Look'd up, and hiss'd his God; his parent stung,</l>
               <l>And sold his friend, and country, for a song.</l>
               <l>The new-fledg'd infidel of modern brood</l>
