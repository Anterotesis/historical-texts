            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>POLEMICK Writers, or Books of Controverſy, eſpecially upon religious Subjects, are not in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agreeable to the prevaling Diſpoſition of the preſent Age: And it muſt be acknowledged that an enquiring Mind is too often diſappointed in the Peruſal of ſuch Works. It frequently happening that Perſons who engage in diſputable Points are either biaſſed by their Education, or elſe act from Prepoſſeſſion; and inſtead of ſincerely endeavouring to promote Truth in its Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, they labor to maintain the Doctrines of a Party, or the Principles of their Education, which perhaps they have implicitly aſſented to, and deem Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals in Religion, tho' they have never impartially examined into their Validity.</p>
            <p>There are ſcarce any People who have been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attacked than thoſe called <hi>Quakers;</hi> or whoſe Principles have, thro' the Ignorance or Malevolence of their Adverſaries, been more groſly miſrepreſented.— 'Tis not long ſince a Treatiſe made its Appearance in this Part of the World under a <hi>ſpecious Title,</hi> probably
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:007983_0003_102DC8DC34537260"/>
with a View to obtain Readers or vend large Numbers of ſo <hi>extraordinary a Performance.</hi>—The Author aſſerts that <hi>the</hi> Quaker <hi>Doctrine of Water Baptiſm is conſidered, their Objections anſwered, and the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England <hi>upon that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Point ſtated and vindicated.</hi>—The following Sheets contain an Anſwer to that Treatiſe, which we recommend to the ſerious Peruſal of every impartial and judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>Our Antagoniſt pretends in his Preface that his only Motive for entering into the Enquiry was to obtain Satisfaction to himſelf upon the Doctrine of Water Baptiſm; and that he had no Thoughts of appearing in Print: From which, we ſuppoſe, he would have us conclude that he was a ſincere Seeker after Truth, and entered into the Enquiry free from Bias or Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice: But whether he commenced his Enquiry upon this Bottom muſt be left to his own Conſcience. Tho' if to miſcite or mutilate the Quotations he brings from the Writings of thoſe whom he oppoſes, and to inſert them as fair and genuine, be Evidences of the Contrary, our Opponent is, we think, highly culpable; and which we conceive will evidently appear on Peruſal of the enſuing Sheets.—Is it not hard to know what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principles this Author is of? For, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he affects to advocate for the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> does he not advance Doctrine contrary thereto, when he ſays, <hi>It, Water Baptiſm,</hi> is made one of the Conditions upon the Performance whereof eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:007983_0004_102DC8DEC79033F8"/>
is to be obtained? Do not Proteſtants deny that Water Baptiſm is <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' Papiſts ſay none can be ſaved without it?</p>
            <p>Our Adverſary's Notion of Water Baptiſm ſeems ſomewhat like the Papiſts Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation: <hi>They ſay</hi> the Bread after Conſecration is the real Body of Chriſt; <hi>He ſuggeſts</hi> that Water duly adminiſtred waſhes the moſt inveterate and malignant Diſeaſes from the Soul. Is not this to make the Water ſpiritual, or to add ſome Virtue it had not before? It being evident that elementary Water cannot reach the Soul.</p>
            <p>How lamentable is it that Men will not ſtudy to be quiet and mind their own Buſineſs: Were they to act in their proper Sphere they might be of Uſe to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. —And if Divinity or the right Knowledge of the ſaving Truths of the Goſpel were to be attained by human Study, as the Laws of Nations are, our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent might probably have obtained the Character of <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Wiſe:</hi> But as he appears ſo great a Stranger to the experimental Knowledge of the Nature, End and Deſign of the Goſpel Diſpenſation, it is no Wonder he has run into ſo many and great Abſurdities reſpecting the Doctrine of Water Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>The Author of this Reply is a plain Man, not practiſed in the Art of Controverſy, nor inclined to Diſputation; but is diffident of his own Abilities and
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:007983_0005_102DC90A396B2C48"/>
Qualifications for ſuch Undertakings; and nothing ſhort of an Apprehenſion of Duty and good Will to Mankind was his Inducement to appear in Print. We think he has treated our Antagoniſt with Coolneſs and Moderation, and avoided unfair Deductions.—And if any Thing herein written ſhould contribute towards informing the Ignorant or Unprejudiced, or tend to remove Stumbling-Blocks out of the Way of the Weak, the Deſign of the Author will in great Meaſure be anſwered.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE LAYMAN'S Treatiſe on Baptiſm.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author, here to be anſwered, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces his Complaint, againſt <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> with a Perverſion of his Words, in adding the Word <hi>[Utter]</hi> Strangers, inſtead of
<q>how much Strangers to, and averſe from, that true and acceptable Worſhip that is performed in the Spirit of Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ROBERT BARCLAY, in his Apology, (Page 411) after he has mentioned ſome Expreſſions, of which our Opponent has taken Notice, in his firſt Page, makes the following Remark:
<q>Which Zeal, <hi>ſays he,</hi> if they would but ſeriouſly examine it, they would find to be but the Prejudice of Education, and the Love of Self more than that of God or his pure Worſhip; this is verified concerning thoſe Things which are called Sacraments.</q>
And then the Author, by another Perverſion of his Words, ſaith,
<q>which are empty Shaddows, and mere out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007983_0007_102DC90FC24CCA78"/>
Things, and not commanded by Chriſt, nor any Way neceſſary to Salvation.</q>
All which I readily grant him, but would have him ſpeak the Truth, and render others Words as they are. <hi>See Apology, Page</hi> 411.</p>
            <p>HE confeſſeth, that if what is here ſaid of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be true, the Church of <hi>England</hi> falls very juſtly under the Cenſure before complained of. The Queſtion with me is not what Church or Society falls under that Cenſure, but what is agreeable to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Truth and ſound Reaſon in this important Point; and in Order to give a Reaſon to ſuch as aſketh us of the Hope that is in us, in Meekneſs and Fear:
<q>Firſt we believe that there is but one Baptiſm, as well as but one Lord, one Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Apology, Page 413.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>SECONDLY, that this one Baptiſm, which is the Baptiſm of Chriſt, is not a Waſhing with, or Dipping in Water, but a being baptiſed with the Spirit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>THIRDLY, that the Baptiſm with <hi>elementary Water</hi> was but a Figure of the <hi>ſpiritual Baptiſm;</hi> and therefore the Figure muſt give Place to the Subſtance, and when the Subſtance is enjoyed, the Figure ceaſeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the Truth of our Principles, <q>that there is but one Baptiſm to continue in the Church of Chriſt, there needs no other Proof than theſe Words, <hi>Epheſians,</hi> iv. 5. One Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm; where the Apoſtle plainly affirms that as there is but one Lord, one Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo there is but one Baptiſm. Apology 414.</q> And the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, being an Ordinance of Chriſt, by which, according to the Scriptures of

               </hi> the one ſaving Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>KNOW <hi>ye not that the Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God, and ſuch were ſome of you; but ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> 1 Corinthians, vi. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>AND now according to the Acknowledgement of the nameleſs Author the Subſtance of the Controverſy depends upon this, Whether Chriſt inſtituted a Water Baptiſm in his Church as a ſtanding Ordinance, or not.</p>
            <p>FOR Confirmation of his Water Argument (Page 4) he cites <hi>Matthew,</hi> xxviii. 19. <hi>Go ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and teach all Nations, baptiſing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> From which he boldly aſſerts two poſitive Duties are enjoyned, to wit, the Duty of Teaching, and the Duty of Baptiſing; but the Reader will find that the Text doth not ſay, teach and baptiſe (which according to his Definition it ſhould have done) but teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions baptiſing them <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But herein he explains this Text contrary to moſt of the approved Authors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for they ſay it ſhould be, go ye therefore and diſciple all Nations by baptiſing them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well knowing that if they admit of the Word (Teach) according to the Text, it makes againſt the Baptiſm of Infants, they being incapable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007983_0009_102E0CF087B9E7C0"/>
of being Taught; and altho' this Author ſaith in his Preface, that he hath on Purpoſe avoided ſaying any Thing of Infant Baptiſm: Yet <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> with whom he is contending, ſaith,
<q>It is a meer human Tradition, for which neither Precept nor Practice is to be found in all the Scriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND indeed that Text will make againſt him in that there is no Water there mentioned, or that can by any neceſſary Conſequence be deduced thence. And as a certain Author of Note obſerves,
<q>The Commiſſion there to baptiſe is not into the <hi>Water,</hi> but into the <hi>Name</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> (as the Word frequently ſignifies in the Scripture) <hi>of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> and this Interpretation is ſtrongly ſupported by Verſe 18. <hi>All Power,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>is given unto me in Heaven and Earth,</hi> where Power and Name (Verſe 19) are of the ſame Import: And likewiſe by <hi>Acts,</hi> i. 5. <hi>John truly,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>baptiſed with Water, but ye ſhall be baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt not many Days hence:</hi> Compare with Verſe 8. <hi>Ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> Power, <hi>after that the Holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be Witneſſes unto me both in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and in all</hi> Judea, <hi>and in</hi> Samaria, <hi>and unto the uttermoſt Part of the Earth.</hi>
               </q>
Thus far <hi>Joſeph Beſſe,</hi> from R. C's <hi>Lux Evangelica Atteſtata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> obſerves, in Page 437,
<q>Altho' it ſhould be granted, that for a Seaſon they did ſo far miſtake the Commiſſion, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. as to judge that Water belonged to that Baptiſm (which, however, I find no Neceſſity of granting;) yet I ſee not any great Abſurdity would thence follow, for it is plain they did miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take that Commiſſion, as to the main Part of it,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007983_0010_102E0CF21F139CB8"/>
for a Seaſon, as where he bids them go teach all Nations, ſince ſome Time after they judged it unlawful to teach the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yea <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſcrupled it, until by a Viſion conſtrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for which, after he had done it, he was for a Seaſon (until they were better informed) judged by the reſt of his Brethren. Now if the Education of the Apoſtles, as <hi>Jews,</hi> and their Propenſity to adhere and ſtick to the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> did ſo far influence them, that, even after Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the pouring forth of the Spirit, they could not receive or admit of the teaching of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tho' Chriſt in his Commiſſion to them commanded them to preach to them; what further Abſurdity were it to ſuppoſe, that thro' the like Miſtake, the chiefeſt of them having been the Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> and his Baptiſm being ſo much prized there among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they alſo took Chriſt's Baptiſm (intended by him of the Spirit) to be that of Water which was <hi>John</hi>'s, and accordingly practiſed it for a Seaſon. It ſuffices us that if they were ſo miſtaken (tho' I ſay not that they were ſo) they did not always remain under that Miſtake, elſe <hi>Peter</hi> would not have ſaid of the Baptiſm which now ſaves, that it is not <hi>a putting away</hi> of the Filth of the Fleſh, which certainly Water Baptiſm is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Opponent, in Page 6 and 7, brings ſeveral Scriptures to prove the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt on the Apoſtles at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> which in my Opinion, are a Confirmation of the Truth of that which he cannot deny, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was a Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire: But he labors afterwards to confine that glorious
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007983_0011_102E0CF53346CCF0"/>
Goſpel Privilege to the Days of the Apoſtles only, and to prove that the Baptiſm of the Holy Spirit is now ceaſed; and the eaſier to impoſe upon his Readers, cites much of the 11th Chapter of <hi>Acts,</hi> till he comes to the 39 Verſe, which is, <hi>For the Promiſe is to you and to your Children, and to all that are a-far off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> not conſidering likewiſe, <hi>that no Man can</hi> (knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and experimentally) <hi>ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would have the Reader obſerve his Argument in his 7th Page, where he makes this Remark:
<q>Now the Baptiſm in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, being one of the Conditions upon which the Holy Ghoſt is promiſed, the Condition muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the Promiſe is to be fulfilled.</q>
But how he will make this Doctrine agree with the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> when at the Houſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> for my Part I cannot ſee; but think that this one Inſtance is enough to lay waſte his whole Building. See <hi>Acts,</hi> x. 44. <hi>While</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpake theſe Words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the Word;</hi> and after this it was that <hi>he commanded them to be baptiſed in the Name</hi> of the Lord, Verſe 48. So that it is evident that the Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>viz.</hi> the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, was powerfully received by the efficatious Miniſtry of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> before the Adminiſtration of elementary Water was performed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus: And therefore I would hope the Author will take Heed leaſt he be found darkening Council with Words without true Knowledge, and not only not entering himſelf but hindering thoſe that are about to enter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007983_0012_102E0CF881317F08"/>THAT the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were baptiſed with a different Baptiſm from that of the Holy Ghoſt, as our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent ſaith, Page 8, we freely grant; and that it was ſuch a Baptiſm as fell ſhort of giving <hi>the Anſwer of a good Conſcience in the Sight of God,</hi> appears very plain in the ſame Chapter, from the Inſtance of <hi>Simon.</hi> For notwithſtanding he was baptiſed with Water, yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to him, <hi>Acts,</hi> viii. 23. <hi>I perceive thou art in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity.</hi> Now if this Water Baptiſm had had that Virtue in it, which this Author hereafter urges from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> I ſhould think that it would have broken <hi>Simon</hi>'s Bond of Iniquity and taken away his Gall of Bitterneſs, which it ſeems it did not, and therefore cannot be the Baptiſm commanded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to <hi>Mark,</hi> xvi. 16. He that believeth and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved; and to ſay that he was in a State of Salvation, and yet in the Bond of Iniquity at the ſame Time, would be a Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Terms.</p>
            <p>AS to what this Author ſaith, Page 9 and 10, concerning <hi>Philip</hi>'s baptiſing the Eunuch with Water, take the Reply of <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> in the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Letter, Page 47.
<q>That <hi>Philip</hi> baptiſed the Eunuch with Water we queſtion not, but that he baptiſed him in Purſuance to Chriſt's Command, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. we do not believe can ever be proved. It ſeems moſt probable by the concurring Circumſtances to have been in Relation to <hi>John</hi>'s Dipenſation. Firſt, it does not appear that the Action ſprang from any Motion in <hi>Philip,</hi> but from the Eunuch's Requeſt: <hi>See here is Water, what hindreth me to be baptiſed?</hi> Which Words
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007983_0013_102E0CFC2F5D4650"/>
ſhew that the Eunuch underſtood that Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was then in Uſe, which he well might being himſelf a Proſelyte to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, on the Account of which he had then been at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he could not eaſily miſs of being informed of the ſo noted Adminiſtration of Water Baptiſm by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. And it is evident that <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was in Practice a long Time after that. See <hi>Acts,</hi> xix. 3. Secondly, the prerequiſite Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for the Reception thereof agrees with that of <hi>John</hi>'s: A Belief in Chriſt was the Terms upon which the Eunuch was baptiſed: When <hi>John</hi> baptiſed he ſaid unto the People that they ſhould believe on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Acts,</hi> xix. 4. Thirdly, <hi>Philip</hi>'s anſwering ſo cooly in the permiſſive Form [Thou mayeſt] denotes it to be a Matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, and not that which Chriſt had ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly enjoyned. <hi>Matthew,</hi> xxviii. 19. and <hi>Mark,</hi> xvi. 16.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the Caſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> mentioned Page 10, after his Converſion, <hi>Acts,</hi> ix. I would have the Reader obſerve how the Author, in Order to evade the Scope of the Text, leaves out Verſe 17, where it is ſaid, <hi>And Annanias went his way, and entered into the Houſe, and putting his Hands on him, ſaid Brother</hi> Saul, <hi>the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared to thee in the Way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me that thou mighteſt receive thy Sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> From which it is evident that <hi>Paul</hi> was filled with the Holy Ghoſt by Virtue of this Meſſage, and <hi>Annanias,</hi> who was not one of the twelve Apoſtles, was made the Inſtrument. But the Author has, in the Margin, referred the Reader to <hi>Gallatians</hi> i. 11.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007983_0014_102E0CFDCCD6E938"/>
to 17. which I hope was not done with Deſign to pervert <hi>Paul</hi>'s Meaning, but to draw from thence ſome Pretence of Argument: Tho' he muſt be a weak Reader who cannot ſee his Confuſion when <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words are fairly ſtated; Verſe 11 and 12. <hi>But I certifie you Brethren that the Goſpel which was preached of me is not after Man; for I neither received it of Man, neither was I taught it but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which Text is very plain that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpake poſitively of his Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, and it hath no Reference to the Manner in which he was baptiſed.</p>
            <p>AS to what he urges, Page 11, of <hi>Peter</hi>'s baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> with Water, after they had received the Holy Ghoſt, he muſt have forgot his Aſſertion in Page 7, where he makes a being baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus ſo neceſſary a Condition of the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt that it muſt be performed before the Promiſe is to be fulfilled. For here it is evident they had received the Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, before they were baptiſed in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>AND is it not manifeſt, from this Text, to every unprejudiced Reader, that Water Baptiſm is not neceſſary to Salvation; for it is undeniable that when they had received the Holy Ghoſt they were in a State of Salvation, and Water Baptiſm, with which they had not been baptiſed, could not put them in that State.</p>
            <p>AND obſerve, the Apoſtle puts the Queſtion, <hi>Can any Man forbid,</hi> &amp;c. and that being an Appeal to the Judgement of Men, concerning the Fitneſs or Unfitneſs of the Thing, one would think he would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007983_0015_102E0D00D9E7D218"/>
not have done it had it been a plain and poſitive Duty; which appears to me a good Argument that this cannot be the Baptiſm enjoined, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. But that the being baptiſed in the Name of the Lord was no other than <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm we ſhall endeavour to make appear.</p>
            <p>THE Author, Page 11, cites <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and from thence attempts to prove three different Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>John</hi>'s; ſecondly, In the Name of the Lord; and thirdly, The Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt. And as he has made Choice of that of being baptiſed in the Name of the Lord, for his Foundation to build his Argument upon, for a Water Baptiſm to remain a ſtanding Ordinance in the Church, by Virtue of a Command of Chriſt, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſundry Authorities taken from <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> Page 64, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <q>To make appear that a being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the Name of the Lord was underſtood to be no other than that of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm;' <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſays, <hi>John,</hi> baptiſed in the Name of Chriſt, not in his own Name, for the Remiſſion of Sins.' <hi>Gregory,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Beginning of the third Century, maintains in his Expoſition of <hi>Matthew</hi> iii. 14.

               <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> in his before mentioned Diſcourſe, Page 73, in Anſwer to an Oppoſer much in the ſame Strain with this Author, hath this Remark:
<q>For as much then as upon an impartial Examination, it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly appears not only conſiſtent with the holy Writ but alſo correſpondent with the expreſs Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as laid down by ſundry of her apologetical Theologiſts, and other Proteſtant Writers, that the Water Baptiſm which the Apoſtles uſed was no other than that of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; and that it is too apparent to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (even as this Author himſelf allows) that the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007983_0017_102E0D064D06BF50"/>
Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> is aboliſhed, it therefore naturally follows, as an undeniable Conſequence, from the the Premiſes, that that Baptiſm which the Apoſtles uſed is aboliſhed likewiſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, upon the whole, I doubt not but it will be plain to every unprejudiced Reader, that this Author, by his maintaining the Abolition of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, has quite done the Buſineſs of Water Baptiſm for ever, and laid his own Structure as proſtrate as ever the Image of <hi>Dagon</hi> lay before the Ark of God.</p>
            <p>THE Author aſſerts, in Page 12, that <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in his Apology, Page 431, acknowledges that the Word <hi>baptiſe</hi>
               <q>always ſignifies in Scripture a being baptiſed with Water, and not with the Spirit, when it ſtands ſingly and without other Words to diſtinguiſh the particular Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
But as I have examined that Page and can find nothing that will bear that Conſtruction, I ſhall return it upon him as a falſe Accuſation till he makes it fairly appear.</p>
            <p>HE has riſen to a great Height, Page 14, even to aſſert that Chriſt's Baptiſm was a Water Baptiſm as had been and would be further proved; which, if he means elementary Water, appears to me to be a great Preſumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, for the Satisfaction of the Reader, let us examine his Proofs, as referred to in the Margin: The firſt is <hi>Acts,</hi> ii. 28. <hi>Thou haſt made known to me the Ways of Life; thou ſhalt make me full of Joy with thy Countenance.</hi> This hath not the leaſt Shadow of Proof in it, but quite the contrary, as it refers to inward Communion with God.</p>
            <p>HIS ſecond Proof is <hi>Mark,</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is baptiſed ſhall be ſaved, but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth

not ſhall be damned.</hi> Which will be of no Service to ſupport his Argument, unleſs he can prove the Baptiſm herein mentioned to be a Water Baptiſm. But it is evident to me that this Text ought not to be underſtood of Water Baptiſm, from the following Conſiderations: Firſt, the Caſe of <hi>Simon,</hi> mentioned before, who was, notwithſtanding his being baptiſed with Water, left in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity. As to the Author's Reply to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in his Treatiſe, it will be anſwered in its proper Place. Secondly, that of <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, iii. 21. <hi>The like Figure whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us (not the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as elementary Water can only waſh the Filth of the Fleſh, but not give the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, ſo the Baptiſm which ſaves muſt be that which will <hi>waſh the Heart from Wickedneſs.</hi> Jeremiah, iv. 14. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>waſh thine Heart from Wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> had God for its Author we agree with our Opponent, Page 15, and that it was preparatory to Chriſt: And we further agree with him that it is now ceaſed, as has been obſerved before.</p>
            <p>THAT the Baptiſm of Chriſt hath not only God for its Author, but was inſtituted for much higher and more excellent Ends, we alſo heartily agree; but that it was with outward Water he has not yet proved, and therefore we ſhall deny his Aſſertion in that Reſpect, as it would greatly tend to eclipſing the glorious Goſpel Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14"
                   facs="unknown:007983_0019_102E0D0C8FA26548"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>AND that Baptiſm which is to continue in the Church of Chriſt to the End of the World, and which he will accompany with his Preſence, muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire; as that alone purifies the Heart, and effectually cleanſes from former Defilements, and puts Mankind into a State of Salvation, by becoming true Members of that myſtical Body, of which Chriſt is the Head, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit of God the Father: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unneceſſarily running Men and Women into that frequent Preſumption, of promiſing that for others which they acknowledge they cannot do for themſelves, when they ſtand as God-Fathers and God-Mothers, in executing the Ceremony of Water Baptiſm, according to what the Church of <hi>England</hi> requires.</p>
            <p>I agree with the Author, Page 16, that the Ends for which the Baptiſm of Chriſt and that of <hi>John</hi> were inſtituted are quite different, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſame Baptiſms; but that they were both of Water he has not yet proved, without his bare Aſſertion can be taken for Proof. And that the Difference between theſe two Baptiſms, both in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Effect, is very great, will plainly appear, by conſidering <hi>John</hi>'s to be elementary, Chriſt's to be ſpiritual; the one to be preparatory to Chriſt's Diſpenſation and figurative of his Baptiſm, and the other to be the inward Purgation of the Soul from Sin, by the cleanſing Virtue of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>THE Author, Page 16, brings what he calls a moſt familiar Inſtance of entering into three Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and ſealing them all with Wax, which, in the Concluſion, that he confeſſeth he would willingly have excuſed himſelf the Trouble of ſtating.
<q>But
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007983_0020_102E0D0E2AB17180"/>
as thoſe who deny Water Baptiſm have confounded this Diſtinction and complicated all Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, ſo as if they were one and the ſame, and not to be diſtinguiſhed, he could not allow himſelf to paſs it by altogether.</q>
And ſo by the Way he aſſerts three different Baptiſms, and that Water is the Wax in all of them, as if he intended to impoſe upon his Readers by taking the Point in Diſpute for granted, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt's Baptiſm is a Water Baptiſm, without one clear Scripture Proof: So that Reader, if thou wilt believe him, thou muſt rely upon his own bare Aſſertion, notwithſtanding it contradicts the Scriptures of Truth, and the Judgement of ſeveral approved Writers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for which he would make the World believe that he is now become an Advocate.</p>
            <p>WE deny his Aſſertion that Water is the Wax in theſe three Baptiſms, ſeeing he intends Chriſt's to be one of them; and he might have ſpared his Pains, and ſhuned running into ſo great an Abſurdity.</p>
            <p>AND now I would have the Reader take Notice, that this Author, Page 18, is going about to prove a Difference between the Baptiſm ordained by Chriſt, as a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, and the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, which, if he ſhould do, the whole Point muſt be given up to him; and moſt of the Writers upon the Subject of Baptiſm may put their Hands to their Mouths and ſay, That he has done more than ever could be done before.</p>
            <p>BUT as the Subject is very important, and ought not to be handled careleſly, it will be very proper for us to take good Heed that he doth not impoſe upon us, by endeavouring to limit the Diſpenſations of the Moſt High to Mankind. That the Baptiſm
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007983_0021_102E0D0FCEFDA198"/>
of Chriſt was with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire, is too evident to be denied; and he himſelf cites ſeveral Places of Scripture to prove it; but then endeavours to confine this Privilege to the Days of the Apoſtles only. Which is a taking away the Key of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and falling into the two Evils complained of, of old: <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ii. 13. <hi>They have forſaken me the Fountain of living Waters, and hewed them cut Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns, that can hold no Water.</hi> Now to know whether the pouring forth of the Spirit, on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> was an Accompliſhment, according to this Author (by which I ſuppoſe he means a finiſhing or ending) of the Prophecy of the Prophet <hi>Joel;</hi> or whether it had only fallen out at that Time, and upon thoſe Perſons, agreeable to what that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had foretold ſhould come to paſs in the latter Days upon all the Church of Chriſt, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have the Words of <hi>Peter</hi> fairly ſtated: <hi>Acts,</hi> ii. 16, 17, 18. But this is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> and it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt Days ſaith God, <hi>I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh; and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall prophecy, and your young Men ſhall ſee Viſions, and your old Men ſhall dream Dreams, and on my Servants, and on my Handmaids I will pour out in thoſe Days of my Spirit, and they ſhall prophecy:</hi> And in Verſe 39, before cited, <hi>For the Promiſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are a-far off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> So that the pouring forth of the Spirit, even in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Judgement, muſt be the Privilege of every Chriſtian. Yet this Author affirms, Page 19, That this amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and miraculous Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt is expreſly ſaid by St. <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Accompliſhment

            <p>AND in Order to confine the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt to the Days of the Apoſtles, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it after, he tells us the Meaning thereof, is, being endowed with extraordinary and ſupernatural Gifts; ſuch as a Power to work Miracles, ſpeak with Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this he ſaith, Page 20,
<q>will be more manifeſt by conſidering the Scriptures which ſpeak of thoſe, who, after their Converſion to Chriſtianity, were baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
Herein the Author ſeems hard to be underſtood, without he looks upon Believing and Converſion to be the ſame. It is ſaid indeed of thoſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> that they believed <hi>Philip</hi> preaching; but that they were converted before they were baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, I do not find, and believe he never will be able to prove it.</p>
            <p>AS to his inſiſting upon Miracles, ſee 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> xiv. 22. <hi>Wherefore Tongues are for a Sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.</hi> And that he may ſee how he is joining <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I would have him read <hi>The Proteſtant Anſwered,</hi> in <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Apology, Page 296, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That we need not Miracles, becauſe we preach no new Goſpel, but that which is already confirmed by all the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and that we offer nothing but that which we are ready and able to confirm by the Teſtimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which both already acknowledge to be true.</q>

<q>If the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt was not viſible, how could <hi>Simon</hi> ſee it?</q>
I ſhall anſwer him, in his own Words, in the ſame and the next Page, who aſketh,
<q>How did thoſe of the Circumciſion know that the Holy Ghoſt was fallen on the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Why they heard them ſpeak with Tongues, by which viſible Evidence they were convinced that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had received the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt; by ſome ſuch like Evidence was <hi>Simon</hi> alſo convinced that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had received the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt:</q>
Herein the Author has fully anſwered his own Objection to my Satisfaction. But it looks to me as if he had forgo which Side of the Queſtion he was of, or elſe he would not have contradicted himſelf in ſuch a Manner.</p>
            <p>THE Author, again inſiſting, that being baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt always ſignifies, in Scripture, the being endowed with ſome extraordinary and wonderful Gift; ſuch as a Power to work Miracles, to ſpeak with Tongues, to prophecy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Order to make ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Work of it, that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt has long ſince ceaſed, he ſaith, Page 21, that the Promiſe of Chriſt was <hi>fully accompliſhed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles departed from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how weak, and indeed ridiculous this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of his own Brain muſt make the Practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> appear in the Judgement of all ſuch as conſider it.

Which Prayer, if they that uſe it are of the Opinion of this Author, muſt be Sin; becauſe it cannot be of Faith.</p>

Cloud of Witneſſes againſt him that it is high Time for him to acknowledge, that he hath uttered Words without true Knowledge.</p>
            <p>IN the Bottom of Page 22, this Author aſſerts that <hi>no Perſon,</hi> but the Apoſtles themſelves, could be the inſtrumental Cauſe of the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt; but I have before ſhewn, that <hi>Annanias,</hi> who was not one of the twelve Apoſtles, was the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Paul</hi>'s being baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt; which doth evidently appear by <hi>Acts</hi> ix. 17. <hi>And</hi> Annanias <hi>went his way, and entered into the Houſe, and putting his Hands upon him ſaid, Brother</hi> Saul, <hi>the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee in the Way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me that thou mighteſt receive thy Sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> If he ſhould ſay that this is only a ſingle Inſtance, I anſwer, that one ſingle Inſtance, ſupported by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Authority, is ſufficient to overthrow his whole Building, as it ſtands upon ſo ſandy a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; and I hope there are but few Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who are ſerious in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that will venture to join with him.</p>
            <p>BUT leaſt he ſhould become wiſer in his own Conceit than ſeven Men that can render a Reaſon, I ſhall add ſome further Conſiderations, taken out of <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> Page 168,
<q>That this Doctrine is not inconſiſtent with, but agreeable to what ſeveral Doctors of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have taught. Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> holds that Chriſt's Miniſters were impowered to communicate ſpiritual Gifts: See his Paraphraſe and Annotations on <hi>Acts</hi> i. 5, 11, 38. viii. 17. <hi>Romans</hi> i. 11, 12. Doctor <hi>Burkett,</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> ix. 17. aſſerts, That <hi>Annanias,</hi> tho' but an ordinary and private Chriſtian, yet had Power
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007983_0026_102E0D1C607F0010"/>
to confer the Holy Ghoſt: And on <hi>John</hi> vii. 38. He ſays Chriſt and his Spirit are a living Fountain whoſe Waters never fail; they are not a Water Brook, but a Spring of Waters; we ſhall never miſs of the Waters of Life, if we ſeek unto, and wait upon Chriſt for them, for, <hi>If we believe on him, out of our Bellies ſhall flow Rivers of living Waters,</hi> ſufficient for ourſelves, and therewith to refreſh others.</q>
Which (I think) is, in Effect, to ſay the Miniſters ſhall baptiſe with the Spirit.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL Pages of this Author's Treatiſe ſeem, in my Opinion, to be little elſe but the Product of his own Imaginations, to limit the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt to the Apoſtles only; and his Arguments will amount to little more than this: That the Apoſtles were ſent for to thoſe that were lately convinced of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion, and that upon the laying on of their Hands the Holy Ghoſt was given, or fell on them; but how this doth limit that Favor to the Apoſtles only doth not yet appear, but quite the contrary, in the Caſe of <hi>Annanias</hi> beforementioned. And that the Author may ſee how tickliſh he ſtands, I ſhall add to the foregoing Authorities, as a full Anſwer to what he has aſſerted on this Head, an excellent Paſſage of Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> who ſpeaking concerning <hi>Matthew</hi> iii. 2. <hi>He ſhall baptiſe you with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire,</hi> ſays,
<q>Altho' this was literally ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> yet morally there is more in it, for it is the Sign of the Effects of the Holy Ghoſt, and his Productions on the Soul; and it was an Excellency of our Saviour's Office that he baptiſes all that come to him with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire. For ſo St. <hi>John,</hi> preferring Chriſt's Miſſion and Office before his own, tells the <hi>Jews</hi> (not
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007983_0027_102E0D1EB8D1CAA8"/>
Chriſt's Diſciples) that Chriſt ſhall baptiſe them with Fire and the Holy Ghoſt, that is, all that come to him, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt did, with Water.</q>
               <hi>Libert. of Proph.</hi> Page 231.</p>
            <p>THE Authorities before mentioned are ſo far from confining the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt to thoſe extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit beſtowed on Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Apoſtles Time, as that of Tongues, heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sick, raiſing the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly make it to be that Gift, or Meaſure of the Holy Spirit, which regenerates and renews the Heart, purges the Conſcience, cleanſes from Sin, illuminates the Mind, kindles Zeal and Love both towards God and our Neighbour, warms and influences the Heart with a Senſe of God's Love, raiſes ſpiritual Habits in the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay, in fine, they ſeem to aſcribe thereto the whole Work of Regeneration and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication produced in the Soul from a State of Nature to a perfect Man in a State of Grace.</p>
            <p>THAT the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is not ceaſed, the many excellent Effects and Operations which are appropriate thereunto ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for take away theſe and Chriſtianity itſelf ceaſeth. Wherefore if this Author will abide by his Aſſertion, that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is ceaſed, he muſt renounce all the before cited Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities (and lay by his Common-Prayer-Book, ſince it teacheth to pray for the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt) and thereby, at once, declare himſelf to be neither <hi>Roman-</hi>Catholic, Church of <hi>England-</hi>Man, <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> nor <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> ſince this dark Notion will not agree with the Judgement of either of the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Communities.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007983_0028_102E0D21E54F48E8"/>FROM whence this Author has imbibed ſuch a Notion about the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, as its being ceaſed, ſeems ſtrange; but as it is ſuch an antiſcriptural and antichriſtian Doctrine, it is very neceſſary to be expelled the Regions of Chriſtianity. But is there not Reaſon to fear, that his Envy againſt the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from the ſame Spirit that cauſed <hi>Saul</hi>'s Anger to burn ſo hot againſt <hi>David,</hi> when he ſaid to <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> xx. 31. <hi>As long as the Son of</hi> Jeſſe <hi>liveth thou ſhalt not be eſtabliſhed nor thy Kingdom.</hi> For he no Doubt foreſaw, that his new-found Water Baptiſm could not be eſtabliſhed, without diſannulling that of the Holy Ghoſt and Fire; but his Endeavour to effect that, has run him into great Abſurdities. For is it not ſurpriſing, that a Man profeſſing himſelf to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould tell the World, in Print, that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is long ſince ceaſed; when at the ſame Time, not only the Rubrick of the ſaid Church enjoins every Congregation, wherever the Common-Prayer-Book takes Place, at the Adminiſtration of public Baptiſm, to pray for the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, but alſo ſince ſeveral learned Biſhops, Theologiſts, and approved Authors of moſt Chriſtian Societies, are ſo pathetic, clear, and expreſs in maintaining the Continuance of the ſame, as a Thing abſolutely neceſſary for every true Believer to experience, in Order to their eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>'TIS indeed ſtrange that Men in their right Senſes, ſhould loſe themſelves ſo in Confuſion, that whilſt they oppoſe the religious Principles of others, they ſhould proclaim themſelves Antagoniſts to the chief Doctrines of their own Church.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:007983_0029_102E0D2483E1CE10"/>THE Premiſes duly conſidered, I doubt not but it will appear plain to every unbiaſſed Reader, that the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is ſo far from being ceaſed, that it is that whereby Chriſt our Lord bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes all his Diſciples, every true Chriſtian, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which none can be ſaved; and conſidering it as ſuch, 'tis certainly moſt agreeable to conclude, that that was the very Baptiſm commanded, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. 19.</p>
            <p>AND moreover, ſince this Author, Page 27, would make the (ſuppoſed) Ceſſation of the Spirit's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm a deciſive Argument to prove that the Baptiſm enjoined, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. was a Water Baptiſm: The Proof of the Non-Ceſſation or Continuance of the Spirit's Baptiſm muſt, by the ſame Parity of Reaſon, be a deciſive Argument to prove that the Baptiſm commanded, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. is that of the Spirit, eſpecially ſeeing there is but one Baptiſm to continue in the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſians</hi> iv. 5.</p>
            <p>THIS Author ſaith, Page 28, That he agrees with <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> in his Argument drawn from <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> iv. 5. that there is but one Baptiſm; but ſaith, he cannot agree with him that this one Baptiſm (which is the Baptiſm of Chriſt) is not a Waſhing with Water but a being baptiſed with the Spirit. And yet he allows, that the one Baptiſm mentioned <hi>Epheſians</hi> iv. 5. is the ſame with the Baptiſm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Matthew</hi> 21. and that it is the Baptiſm of Chriſt, he don't deny; ſo that as it hath been proved already that the Baptiſm of Chriſt is that of the Spirit, not only according to Scripture, but by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſeveral famous Writers, there needs no other Proof now than this, That the one Baptiſm is not a Water Baptiſm, and then his whole Building
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007983_0030_102E0D26E6273A28"/>
muſt of Conſequence fall to the Ground. And altho' he ſaith that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Arguments are not ſatisfactory to him, yet as they are ſo clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they may prove ſatisfactory to others: Apology, Page 419.
<q>That the one Baptiſm of Chriſt is not a Waſhing with Water, appears from 1 <hi>Peter</hi> iii. 21. <hi>The like Figure whereunto even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us (not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So plain a Definition of Baptiſm is not to be found in all the Bible, and therefore ſeeing it is ſo plain it may very well be preferred to all the coined Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Schoolmen. The Apoſtle tells, <hi>firſt negatively,</hi> what it is not, <hi>viz.</hi> not a putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh; then ſurely it is not a Waſhing with Water, ſince that is ſo. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he tells us, affirmatively, what it is, <hi>viz.</hi> the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. Where he affirmatively defines it to be the Anſwer (or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as the <hi>Syriack</hi> Verſion hath it) of a good Conſcience. Now this Anſwer cannot be but where the Spirit of God hath purified the Soul, and the Fire of his Judgment hath burnt up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Nature; and thoſe in whom this Work is wrought, may be truely ſaid to be baptiſed with the Baptiſm of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Spirit and of Fire.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT this Author, Page 34, ſeems to be offended with <hi>Barclay</hi> for ſaying that this Place is the plaineſt Definition of Baptiſm in the Bible. This he denies, and propoſes, as equally plain, ſundry other Paſſages of Scripture; as <hi>John</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Except a Man be born
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007983_0031_102E0D2AADCC5998"/>
of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> And <hi>Titus</hi> iii. 4, 5. <hi>But after the Kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour towards Man, appeared not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us by the Waſhing of Regeneration and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And then he labors to maintain that all theſe Scriptures are agreeable to thoſe Expreſſions of the Church Catechiſm, The outward and viſible Sign, and the inward and ſpiritual Grace. And then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. and ſaith, Belief, or being born of the Spirit, or the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, or the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, or the inward and ſpiritual Grace, is made one of the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Parts; and the being born of Water, or the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, or the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Regeneration, or the outward and viſible Sign, is made the other and leſs neceſſary Part of the ſame Baptiſm. Now I would have the Reader conſider how this Author has been laboring to prove the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Holy Ghoſt to be long ſince ceaſed; and yet now he allows the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt to be the moſt neceſſary Part of the Baptiſm of Chriſt (which is granting the Point to us, that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is not ceaſed) and that at moſt Baptiſm with Water is but one of the leſs neceſſary Parts of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>AND ſince he has been ſo kind to furniſh me with the before-mentioned Scriptures, and allow them to be equally plain and deſcriptive of the ſame Thing with that, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> iii. 21. mentioned by <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew that they are good Arguments for us againſt him. See <hi>Joſeph Beſſe,</hi> Page 293.
<q>The Waſhing of Regeneration and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007983_0032_102E0D2C4ADF3BD0"/>
the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt mentioned <hi>Titus</hi> iii. 5. ſignifying but one and the ſame purifying Virtue of the Spirit: An Expreſſion like that in <hi>John</hi> iii. 5. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>' Which Text <hi>Calvin</hi> thus interprets: "'Tis an Error in thoſe, who, becauſe they hear the Name of Water, think that Kind of Baptiſm to be made mention of in this Place. For when Chriſt had explained to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the Corruption of Nature, and taught him the Neceſſity of a new Birth, becauſe <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> dreamt of being born again bodily, Chriſt declares in this Place the Manner how God doth regenerate us, to wit, by Water and the Spirit, as if he had ſaid by the Spirit, which in cleanſing and watering the Souls of the Faithful performs as it were the Office of Water: I take therefore Water and the Spirit ſimply for the Spirit, which is as Water; nor is this any new Way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it is like that which is uſed in <hi>Matthew</hi> iii. <hi>He that cometh after me,</hi> he it is that baptiſeth <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire.</hi> So then as to baptiſe with the Holy Ghoſt and Fire is to give the Holy Ghoſt, which in Regeneration hath the Office and Nature of Fire; ſo to be born again of Water and the Spirit, is nothing elſe but to receive that Virue of the Spirit which effecteth the ſame Thing in the Soul as Water doth in the Body. I know that ſome otherwiſe interpret that Text, but that this is the genuine Senſe I have no Doubt or Queſtion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Author, in Page 30, ſays,
<q>It has been proved that Chriſt did inſtitute a Water Baptiſm different from <hi>John</hi>'s;</q>
and from this Suppoſition
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007983_0033_102E0D2DE6C9A830"/>
denies <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Argument to prove the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine contained in the Propoſition; but where, or what his Proof is, I cannot find, without his bare Aſſertion (from the Imagination of his own Brain, in Oppoſition to moſt or all that have wrote on the Subject of Water Baptiſm) is taken for Proof, which, in my Opinion, proves nothing: And therefore he might have forborn quarrelling with <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> Page 31, for calling <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm <hi>the</hi> Water Baptiſm, in as much as it hath not, nor cannot be proved from Scripture, that there was more than two Water Baptiſms then in Uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s. And that Chriſt's Baptiſm is not <hi>John</hi>'s, we freely grant; but that Chriſt's Baptiſm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, is a Water Baptiſm, we do deny; and have ſufficiently proved the contrary. And even according to this Author's own Doctrine, if he ſhould have his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before cited allowed him, the moſt that he can make of Water Baptiſm is, that it is but one of the leſs neceſſary Parts of the one true Baptiſm which ſaves. And that he could not do without running into that groſs Abſurdity (often attempted by others when pinched) of taking the Baptiſm of the Spirit for one Part, and elementary Water for the other Part, to make the one Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>BUT as <hi>Joſiah Foſter</hi> obſerves, Page 123,
<q>It is an inconteſtible Point, that the Baptiſm with Water and the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt are two different Baptiſms and diſtinct from each other; and the Apoſtle aſſerts no more than one Baptiſm in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Epheſians</hi> iv. 5. it muſt be allowed to be one of the two.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:007983_0034_102E0D305121C5D0"/>
               <q>To maintain it to be the firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, would be diametrically oppoſite to <hi>Matthew</hi> iii. 2. <hi>Mark</hi> i. 8. <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 16, 17. and <hi>John</hi> i. 33. which Texts declare Chriſt's Baptiſm to be the Second, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Spirit; and it would be erroneous to ſuppoſe the Apoſtle intended any other but Chriſt's Baptiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it is worthy of Obſervation, that this Author has run himſelf into a Round of Confuſion: Firſt, to plead that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt has long ſince ceaſed: Secondly to argee with <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> that there is but one Baptiſm: Thirdly, to agree that the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is the moſt neceſſary Part of the Baptiſm of Chriſt, and that Water is one of the leſs neceſſary Parts of the ſame Baptiſm of Chriſt: And Fourthly, to ſay that he has proved that Chriſt did inſtitute a Water Baptiſm, different from <hi>John</hi>'s, as a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church; ſo now he has need of equivocal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of which he has falſly accuſed <hi>Robert Barclay.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:007983_0035_102E0D3358B9A6A0"/>THE Author, in Page 33, ſays, 'Enough has been ſaid already about <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s confounding the Diſtinction between Water Baptiſms, by his uſing the Word <hi>the</hi> Water Baptiſm, inſtead of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm;' but I ſee no Reaſon but that <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay</hi> meant any Water Baptiſm, and had no View of equivocating with the Water Baptiſm he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſet up under the Name of Chriſt's Water Baptiſm, and I apprehend that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Arguments ſtand good againſt him.</p>
            <p>AND his own Arguments will reſolve in this, that at moſt Water Baptiſm is but the leſs neceſſary Part of the one ſaving Baptiſm; and as he grants <hi>John</hi>'s Water Baptiſm to be ceaſed, we ſhall deny any Water Baptiſm to be to continue as a ſtanding Ordinance in the Church of Chriſt, by Virtue of a Command of Chriſt. But he obſerves, in the ſame and the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 page">

               </gap> Page, that as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s other Argument to prove that Chriſt's Baptiſm, which now continues is not a Water Baptiſm, are taken from ſeveral Texts of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, in which are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

This is indeed very good Caution, and if he had kept to it himſelf he would not have run into the frequent Perverſion I have before ſhewn.</p>
            <p>AND ſince we are to enter upon the Examination of thoſe Texts with ſo much Caution, I would have the Reader carefully examine whether he makes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Subſtance of them prove any Thing further than what I have mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Belief, or

being born of the Spirit, or the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, or a Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, or the inward and ſpiritual Grace, is made one and the moſt neceſſary Part; and the being born of Water, or the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, or the Waſhing of Regeneration, or the outward and viſible Sign (which he ſays are all Phraſes of the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) is made the other and leſs neceſſary Part of the ſame Baptiſm. And as he allows that that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm which is by the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, is the moſt neceſſary Part of the one Baptiſm, we ſhall not allow him the Liberty of confounding that of the Spirit with that of Water. For according to 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> xii. 13. <hi>By one Spirit are we all baptiſed into one Body, whether we be</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles, <hi>whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi> But according to this Doctrine it makes the Apoſtle confuſed and inconſiſtent with himſelf (as our Opponent is) to hold two Baptiſms, for it is undeniable that the Apoſtle here aſſerted the Baptiſm of the Spirit. And as <hi>Joſiah Foſter</hi> obſerves, in Page 124,
<q>As the Apoſtle told the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> there is one Body and one Baptiſm; ſo he told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that by one Spirit they were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed into one Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Opponent ſaith, Page 35,
<q>That theſe Words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> prove nothing more than what the other Texts do, <hi>viz.</hi> That the outward Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Water Baptiſm is neceſſary, but not ſo neceſſary as the Anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without which, in the Sight of God, the outward Adminiſtration will avail nothing.</q>
Which indeed would have been a good Confeſſion if he had put the Words <hi>not neceſſary</hi> after Water Baptiſm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>is neceſſary.</hi>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>BUT now he proceeds, and ſays, That Chriſt who is gone into Heaven hath put that Virtue into Baptiſm that by it we are ſaved; ſo ſay I: But if he means Water Baptiſm it is denied, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſufficently proved. The Subſtance of what remains in the 35 Page, ſeems to be comprehended in this, That in Order to make Water Baptiſm a ſaving Baptiſm there muſt firſt be the Anſwer of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the Sight of God, by renouncing the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, which, whoever has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, as it is the Concluſion of the whole Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> to fear God and keep his Commandments, will ſee beyond empty Shadows and mere out-ſide Things, which are not commanded by Chriſt, nor any ways neceſſary to Salvation; and will alſo ſee his Emptineſs in ſtriving to join the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt with that of elementary Water.</p>
            <p>IN Page 36, our Opponent aſſerts, that thoſe who ſay St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Words, <hi>Not the putting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. are a Negation of Water Baptiſm, muſt charge him with a Contradiction, bacauſe he ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptiſed every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> but here I would have the Reader obſerve, that this Baptiſm in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt has already been proved, by undoubted Authorities, to be <hi>John</hi>'s, which this Author himſelf acknowledges to be ceaſed. And the other Words of <hi>Peter, Not the puting away the Filth of the Fleſh,</hi> were penned about twenty Years after, by which Time the Apoſtles (whatever they had thought to the contrary before) were no Doubt fully convinced that Water Baptiſm was not neceſſary to Salvation, or <hi>Peter</hi> would not have been ſo expreſs and clear in the Point. And let our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007983_0038_102E0D3A19D9C088"/>
make appear, by any Text of Scripture, that ever any of the Apoſtles baptiſed with Water after the penning of this Epiſtle of <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT before I leave this Paragraph I would willingly query with the Author concerning thoſe Words of <hi>Peter Acts</hi> ii. 38. <hi>Repent and be baptiſed for the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins;</hi> whether this Baptiſm is the ſame which is practiſed by the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And if it is, whether Infants are capable of Repentance, or of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing that they will repent; or whether they have any Sin to repent of? Seeing where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion. And our Saviour ſaid of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, and propoſes little Children to us as Patterns of Innocency, agreeable to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Common Prayer-Book: How he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth all Men to follow their Innocency, <hi>i. e.</hi> little Children's Innocency.</p>
            <p>OUR Opponent will not admit, Page 37, of the Sufficiency of that Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> That,
<q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many are baptiſed with Water that are not ſaved, therefore Water Baptiſm is not the Baptiſm meant by <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </q>
But being here met with in a narrow Place, and like <hi>Baalam</hi> ſtill willing to ruſh on, let his Way be never ſo perverſe in the Eyes of the Lord: He ſtuffs two or three Pages chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this Argument, That altho' many are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with Water that are not ſaved thereby, yet it is no more an Argument againſt Water Baptiſm than for thoſe who had been baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt and fell away from that State, to be brought as an Argument againſt the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt. According to which, in Page 41 and 42, he ſaith,
<q>If there was a <hi>Symon</hi> who was baptiſed with Water whoſe Heart was afterwards found not right in the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007983_0039_102E0D3D62DD5AA0"/>
Sight of God, there was alſo a <hi>Nicholas</hi> who was baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt whoſe Practices and Doctrine were afterwards hated by the beloved Apoſtle of our Lord;</q>
and theſe Compariſons ſeem to be ſuppoſed by him to be equal, which in my Opinion may be eaſily confuted. For firſt, we can prove that <hi>Simon</hi> was in the Bond of Iniquity and Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs at the Time of his being baptiſed with Water, by the Teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> viii. 23. But if he cannot prove that <hi>Nicholas</hi> was guilty of ſuch Practices, and held ſuch Doctrine as was hateful to the beloved Diſciple at the Time of his being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>I ſay,</hi> that if he cannot make that appear, his Compariſon is no way equal. And we have always denied that Doctrine, <hi>Once in Grace ever in Grace;</hi> but do believe a Poſſibility of falling from Grace and high Attainments, and that our Safety depends upon a conſtant Obedience to the righteous Law of God written in our Hearts; and that no Man after he has put his Hand to the Plough and looks back again is fit for the Kingdom of God. <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 62. So that a Perſon's falling from Grace of heavenly Attainments is no Argument that the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt is not Chriſt's Baptiſm which is to continue to the End of the World; but a Perſon's being in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity at the Time of receiving Water Baptiſm, is an undeniable Proof that People may be admitted to that Ceremony, and yet be far ſhort of acquiring the Anſwer of a good Conſcience thereby; and that Water Baptiſm cannot be that Baptiſm mentioned <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 10. becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> both believed and was baptiſed, notwithſtanding which he remained in the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007983_0040_102E0D408B1BDF40"/>
Gall of Bitterneſs and Bond of Iniquity, which is far ſhort of a State of Salvation.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus endeavoured to remove this Author's Cavil againſt <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> on this Head, I ſhall inſiſt upon his Arguments being ſound and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able until I ſee them confuted by better Reaſons than <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> has offered. And that the Reader may ſee the Abſurdity of his Arguments, Page 39 and 40, where he ſeems to allow, that thoſe who have been baptiſed with Water have put on Chriſt, I ſhall offer ſome Obſervations taken out of <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> Page 109, who ſpeaking concerning <hi>Galatians</hi> iii. 17. <hi>For as many of you as have been baptiſed into Chriſt have put on Chriſt;</hi> ſaith,
<q>The cleareſt Way to find out what Baptiſm the Apoſtle has relation to here, whether the Baptiſm of the Spirit or that of Water, is to conſider what he means by that rhetorical Phraſe, <hi>to put on Chriſt. Beza</hi> on <hi>Romans</hi> xiii. 14. ſays, "To put on Chriſt is to poſſeſs him, ſo as to have him in us and us in him." Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it thus, "ſet yourſelves to the Practice of all Chriſtian Purity." <hi>Burkett</hi> thereon ſays, "Set the Doctrine and Life of Chriſt continually before you; follow every Inſtitution and imitate all the Parts of his holy Converſation; even as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is commenſurate to the Body." May not the Expoſition, ſaith he, imply that the Soul of Man ſince the Fall is in a naked State, deſtitute of thoſe divine Graces of the Holy Spirit which were its original Cloathing in the Day of undefiled Innocency.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND as this Author, Page 39, ſeems alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Meaning of this Text, <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us as were baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt were
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007983_0041_102E0D4222BB1918"/>
baptiſed into his Death: Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhall walk in Newneſs of Life. Romans</hi> vi. 3, 4, in Favor of Water Baptiſm, I ſhall furniſh the Reader with the Judgment of Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> on the ſame Place, taken out of <hi>Joſiah Foſter,</hi> Page 113, who ſays,
<q>All this is nothing but Crucifixion of the old Man; a deſtroying the Body of Sin, that we no longer ſerve Sin.</q>
And if ſo, then it is eaſily forſeen what naturally follows from this Author's Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That Water Baptiſm crucifies the old Man, or Nature of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> deſtroys the Body of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſuch a whimſical Notion as even a Papiſt would be aſhamed of: So that here is a great Abſurdity ariſing from his Doctrine, and more eſpecially when it is conſidered that by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion the moſt he can make of Water Baptiſm is this, that it is but one of the leſs neceſſary Parts of the one ſaving Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>BUT when the Apoſtle ſays we are buried with Chriſt by Baptiſm into his Death, his Meaning is very obvious, that as Chriſt's Humanity or Veil of Fleſh was crucified and buried, ſo by Baptiſm, <hi>that is,</hi> through the regenerating Power of the Holy Spirit, which waſhes and ſanctifies the Soul, the old Man, the Body of Sin in us, is crucified, deſtroyed, and as it were laid in the Grave. Then with Reſpect to our being raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in Newneſs of Life; which plainly ſets forth that as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the glorious Power of the Father, ſo is our new Man raiſed to Holineſs of Life by the ſame divine Power or Spirit of God. In
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007983_0042_102E0D448CE61BD8"/>
ſhort if all this according to the learned Biſhop's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion be nothing but Crucifixion of the old Man, deſtroying the Body of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then moſt evidently the Baptiſm which produces ſuch an Effect is nothing elſe but that of the Spirit, and the very ſame is to be underſtood concerning <hi>Colloſians</hi> ii. 12. 13, where the Apoſtle expreſſes himſelf in Terms equivalent to this of <hi>Romans</hi> vi. 4. As to the Author's Paraphraſe on theſe Texts, what can it be called more properly than a Jargon of Words without Coherence reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Nature of the Caſe? Conſidering that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is obliged to allow that the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt is one and the moſt neceſſary Part of the true and ſaving Baptiſm, Page 34.</p>
            <p>THE Author being met with in a narrow Place, as I ſaid before, and ſorely pinched, rather than yield to common Juſtice, has Recourſe to the Concluſion of the Harlot, who had no juſt Claim to the living Child; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iii. 26. <hi>Let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it.</hi> For in the Nature of his Arguments, and by his unequal Compariſons, he has confounded both Baptiſms, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Spirit as well as that of elementary Water; but then confeſſes, Page 42, that this Argument is falſe, which I ſhall readily grant him; but ſhall deny him his faint Argument,
<q>That Chriſt's Baptiſm, inſtituted as a ſtanding Ordinance in his Church, <hi>may be</hi> a Water Baptiſm, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome of thoſe who were baptiſed with it afterwards became wicked Men:</q>
If he had dealt honeſtly he ſhould have ſaid <hi>were then</hi> wicked Men. But the Reader may obſerve that his confident Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions are now come to a <hi>may be</hi> a Water Baptiſm, and this I utterly refuſe to grant him, without he can bring me into ſuch a Streight, that like the true

Mother of the living Child, I ſhould rather choſe to ſee the falſe Mother have it than that it ſhould divided. But I am confirmed of the Truth of thoſe Expreſſions quoted by him, <hi>The Truth endureth, and is always ſtrong, it liveth and conquereth for ever.</hi> 1 Eſdras iv. 38.</p>
            <p>HE now would inſinuate, Page 43, that as ſoon as the Meſſias was made known to the World, <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm muſt ceaſe of Courſe; and that <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>may be</hi> the Figure of a Water Baptiſm inſtituted by Chriſt. I anſwer, that when the Meſſiah offered up himſelf upon the Croſs he blotted out the Hand Writing of Ordinances, and put an End to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and all the Ceremonies of the Law; and he now circumciſeth the Hearts of People by which they are made true <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Praiſe is not of Men but of God. <hi>Romans</hi> ii. 29. And yet we find that Circumciſion was practiſed thro' Condeſcenſion, after the Aſſenſion of our bleſſed Lord, in the Caſe of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and that of <hi>Peter</hi>'s conſtraining the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be circumciſed; and why might not the Apoſtles baptiſe with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm of Water from the ſame Motives of Condeſcenſion of becoming all Things to all Men, to ſave ſome, without giving any more juſt Argument for Water Baptiſm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a ſtanding Ordinance in the Church of Chriſt, than for Circumciſion; ſeeing that the moſt that can be made of either of them, is this, that they were but Types or Figures to point out the Subſtance, and where the Subſtance is enjoyed, now under the Goſpel, they are become but like the brazen Serpent, a mere Piece of Braſs; which tho' very good in its Time, yet the good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xviii. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he found the People idolizing it, broke it
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007983_0044_102E0D4A16180568"/>
in Pieces; and I take this Water Baptiſm which this Author ſeems to be in ſo much Pain to eſtabliſh the Neceſſity of, to have no more Virtue in it than a mere Piece of Braſs, a Nehuſhtan.</p>
            <p>AS to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm being a Figure of a Water Baptiſm inſtituted by Chriſt, I would have the Reader conſider what an abſurd Notion it muſt be; ſeeing Chriſt's Water Baptiſm (if we could ſuppoſe any ſuch Thing) can be nothing but a Type or Figure, for there is no one I preſume ſo weak as to ſay it is the Subſtance: And is there any Senſe in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions? A Figure of a Figure, a Type of a Type, or a Shadow of a Shadow. But does it not look as if this Notion proceeded from a Deſire of keeping us from the Subſtance, and ever graſping after Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>
            <p>AS to his Aſſertion, Page 43, that the Apoſtles always underſtood the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> xviii. to mean a Water Baptiſm, I cannot allow it to be Truth; and herein he may ſee that it is not beyond Contradiction: I have before ſhewn that the Text is, <hi>Teach all Nations baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. which never can fairly be conſtrued to mean two poſitive Duties (as he before affirms) but ſimply that as Chriſt promiſed his Preſence to accompany them in this Service, their Doctrine ſhould be attended with that Power which ſhould prick the Heart, and have in it that baptiſing Quality (as it was not they that were to ſpeak, but the Spirit of their Father which was in them) that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould fall on the Hearers by Virtue of their Miniſtry, as on <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Houſe at the preaching of <hi>Peter.</hi> And ſo I ſhall agree with this Author that that Ordinance which Chriſt has been pleaſed to inſtitute, and has promiſed to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:007983_0045_102E0D4C66F845C8"/>
accompany with the ſanctifying Graces of his divine Spirit muſt be ſome thing more than a mere carnal and ceremonial, it muſt be a pure and ſpiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which I do aſſert to be the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt; and deny his Water Arguments as being much beneath the Dignity of a glorious Goſpel or ſpiritual Diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>AND now, friendly Reader, if thy Patience has been ſufficient to accompany me in tracing this Author thro' his ſometimes one Thing and ſometimes another, I doubt not but thou haſt, with me, found many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies, notwithſtanding his Learning and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as a Man.</p>
            <p>BUT let us have a little more Patience and ſee whether the reſt of his Arguments have any more Weight in them.</p>
            <p>AS to his Argument, Page 45, concerning the Sameneſs of the Word in the general Command, <hi>Matthew</hi> xviii. 19. and in 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> i. 17. it can have no more Force to prove theſe two Baptiſms one and the ſame, than it would to prove all Baptiſms alike in the whole Scriptures wherever that Word is made Uſe of; ſeeing there are other Words in both Texts ſufficient to point out plainly what Kind of Baptiſm is meant in each. That in <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. is, <hi>Teach all Nations baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. which, as has been ſhewn before, ſignifies a baptiſing Quality to accompany a true Miniſtry, and ſo muſt be meant of the Spirit of Truth, which leads into all Truth. The other in 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> i. is, <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptiſe but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> ſo that this muſt be underſtood of Water Baptiſm as this Author rightly obſerves, and therefore it may be ſafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that neither <hi>Paul</hi> nor any of the Apoſtles had
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007983_0046_102DC8CACAF3C988"/>
a Commiſſion to baptiſe with Water, and what they did in this Reſpect was in Condeſcenſion to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Times, like that of Circumciſion; and herein <hi>Paul</hi> was nothing behind the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles either with Regard to Water Baptiſm or in Reſpect of the general Commiſſion in <hi>Matthew.</hi> For this Author has brought <hi>Timothy</hi> and the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus</hi> as Seals that <hi>Paul</hi> had Power to confer the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt: But to make Water Baptiſm ſaving would not only make <hi>Paul</hi> inferior to the reſt of the Apoſtles, but alſo to accuſe him of being guilty of thanking God for having done him ſo little Service as the baptiſing ſo few with Water.</p>
            <p>AND I would have the Reader obſerve how this Author, about the Middle of Page 46, makes an Addition of the Word <hi>and</hi> baptiſe, in the general Command, which if allowed would bring a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction on <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to baptiſe but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> i. 17. but it has been acknowledged to be a Water Baptiſm, in this laſt Place, that <hi>Paul</hi> meant, which he ſays he was not ſent to baptiſe with; and the other, in the general Command, has been proved to be the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſuch a Baptiſm as accompanies, or is the Effect of Chriſt's true Minſters teaching or preaching the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>THESE Things conſidered, I doubt not but we are in the Judgment of every unprejudiced Reader, ſufficiently freed from the Dilemma this Author would gladly bring us into, and all ſeeming Contradictions fairly reconciled.

            <p>BUT this Author has wreſted <hi>Paul</hi>'s Meaning, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> i. by adding, Page 47, as tho' they had been <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words; 'I tell you that tho' I have Power to baptiſe, yet my chief Buſineſs is to preach the Goſpel to the Gentiles. And again after the ſame Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Page 48,
<q>but tho' it is I that plant or convert you, and <hi>Appollos</hi> or any other Miniſter that watereth or baptiſeth you, it is Chriſt that you ſhould call yourſelves after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
By this Rule of Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may wreſt the Scriptures to our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and by making the inſpired Writers ſay what we pleaſe, may pretend to prove the moſt erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrine from thence.</p>
            <p>THIS Author, like the poor ignorant <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, deſcends to material Water upon the Words <hi>Appollos watereth,</hi> which ſhews his Weakneſs, but being in a great Streight he will catch at any Thing that has the Name of Water: And ſeeing he is ſo in Love with Water I ſhall furniſh him with ſome other Texts of Scripture in which Water is mentioned alſo, from whence the Reader may have an Opportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that we can prove a <hi>ſpiritual Water</hi> proceeding from <hi>the Well of Salvation</hi> that ſhall be drawn with Joy; with which I apprehend <hi>Appollos</hi> watered as an Inſtrument; and which they who have once drank of ſhall never thirſt after this Author's elementary Water, or go to him or any in his Spirit to draw. See <hi>John</hi> iv. 13, 14. <hi>Jeſus anſwered unto her (the</hi>

Samaritan) <hi>whoſoever drinketh of this Water ſhall thirſt again: But whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt; but the Water that I ſhall give him ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life.</hi> And again, Chap. vii. Ver. 37. <hi>&amp;c. In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any Man thirſt let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. But this he ſpake of the Spirit which they that believe on him ſhould receive; for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> But it is evident that before the Time of <hi>Appollos</hi>'s watering the Church Jeſus was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and the Holy Ghoſt given; and ſo <hi>Appollos</hi> and the other Miniſters, being Believers in Chriſt, watered the Church with living and ſpiritual Water. And this Author's endeavouring to render it elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Water is one of the weakeſt Arguments that I ever ſaw in Print on the Subject; and ſo I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it as having no Subſtance.</p>
            <p>BUT now he ſays, Page 49, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> affords him another Argument to prove that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words cannot be underſtood in the Senſe he contends for: Becauſe he ſays that thoſe few baptiſed by <hi>Paul</hi> were not baptiſed by Virtue of his apoſtolic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but rather in Condeſcenſion to their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even as at another Time he circumciſed <hi>Timothy.</hi> To which our Opponent ſaith, it not being prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was a Matter of perfect Indifferency, and brings ſome Reaſons for the Policy of it; but ſaith, as ſoon as it became a Queſtion of Importance and likely to be hurtful, then the Apoſtle declared againſt it. Now what this Author here ſaith in Regard to Circumciſion,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007983_0049_102E0D55B014A3B8"/>
may alſo be the Caſe with Water Baptiſm. For, as that was not at that Time prohibited, it was a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Indifferency, and ſome of the ſame politic Reaſons might be added, as of meeting with leſs Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo baptiſing thoſe few mentioned by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might be in Condeſcenſion, and not by Virtue of his apoſtolic Commiſſion; but when he ſaw ſo bad Uſe made of Water Baptiſm, that they diſtinguiſhed themſelves by the Name of thoſe who baptiſed them, and that it was likely to cauſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the Church, it was high Time to take them down a little, and no better Way could this be done than to leſſen their Thoughts of that Ceremony on which they ſo valued themſelves, and to tell them plainly that Chriſt ſent him not to baptiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he thanked God that he had baptiſed ſo few of them.</p>
            <p>HE ſeems to be offended with <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> Page 50, and ſays, but it is inſiſted on with great Poſitiveneſs, that the Text, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. 19. is not to be underſtood of baptiſing with Water; and that the Form of baptiſing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Warrant from the Text. To which he ſaith, when the foregoing Proofs, that the Text <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. is to be underſtood of a Water Baptiſm, are anſwered, then he will believe theſe poſitive Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and not before.</p>
            <p>ROBERT BARCLAY indeed doth ſay, in Page 434,
<q>That this Scripture is not to be underſtood of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing with Water; and that the Form of baptiſing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, hath no Warrant from <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. 19.</q> And this Author accuſeth him of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

from his own Maxim, laid down not to go from the literal Signification of the Text, without ſome urgent Neceſſity forceth thereto; but he thinks that <hi>Barclay</hi> has broke this Rule, becauſe he argues that the Name of the Lord is often taken in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for ſomething elſe than a bare Sound of Words or literal Expreſſion, even for his Virtue and Power, as may appear from <hi>Pſalm</hi> liv. 3. <hi>Canticles</hi> i. 3. <hi>Proverbs</hi> xviii. 3. and in many other Places. But as this cannot be denied, ſo I cannot ſee how <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> has gone from the literal Signification of the Text; and if this Author will keep ſo well to the Text as <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> has done, and prove Water Baptiſm an Inſtitution of Chriſt, as a ſtanding Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in his Church, by that Text, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. then I ſhall yeild the Argument to him. But this he cannot do, and yet will be carping at ſomething, if it be only to amuſe others, without the leaſt Proof; for he will find it harder to keep to the literal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of that Text and prove Water there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, than we ſhall to prove the Holy Ghoſt there mentioned, which has been already done.</p>
            <p>AS to the Baptiſm which <hi>Barclay</hi> contends for, into the Virtue and Power of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this Author ſays if it means any Thing; it muſt be a being endowed with the Virtue and Power of that Perſon into whom you are baptiſed, which he thinks muſt ſignify to work Miracles, and if this is not the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words he confeſſes he does not underſtand the Meaning of them. Now if he will pleaſe to read <hi>Matthew</hi> v. 48. he will find that Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>Be ye perfect even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect;</hi> and how this Perfection can be attained without the Virtue and Power of the Father I cannot

ſee: Neither can any partake of the Virtue and Power of the Father but ſuch as are baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, for it is thereby every Chriſtian becomes Members of the Body or Church of Chriſt, or in other Words, Branches of him who is the true Vine, this appears to be <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Meaning.</p>
            <p>AS to what he calls a very ſtrong Argument, Page 52, deduced from <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s own Words, to prove that the Text <hi>Matthew</hi> xxviii. muſt mean a Water Baptiſm, this Author allows that the Apoſtles did miſtake that Part of their Commiſſion in Regard to teaching all Nations, but agrees that as God was pleaſed in ſo particular a Manner to remove their Miſtake in that Reſpect, he certainly would have ſet them right as to the other Part of their Commiſſion which related to baptiſing, if they had miſtaken the Meaning of it. It may not be a-miſs here to inform the Reader, that <hi>Robert Barclay</hi> ſays in the ſame Place which this Author is now carping at, Page 438,
<q>It ſufficeth us that if they were ſo miſtaken (tho' I ſay not that they were) they did not always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under that Miſtake, elſe <hi>Peter</hi> would not have ſaid of the Baptiſm which now ſaves, that it is not a putting away the Filth of the Fleſh, which certainly Water Baptiſm is.</q>
To which I ſhall add <hi>Paul</hi>'s declaring that Chriſt ſent him not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> i. 17. which fully imports that ſuch a Baptiſm, that he there makes Mention of, was not ſaving; for we may ſafely conclude, that if it had been ſaving or conducive to the Salvation of the Soul the ſame would have been in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And as this Author has allowed before, that the Baptiſm alluded to by <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be a Water Baptiſm, has ſtrengthened our Proofs, that if the
<pb n="47"
                   facs="unknown:007983_0052_102E0D5CE13A7070"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apoſtles were once under ſuch a Miſtake concerning Water Baptiſm, that their Miſtake was removed, and their Judgments ſo clearly informed that they have left many full Proofs in Scripture that the one ſaving Baptiſm is that of the Spirit and not elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Water, which neither this Author nor any other have been ever able to prove.</p>
            <p>AND ſo his high Charge, Page 53, againſt <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> of calling the Veracity and Truth of God in Queſtion, which, to heighten, he compares to the Sin which is not to be forgiven, may be urged with more Force againſt him than againſt <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> and the Quakers: And he had Need to pray for himſelf as well as others.</p>
            <p>NOW as to his Reaſon which he calls a prudential one, which is of ſo great Weight with him, when it is examined the Reader may judge whether it has any Weight at all in it: Since it cannot with any Reaſon be ſuppoſed that Chriſt has left his Church at ſuch Uncertainties in ſo important and eſſential a Point, as he obſerves himſelf, in his ſecond Page, this of Baptiſm is, leſt we ſhould be toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine; but that we may be ready to give an Anſwer to every Man that aſketh us a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us: But this prudential Reaſon would leave us in Uncertainties. And that it cannot be a Sin to uſe Water Baptiſm becauſe the Apoſtles uſed it, and <hi>Peter</hi> commanded it; the ſame Argument might be uſed with as much Force for Circumciſion and the other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies to be continued: But the Danger of Sin in this Caſe of Water Baptiſm lies in this, that altho' it was good in its Time as a Figure of the Subſtance, even as the brazen Serpent was a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:007983_0053_102E0D5E77A6EED8"/>
Figure of Chriſt, yet now by People's putting a Dependance in that for Salvation, and laying hold of the Shadow, they thereby neglect the Subſtance and are left wandering at Uncertainties. As to what this Author ſaith in the remaining Part of Page 54, it can be of no Force againſt us, neither has it any Shew of Reaſon, being built upon his uſual Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of poſitive Aſſertion without Proof. And obſerve his Aſſertions:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, That Water Baptiſm is a poſitive Command of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2d, That it is one of the Conditions of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="3">3d, That Chriſt has promiſed to accompany it with his divine Preſence.</p>
            <p n="4">4th, That <hi>Peter</hi> has declared the Effects of it upon the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> That by it we ſhall obtain Remiſſion of our Sins.</p>
            <p n="5">5th, That the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is ceaſed, Page 52.</p>
            <p n="6">6th, That the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt is the moſt neceſſary Part. And,</p>
            <p n="7">7th, That the Baptiſm with Water is the leſs neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Part, Page 34.</p>
            <p>WHICH if thou canſt reconcile, Reader, it is more than I can do.</p>
            <p>BUT now as he draws towards a Concluſion he would, I ſuppoſe, be underſtood that God has inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, by his Son, a Water Baptiſm which waſhes the moſt inveterate and malignant Diſeaſes of the Soul; but adds, by Virtue of the divine Preſence of the great Author and Mediator of a new Covenant, and the ſanctifying Graces of his holy Spirit accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the due Adminiſtration thereof: Which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007983_0054_102E0D6187FEFB58"/>
he can make a Divorce between the ſanctifying Graces of the Holy Spirit and the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, muſt center in this, that the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt is the moſt neceſſary Part: And then as he ſays that has long ago ceaſed, his Building at laſt is but a mere Babel Tower. But as to that Virtue which he talks of being in Water Baptiſm, the Multitude of uncleanſed Souls who have paſſed thro' that Adminiſtration are moſt irrefutable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of its being an Application of no Value: And how conſiſtent it is with the evangelical Diſpenſation to ſuppoſe that Chriſt commanded a Duty and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice thereof never appear, I leave to the judicious to determine.</p>
            <p>AS to his Impartiality here boaſted of, I have proved the Contrary by a neceſſary Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Perverſions and Additions, of not only <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Writings, but alſo of the Scriptures of Truth, and I think that he would do well in Time to repent for his adding to the Words of the Teſtimony of Truth which was ſpoken under the Influence of the Holy Ghoſt, in that Caſe of <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now I ſhall leave it to the judicious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reader to determine whether this Author has either ſtated or vindicated the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon the important Point of Baptiſm; ſeeing he has wholly paſſed over that of Infants, the moſt uſual Practice of that Church, or whether he has anſwered our Objections againſt Water Baptiſm in General.</p>
