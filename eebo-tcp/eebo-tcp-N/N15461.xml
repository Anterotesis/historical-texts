            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>ECCLESIASTES, X. 1.</bibl>
Dead flies cauſe the ointment of the Apothecary to ſend forth a ſtinking ſavor: ſo doth a little folly him that is in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for wiſdom and honour.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is hoped that the feelings of none in the aſſembly will be wounded by the introduction of this maxim, which may ſeem unpoliſhed; when it is conſidered that it was penned by a perſon of the firſt character for diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: who was alſo the chief magiſtrate of a great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and under the ſuperintending influence of the Holy Spirit. King Solomon made choice of the wiſdom requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for his important ſtation, and God graciouſly gave him his deſire.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings, iii.5—12.</note> From that wiſdom, improved by long experience, and directed by ſupernatural influence, he was eminently qualified to give proper inſtruction to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of every condition in life: both as it conſiſted in general maxims, and in the application of them to particular caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:019699_0005_0FAC99482285F3A0"/>THE paſſage before us contains a general principle, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to a variety of particular characters. It will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to all who are diſtinguiſhed for ſuppoſed worth, and reſpected by mankind on that account: to all who are in ſtations of eminence, where their accompliſhments are conſpicuous, and their faults, if they have any, are not hidden. Theſe are the poſſeſſors of that wiſdom and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is compared to the precious ointment of the apothecary: that good name which is even more valuable than precious ointment. A little folly, however, in a character ſo conſpicuous, and exalted, will tarniſh its beauty, and diffuſe an ill favour through the ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.<note n="*" place="bottom">Text and Chap vii.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As the maxim in the text is fitted to ſuch an extenſive application, to perſons of eminence in the ſeveral claſſes of ſociety, it requires our ſerious attention on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>A DISCUSSION of the ſubject is propoſed in the following manner.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A DESCRIPTION of a reputable character, or good name, will be attempted.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE deſtructive influence of folly, when mixed with ſuch a character, will be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="3">III. AN application of the general maxim to particular characters, will conclude the diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A DESCRIPTION of a good name, or reputable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, will be attempted.</p>
            <p>THE compariſon of a good name, to the precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the apothecary, is implied in the text and other ſacred paſſages.<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtes vii.1. Canticles i.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>FROM an inſtitution in the antient Moſaic writings we learn that an holy anointing oil was to be made, by a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019699_0006_0FAC9948E267F008"/>
of the moſt excellent ſpices, with the pure oil of the olive tree. With this precious ointment, the prieſts, the tabernacle, and its utenſils were to be anointed, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration to the particular ſervice of God.<note n="*" place="bottom">Exodus xxx.22—38.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THIS holy oil which was not to be imitated, or even applied, except for the purpoſes, and in the manner ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the institution, was evidently deſigned to repreſent the excellent nature of true religion, and of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in his ſanctifying influences on the hearts of men.— Thoſe beſt accomplishments of the human mind—as there is, in theſe, a combination of the moſt amiable qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities compoſing the character of the man of God.</p>
            <p>A LIKE mode of expreſſion is uſed, by the inſpired pſalmiſt, to illuſtrate the mutual and harmonious affection of brethren, dwelling together in unity—and the happy influence of that affection.<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm cxxxiii.</note> Finally, the excellent qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities and unequalled glories of the divine Meſſiah, are repreſented under this ſame metaphor.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm xlv.6, 7, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE idea running through the ſeveral repreſentations is, obviouſly, the ſame. A variety of individual objects, excellent in themſelves, united and combined, in ſuch a manner as to conſtitute one complete object. In which the beauty of each is, not only preſerved, but exhibited, with ſuperior advantage; by its connection with the reſt, in ſuch a manner, as to heighten the perfection of the whole.</p>
            <p>THIS is true with regard to the beauty of all complex objects. <hi>It conſiſts in the due proportion of each part, to the uſe for which it is deſigned—to its various relations, and to the whole.</hi> This will appear by an application of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to objects confeſſedly beautiful, in the various productions of nature and art. In theſe laſt, we are, ſometimes, agreeably entertained and improved, by view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſplays of human ſagacity. But, in the firſt, we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019699_0007_0FAC994A6292F3C0"/>
are ſtruck with pleaſing and devout aſtoniſhment, at their inimitable beauty and grandeur. And, by the perfection diſcernible in his various works, from the moſt ſimple and minute, to the moſt complex and magnificent, we are led "to look through nature, up to nature's God."</p>
            <p>THE beautiful, the exact gradations, and proportions, by which they are conſtituted and directed, impreſs the devour philoſopher with the deepeſt reverence for the Moſt High, and lead him to acknowledge that "the heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy works"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xix.i.</note>—and that "in wiſdom he hath made them all."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm civ.24:</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT we muſt not indulge in theſe general reflections, but confine our attention to that particular ſpecies of beauty, which conſtitute a good character. Are material and inanimate objects beautiful, intelligent creatures muſt be capable of that which is far greater, and more perfect —in proportion to the ſuperior nature of the ſoul. This beauty of the mind, is what renders man worthy of eſteem, and by which he obtains the approbation of the wiſe and good.</p>
            <p>IT is worthy of notice, that the perfection of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment, referred to in the text, conſiſted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent quality of its ſeveral parts, and their due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each other. In like manner, a good name is the reſult of a compoſition of mental excellencies, fitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to each other, and to their object.</p>
            <p>HUMAN perfection may be ſummed up in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent qualities of the underſtanding, and the heart. All our perceptions and knowledge belong to the former, and all emotions, affections, and determinations, to the latter. The beauty of the underſtanding conſiſts in its ſuſcepiibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of thoſe perceptions, by which we are furniſhed with the knowledge requiſite to our place and ſtation: or, in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019699_0008_0FAC994B2388A630"/>
their actual exiſtence. The other eſſential branch of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perfection is compriſed in affections correſponding to our perceptions: or, in the qualities of the heart. If theſe are proportioned, to a proper knowledge of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of perceptions, it forms that amiable and worthy character, which comports with the nature and dignity of man—as he is related to his preſent and future ſelf, to his fellow creatures and to his Creator.</p>
            <p>THE duly proportioned knowledge of the objects of human perception, may be ſtiled <hi>the natural beauty,</hi> or perfection, of man; and the correſponding affections of the heart, that which is <hi>humane, domeſtic, civil, moral,</hi> or <hi>evangelical:</hi> according to the qualities or relations of the objects, on which they terminate. And the oppoſite to theſe, are the deformity of the underſtanding, and the heart. The beauty, or perfection of the heart, is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the greateſt importance. Without this, the fineſt accompliſhments of the underſtanding are of little worth —Yea when connected with a heart, altogether deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they conſtitute a character, utterly unworthy. And that deformity is even increaſed, in conſequence of its connection with ſuperior knowledge. For, it is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of reaſon and revelation that, "to him who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin."</p>
            <p>By ſuitable exertions of the heart, the perceptions, and knowledge of the mind, are applied to their proper uſe, and rational exiſtence is both honorable and happy. But this can be aſſerted, with the ſtricteſt propriety, of thoſe affections and exertions only, which are of the moral, or evangelical kind. The others, which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have obtained the name of virtues, or perfections, on account of their coincidence with particular objects. A virtuous huſband, friend, citizen or ruler, is denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from his acting agreeably to thoſe relations: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to what he is, in regard to his more exſtenſive connections. And, it is very ſuppoſable, that a perſon may be eminent in one, or more, of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019699_0009_0FAC994BE3D86828"/>
virtues, and yet be utterly deformed, or vicious, in reſpect to his great and important relations, as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, a rational and immortal being.</p>
            <p>FROM hence it appears that though certain affections may be beautiful, in a ſeparate view, and as proportioned to particular objects, or relations—the character, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, may be exceedingly deformed, on the whole: in conſequence of an oppoſition of heart, to its more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and important connections. And thoſe particular attachments, though agreeable in a ſubordination to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior affections, ſerve to heighten the deformity of the character, in a different connection. As we ſee men, eminent for ſome of the private virtues, often the moſt inveterate and dangerous enemies to the ſtate: when they are deſtitute of public affection, and conſider the intereſt of their particular connections, and that of the public, in oppoſition.</p>
            <p>IN like manner, a perſon may be poſſeſed of many of thoſe agreeable qualities, which are denominated vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and yet, through the influence of private affection, he may be oppoſed to the honour of his Creator, and the intereſt of his fellow creatures. And thoſe very attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo agreeable and uſeful, when ſubordinated to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affection may be ſubſervient to that oppoſition, and greatly enhance it. But that coincidence of affection, and exertion, to our great moral objects and relations, which obtains the name of <hi>moral virtue,</hi> or perfection in rational beings who have never tranſgreſſed, and <hi>is evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical virtue</hi> or holineſs in man, as correſponding to the goſpel revelation of ſalvation.—<hi>That,</hi> is truly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, both as it is proportional to our moſt extenſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and involves a proper affection to all particular objects, conſidered in themſelves, and as ſubordinate to the whole.</p>
            <p>WERE we to apply theſe general principles to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar characters, the evidence would appear to be ſtill more

deciſive. The great law of religion, in reference to our duty to God, our Creator, is ſummed up in that reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and practical affection, which is proportioned to our utmoſt ability. In relation to our fellow men, we are to love our neighbours as ourſelves—their happineſs being of equal importance with our own. For the ſame reaſon, the leſs good is to give way to the greater, the private to the public, and the intereſt of all finite, created beings, ſhould be ſubordinated to the infinite and uncreated Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of all. To man, as related to his preſent, and future ſelf, it is the voice of reaſon and revelation—"Do thyſelf no harm." He is directed to ſeek that happineſs, which comports with the dignity and importance of his exiſtence as a man.—A happineſs conſiſting in union to his Creator, and to his fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>THUS the great principles of reaſon, and revelation, form a moſt beautiful and harmonious ſyſtem. And the man, who is practically conformed to them, is poſſeſed of the excellent qualities conſtituting that good character, which is repreſented by the precious ointment, and is declared to excel it.</p>
            <p>IF we conſider the chriſtian religion, as a ſcheme adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the caſe of lapſed creatures, we ſhall find a no leſs beautiful harmony in its ſeveral parts—to their reſpective objects, to each other, and to the whole.</p>
            <p>THIS divine ſyſtem is conſtituted of two great branches. The firſt, is a ſupernatural revelation of the way of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſalvation for ſinners of mankind, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation and atonement of Chriſt; who is "God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh." An atonement every way ſuitable to the perfection of God, both as it exhibits the original ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of his character and government, and prepares the way for the fulleſt manifeſtation of them, to the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creation, in the actual recovery, and ſalvation, of ſinners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019699_0011_0FAC994D62B37028"/>THE other branch, of the chriſtian revelation, contains what man is to believe and do, in reference to this reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—the whole train of chriſtian graces and exertions, which correſpond to his condition as a ſinner, to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to God, as Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier and Judge—to mankind, and to his own preſent and future exiſtence. Theſe, fitly expreſſed, in a life of chriſtian holineſs, form the character of "the man of God, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to every good work." Each of theſe is excellent in itſelf, and as connected with the reſt. And all of them, collectively viewed, and raiſed to their proper ſtandard, form the chriſtian for that ſtate of perfection to which he is redeemed; and prepare him to fill a place in that church of the firſt-born, of which he is a member.</p>
            <p>So little cauſe love the oppoſers of chriſtianity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, as a ſcheme unworthy of God, and repugnant to the dictates of reaſon and philoſophy. It was, long ſince, obſerved by a great maſter of reaſon, that "true and deep philoſophy always leads men to a profound admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>the firſt cauſe.</hi>" It may be added, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found admiration will be abundantly increaſed by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per view of that great firſt cauſe, as diſplayed in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation. It is a <hi>minute philosophy only</hi> which leads men to reject this divine ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>WE now proceed to the next branch of our ſubject.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the deſtructive influence of ſolly, when mixed with a good name.</p>
            <p>THAT we may underſtand the force and propriety of the compariſon implied in the text, it may be proper to obſerve, that one eſſential excellence of the precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment refered to, conſiſted in its fragrant and reviving ſmell.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. i.3.</note> The deſructive influence of the dead fly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in its taking away the ſweet ſavour of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019699_0012_0FAC994E22788A08"/>
or in cauſing it to ſmell diſagreeably. By its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſaction a poiſonous, as well as offenſive, quality was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo diffuſed through the compoſition. And as this ſweet and refreſhing ointment, would become diſagreeable, and deſtructive, by the mixture of the dead fly—ſo the moſt reſpectable character may looſe its luſtre, and be covered with diſgrace, by the mixture of folly.</p>
            <p>THAT the repreſentation may be more fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, it may be farther obſerved, that the term <hi>folly,</hi> as uſed by this inſpired writer, is not reſtrained to its prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignification, to denote a deſtitution of rational percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or an imbecility of intellect—Perfons of this deſcription cannot be ſuppoſed to be in reputation for wiſdom and honour.</p>
            <p>IT will likewiſe appear, by an examination of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages where this and other like terms are uſed, that they are eſpecially deſigned to expreſs the quality and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thoſe who neglect the proper application of their intellectual powers, or uſe them for oppoſite and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ends. In this ſenſe the term <hi>folly</hi> is to be underſtood in the paſſage before us.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, it muſt be remembered, that the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mentioned, in the text, is ſuppoſed to be eminent. It belongs to ſuch as are "in reputation, for wiſdom and honour." The aſſertion might be illuſtrated by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to particular inſtances, of the mixture of folly, in a character otherwiſe reputable. The expreſſions of a bad heart reproach the moſt exalted ſtation. And, folly is the reverſe of <hi>that wiſdom</hi> which is the honour of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous character, in the various applications of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſome of which have been named already.</p>
            <p>A PERSON poſſeſſed of, even the beſt, intellectual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, but the reverie of what he ought to be in the ſeveral relations of human life, and his connections in ſociety, is deſtitute of the whole train of virtues; and his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019699_0013_0FAC994F0459E828"/>
character ſends forth an offenſive ſavour. This will be evident in real life: it is true of a huſband and father, deſtitute of conjugal and paternal affection—a nominal patriot, void of public ſpirit—a judge, under the blinding influence of the love of money—and a rich man, deſtitute of compaſſion and liberality to the poor. Men, deſtitute of the virtues ſuitable to their particular conditions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and under the influence of the oppoſite vices, are the objects of juſt abhorrence, in proportion to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to be uſeful, to the eminence of their abilities and ſtations.</p>
            <p>THIS truth will be ſtill more obvious by applying it to the great moral objects, and relations, of man. By a ſingle fault, the moſt awful ruin is diffuſed through the human race. In place of that holy affection, to the Moſt High, and to our brethren of mankind, which is ſuitable to our nature and relations, and is our higheſt perfection; ſelfiſh propenſities have the dominion in the human heart, and "all men ſeek their own." This is the general ſource of ruin to mankind. From hence, as their proper fountain, proceed, the private and public quarrels, the cruel wars and ſlaughters, which have filled our world— all the oppreſſions and perſecutions which, under various pretences, have ſpread deſolation through the earth. The wide-ſpreading ruin has diffuſed itſelf through all ages, all nations, and claſſes of mankind. It has infected all degrees of ſociety, from the meaneſt cottages, to the moſt magnificent empires.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of paſt ages, and kingdoms, will atteſt the truth of theſe observations, and general experience will confirm them. This dead fly, with its malignant infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, enters the retirements of domeſtic quiet, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbs the ſweet enjoyment of its tender friendſhips; and, in many inſtances, utterly deſtroys them. It even ſets a man at variance with himſelf, and the conflict uſually iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues in his falling a prey to this baneful paſſion. To this
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019699_0014_0FAC994FA25BB720"/>
muſt be traced, <hi>ſuicide itſelf,</hi> that moſt unnatural of all the crimes of wretched mortals.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, this ſets man at oppoſition to his Maker, and leads him to reject the proffered grace and ſalvation of the goſpel, procured and offered by the great Redeemer—and thus to plunge himſelf into the moſt agravated, and remedileſs ruin. But for this, how happy were the lot of men! united to their Creator, to each other, and to themſelves; poſſeſſed of intellectual and other endowments, ſuſſicient for the ſublimeſt purſuits and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, in a reciprocation of benevolent exertions, and in united reverential love and obedience, to the fountain of good.</p>
            <p>BUT it is time to diſmiſs this gloomy ſide of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of our ſubject, and proceed to the concluding branch of it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. IN an application, of the general maxim, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular characters.</p>
            <p>THE preſent joyful anniverſary, and this reſpectable aſſembly, invite us to apply the ſubject to the intereſting concerns of juriſ-prudence and civil government. The gentlemen of the two houſes of Aſſembly, are the perſons pointed out in the text, elected to their reſpective pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of honour and reputation, by the <hi>unpurchaſed, unſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited</hi> votes of the freemen of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>IN a conſtitution like our's, nothing but diſtinguiſhed merit can be a recommendation to public office. It is thoſe, who are thus choſen, who are in reputation for wiſdom and honour. Happy indeed! if no dead fly be ever found in this venerable "aſſembly of wife men." In the preſent application of the ſubject, we have only to ſhew, that each branch of the legiſlature, and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be compoſed of men equal in ability, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of diſpoſition, to the importance of their ſtation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:019699_0015_0FAC9950681D68C0"/>As the object of government is the good of ſociety, it is natural to remark, that the rulers of a ſtate ſhould have a thorough knowledge of its intereſts, on the whole. A ſuperficial reaſoner in politics, is a very bad ſtateſman. Such an one will often purſue ſome trifling intereſt of the ſtate, real or imaginary, to the neglect and hazard of its greateſt, and moſt laſting emolument.</p>
            <p>IF I rightly apprehend the nature of our conſtitution, the honorable members of the Upper Houſe of Aſſembly, beſide acting as aſſiſtants to <hi>his Excellency,</hi> are repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſtate, <hi>at large.</hi> To theſe, in particular, it is given in charge "<hi>that the commonwealth receive no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>" The gentlemen of the Lower Houſe, ſtand in much the ſame relation to their reſpective corporations, as the honourable council, to the whole ſtate. In legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and government, the intereſt of each corporation is to be regarded individually, and as connected with that of the ſtate—in ſuch a manner as to conſtitute a common good, in which each town and, as far as poſſible, each individual, ſhall find it to be his intereſt to unite. This common good of the ſtate, muſt alſo be purſued in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner coinciding with the intereſt of the confederacy at large.</p>
            <p>THE members of the Houſe of Repreſentatives ought to have a good acquaintance, at leaſt, with the reſpective intereſts of their own corporations, and to know how to promote them by the wiſeſt means, in conſiſtence with the common good of the ſtate. The honourable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council ſhould have a ſtill more exact and extenſive knowledge of the public intereſt, in its ſeveral branches, as they are guardians to the whole ſtate—and ſhould know how to ſecure and promote its welfare, ſo as to produce the greateſt quantity of good, to each branch, and to the whole. And, as ſhall moſt exactly coincide with the intereſt of the United States—and bear a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſpect to the good of ſociety, and mankind, at large.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:019699_0016_0FAC995123460780"/>IT is the part of the accompliſhed legiſlator to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the beſt intereſt of each claſs of ſociety, and riſe, by juſt gradations, in his plans and ſyſtem, from parts to the whole; till he fix a common good, compriſing the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſubjects, as a body, and this, in conſiſtence with the intereſt of mankind. Such may the legiſlature of Connecticut be, and adopt the wiſeſt plans to promote its true intereſt, and to advance the preſent and future happineſs and glory of the United States; as a conſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate republic, acting on the great theatre of the world, ranking with other nations, and having, in various reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, a common intereſt with them; and, involving the happineſs, or miſery, of the many unborn millions who are to ſucceed us; and fill our extenſive territory with, flouriſhing ſettlements: whoſe it will be to complete the glorious fabric of liberty and equal government, founded by the wiſdom of our venerable ſenators, and cemented by the blood of our ſons and brothers.</p>
            <p>SUCH, and ſo great, are the events connected with the preſent day. It is even an aera pregnant with the fate of a world! Where then, it will be aſked, is the wiſdom, not more than human, which is equal to the importance of legiſlation and government, in founding this riſing empire? In this, however, as in other branches of practical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, though the highest degree of perfection can not be obtained, the man who would deſerve to be in reputation for wiſdom and honour, muſt climb the lofty ſteep of knowledge, in his profeſſion, with unabating aſſiduity, and approach, as near as poſſible, to the unattainable height.</p>
            <p>THE other accompliſhment of the good legiſlator, and which renders him worthy of the higheſt reſpect, is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the public intereſt, proportionate to his abilities. Without this, the greateſt ſkill in juriſ-prudence and civil government, will be vain. Indeed, knowledge, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver neceſſary, derives its importance from its connection
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019699_0017_0FAC9951E41EF6A8"/>
with exertions, for the good of ſociety. And, unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a diſpoſition to ſuch exertions, in a ruler, it may produce conſequences—fatal to the ſtate. The public man muſt be like the excellent Centurion, who had the teſtimony of the Jews that he loved their nation.—Or, like the celebrated Emperor who, when a ſingle day had pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed without any particular inſtance of benificent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lamented ſaying, "I have loſt a day."</p>
            <p>WHO can ſufficiently revere the venerable patriot, whoſe life is devoted to the ſervice of his country, and of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?—From determination of the human mind, which is univerſal, this character has been the admiration of all nations, and claſſes of men. "Bleſſed art thou, O land, when thy king is the ſon of nobles, and thy princes eat in due ſeason, for ſtrength, and not for drunkennefs."<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſtcs x.17.</note> Here is full ſcope for the collected wiſdom and virtue of our venerable Aſſembly! And, with what inviting ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour will thoſe ever honoured names be perpetuated to poſterity, through all generations, whole wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, whether in the council or in the field, have fixed the baſis, for the future greatneſs of this empire of freedom!</p>
            <p>AMONG theſe, and at their head, we behold, with thankful praiſe to <hi>the great Preſerver,</hi> ſafe from the perils of the war, "The Hero who redeemed our land!"— From the midſt of ten thouſand dangers, reſtored to the boſom of peace, and domeſtic felicity—Above the wiſh for other honours than thoſe which his diſtinguiſhed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has ſecured.—Happy in the ſafety of his country, like the parent claſping his dear child, juſt ſnatched from the jaws of death.</p>
            <p>WHAT is all tinſeled greatneſs of haughty mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy, compared with the meek majeſty, the ſweet and dignified ſerenity of that heroic breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoftened with the moſt tender ſentiments of humanity! conſcious of his own

ſucceſsſul efforts, and of the grateful, the affectionate, acknowledgements of the nation, which he was born to ſave. How much better is the name he has obtained than that of ſons and daughters! Preſent and future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will glory in the relation, and liſping infancy will be fond to call him father.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the ſweet rewards of diſtinguiſhed merit.— May thoſe which are far greater and more laſting attend <hi>the illuſtrious</hi> WASHINGTON.—May he be the care of heaven, the highly favoured ſubject of the King of Kings. —May he grow old in conſcious peace with God, and the ſweet ſenſibility of chriſtian conſolation. Long may he bleſs mankind, and honour the Redeemer; till, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with age and piety, and ſatisfied with this life— ſweetly, and without a parting groan, he ſhall drop what was mortal, and aſcend to glory.</p>
            <p>SUCH are thy charms, O virtuous philanthropy!— May the venerable aſſembly of the wiſe men of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, feel thy ſweetneſs, and diffuſe thy luſtre!</p>
            <p>THE ſubject opens an extended field, for uſeful and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining reflections, which will readily occur to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind, and ſhall not, therefore, be particularly named.

But, for himſelf, the moſt proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; his hoary head being crowned with glory, as a man of letters, a ſtateſman and a chriſtian.

            </p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency will pardon this momentary digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on account of the ſolemn and weighty occaſion.—I have only to add, that, great as your honour and felicity are, in the reſpects which have been named, <hi>were this all,</hi> you could not be pronounced happy on the whole. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, your proſpects are not bounded by time, but open into immortality.—That, while your Excellency is treading the downward ſteep of life, you can look back on its ſeveral ſtages, devoted to God and ſpent in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and in doing good to men—and look forward with calm ſerenity, and joyful confidence, in the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to an admiſſion into the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy.</p>
            <p>IT is our heart's deſire and prayer to God for your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that you may be ſupported under the weight of public cares, and declining years; that you may continue to be bleſt, and to bleſs mankind; that the chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019699_0021_0FAC995507E8CF90"/>
may be your joy; that, in ſome future period, being old and full of days, you may be honourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred—your country's tears mingling with thoſe of your own family, and bedewing your venerable herſe. And that you may receive a diſtinguiſhed portion among the redeemed, through Chrift Jeſus.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject now invites the attention of his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, the honourable-Council, and Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>THROUGH the good hand of our God upon us, in the peace of 1783, our freedom and independence are recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, by the Britiſh court.—We rank among other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—Have an immenſe territory, extending through a variety of climates.—A wide field is opened for the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the arts of peace—An opportunity for perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perpetuating the moſt happy conſtitution of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the federal union. And, by the divine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on proper civil and military diſcipline, we ſhall be ſecure from the attacks, or, at leaſt, from the ravages of an enemy.</p>
            <p>WHAT remains then, but that we take the cup of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call on God—thankfully accept his ineſtimable bleſſings, and improve them—to be happy ourſelves, and to leave the invaluable inheritance to poſterity? To this we have motives the moſt numerous and weighty, but above all, we owe it to that omnipotent goodneſs—that God of grace, "who ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomſoever he pleaſeth," and who hath cauſed his tender mercy to triumph over all our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs</p>
            <p>THAT we may enjoy the proffered bleſſings, much is yet to be done.—The various and complicated intereſts of the ſtate are to be fixed and ſecured.—The energy of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019699_0022_0FAC9956054964C0"/>
government, enſeebled by the revolution, and other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is to be reſtored—the principles of the union im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and confirmed—the public credit eſtablished—and the whole ſyſtem of the finances placed on a wiſe and reſpectable footing.</p>
            <p>AMONG the many ſubjects which will engage the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the legiſlature the following deſerve particular attention. That, in the weighty ſubject of legiſlation, whatever ſtatutes may be requiſite, ſhould be founded on principles of private and public juſtice and utility, combining, as far as poſſible, the intereſt of individuals with that of the public.—Laws ſhould be plain, ſimple, and but few:—Would rulers wiſh to govern well, they will not attempt to govern too much.</p>
            <p>YOUR honours will not be unmindful of the vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the executive branch. In particular, that your Judges are men of the firſt character, for wiſdom, and unbiaſſed rectitude of heart—well acquainted with the laws of the ſtate, and with the principles and ſpirit of law in general. And, who are exemplary for thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which give energy to their determinations.</p>
            <p>As the ſame courſe of <hi>external conduct,</hi> which flows from a heart animated by the ſpirit of true religion—and, as ſuch, is evangelical obedience—is, in many reſpects, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the well being of ſociety:—<hi>In this laſt view</hi> it is the proper object of civil government. While, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is remembered that Chriſt's kingdom "is not of this world," and as fuch "calls no man mailer," it is proper to obſerve that <hi>the manners</hi> of the people muſt be formed by education and government. Admitting that an exact determination of the boundaries between the rights of conſcience, and of the magiſtrate may be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, in ſome caſes—the moſt important and practical principles, on this ſubject, are extremely plain; and are admitted by the moſt enlightened, of every denomination, as eſſential to good order and happineſs in ſociety. Your
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019699_0023_0FAC9956631C3090"/>
honors, ſenſible of the importance of the general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, will apply it in your wiſdom for the good of this people.</p>
            <p>AMOMG the many vices, which tend to the ruin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals and society, perhaps none are more fatal than thoſe of needleſs lawſuits, and the intemperate uſe of ſtrong drinks. The expence of theſe destructive practices is the leaſt of their evils; but even this is not inconſiderable. It would be easy to ſhew, were it needful, that the uſeleſs conſumption of time end money, in theſe ſocial vices, far exceeds the whole coſt of ſupporting civil government, and the public worship of God. But were this all, it would be comparatively, trifling.—What is of, almoſt infinitely, greater importance is the deſtruction of virtue and good manners; which is hereby effected, in individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals, in families, and the public. "Who hath wo? Who hath ſorrow? Who hath contention? Who hath babbling? Who hath wounds without cauſe ? Who hath redneſs of eyes?—They who tarry long at the wine: they who go to ſeek much wine."—At the laſt it biteth like a ſerpent and ſtingeth like an adder."<note n="*" place="bottom">Proverbs, xxiii. 29—32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>YOUR honours will be happy if you can ſave this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from that gulph of ruin. We rejoice that our rulers ſo generally remember the excellent maxim, which king Lemuel received from his mother. "It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings, to drink wine, nor for princes ſtrong drink: left they drink and forget the law, and pervert the judgement of any of the afflicted.<note n="†" place="bottom">Proverbs, xxxi. 4, 5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE intereſt of education, and literature in general, are humbly recommended to this honorable Aſſembly. The Univerſity in the ſtate, under the auſpices of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whoſe praiſe is far extended in the religious and literary world—flouriſhing in numbers, in literature and reputation—is, however, expoſed to many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019699_0024_0FAC995727DA2DD0"/>
eſpecially from the want of proper edifices to contain the ſtudents under the eye of the executive autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and funds to ſupport ſome additional profeſſorſhips. The paternal attention of this venerable Aſſembly, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to that important inſtitution; where ſo many of us have received our education: in which we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, and where we wiſh that our ſons may be united as a band of brothers, in treading the delightful paths of ſcience, and forming for public uſefulneſs— when we ſhall ſleep in the duſt of death.</p>
            <p>YOUR honours are no ſtrangers to the preſent alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of public credit, and the preſſing neceſſity for the adoption of deciſive meaſures to reſtore it. That our foreign and domeſtic creditors muſt be ſatisfied is not problematical—it is certain. Our national character is at ſtake, with all the invaluable bleſſings of freedom and independence. In vain have theſe been purchaſed, at ſuch an expence of blood and treaſure, unleſs our national credit be ſupported.</p>
            <p>THIS is a ſubject no leſs important than difficult. It is eaſy to foreſee <hi>what will not</hi> ſucceed, but hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>what will.</hi> An attempt to remedy the evil by a new emiſſion of paper currency would, no doubt, come under the former deſcription, and be making bad worſe. Our public ſecurities, of every denomination, are of this kind, poſſeſſed of all the recommending qualities which could attend a new paper currency, deſtitute of a fund for its redemption. But, like the thin ears, and lean kine, in the dream of Egypt's king, they have already devoured the fat and full ears of gold and ſilver with which our country abounded at the peace in 1783—and they are nothing better but are, continental money ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, <hi>ſuch as were never ſeen in all the land of America for badneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, however, is not the fault of any claſs of men, whether rulers or ſubjects, but of the times. It is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019699_0025_0FAC9957E3EF6AC8"/>
of a combination of circumſtances attending the late revolution, in connexion with the imperfection common to man. How to remedy the evil is the queſtion.—The collected wiſdom of this Aſſembly, and of the united Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, will be ſtrenuously, and, we truſt, ſucceſsfully, employed in deviſing means to reſtore our credit, as a ſtate and nation.—<hi>These,</hi> it is not the province of the ſpeaker to ſuggeſt: but it is easy to obeſerve, that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources are not inconſiderable, Beſide our unlocated lands, a future revenue of immenſe value, the fruits of a well directed industry and oeconomy.—Our advantage for ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building, for trade, and, eſpecially, for the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery.—With other ſources of private and public wealth may be directed in ſuch a manner as to fix, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the public credit.</p>
            <p>YOUR honours would be happy if you could deviſe ſome better expedient, than has yet been adopted, for <hi>the gradual, but total abolition of ſlavery</hi>; and, in the mean time, protect the friendleſs Africans among us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, on the one hand, and, on the other, ſecure ſociety from injury by improper and ill-timed manumiſſions.</p>
            <p>DURING the firſt ſtages of the late war, amidſt the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of impending ſlavery on ourſelves and poſterity—<hi>much</hi> was ſaid!, and <hi>ſomething</hi> done, in favour of the blacks. But the meaſures, then adopted, are evidently inadequate, and attended with conſequences unfriendly to ſociety, and to them. In each of theſe views, the ſubject calls for public attention: but, immediate danger being paſt, it engages little notice.—And, not a few of the citizens of the United States are returning, "like the dog to his vomit," to that dreadful infraction of the law of nature and of God, the practice of ſtealing their brethren of the human race, and ſelling them. While many Britiſh ſubjects and ſome of the firſt dignitaries of their eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed church, are pleading the cauſe of thoſe friendleſs and oppreſſed ſtrangers, with a nobleneſs of ſentiment
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019699_0026_0FAC9958A4BE8A38"/>
and ardour of zeal, which do honour to their profeſſion and to humanity.<note n="*" place="bottom">Beſide many other publications, the reader is deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, a pamphlet entitled, "The caſe of our fellow creatures, the oppreſſed Africans, reſpectfully recommended to the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration of the Legiſlature of Great-Britain, by the people called <hi>Quakers.</hi>" And, the Biſhop of Cheſter's Sermon before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts, at their anniverſary meeting in February, 1783, published by order of the ſociety. As the members of that ſociety are numerous and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable, the publication of the Sermon is no ſmall indication of the humane ſentiments which are prevailing in Great-Britain, on this ſubject.</note>
            </p>
            <p>COULD your honours do any thing effectual, however the intereſted and unfeeling might oppoſe, humanity would approve, with the moſt friendly ardour. The lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of truth and goodneſs would aſſiſt you with their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The bleſſing of many, ready to periſh, would come on you. Heaven would approve, and the good favour of your excellent name would be diffuſed through all generations.</p>
            <p>THAT I be not further tedious, may the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom guide the preſent ſeſſion of the legiſlature. May you do much ſervice for your country, and return home, with that deſerved reputation for wiſdom and honour which is far better than the moſt precious ointment.</p>
            <p>THE venerable Clergy will now be pleaſed to ſuffer the affectionate addreſs.</p>
            <p>MUCH RESPECTED FATHERS AND BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>THOUGH we have no ſhare in legiſlation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a large field is open, in which we are to diffuſe the ſweet perfume of that moſt fragrant compoſition, <hi>the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion,</hi> which we are to preach to others, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ourſelves. Nothing is more obvious than that the ſpirit and inſtitutions of the goſpel bear a friendfy aſpect
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019699_0027_0FAC995962735DD0"/>
to ſociety and government. And that, in ſuch a manner, as is true of no other religious ſyſtem:—for no other, teaches its votaries to place their felicity in the public good, and to think and act on the extended ſcale of the moſt perfect general happineſs. But chriſtianity not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>teaches,</hi> but <hi>inſpires</hi> its ſubjects with this truly noble liberality of ſentiment and affection. It expands the heart of each individual to embrace the good of all, and to reſt ultimately, in the perfection of the divine glory, and of the felicity of God's kingdom. And, ſurely, a heart thus dilated with public affection, can not fail to exert itſelf for the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>WE are to teach our people "the whole council of God," as it reſpects doctrinal, experimental, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal chriſtianity.—But let it ſuffice, on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to obſerve, that we muft "put them in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, to obey magiſtrates, to be ready to every good work, to ſpeak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men."<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus iii.1, 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BY inſtruction and example, we are to ſhew them the way to exhibit the amiable beauties of pure chriſtianity, in the exertions of well directed benevolence and public ſpirit, and a becoming diſcharge of all the relative duties. From us, they ſhould learn the ſweet pleaſure of domeſtic virtue and religion, in all its branches. And how good and pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity. Society is conſtituted of families, and from them, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its complexion.—In this way let us teach our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to reverence the laws, the rulers, and judges of the ſtate. And, above all, to reverence our great Creator and Redeemer, and imitate his goodneſs—to be fathers to the poor—the friends of ſtrangers—to wipe the tear from the orphan's eye—and cauſe the widow's heart to ſing for joy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:019699_0028_0FAC995A237A8118"/>SOLICITOUS that the people of our charge, may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to every good work, and wiſe to ſalvation— we ſhall not only teach them by word and example, but bear them on our hearts at the throne of grace; and, we ſhall not be unmindful of each other, and the churches of God. May I not add that, while we pray the Lord of the harveſt to ſend forth labourers into the harveſt, we ſhould be of one mind among ourſelves as to the introduction of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, and the ſettlement of paſtors—that they are workmen who need not to be aſhamed—perſons eminent for piety, literature, and all miniſterial accompliſhments. The faithful miniſter wiſhes to live in his ſucceſſors, in the evangelical work.—May we have this animating proſpect.</p>
            <p>BLESSED be God that to us, is this grace given to preach among our fellow ſinners, the unſearchable riches of Chriſt. Happy, indeed, if we obtain mercy to be faithful and ſucceſsful!—Thus ſhall the precious ointment of pure chriſtianity, exhibited in our doctrines and our lives, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a moſt delicious perfume, and be "a ſweet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avor of Chriſt unto God"—ſweeten our way through the labours and trials of life—not forſake us in the ſolemn hour of death, and render our joys pure and complete in a better world, when we meet each other, and thoſe of our dear flocks, who have profited by our miniſtry.</p>
            <p>THE leaſt of you all felicitates you, and himſelf on the great mercy of having received part of this miniſtry.—He heartily wiſhes you the divine preſence, and abundant ſucceſs, together with increaſing harmony in all the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of chriſtian truth, "till we all come in the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſians iv.13.</note>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:019699_0029_0FAC995AE6912370"/>FINALLY, all who are preſent this day are invited to "take the cup of ſalvation and call on God"—with thankful praiſe for all his mercies to us, and to our fathers, and wiſely to improve them by a practical compliance with the duties of their relations to ſociety, to mankind, and to themſelves.</p>
            <p>ABOVE all, let us receive the cup of goſpel ſalvation, preſented through the great Redeemer—by a hearty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with all the inſtitutions of chriſtianity. Then ſhall the ſweet perfume of "the anointing from above" diffuſe its reviving influence through every breaſt, and we ſhall know, in ſome degree on earth, "how good and how pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity" —And this happifying knowledge will be perfected in the world of perpetual harmony:—where all the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from among men ſhall join in receiving the cup of ſalvation, and in ſaying, "thanks be to God for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable gift."</p>
