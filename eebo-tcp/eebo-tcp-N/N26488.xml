            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

On the third day it was inſpected; and from the third to the fifth it was enough rotted, as it is called. In examining it, with finger and thumb ſome of the roots were broke. If they bent or were tough, it was not enough: when they ſnapt off ſhort like glaſs, it was enough: but the bark alſo was tried.

But, it greatly depends on the ſlate of the ground, and the purpoſes for which the crop is intended. A little experience will aſcertain the proper quantity. Two buſhels of ſeed to an acre, I believe are a full portion for rope. A little leſs might be about the quantity I ſowed. It is ſaid in a publication by the Boſton Committee of Agriculture, that in the common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſowing by broad caſt, "not leſs than three buſhels are uſually ſowed, and ſometimes more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the richneſs of the ſoil."

The Hemp is laid at full length in a kettle. If the kettle is too ſmall to admit it at full length, the Hemp may be doubled, but without twiſting it; only the ſmall end of every hand is twiſted a little, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eep the hands whole, and from tangling. Smooth ſticks are laid in the bottom of the kettle, acroſs and acroſs three or four layers, according to the ſize and depth of the kettle; which is for keeping the Hemp from touching the liquor. Then pour lie of middling ſtrength, half the ſtrength of that for ſoap, gently into the ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

The kettle is now covered cloſe as can be, and hung over a very <hi>gentle</hi> fire to ſtew or ſimmer, but not boil, ſo as to raiſe a good ſteam for 6 or 8 hours. It is then taken off, and let ſtand <hi>covered</hi> 'till the Hemp is cool enough to be handled. It is now taken out, and wrung very <hi>carefully,</hi> 'till dry as can be: then hang it up <hi>out of the way of the wind,</hi> in a garret or ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet at times it is to be viſited, and examined if any part has become <hi>damp.</hi> At leiſure, <hi>twiſt up</hi> as many hands of Hemp as are intended for preſent uſe, <hi>hard</hi> as you can; and with a ſmart, round, ſmooth hand-beetle, on a ſmooth ſtone beat and pound each hand by itſelf, all over very well, turning it round till all is well bruiſed. Then untwiſt and hackle it through a coarſe, and after it through a fine hackle. Hackling is performed in the ſame manner as if combing a fine head of hair; beginning at the <hi>ends</hi> below as theſe are entangled, riſing higher and higher: at laſt the top of the head is reached. The firſt tow makes country rope; the ſecond, oznabrigs, ſheeting and bagging; and the pure Hemp excellent linen.</p>
