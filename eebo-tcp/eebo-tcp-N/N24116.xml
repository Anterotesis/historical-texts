            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DIFFIDENCE ever troubles its poſſeſſor. It gives him moſt perplexity when he perceives himſelf the object of public attention. The orator muſt feel extremely anxious while he beholds a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous audience, whoſe concourſe, whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, whoſe very eyes, ſeem to mark him out as the ſource of their preſent amuſement.</p>
            <p>Beſides this inconvenience, common to all public ſpeakers, he, who now addreſſes you, has peculiar embarraſſments. His theme is appropriate: he muſt ſpeak on the nature of ſociety. This ſubject is far from being the moſt brilliant. It does not glitter with the ſplendour of military atchievement; nor is it ſhaded by the bays of academic fame. Might the fields of nature and art be ranged, themes could be found, whoſe native beauty would eclipſe the want of embelliſhment, and lure the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an audience, in defiance of every oratorial imperfection.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, he cannot feel that ardour of occaſion which inſpires the orator of ſome important
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031892_0004_0FEF3145F1508AD0"/>
aera. We this day celebrate the birth of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Society. The duration of this ſociety is but ſhort; the number of its members is yet but ſmall. The anniverſary of its inſtitution, therefore, cannot be an event which very extenſively intereſts the world. It is not like the celebration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and revolutions, where the ſplendour of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal heroiſm arreſts the attention of gazing mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; or where the recollection of national emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation hurries the ſoul into extaſy, and drives the loud echo of acclamation round the ſky.</p>
            <p>Before this day have you liſtened with ſilent admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the oratorial allurements of thoſe, who, on ſimilar occaſions, have appeared in this place. After them, to gain applauſe, to pleaſe, or even to paſs without cenſure, muſt require all the powers of eloquence.</p>
            <p>Forgive me, then, my fellow-citizens, if, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with diffidenee, on ſuch a theme, on ſuch an occaſion, and after ſuch predeceſſors, I attempt to amuſe you, by a ſhort delineation of the evils and benefits of ſocial intercourſe.</p>
            <p>We were nurtured in the boſom of ſociety, and are, therefore, quite incompetent judges of the goods, or ills, of a ſtate of ſolitude. Let us, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for a moment, baniſh hereditary prejudice, and contemplate the goods of ſolitude, in contraſt with the ills of ſociety; we can then better deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine why man forſook the ſolitary ſtate, and mingled with his fellow-man.</p>
            <p>The ſolitary man has entire fruition of natural liberty. He is arbiter of his own actions. He knows no other law than that which the hand of nature has inſcribed on the pages of his own mind. Inſtructed by this, he takes without fear or controul that portion of heaven's munifactions which the wants of his nature require. He draws the fiſh
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031892_0005_0FEF314A9879EE20"/>
from any lake; lures the beaſts and birds of any grove; plucks the fruits and flowers of any heath, and ſlakes his thirſt at the cryſtal wave of any glid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream.</p>
            <p>This liberty muſt be dear to man; for the very child burſts into tears at the firſt approach of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; and men draw their ſwords, fight, bleed, and die for freedom. Indeed, heaven has vivified the human breaſt with a certain ſpirit which ſpurns at the approach of ſubjugation, and bids its poſſeſſor do homage to no being but his God.</p>
            <p>This native liberty, though dear to man, muſt be immerged in the tide of ſocial intercourſe. Man there relinquiſhes that freedom, which made him lord of his own actions; and learns to obey the dictates of extraneous ſovereignty. He exchanges the umpirage of his own controverſies, the vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his own wrongs, for the tardy deciſions of ſocial opinion, and the lingering reparations of public juſtice. For his ſhare of the undivided earth, he accepts that narrow portion of land, which the laws of his country have deigned to aſſign him. While a mere citizen of the world, he was no where a ſtranger, no where a foreigner; but, when he throws off the allegiance of nature, he inſtantly becomes an alien, an outcaſt, a barbarian, in every land but his own.</p>
            <p>A nearer view of the ſeveral kinds of ſociety, will give their peculiar evils a more ſtriking ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſociety, perhaps, was conjugal. This is not entirely exempt from evils. The domeſtic ſtate is a ſtate of cares and perplexities. Theſe perplexities irritate the mind, and excite conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the fondeſt partners. Contentions are ſharpened by reiteration; till mutual hatred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes thoſe hearts, which, before, nurtured the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031892_0006_0FEF32D9712EDDB8"/>
ſofteſt paſſions; and reciprocal reproaches echo from tongues, once invoking the ear of heaven to witneſs the tenderneſs of mutual attachment.</p>
            <p>Human imperfections ſoon blaſt the unlimited confidence of nuptial lovers. We fear to loſe the objects of our fondneſs; and that fear originates ſuſpicions of infidelity. Trifling accidents convert thoſe ſuſpicions into jealouſy, and jealouſy plants a thorn in every path, infuſes a bitter in every cup of life.</p>
            <p>But had this paſſion been forever unknown, and had contention never diſturbed domeſtic happineſs, ſtill would mankind have felt enough of conjugal infelicity. It is a ſad truth, that the ills attendant on the objects of our love, are felt with a ſeverity equal to our own. Wedlock gives its partners each another ſelf, equally the ſubject of misfortune; and thus unhappily doubles the ſources of human wretchedneſs. Care for the health, education and proſperity of children, perpetually throw the minds of parents on a rack of anxiety. Theſe cares and attachments, ſoftening and dilating the heart, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it as a mark broader and more vulnerable to the arrows of calamity.</p>
            <p>All theſe evils are peculiar to the ſocial ſtate. The votary of ſolitude ſhall never feel them. He, by accident, meets the counterpart of his nature in ſome ſequeſtered grove. That God, who gave them hearts attuned to the emotions of ſympathy, with a ſmile of approbation joins their hands. Short is the duration of their ſocial intercourſe; too ſhort for evils to diſturb the concert of their bliſs. Contention and reproach ſtand afar from their happy grove, and the black fang of jealouſy never wounds their tender boſoms. The next day's ſun beholds them, ſeparately, roving on their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive hills. Their offspring, like his parents, is the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031892_0007_0FEF32DC29415B08"/>
offspring of nature. Nouriſhed from the boſom of his mother, and fed on the unſolicited growths of the earth, he ſoon becomes independent of parental aid; and, like the mountain roe,
<q>
                  <l>—"Forſaken the dam's warm ſide;</l>
                  <l>"Bounds o'er the lawn, or ſeeks the dewy glade;</l>
                  <l>"And finds a home in each delightful ſhade."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Civil ſociety ſucceeded conjugal. This his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en birth to many calamities. Men were no ſooner collected, than they felt the conſequences of aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Power produced ambition and avidity: and theſe impelled men to war and rapine. United invention ſupplied them with arms; they ſwiftly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced beyond the line of juſtice; while crimſon carnage, and pale devaſtation, ſtalked behind them through the land. Slavery and deſpotiſm were the effects of conqueſt. Theſe calamities have been nurtured by thoſe cauſes which brought them into the world; and every ſpecies of ſociety has been tormented by them, ſince firſt old Nimrod collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a nation of robbers, and, by the tye of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wickedneſs, united thoſe whom God had ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered over the face of the earth. Yes, from that fatal aera to the preſent moment, the hand of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny has ſhaken the iron ſceptre of ſlavery and oppreſſion over the proſtrate nations. Through Afric's ſultry realms, over Aſia's fertile plains, and back to the icy regions of the north, we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the forlorn inhabitant the unreſiſting ſlave of lawleſs ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>Even where tyranny is baniſhed; where the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of laws is eſtabliſhed, ſtill oppreſſion cannot be entirely excluded. No code of general laws can equally embrace the multifarious rights of variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtanced individuals. Some rights muſt be left undefined, and without defence. This is one ſource of oppreſſion. Though judges are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031892_0008_0FEF32DEC0CD4E98"/>
learned, and attentive, and unprejudiced, yet ſtill will human imbecility often betray them into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. In ſuch caſes the unfortunate object of their deciſions is entirely ruined. He has loſt even the privilege of complaining, that laſt ſad conſolation of the wretched. This, then, is another ſource of oppreſſion. If judges are ignorant, or partial, or perfidious, the weight of a ſingle bribe may turn the ſcale of juſtice, and condemn innocence itſelf to the ſcaffold. Is not this another ſource of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion? And are not war, ſlavery and oppreſſion, fearful calamities? Surely they are.</p>
            <p>Theſe alſo are calamities peculiar to the ſocial ſtate. Man in ſolitude has neither the means, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, nor diſpoſition, neceſſary for war. No hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile weapons glitter in his hands; no neighbour's field offers a rich harveſt to his rapacity; and no ambitious thirſt for glory has learned his ſoul to ſigh for martial devaſtation. He calls no man maſter. The yoke of vaſſalage has never bent his neck; he has not felt the ſcourge of oppreſſion; nor ever trembled at the auſtere frowns of tyranny. Awed by no menace, controuled by no command, he paſſes through the world; and, as he goes, he ſets his foot on that ſpot of earth which moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights him.</p>
            <p>Men had no ſooner felt the evils of civil and conjugal ſociety, than they ſighed for relief from theſe calamities. To remedy the inconveniences of theſe eſtabliſhments, and to advance themſelves nearer to their God, they formed a combination, which they called eccleſiaſtical. This, however it may have removed the ills of the other kinds of ſociety, has been ſo managed, as to be productive of many calamities of its own.</p>
            <p>The church has preached, that God had promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never to forſake any who ſtand within the pales
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031892_0009_0FEF32E26C8BEE40"/>
of nominal righteouſneſs. A moſt exuberant li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs has been produced by this one article of faith. Thoſe, who call themſelves ſaints, have dared to tranſgreſs with greedineſs; becauſe their creed had taught them, that they could not tranſgreſs beyond the reach of mercy.</p>
            <p>A right to ſell indulgences has been another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of eccleſiaſtic combination. This, while it has encouraged wickedneſs, has, by gratifying avidity, produced a moſt enormous avarice. So great has been this thirſt for gain, that the ſame eccleſiaſtic, who fulminated damnation at the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, has commenced auctioneer, and publicly ſold abſolution for every ſpecies of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>By thus amaſſing wealth, the church ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came powerful. She then ſhut the doors of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and emolument; ſhe barred the gates of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and unſheathed the dreadful ſword of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, againſt all who refuſed to join her family, or dared to withdraw themſelves from her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. What though the wretched object of her reſentment may have eſcaped the ax, the rack, and the flames; yet, feared with the dreadful bolt of excommunication, he ſtands the forlorn outcaſt of earth and heaven. Human cunning could never have deviſed a ſcheme more produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of hypocriſy. For, while admiſſion to the church offers men all they deſire; while excluſion from it expoſes them to all they fear; they will be conſtrained to profeſs a belief in doctrines, which they never believed, and to promiſe the practice of virtues, which they never intend to practiſe.</p>
            <p>To all theſe calamities the ſolitary man is a ſtranger. No avarice bids him lure a brother into wickedneſs; and no fell ambition tempts him to hide the movements of his heart behind the curtain of hypocriſy. Though he has no page of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031892_0010_0FEF32E3F6874A20"/>
but the hook of creation; no object of ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation but nature's God; yet is his ſoul not void of faith, nor uncharmed by the ſmiles of devotion. He believes his Creator gives the woods their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and the birds their ſongs. He views the ſun travelling through the fields of heaven, and calls him the meſſenger of God. When the ſtars look from the blue battlements of the ſky, and the ſerene majeſty of midnight awes the world into ſtillneſs, his ſoul falls proſtrate before that power who bids the wheels of nature roll in ſilence, and lull his children to repoſe.</p>
            <p>Such are the goods of ſolitude. Such are the evils of ſociety. If, then, ſocial intercourſe has given birth to domeſtic contention, jealouſy, and anxious care; if it has originated war, ſlavery and oppreſſion; if it has been the ſource of avarice, licentiouſneſs and hypocriſy, why did man, forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his native liberty, native pleaſures, and native religion, mingle with his fellow man, and expoſe himſelf to all theſe calamities? A ſolution of this interrogation induces a neceſſity of contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſpoſition of man, and his condition in the preſent ſtate of things, together with a few of the benefits of ſocial intercourſe.</p>
            <p>Man has an irreſiſtible propenſity to aſſociate with his fellow beings. He endures nothing with more pain than he endures ſolitude. When alone, his heart is ſad; and the clouds of melancholy ſettle on his countenance. This propenſity is too violent to be allured by any ſolitary pleaſure, or reſtrained by the anticipation of any ſocial calamity. To throw himſelf into the arms of ſociety, man leaves his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſolitude, barters his unviolated liberty, and encounters all the hazard, toil and danger of ſocial intercourſe. If, then, it be enquired why men aſſociate, each one of us has an anſwer in his own boſom. It is not becauſe in ſolitude we are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031892_0011_0FEF32E70D52EB50"/>
fearful and defenceleſs; it is becauſe we are ſocial beings: we love to congregate.</p>
            <p>More aſſociation, then, aſide from all conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial benefits, affords man a high degree of gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It makes him happy, by removing the pain of, ſolitude; it makes him happy, by gratifying a wiſh, of all the moſt impatient. If, therefore, man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no other good from ſociety than merely the gratification of this one propenſity, it would more than compenſate the loſs of ſolitary good; more than balance the acquiſition of every ſocial evil. If, in addition to this, we view the beneficent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of aſſociating, we ſhall find they afford all which man can reaſonably expect or deſire. For his nature forbids him to expect unſullied greatneſs of mind; nor can his condition afford him complete and inviolable felicity; becauſe reaſon and folly, virtue and frailty, good and evil, are united, and travel through the world as the companions of man. The beſt, therefore, which he can do, is to improve his reaſon, and retrench his folly; to confirm his virtue, and guard againſt frailty; and to follow that road through life which affords the moſt benefits, and is infeſted by the ſmalleſt number of inconveniences.</p>
            <p>Social intercourſe we ſay is this road; becauſe it produces the higheſt improvement of man's facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, together with the greateſt number of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. How ſociety can do this, is now the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of enquiry.</p>
            <p>Society, by multiplying his wants, calls into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the induſtry and invention of man; and thus enables him to produce all the great works of utility and ornament. Men had not long been collected, before they felt the neceſſity of increaſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the ſoil. While a tribe was ſcattered over a thouſand hills, the fruit of thoſe hills ſupplied them with food; but when the ſame number drew
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031892_0012_0FEF32E95998A878"/>
themſelves within the limits of one valley, or pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their tents on the face of one plain, their nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row territory left half its inhabitants unſupplied with proviſions. This want immediately evinced the neceſſity of ſoliciting from the earth, by labour, thoſe productions which ſhe would not yield ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly. Here was the origin of agriculture. Men removed the rock, extirpated the oak, plowed up the plain, and clothed the field in the livery of harveſt. All this could not be performed without the aid of machinery.</p>
            <p>The mine muſt be digged, the forge muſt be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſmith muſt blow the coals and ſwing the ſounding hammer, before the ax, the plowſhare and the ſcythe, could brighten in the hand of labour. The ſame wants, therefore, which originated agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, originated all thoſe arts neceſſary for its practice.</p>
            <p>Men, enriched by their toil, were not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with thoſe habitations which ſubſerved their wants, while they roved the woods in a ſtate of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. They pulled up their tents, demoliſhed their cottages, and erected buildings more durable and elegant. Here architecture had its origin. But architecture, without auxiliary arts, could not have erected the magnificent palace. Without the ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, the carpenter and the ſtatuary, the arched rafter had never left its native hill; the pine's rough trunk would always have inveloped the poliſhed cieling; and the marble column had forever ſlept in the quarry, nor raiſed its white capital to heave aloft the gilded dome.</p>
            <p>Nations had not advanced thus far in wealth, arts and refinement, without feeling wants which they could not ſatisfy by the productions of their own climate. They, therefore, began to exchange their own ſuperfluities for the conveniences and elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031892_0013_0FEF32EC2166FAC8"/>
of foreigners. To perform this commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, caravans travelled the deſert, and ſhips ſailed over the ocean. Theſe journeys and voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages introduced the neceſſity of new inventions and new labour. The ſection of an oak, by thunder ſplintered from its parent trunk, and thrown float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down on the boſom of a ſtream, doubtleſs firſt ſuggeſted to man the poſſibility of journeying over the waves. From this rude hint, to form a ſhip, with all its appendages of cordage and ſails, required much toil, much invention, and the united produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of many arts. The brake, the wheel and the loom, muſt employ the hand of induſtry; the ax, the ſaw and the hammer, muſt be heard to reſound in the foreſt, before the oak of the mountain, hewn into a keel, ſhall cleave the ſeas; before the hemp, now green in the field, ſhall, twiſted into cables, hold the ſhip againſt the fury of the tempeſt; or, ſpread out in ſails, collect the winds, and hurry the fleet over the ocean.</p>
            <p>After the production of all theſe wonders in the ways of art, we ſhall, doubtleſs, find man advanced to an elevated grade of improvement in his reaſon, his taſte, his paſſions, and in the diſpoſition of his heart. The perfection of all theſe depends on his connexion with the ſciences; and the ſciences ſprang from the practice of thoſe arts, which we have traced up to their ſource among the wants ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated by ſocial intercourſe. We had never known the philoſophy of animal, vegetable and foſſil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, had not that knowledge been connected with the gratification of our thirſt and hunger. The arcana of mathematics had never been explored, if commerce had not rendered its inveſtigation neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The firſt botaniſt, therefore, doubtleſs was a farmer; the firſt chymiſt, a blackſmith; and the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031892_0014_0FEF32EEEE138C28"/>
merchant and ſailor firſt diſcovered and applied arithmetic, aſtronomy and navigation.</p>
            <p>Theſe rude eſſays opened the avenues of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and diſcloſed on the mind a region of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where reaſon, by exerciſing her powers, has acquired almoſt inconceivable acuteneſs and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in all her operations. By forming ſociety, men produced the neceſſity of government and laws. Theſe afforded a new field for the exerciſe of reaſon; in which the philoſophy of morals and juriſprudence offered new ſubjects of contemplation, which gave additional force and ſubtlety to the exertions of the mind.</p>
            <p>The improvement of taſte is ſo cloſely connected with the improvement of reaſon, that what perfects the one, may be conſidered as the cauſe of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other. The ſame ſocial neceſſities, therefore, which, originating the ſciences, gave rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon its improvement, have refined taſte into an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate ſtandard of deciſion in all the arts of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and by this means furniſhed the mind with pure ſources of exquiſite delight. Taſte has thus become the unerring director of the architect, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſtatuary and poet; and while it has guided the hand of the artiſt, it has taught the ear to liſten with pleaſure to the melody of the poem, and learned the eye to gaze with rapture on the teints of the picture, the expreſſive features of the ſtatue, and the ſublime grandeur of the palace.</p>
            <p>The improvement of taſte and reaſon refines the paſſions. Beſides this, their refinement is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequence of ſocial intercourſe. Society, by producing new relations, gives us new objects of attachment, and raiſes in the heart new paſſions, more tender, more generous, and more prolific of delight. In ſociety men commence citizens, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, friends, parents, children, brothers; and,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031892_0015_0FEF32F1D0F779B0"/>
united by theſe cords of affection, their hearts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate in harmonious uniſon with the emotions of patriotiſm, friendſhip, parental, filial and fraternal fondneſs.</p>
            <p>The very exerciſe of theſe paſſions meliorates and improves the diſpoſition of the heart. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is advanced ſtill farther by gratitude and benevolence. Theſe are grafted on that mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence which ſprings up in ſociety, as its native ſoil. In ſociety no one is independent. For while a man, in one reſpect, has the power of granting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in another, he himſelf may need aſſiſtance. Reaſon, therefore, directs every man to benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; becauſe every man knows he may be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it. He is alſo impelled to it by compaſſion; becauſe compaſſion renders him wretched until he grants relief to him who ſolicits his charity. Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is a kind of counterpart to benevolence. It is the offspring of that gladneſs of heart which we feel on the reception of a favour; and which very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally induces a wiſh to reward our benefactor with reciprocal kindneſs. Gratitude, therefore, as well as reaſon and compaſſion, urges men to benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that moſt exalted of all human virtues, which elevates us to a reſemblance of Deity, and qualifies our ſouls for ineffable fruition.</p>
            <p>All theſe improvements are produced by ſocial intercourſe. For without ſocial intercourſe, mens wants had never been increaſed beyond the ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous productions of the earth; without theſe wants, labour had not been excited, nor invention called into activity; without the exerciſe of labour and invention, there had been no cultivated fields, no fruitful orchards, no ornamented gardens, no lofty palaces, no hallowed temples, no magnificent cities, no commerce travelling the deſert, or ſailing the ocean, to pour the wealth of one climate into the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031892_0016_0FEF32F45B3B0DD8"/>
boſom of another; without any of all theſe, there had been no ſcience, no improvement of reaſon, no perfection of taſte, no refinement of paſſions, no benevolence of heart; but the world, to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had remained an undivided wilderneſs; and man, ſolitary man, had roamed on the deſolate mountains, with no other ſocial amuſement than howling at the ſtillneſs of midnight, and liſtening to the diſmal reſponſes of echo.</p>
            <p>If, therefore, all theſe improvements of mind, all theſe advancements in the arts of utility and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are produced by ſocial intercourſe, may we not ſay, that ſocial intercourſe offers men the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of enjoyments? Do we derive no felicity from the fine arts, from knowledge, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of feelings? Is no pleaſure felt while we liſten to the ſtrains of muſic; while we read the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic numbers of poetry, or while we gaze on the landſcape, ornamented by the hand of cultivation? Who will ſay there are no pleaſures in knowledge? Surely not he who has felt the influence of one ray of that profuſion of ſcience which beams on the mind of the philoſopher, who has realized the force of moral truth, and enjoyed the luxury of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic demonſtration. Do we derive no felicity from refined feelings? Is there no delight in ſociability, no charm in friendſhip, no rapture in love? Is there no bleſſedneſs in beneficence, when, by a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of benefactions, the heart is warmed with gratitude, and dilated with benevolence?</p>
            <p>What ſolitary pleaſures can compare with theſe? Can the groſs fruition of the anchorite equal the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined felicity of conjugal intercourſe? Can the wild ſavageneſs of natural liberty afford a delight like the ſober undiſturbed ſatisfaction of civil freedom? Can the faith and devotion of the ſolitary, who "ſees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind," ſwell the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031892_0017_0FEF32F611E91D10"/>
ſoul with ſuch exalted beatitude as glows in the boſom of the Chriſtian, who, illumined by the full blaze of revelation, looks beyond the mountain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the lurid cloud, and, raptured, beholds a God of boundleſs mercy ſeated on the circuit of the heavens? No; even the happineſs of a ſolitary angel muſt ſink below the reach of computation, when once contraſted with the felicity of thoſe on earth, who ſtand within the embrace of ſocial intercourſe, and feel their ſouls enlarged by knowledge, refined by reaſon, illumined by revelation, warmed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and united by the ties of friendſhip and love.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Mr. Preſident, and Philological Brothers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON the anniverſary of our Society, it cannot be improper to call into recognition the final cauſes of its inſtitution. We aſſociated for mutual improvement; for increaſing our knowledge, and mending our hearts; and thus advancing our own felicity, and aſſiſting our brothers of the human race. Important duties are the conſequence of this aſſociation. It is in our power, and we are therefore obligated, to be more knowing, and better diſpoſed, than thoſe who are not of our fraternity.</p>
            <p>Our inſtitutions are calculated to forward theſe purpoſes. Our library, our diſſertative correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence, our quarterly diſputations, and our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic anniverſary, are all well deviſed to call up emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and diffuſe knowledge. A punctilious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe articles of our inſtitution will rapidly advance us in ſcience, and ſoon demonſtrate to the world that our pretenſions are not merely nominal.</p>
            <p>Something, however, beſides ſcience, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to conſtitute a good philologian. He muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in virtue, as well as knowledge; nor neglect
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031892_0019_0FEF32FDDCE7DB48"/>
the felicity of others, while he attends to his own. Much of all this is conſtantly within our power. We know a habit of doing well reſults from the practice of virtue; and this habit, confirmed by reiteration, will be the guardian of our ſouls, when vice hangs out her faſcinating lure; and the whiſper of frailty, or the clamour of paſſion, bids us follow her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing charms.</p>
            <p>Every day affords us opportunity to increaſe the joy, or diminiſh the grief of a fellow mortal. Some one may want our counſel, our inſtruction, our charity, our aſſiſtance, or our conſoling ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy. We may direct inexperience, relieve want, ſupport infirmity, and pluck the thorn of grief from the pillow of wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>There is not one of us but whoſe example is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential in the world. All this influence we ought to enliſt on the ſide of virtue. We ſhould patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize induſtry, as a ſource of wealth, ornament and knowledge; we ſhould baniſh indolence, as the prolific parent of poverty, ignorance, vice and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. Our conduct ſhould evince that we meaſure our actions by the rules of virtue, and revere the awful ſanctions of religion. We ſhould never look with approbation on fraud, or deceit, or treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor, without the moſt ſovereign indignation, behold the blaſphemous ſnear of infidelity. We ought to regard religion as the ſource of national peace, proſperity and happineſs. We know its ſanctions give energy to the public voice. We know its promiſes add a new delight to preſent joy, and bid wretchedneſs anticipate a region where ſhe ſhall never hear a ſigh, nor ſee a tear. We ought, therefore, to regard him, who would leſſen the influence of religion, as one diſpoſed to relax the laws, to diminiſh the pleaſures and multiply the miſeries of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:031892_0020_0FEF32FF6FBD1990"/>
We ſhould conſtantly labour for a removal of thoſe calamities which are the imperfection of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. Though we cannot pluck out the fang of jealouſy, nor unlock the chain of ſlavery, nor ſoothe the rage of war, nor break the wheel of perſecution; yet can we often huſh domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, often lighten the load of oppreſſion, and often tear away the maſk of hypocriſy, and ſhow the world the diſtorted viſage of ſanctified wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>To theſe things we are urged by the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting motives. Virtue and knowledge delight the mind, and elovate the character. They not only confer a dignity and reputation on their poſſeſſor, which converge the beams of glory round his head; but they alſo approximate him towards the nature of thoſe celeſtials that ſtand in the preſence of Him whoſe knowledge is omniſcience, whoſe goodneſs knows no limitation.</p>
            <p>We are this day, my brethren, ſurrounded by a numerous concourſe of our follow-citizens. For this honorary attention, we owe them a tribute of gratitude, which we cannot diſcharge unleſs by the moſt vigorous exertions for the benefit of our common country.</p>
            <p>In Europe, and in the United States, are many inſtitutions ſimilar to our own. Let us emulate them, in ſcience, in virtue, in religion; and, unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our exertions with thoſe of our ſiſter inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, improve the genius of our country, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Columbia to a model for the world.</p>
            <p>The infancy of our inſtitution calls on us for more than parental care, anxiety and ardour, to nurture its tender growth into an athletic maturity. While we feel this, let us remember, that the greateſt things, both in the natural and ſocial world, have originated from the ſmalleſt. Yes; the oak,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031892_0021_0FEF330113BE4A70"/>
whoſe trunk ſtands unbent againſt the tempeſt, whoſe branches are the habitation of the eagle, was once an embryo in the acorn. The Nile rolls down a copious ſtream, and fertilizes the fields of Egypt, while mountain ſhowers, and ſolitary fountains, are its ſource. Rome and Greece, whoſe philoſophers, orators and poets, have held aloft the glory of their country, and arreſted the gazing eyes of admiring poſterity, were, at firſt, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering hordes of hunters and ſhepherds. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive followers of that religion whoſe precepts <note n="*" place="bottom">Give men ſuch diſpoſitions as they will poſſeſs in the millennium. This word is coined according to the direction of Demetrius Phalerius on Elocution, ſec. 96.</note> millennialize the world; whoſe promiſes break up the iron bedchambers of death, and emancipate the buried nations; whoſe votaries ſhall eſcape the depredations of ages, and ſhine in renovated glory, when the ſun ſhall have loſt its ſplendour; the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of this religion were, once, but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but ſmall in power, and paſt the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhelter from the ſtorms, or a pillow for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Let us, my brothers, think on theſe things; and if we ſupport our inſtitution by purſuing ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by practiſing virtue, by feeling religion, we may anticipate the time when the name of Philolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian ſhall be the panegyric of greatneſs.</p>

                  <l>THAT Power, who warm'd the human breaſt,</l>
