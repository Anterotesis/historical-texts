            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <p>TO avoid diſeaſes, it is neceſſary we ſhould know their cauſes. Theſe indeed are numerous; but we ſhall endeavour to point out ſuch only as have the moſt general influence, as too great minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this reſpect would tend rather to perplex than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the generality of readers.</p>
                        <p>THE better to trace diſeaſes from their original cauſes, we ſhall take a view of the common treatment of mankind in the ſtate of infancy. In this period of our lives, the foundations of a good or bad conſtitution are generally laid; it is therefore of importance, that parents be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the various cauſes which may produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in their offspring. It muſt be owing either to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or careleſſneſs of parents, that ſo many of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies periſh in infancy. This, we preſume, will appear from the following obſervations.</p>
                        <p>THE annual regiſters of the dead ſhew, that at leaſt one half of the children born in Great Britain die under twelve years of age. To thoſe who do not reflect, this appears to be a natural evil, and therefore they think it their duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o ſubmit to it. But whoever accurately examines the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will find that it is an evil of our own making, and, in a great meaſure, owing to miſmanagement. Were the death of infants a natural evil, other animals ſhould be as liable to die young as man; but that we ſee is not the caſe.</p>
                        <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange, that man, notwithſtanding his ſuperior reaſon, ſhould fall ſo far ſhort of other animals
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:012338_0006_0F88EA96F8D18C28"/>
in the management of his young: But our ſurpriſe will ſoon ceaſe, if we conſider that brutes, guided by inſtinct, never err in this reſpect; while man, truſting ſolely to art, is ſeldom right. Were a catalogue of thoſe children who periſh annually by art alone, exhibited to public view, it would aſtoniſh moſt people.</p>
                        <p>WHEN parents are above taking care of their children, others muſt be employed for that purpoſe: Theſe will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavour to recommend themſelves by the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of extraordinary ſkill and addreſs. By this means ſo many unneceſſary and deſtructive articles have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the diet, cloathing, &amp;c. of children, that it is no wonder ſo many of them periſh.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING can be more prepoſterous than for a mother to think it below her to take care of her own child, or to be ſo ignorant as not to know what is proper to be done for it. If we ſearch nature throughout, we cannot find a parallel to this. Every other creature is the nurſe of its own young, and they thrive accordingly. Were the brutes to bring up their young by proxy, they would ſhare the ſame fate with thoſe of the human ſpecies.</p>
                        <p>WE mean not to impoſe it as a taſk upon every mother to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ckle her own child. This, whatever ſpeculative writers may ſay to the contrary, is in many caſes imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, and would inevitably prove deſtructive both to the mother and child. Women of delicate conſtitutions, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to low ſpirits, hyſteric fits, or other nervous diſorders, make very bad nurſes: But theſe complaints are now ſo common, that it is rare to find a woman of faſhion free from them; for which cauſe few women of better ſtation, ſuppoſe them willing, are really able to ſuckle their own children.</p>
                        <p>DID mankind live as nature directs, almoſt every mother would be in a condition to give ſuck: But, whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders how far we have deviated from her dictates, will not be ſurpriſed to find many of them unable to perform that neceſſary office. Mothers, who do not eat enough of ſolid food, nor enjoy the benefit of free air and exerciſe, can neither have wholeſome humours themſelves, nor afford proper nouriſhment to an infant. Children who are ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by delicate women, either die young, or are weak and ſickly all their lives. Nor is this at all to be wondered at. If children ſuck in nervous diſeaſes with their mother's milk, What have we to expect?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="3" facs="unknown:012338_0007_0F88EA97AF151DA8"/>
WHEN we ſay, that every mother is not able to ſuckle her own child, we would not be underſtood as diſcouraging that practice. Every mother who can, ought certainly to perform that tender office. But ſuppoſe it to be out of her power, ſhe may, nevertheleſs, be of great ſervice to her child. The buſineſs of nurſing is by no means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to giving ſuck. To a woman who abounds with milk, that is the eaſieſt part of it. Numberleſs other offices are neceſſary for a child, which the mother at leaſt ought to ſee done. A mother, who abandons the fruit of her womb, as ſoon as it is born, to the ſole care of an hireling, hardly deſerves that name. A child, by being brought up under the mother's eye, not only ſecures her affection, but may reap all the advantages of a mother's care, though it be ſuckled by another. How can a mother be better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, than in ſuperintending the nurſery? This is at once the moſt delightful and important office! yet the moſt trivial buſineſs or inſipid amuſements are often preferred to it. A ſtrong proof both of the bad taſte and wrong edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of modern females.</p>
                        <p>IT is much to be regretted, that more pains is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in teaching the proper management of children to thoſe whom nature has deſigned for mothers. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being made the principal, is ſeldom conſidered as any part of female education. Is it any wonder, when females, ſo educated, come to be mothers, that they ſhould be quite ignorant of the duties belonging to that ſtation? However ſtrange it may ſeem, it is certainly true, that many mothers, and thoſe of faſhion too, are as ignorant, when they have brought a child into the world, of what is proper to be done for it, as the infant itſelf. Indeed, the moſt ignorant part of the ſex are generally reckoned moſt knowing in the buſineſs of nurſing. Hence, ſenſible people become the dupes of ignorance and ſuperſtition; and the nurſing of children, inſtead of being conducted by reaſon, is the reſult of whim and caprice.</p>
                        <p>ONE great deſign of females, no doubt, is to propagate the ſpecies. But to bring forth a child, is the leaſt part of that important buſineſs. Were the care of a parent to ſtop here, the whole human race would ſoon be extinct. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made it neceſſary, that a child ſhould depend on its parents during the ſtate of infancy; and thoſe parents who neglect the proper care of their offspring, not only violate one of the firſt and ſtrongeſt principles of nature,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012338_0008_0F88EA98A58A2738"/>
but actually endeavour to extinguiſh the human race. An infant may be as certainly murdered by neglect, as by any act of violence whatever; and, for one child that loſes its life by the latter, a thouſand periſh by the former, without being regarded.</p>
                        <p>WERE the time that is generally ſpent by females in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring uſeleſs knowledge, employed in learning how to bring up their children; how to dreſs them ſo as not to hurt, cramp, or confine their motions; how to feed them with wholeſome and nouriſhing food; how to exerciſe their tender bodies, ſo as beſt to promote their growth and ſtrength: Were theſe the objects of female inſtruction, mankind would derive the greateſt advantage from it. But, while the education of females implies little more than what relates to dreſs and public ſhow, we have nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them but ignorance, even in the moſt important concerns. But ignorance can be no excuſe, where people have it in their power to be better informed; and, if chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren periſh by the negligence of mothers, they muſt be accountable.</p>
                        <p>DID mothers know their importance, and lay it to heart, they would embrace every opportunity of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the duties which they owe to their infant-offspring. It is theirs, not only to form the body, but alſo to give the mind its moſt early caſt. They have it very much in their power to make men healthy or valetudinary, uſeful in life, or the bane of ſociety.</p>
                        <p>BUT the mother is not the only perſon concerned in the management of children. The father has an equal intereſt in their welfare, and ought to aſſiſt in every thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects either the improvement of the body or mind.</p>
                        <p>IT is pity that men pay ſo little regard to this matter. Their neglect is one reaſon why females know ſo little of it. Women will ever be deſirous to excel in ſuch accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments as recommend them to the other ſex. But men generally keep at ſuch a diſtance from even the ſmalleſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the affairs of the nurſery, that many would eſteem it an affront, were they ſuppoſed to know any thing of it. Not ſo, however, with the kennel or the ſtables: A gentleman of the firſt rank is not aſhamed to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections concerning the management of his dogs or horſes; but would bluſh, were he to be ſurprized in performing the ſame office for that being, who derived its exiſtence from himſelf, who is the heir of his fortunes, and the future hope
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012338_0009_0F88EA9A43C0A9B0"/>
of his country. Few fathers indeed run any hazard of being ſurprized in this ſituation; yet, certain it is, that man needs culture more than any other creature, and that both his body and mind are capable of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. Nature has left ſo much in the power of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that children are, in a great meaſure, what they pleaſe to make them.</p>
                        <p>PHYSICIANS themſelves have not been ſufficiently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the management of children: That has been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered as the ſole province of old women, while men of the firſt rank in phyſick have even refuſed to viſit infants when ſick. Such conduct in the faculty has not only cauſed this branch of medicine to be neglected, but has alſo encouraged the other ſex to aſſume an abſolute title to preſcribe for children in the moſt dangerous diſeaſes. The conſequence is, that a phyſician is ſeldom called till the good women have exhauſted all their ſkill; when his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance can only ſerve to divide the blame and appeaſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate parents.</p>
                        <p>WE would have nurſes do all in their power to prevent diſeaſes; but, when a child is taken ill, ſome perſon of ſkill ſhould immediately be conſulted. The diſeaſes of children are generally acute, and the leaſt delay is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                        <p>WERE phyſicians more attentive to the diſeaſes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they would not only be better qualified to treat them properly when ſick, but likewiſe to give uſeful directions for their management when well. The diſeaſes of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is by no means ſuch a difficult ſtudy as many imagine. It is true, children cannot tell their complaints; but the cauſes of them may be pretty certainly diſcovered, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting proper queſtions to the nurſes and ſuch as are about them. Beſides, the diſeaſes of infants, being leſs compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, are eaſier cured than thoſe of adults.</p>
                        <p>IT is really aſtoniſhing, that ſo little attention ſhould in general be paid to the preſervation of infant-lives! What labour and expence are daily beſtowed to prop an old rotten carcaſe for a few years, while thouſands of thoſe, who might be uſeful in life, periſh without being regarded, and prove no better than an untimely birth! Mankind are apt to value things not according to their future but their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent utility. This is of all others the moſt erroneous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of eſtimation; yet, upon no other principle is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012338_0010_0F88EA9AACCAFAE0"/>
to account for the general indifference with reſpect to the death of infants.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>OF DISEASED PARENTS.</head>
                        <p>DISEASED parents cannot beget healthy children. It would be as reaſonable to expect a rich crop from a barren ſoil, as that ſtrong and healthy children ſhould be born of delicate parents, worn out with intemperance or diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>AN ingenious writer obſerves *, that on the conſtitution of mothers depends originally that of their offspring. No one who believes this, will be ſurpriſed, on a view of the female world, to find diſeaſes and death ſo frequent among children. A delicate female, brought up within doors, an utter ſtranger to exerciſe and open air, who lives on tea and other ſlops, may bring a child into the world, but it will hardly be fit to live. The firſt blaſt of a diſeaſe will nip the tender plant in the bud: Or, ſhould it ſtruggle through a few years exiſtence, its feeble frame, ſhook with convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from every trivial cauſe, would be unable to ſuſtain the common functions of life, and prove a burden to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                        <p>IF to the delicacy of mothers we add the irregular lives of fathers, we ſhall ſee further cauſe to believe, that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are often hurt by the conſtitution of their parents. A ſickly frame may be originally induced by hardſhips or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, but chiefly by the latter. It is impoſſible that a courſe of vice ſhould not ſpoil the beſt conſtitution: And did the evil terminate here, it would be a juſt puniſhment for the folly of the ſufferer; but when once a diſtemper is contracted and rivetted in the habit, it is entailed on all poſterity. What a dreadful inheritance is the gout, the ſcurvy, or the kings-evil, to tranſmit to our offspring! How happy had it been for the heir of many a great eſtate, had he been born a beggar, rather than to inherit his father's fortunes at the expence of likewiſe inheriting his diſeaſes!</p>
                        <p>NO perſon who labours under any incurable malady, ought to marry, as he thereby both ſhortens his own life, and tranſmits miſery to others: But when both parties are deeply tainted with the ſcrophula, the ſcurvy, or the like, the effects muſt be ſtill worſe. Such will either have no iſſue at all, or thoſe whom they have, muſt be miſerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Want of attention to theſe things, in forming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012338_0011_0F88EA9D3411D580"/>
for life, has rooted out more families than the plague, famine, or the ſword; and while theſe connections are formed from mercenary views, that muſt be the caſe.</p>
                        <p>IN our matrimonial contracts, it is amazing ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is had to the health and form of the object. Our ſportſmen know, that the generous courſer cannot be bred out of the foundered jade, nor the ſagacious ſpaniel out of the ſnarling cur. This is ſettled upon immutable laws. The man who marries a woman of a ſickly conſtitution, and deſcended of unhealthy parents, whatever his views may be, cannot be ſaid to act a prudent part. A puny ſcrophulous woman may prove fertile; ſhould this be the caſe, the family muſt become an infirmary. What proſpect of happineſs the father of ſuch a family has, we ſhall leave any one to judge.</p>
                        <p>THE Jews, by the poſitive direction of the Almighty, were forbid to have any manner of commerce with the diſeaſed; and indeed to this all wiſe legiſlators ought to have a ſpecial regard. In ſome ſtates, the marriage of morbid people has actually been prohibited. This is an evil of a complicated kind, a natural deformity, and political miſchief; and therefore requires a public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
                        <p>SUCH children as have the misfortune to be born of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed parents, will require to be nurſed with greater care than others. This is the only way to make amends for the defects of conſtitution; and it will often go a great length. A healthy nurſe, wholeſome air, and enough of exerciſe, will do wonders. But, when theſe are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, little is to be expected from any other quarter. The defects of conſtitution cannot be ſupplied by medicine.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who inherit any family-diſeaſe, ought to be very circumſpect in their manner of living. They ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well the nature of ſuch diſeaſe, and guard againſt it by a proper regimen. It is certain, that family-diſeaſes have often, by proper care, been kept off for one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is great reaſon to believe, that, by perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame courſe, ſuch diſeaſes might at length be wholely eradicated. This is a ſubject very little regarded, though of the laſt importance. Family-conſtitutions are as capable of improvement, as family-eſtates; and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, who impairs the one, does greater injury to his poſterity, than the prodigal who ſquanders away the other.</p>

                        <head>OF THE CLOATHING OF CHILDREN.</head>
                        <p>THE cloathing of an infant is ſo ſimple a matter, that it is ſurpriſing, how any perſon ſhould err in it; yet many children loſe their lives, and others are deformed, by errors of this kind.</p>
                        <p>NATURE knows no other uſe of cloaths to an infant, but to keep it warm. All that is neceſſary for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is to wrap it in a ſoft, looſe covering. Were a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left to the dictates of nature and reaſon, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the method that ſhe would follow. But the buſineſs of dreſſing an infant has long been out of the hands of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and has at laſt become a ſecret, which none but adepts pretend to underſtand.</p>
                        <p>FROM the moſt early ages it has been thought neceſſary, that a woman in labour ſhould have ſome perſon to attend her. This in time became a buſineſs; and, like all others, thoſe who were employed in it, ſtrove to outdo one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the different branches of their profeſſion. The dreſſing of a child came of courſe to be conſidered as the midwife's province, who no doubt imagined, that the more dexterity ſhe could ſhow in this article, the more her ſkill would be admired. Her attempts might be ſeconded by the vanity of parents, who wanting to make a ſhow of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant as ſoon as it was born, were ambitious to have as much finery heaped upon it as poſſible. Thus it came to be thought as neceſſary for a midwife to excel in bracing and dreſſing an infant, as for a ſurgeon to be expert in applying bandages to a broken limb; and the poor child, as ſoon as it came into the world, had as many rollers and wrappers applied to its body, as if every bone had been fractured in the birth; while theſe were often ſo tight, as not only to gall and wound its tender frame, but even to obſtruct the motion of the heart, lungs, and other organs neceſſary for life.</p>
                        <p>IN ſeveral parts of Britain the practice of rolling chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with ſo many bandages is now, in ſome meaſure, laid aſide; but it would ſtill be a difficult taſk to perſuade the generality of women, that the ſhape of a child does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely depend on the midwife's care. So far, however, are all their endeavours to mend the ſhape of children, from being ſucceſsful, that they conſtantly operate the contrary way, and mankind become deformed juſt in proportion to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012338_0013_0F88EA9E717FDC18"/>
the means uſed to prevent deformity. How little deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body is to be found among uncivilized nations? So little indeed, that it is vulgarly believed they put all their deformed children to death. The truth is, they hardly know ſuch a thing as a deformed child. Neither ſhould we, if we followed their example. Savage nations never think of manacling their children. They allow them the full uſe of every organ, carry them abroad in the open air, waſh their bodies daily in cold water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement their children become ſo ſtrong and hardy, that, by the time our puny infants get out of the nurſe's arms, theirs are able to ſhift for themſelves.</p>
                        <p>AMONG brute animals no art is neceſſary to procure a fine ſhape. Though many of them be extremely delicate, when they come into the world, yet we never find them grow crooked for want of ſwaddling-bands. Is nature leſs generous to the human kind? No: But we take the buſineſs out of nature's hands.</p>
                        <p>NOT only the analogy of other animals, but the very feelings of infants tell us, that they ought to be kept eaſy and free from all preſſure. They cannot indeed ſpeak their complaints; but they can ſhew ſigns of pain; and this they never fail to do, by crying, when pinched by their cloaths. No ſooner are they freed from their bracings, than they ſeem pleaſed and happy; yet, ſtrange infatuation! The moment they hold their peace, they are again committed to their chains.</p>
                        <p>IF we conſider the body of an infant as a bundle of ſoft pipes, repleniſh'd with fluids in continual motion, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of preſſure will appear in the ſtrongeſt light. Nature, in order to make way for the growth of children, has form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their bodies ſoft and flexible; and, leſt they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any injury from preſſure in the womb, has ſurrounded the <hi>foetus</hi> every way with fluids. This ſhews the care which nature takes to prevent all unequal preſſure on the bodies of infants, and to defend them againſt every thing that might in the leaſt cramp or confine their motions.</p>
                        <p>EVEN the bones of an infant are ſo ſoft and cartilaginous, that they readily yield to the ſlighteſt preſſure, and eaſily take on a bad ſhape, which can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ver after be remedied. Hence it is, that ſo many people appear with high ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, crooked ſpines and flat breaſts, who were born with as good a ſhape as others, but had the misfortune to be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012338_0014_0F88EA9F2AE72780"/>
ſqueezed into monſters by the application of ſtays and bandages.</p>
                        <p>PRESSURE, by obſtructing the circulation, prevents the equal diſtribution of nouriſhment to the different parts of the body, by which means the growth becomes unequal. One part of the body grows too large, while another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains too ſmall, and thus in time the whole frame becomes diſproportioned and misſhapen. To this we muſt add, that when a child is cramped in its cloaths, it naturally ſhrinks from the parts affected, and by putting its body into unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural poſtures, it becomes deformed by habit.</p>
                        <p>DEFORMITY of body may proceed from weakneſs or diſeaſes; but, in general, it is the effect of improper cloathing. Nine tenths, at leaſt, of the deformity amongſt mankind muſt be imputed to this cauſe. A deformed body is not only diſagreeable to the eye, but injurious to the health. By a bad figure both the animal and vital func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be impeded, and of courſe health impaired. Hence, few people remarkably misſhapen are ſtrong or healthy.</p>
                        <p>THE new motions which commence at the birth, as the circulation of the blood through the lungs, reſpiration, the periſtaltic motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> afford another ſtrong argument for keeping the body of an infant free from all preſſure. Theſe organs, not having been accuſtomed to move, are eaſily ſtopped; but when that happens, death muſt enſue. Hardly any method could be deviſed more effectually to ſtop theſe motions than bracing the body too tight with<note n="*" place="bottom">This is by no means inweighing againſt a thing that does not happen. In many parts of Britain at this day a roller, five or ſix feet in length, is applied round the child's body as ſoon as it is born.</note> rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were theſe to be applied in the ſame manner to the body of an adult, for an equal length of time, they could hardly fail to hurt the digeſtion and make him ſick. How much more hurtful they muſt be to tender infants, we ſhall leave any one to judge.</p>
                        <p>WHOEVER conſiders theſe things, will not be ſurpriſed, that ſo many children die of convulſions ſoon after the birth. Theſe fits are generally attributed to ſome inward cauſe; but, in fact, they oftener proceed from our own imprudent conduct. I have known a child ſeized with convulſion-fits, ſoon after the midwife had done ſwaddling it; but, upon taking off the rollers and bandages, it was
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012338_0015_0F88EAA01AC9C1F0"/>
immediately relieved, and never had any convulſion-fits af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Numerous examples of this ſort might be brought, were they neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IT would be ſafer to fix on the cloaths of an infant with ſtrings than pins, as theſe often gall and irritate their tender ſkins, and occaſion convulſions. Inſtances have been known, where pins were found ſticking above half an inch into the body of a child after it had died of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion-fits, which, in all probability, proceeded from that cauſe.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN are not only hurt by the tightneſs of their cloaths, but alſo by the quantity. Every child has ſome degree of fever after the birth; and, if it be loaded with too many cloaths, the fever muſt be increaſed. But that is not all; the child is generally laid in bed with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is likewiſe feveriſh; to which we may add the heat of the lying-in-bed-chamber, and the wines, and other heating things too often given to children immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the birth. When all theſe are combined, which does not ſeldom happen, they muſt increaſe the fever to ſuch a degree as will endanger the life of the infant.</p>
                        <p>THE danger of keeping infants too hot, will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we conſider, that, after being for ſome time in the ſituation mentioned above, they are often ſent into the country to be nurſed in a cold houſe *. Is it any wonder, if a child, from ſuch a tranſition, catches a mortal cold, or contracts ſome other fatal diſeaſe? When an infant is kept too hot, its lungs not being ſufficiently expanded, are apt to remain weak and flaccid for life; from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed coughs, conſumptions, and other diſeaſes of the breaſt.</p>
                        <p>IT would anſwer little purpoſe to ſpecify the particular pieces of dreſs proper for an infant. Theſe ever will vary in different places according to cuſtom and the humour of parents. The great rule to be obſerved is, <hi>That a child have no more cloaths than are neceſſary to keep it warm, and that they be quite eaſy for its body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>STAYS are the very bane of children. A volume would not ſuffice to point out all the ill effects of this uſeleſs piece of dreſs. The madneſs in favour of ſtays ſeems, however, to have been at a height; and it is to be hoped the world will, in time, become wiſe enough to know, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

                        <p>WE ſhall only add, with reſpect to the cloaths of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that they ought to be kept very clean. Children perſpire more than adults; and, if their cloaths be not frequently changed, they become very hurtful. Dirty cloaths not only gall and fret the tender ſkins of infants, but likewiſe occaſion ill ſmells; and, what is worſe, tend to produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>CLEANLINESS is not only agreeable to the eye, but tends greatly to preſerve the health of children.

                        <head>OF THE FOOD OF CHILDREN.</head>
                        <p>NATURE not only points out the food proper for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, but actually prepares it. This, however, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent ſome who think themſelves wiſer than nature, from attempting to bring up their children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her proviſion. Nothing can ſhow the diſpoſition which mankind have to depart from nature more than their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to bring up children without the breaſt. The mother's milk, or that of a healthy nurſe, is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the beſt food for an infant. Neither art nor nature can afford a proper ſubſtitute for it. A child may ſeem to thrive for a few months without the breaſt; but when teething, the ſmall-pox, and other diſeaſes incident to childhood come on, they generally fall a victim. An evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof, that their food is unwholeſome, and their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours bad.</p>
                        <p>A child ſoon after the birth ſhews an inclination to ſuck; and there ſeems to be no reaſon why it ſhould not be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. It is true, the mother's milk does not always come immediately after the birth; but is not this the way to bring it? The firſt milk that the child can ſqueeze out of the breaſt, anſwers the purpoſe of cleanſing better than all the drugs in the apothecary's ſhop, and at the ſame time
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012338_0017_0F88EAA22C7F8678"/>
prevents inflammations of the breaſt, fevers, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes incident to mothers.</p>
                        <p>IT is ſtrange how people came to think, that the firſt thing given to a child ſhould be drugs. This is beginning with medicines by times, and no wonder that they generally end with it. It ſometimes happens, that a child does not paſs the <hi>meconium</hi> ſo ſoon as could be wiſhed. This has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced phyſicians in ſuch caſes to give ſomething of an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature to cleanſe the firſt paſſages. Midwives have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon this hint, and never fail to give ſyrups, oils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether they be neceſſary or not. Cramming an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant with ſuch indigeſtible ſtuff as ſoon as it is born, can hardly fail to make it ſick, and is more likely to occaſion diſeaſes, than prevent them. Children are ſeldom long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the birth without having paſſage both by ſtool and urine; though theſe evacuations may be wanting for ſome time without any danger.</p>
                        <p>WERE a child permitted to ſuck its mother as ſoon as it ſhows an inclination for the breaſt, it would need no other phyſic; but if it muſt have ſomething before it be allowed the breaſt, let it be a little ſimple water-pap, to which may be added an equal quantity of new milk. If this be given without any wines, ſugars, or ſpiceries, it will neither heat the blood, load the ſtomach, nor occaſion gripes.</p>
                        <p>UPON the firſt ſight of an infant, almoſt every perſon is ſtruck with the idea of its being weak, feeble, and wanting ſupport. This naturally ſuggeſts the need of cordials. Accordingly we find wines univerſally mixed with the firſt food of children. Nothing can be more fallacious than this way of reaſoning, or more hurtful to infants than the conduct founded upon it. Children need very little food for ſome time after the birth; and what they receive, ſhould be thin, weak, light, and of a cooling quality. A very ſmall quantity of wine, or even ſugar, is ſufficient to heat and inflame the blood of an infant; but every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, converſant in theſe matters, muſt know, that moſt of the diſeaſes of infants proceed from the heat of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as the thruſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IF the mother or nurſe has enough of milk, the child will need little or no other food before the third or fourth month. It will then be proper to give it, once or twice a day, a little of ſome food that is eaſy of digeſtion; as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pap, milk-pottage, weak broth with bread in it, or the like. This will eaſe the mother; it will accuſtom the child
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012338_0018_0F88EAA41A558038"/>
by degrees to take food, and render the weaning both leſs difficult and dangerous. All great and ſudden tranſitions are to be avoided in nurſing. For this purpoſe the food of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be ſimple, as near as poſſible reſembling the properties of milk. Indeed milk itſelf ſhould make a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal part of their food, not only before they be weaned, but for a long time after.</p>
                        <p>NEXT to milk, we would recommend good light bread. Bread may be given to a child as ſoon as it ſhows an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to chew, and it may at all times be allowed as much as it pleaſes. The very chewing of bread will help to cut the teeth and promote the diſcharge of <hi>ſaliva,</hi> while by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the nurſe's milk in the ſtomach, it will afford an excellent nouriſhment. Children ſhow an early inclination to chew whatever is put into their hands. Parents obſerve the inclination, but generally miſtake the object. Inſtead of giving the child ſomething which may at once exerciſe its gums and afford it nouriſhment, they commonly put into its hand a piece of hard metal or impenetrable coral. A cruſt of bread is the beſt gum-ſtick. It not only anſwers the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe better than any thing elſe, but has the additional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties mentioned above, of nouriſhing the child and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the <hi>ſaliva</hi> down to the ſtomach, which is too valuable a liquor to be loſt.</p>
                        <p>BREAD, beſides being uſed dry, may be many ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared into food for children. One of the beſt methods of preparing it, is to boil it in water, afterwards pouring the water off, and mixing with the bread a proper quantity of new milk unboiled: Milk is both more wholeſome and nouriſhing this way than boiled, and is leſs apt to occaſion coſtiveneſs. For a child farther advanced, bread may be mixed in veal or chicken broth, made into puddings or the like. Bread is a proper food for children at all times, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be plain, made of wholeſome grain, and well fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; but when enriched with fruits, ſugars, or ſuch things, it becomes very unwholeſome.</p>
                        <p>IT is ſoon enough to allow children animal food when they have got teeth to eat it. They ſhould never taſte it till after they are weaned, and even then they ought to uſe it very ſparingly. Indeed, when children live wholely on vegetable food, it is apt to ſour on their ſtomachs; on the other hand, too much fleſh heats the blood and occaſions fevers and other inflammatory diſeaſes. This plainly points out a proper mixture of animal and vegetable food as moſt fit for children.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012338_0019_0F88EAA5B45A0210"/>
FEW things are more hurtful to children, than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of ſweetening their food. It not only makes them grow fat and bloated, but entices them to take more food than they ought to do. It is pretty certain, if childrens' food were quite plain, that they would never take more than enough. Thus the exceſſes of children are entirely owing to nurſes. If a child be gorged with food at all hours, and enticed to take it, by making it ſweet and agreeable to the palate, is it any wonder if ſuch a child comes in time to crave more food than it ought to have?</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN may be hurt by too little as well as too much food. After a child is weaned, it ought to be fed four or five times a-day; but ſhould never be accuſtomed to eat in the night; neither ſhould it have too much at one time. Some lay it down as a rule, that no child ought to be fed above three times in twenty-four hours; whereas, moſt adults eat four times in the ſame ſpace. The food of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is generally lighter than that of adults; their digeſtion is likewiſe more quickly performed: If to theſe we add the power of habit, we will be inclined to think, that children ſhould be fed oftener than up-grown perſons. If a child, who has been accuſtomed to ſuck its nurſe at all hours, be ſuddenly deprived of that, and reſtricted to three meals a-day, bad conſequences muſt follow. I have often ſeen the ſcheme of bringing children to live on three regular meals a-day tried, but never knew it ſucceed. Children thrive much better with ſmall quantities of food frequently given. This neither overcharges the ſtomach, nor hurts the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and is certainly moſt agreeable to nature.</p>
                        <p>WRITERS on nurſing, have inveighed with ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence againſt too much food, that one would be apt to imagine two thirds of thoſe who die in infancy were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally crammed to death. This has induced many parents to ruin the conſtitutions of their children, by running into the other extreme. The error of pinching children in their food, is more hurtful than its oppoſite. Nature has many ways of relieving herſelf when overcharged; but a child who is pinched with hunger will never become a ſtrong or healty man. That errors are frequently committed on both ſides, we are ready to acknowledge; but where one child is hurt by the quantity of its food, ten ſuffer from the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. That is the principle evil, and claims our ſtricteſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                        <p>MANY people imagine, that food which they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves cannot be bad for their children: But this notion is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012338_0020_0F88EAA653103BD8"/>
very abſurd. In the more advanced periods of life we often acquire an inclination for food which when children we could not bear to taſte. There are many things that may agree very well with the ſtomach of an up-grown perſon, which would be very hurtful to a child; as high-ſeaſoned, ſalted, and ſmoke-dried proviſions, &amp;c. It would alſo be improper to feed children with fat meat, ſtrong broths, rich ſoups, gravies, or the like.</p>
                        <p>ALL ſtrong liquors are hurtful to children. Some parents teach their children to guzzle ale, and other ſtrong liquors at every meal; but ſuch a practice cannot fail to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Theſe children ſeldom eſcape the violence of the ſmall-pox, meaſles, hooping-cough, or ſome other feveriſh diſorder. Milk, water, butter-milk, or whey, make the moſt proper drink for children. If they have any thing ſtronger, it may be fine ſmall bear, or a little wine mixed with water. The ſtomachs of children can digeſt well enough without the aſſiſtance of warm ſtimulants. Young people are naturally hot, and conſequently are eaſily hurt by every thing of a heating quality: Their blood has a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant tendency to inflammation, which all ſtrong liquors muſt increaſe.</p>
                        <p>FEW things are more hurtful to children than unripe fruits. Theſe not only ſour the ſtomach, but relax it and weaken the digeſtion; by which means it becomes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per neſt for worms of all kinds. Children indeed ſhow the greateſt inclination for fruit, and I am apt to believe, that if good ripe fruit were allowed them in proper quantity, it would have no bad effects. We ſeldom find a natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation wrong, if directed to its proper objects. Fruits are generally of a cooling nature, and correct the heat and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the humours. This is what moſt children want; only care ſhould be taken leſt they exceed. Indeed the beſt way to prevent children from going to exceſs in the uſe of fruit, or eating that which is bad, is to allow them a proper quantity of what is good.</p>
                        <p>ROOTS which contain a crude viſcid juice ſhould be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly given to children. They fill the body with groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and tend to produce eruptive diſeaſes. This caution is peculiarly neceſſary for the poor; being glad to get what will fill their children's bellies for a little money, they ſtuff them two or three times a-day with potatoes and the like. Children had better eat a ſmall quantity of ſuch food as would yield a wholeſome nouriſhment, than be crammed with what their digeſtive powers are unable properly to aſſimulate.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="17" facs="unknown:012338_0021_0F88EAA6AE6A5EB8"/>
BUTTER ought likewiſe to be ſparingly given to children. It both relaxes the ſtomach, and produces groſs humours. Indeed, moſt things that are fat or oily, have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Butter, when ſalted, becomes ſtill more hurtful. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of butter, ſo plentifully eat by children in moſt parts of Britain, we would recommend honey. Honey is not only more wholeſome than butter, but likewiſe cheaper. It is cooling, cleanſing, and tends to ſweeten the humours; whereas butter is juſt the reverſe. Children who eat honey are ſeldom troubled with worms. They are alſo leſs ſubject to the common cutaneous diſeaſes, as itch, ſcabbed-head, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>MANY people err in thinking the diet of children ſhould be always moiſt. When children live entirely upon ſlops, it relaxes their ſolids, renders them weak, and prediſpoſes them to rickets, ſcrophulas, and other glandular diſorders. Relaxation is one of the moſt general cauſes of the diſeaſes of children. Every thing therefore which tends to unbrace their bodies ought to be carefully avoided.</p>
                        <p>WE would not be underſtood as confining children to any particular kind of food. Their diet may be frequently varied, provided regard be had to ſimplicity. Whatever food we are moſt accuſtomed to in youth, we generally love during life. For this reaſon children ſhould have a little of any kind of food that is plain and wholeſome, leſt they ſhould contract an averſion for it, and afterwards be under the neceſſity of uſing it.</p>

                        <p>THE deſire of exerciſe is almoſt co-eval with life itſelf. Were this principle attended to, many diſeaſes might be prevented. But while indolence and ſedentary employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments keep two thirds of mankind from either taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves, or giving it to their children, what have we to expect but diſeaſes and deformity among their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring? The rickets, ſo deſtructive to children, never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012338_0022_0F88EAA7AC200540"/>
in Britain till manufactures began to flouriſh, and people, attracted by the love of gain, left the country to follow ſedentary employments in great towns. It is amongſt theſe people that this diſeaſe chiefly prevails, and not only deforms, but kills many of their offspring.</p>
                        <p>THE analogy of other animals ſhews that children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire exerciſe. Every creature endeavours to make uſe of its organs as ſoon as it can, and many of them, even when under no neceſſity of moving in queſt of food, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained without force. This is evidently the caſe with the calf, the lamb, and many other young animals. If theſe creatures were not permitted to friſk about, and take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, they would ſoon die. The ſame inclination appears very early in the human ſpecies; but as they are not able to take exerciſe themſelves, it is the buſineſs of their parents or nurſes to aſſiſt them.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN may be exerciſed various ways. The beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, while light, is to carry them about in the nurſe's arms.

                        <p>IT is a common notion, that if children be ſet upon their feet too ſoon, their legs will become crooked. There is reaſon to believe, that the very reverſe of this is true. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member acquires ſtrength in proportion as it is exerciſed. The limbs of children are weak indeed, but their bodies are proportionably light; and had they ſkill to direct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they would ſoon be able to ſupport their own weight. Who ever heard of any other animal that became crooked by uſing its legs too ſoon? Indeed if a child be not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make uſe of its legs till a conſiderable time after the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012338_0023_0F88EAA82A7366B0"/>
birth, and be then ſet upon them with its whole weight at once, there may be ſome danger of hurting it; but this proceeds intirely from the child's not having been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe its legs from the beginning.</p>
                        <p>MOTHERS of the poorer ſort think they gain a great deal by making their children lie or ſit while they work. In this they are greatly miſtaken. By neglecting to give their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren exerciſe, they are obliged to keep them a long time before they can do any thing for themſelves, and to ſpend more on medicine than would have paid for proper care, while it can never ſupply its place. To take care of their children, is the moſt profitable buſineſs in which even the poor can employ themſelves: But alas! it is not always in their power. Poverty often obliges them to neglect their offspring, in order to procure the neceſſaries of life. When that is the caſe, it becomes the intereſt as well as the duty of the public to aſſiſt them. Ten thouſand times more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit would accrue to the ſtate, by enabling the poor to bring up their own children, than from all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This I have had many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of obſerving. A ſmall premium given to the poor annually for every child they have alive, would ſave more infant-lives than if the whole revenues of the nation were expended on hoſpitals for that purpoſe. This would make the poor eſteem fertility a bleſſing; whereas many of them think it the greateſt curſe that can befal them; and in place of wiſhing their children to live, ſo far does po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty get the better of natural affection, that they are very happy when they die.</note> hoſpitals that ever can be erected for that purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>WHOEVER conſiders the ſtructure of the human body, will ſoon be convinced of the neceſſity of exerciſe for the health of children. The body is compoſed of an infinite number of veſſels, whoſe contents cannot be puſhed on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the action and preſſure of the muſcles. But if the fluids remain inactive, obſtructions muſt happen, and the humours will of courſe be vitiated, which cannot fail to occaſion diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Nature has furniſhed both the veſſels which carry the blood and lymph with numerous valves, in order that the action of every muſcle might puſh forward their contents; but without action this admirable contrivance can have no effect. The final cauſe of this part of the animal oeconomy proves the neceſſity of exerciſe for the preſervation of health.</p>
                        <p>ARGUMENTS to ſhew the importance of exerciſe might be drawn from every part of the animal oeconomy: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012338_0024_0F88EAA96B803B00"/>
exerciſe the circulation of the blood cannot be properly carried on, nor the different ſecretions duly performed; without exerciſe the humours cannot be properly prepared, nor the ſolids rendered ſtrong or firm. The action of the heart, the motion of the lungs, and all the vital functions are greatly aſſiſted by exerciſe. But to point out the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which theſe effects are produced, would lead us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the oeconomy of the human body, than moſt of thoſe for whom this treatiſe is intended, would be able to follow. We ſhall therefore only add, that where exerciſe is neglected, none of the animal functions can be duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and when that is the caſe, the whole conſtitution muſt go to wreck.</p>
                        <p>CERTAINLY our firſt object in the management of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be a good conſtitution. This lays a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for their being uſeful and happy in life; and whoever neglects it, not only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ails in his duty to his offspring, but to ſociety.</p>
                        <p>ONE very common error of parents, by which they hurt the conſtitutions of their children, is ſending them too young to ſchool. This is often done ſolely to prevent trouble. When the child is at ſchool, he needs no keeper. Thus the ſchoolmaſter is made the nurſe; and the poor child is nailed to a ſeat ſeven or eight hours a-day, which ought to be ſpent in exerciſe and diverſions. Sitting ſo long cannot fail to produce the worſt effects upon the body; nor is the mind leſs injured. Early application weakens the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and often fixes in the mind ſuch an averſion from books as can never be removed.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſuppoſe this were the way to make children ſcholars, that ought not to be done at the expence of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Our anceſtors, who ſeldom went to ſchool before they were men, were not leſs learned than we. But we imagine the boy's education will be quite loſt unleſs he be carried to ſchool in his nurſe's arms. No wonder if ſuch hot bed plants ſeldom become either ſcholars or men!</p>
                        <p>NOT only the confinement in public ſchools, but the number often proves extremely hurtful. Children are much injured by being kept in crowds within doors; their breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only renders the place unwholeſome; but if any one of them happens to be diſeaſed, the reſt catch the infection. A ſingle child has been often known to communicate the bloody-flux, the hooping-cough, the itch, or other diſeaſes, to almoſt every individual in a numerous ſchool.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012338_0025_0F88EAA9CDC767A0"/>
BUT if faſhion will prevail, and infants muſt be ſent to ſchool, we would earneſtly recommend to teachers, as they value the intereſts of ſociety, not to confine them too long at a time; but to permit them to run about and play at ſuch active diverſions as may promote their growth and improve their conſtitutions. Were boys, inſtead of being whipped, for ſtealing an hour to run, ride, ſwim, or the like, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to employ their time in theſe manly and uſeful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, it would have many excellent effects.</p>
                        <p>IT would likewiſe be of great ſervice to boys, if at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, they were all taught the military exerciſe. This would improve their ſtrength, courage, and agility; and, when their country called for their aſſiſtance, it would enable them to act in her defence, without being obliged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a tedious and troubleſome courſe of inſtructions, at a time when they are leſs fit to learn new motions, geſtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AN effeminate education will infallibly ſpoil the beſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſtitution; and, if boys are brought up in a more delicate manner than even girls ought to be, they never will be men.</p>
                        <p>BUT the common education of girls is no leſs hurtful to the conſtitution than that of boys. Miſs is ſet down to her frame, before ſhe can put on her cloaths; and is taught to believe, that to excel at the needle is the only thing that can intitle her to general eſteem. It is unneceſſary here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon the dangerous conſequences of obliging girls to ſit too much. They are pretty well known, and are too often felt at a certain time of life. But ſuppoſe this critical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to be got over, greater dangers ſtill await them when they come to be mothers. Women who have been early accuſtomed to a ſedentary life, generally run great hazard in childbed; while thoſe who have been uſed to romp about, and take enough of exerciſe, are ſeldom in any danger.</p>
                        <p>ONE hardly meets with a girl who can, at the ſame time, boaſt of early performances by the needle, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Cloſe and early confinement generally occaſions indigeſtions, headachs, pale complexions, pain of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, loſs of appetite, coughs, conſumptions of the lungs, and deformity of body. The latter indeed is not to be wondered at, conſidering the aukward poſtures in which girls ſit at many kinds of needle-work, and the delicate flexible ſtate of their bodies in the early periods of life.</p>
                        <p>WOULD mothers, inſtead of having their daughters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in many uſeleſs accompliſhments, teach them plain
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012338_0026_0F88EAAB66F35810"/>
work and houſewifery, allowing them enough of time to run about, they would both make them better mothers and more uſeful members of ſociety. I am no enemy to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel accompliſhments, but would have them only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſecondary, and always diſregarded when they impair health.</p>
                        <p>MANY people imagine it a great advantage for children to be early taught to gain their bread. This opinion is certainly right, provided they be ſo employed as not to hurt their health or growth; but, when theſe ſuffer, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, in place of being gainers, are real loſers by their labour. There are few employments, except ſedentary ones, by which children can earn a livelihood; and, if they be ſet to thoſe too ſoon, it ruins their conſtitutions. Thus, by gaining a few years from childhood, we generally loſe twice as many in the other periods of life, and even render the perſon leſs valuable while he does live.</p>
                        <p>IN order to be ſatisfied of the truth of this obſervation, one needs only look into the great manufacturing towns, where he will find a puny degenerate race of people, weak and ſickly all their lives, ſeldom exceeding the middle pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life; or, if they do, being unfit for buſineſs, they become a burden to ſociety. Thus, arts and manufactures, though they may increaſe the riches of a country, are by no means favourable to the health of its inhabitants. Good policy would therefore require, that ſuch people as labour during life, ſhould not be ſet too early to work. Every perſon converſant in the breeding of horſes, or other work-animals, knows, that, if they be ſet to hard labour too ſoon, they never will turn out to advantage. This is equally true with reſpect to the human ſpecies.</p>
                        <p>THERE are nevertheleſs various ways of employing young people, without hurting their health. The eaſier parts of gardening, huſbandry, or any buſineſs carried on without doors, are moſt proper. Theſe are employments that moſt young people are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ond of, and ſome parts of them may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be adapted to their age, taſte and ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>SUCH parents, however, as are under the neceſſity of employing their children within doors, ought to allow them enough of time for active diverſions. This would both encourage them to do more work, and prevent their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions from being hurt.</p>
                        <p>SOME imagine, that exerciſe within doors is ſufficient; but they are greatly miſtaken. One hour ſpent in running,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012338_0027_0F88EAABE9CC8020"/>
or any other exerciſe without doors, is worth ten within. When children cannot go abroad, they ought indeed to be exerciſed at home. The beſt method of doing this, is to make them run about in a long room, or dance. This laſt kind of exerciſe, if not carried to exceſs, is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſervice to young people. It cheers the ſpirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes perſpiration, ſtrengthens the limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An eminent phyſician uſed to ſay, that he made his children dance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving them phyſic. It were well, if more people followed his example.</p>
                        <p>AS many of the chronic diſeaſes of children might be prevented by the prudent uſe of the COLD BATH, we ſhall point out ſome of thoſe miſtakes which commonly prevent its having the deſired effect.</p>
                        <p>THE Cold Bath may be conſidered as an aid to exerciſe. By it the body is braced and ſtrengthened, the circulation and ſecretions promoted, and, were it conducted with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, many diſeaſes, as the rickets, ſcrophula, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might thereby be prevented. The antients, who took every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to render children hardy and robuſt, were no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the uſe of the cold bath; and, if we may judge from the great number of conſecrated wells in this iſland, many of which poſſeſs no other virtues but thoſe of cold water, yet are ſaid to have been famous for curing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of children, we will ſee cauſe to believe, that the practice of immerſing children in cold water muſt have been very common amongſt our anceſtors.</p>
                        <p>SO far as I have been able to obſerve, the cold bath does as much miſchief as good; but that is owing to the want of due care in uſing it. Children born of delicate parents are not ſuddenly to be plunged over the head in cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They muſt be gradually brought to it by uſing tepid water at firſt, and making it a little cooler every time they are bathed, till by degrees they be able to bear it quite cold. Children afflicted with internal diſeaſes, as inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations or obſtructions of the breaſt, bowels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought not to be bathed in cold water. No child ſhould be put into the cold bath, when its body is hot, nor immediately after a meal.</p>
                        <p>IT is next to impoſſible to bring nurſes to make a proper uſe of the cold bath: Their prejudices are ſo ſtrong and deep-rooted, that no reaſoning is able to bring them off their own way. I have known ſome of them, who would not dry a child's ſkin after bathing it, leſt it ſhould deſtroy
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012338_0028_0F88EAADD77F2EB8"/>
the effect of the water. Others will even put cloaths dipt in the water upon the child, and either put it to bed, or ſuffer it to go about in that condition. Some nurſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the whole virtue of the water depends upon its being dedicated to ſome particular ſaint. Theſe will carry a child 40, 50, or 100 miles to have it once dipt in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain well; and this is to cure it of whatſoever diſeaſe it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under. Others place their confidence in a certain number of dips, as three, ſeven, nine, or the like, and the world could not perſuade them, if theſe do not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to try it a little longer.</p>
                        <p>THUS, by the whims and caprice of nurſes, a valuable medicine is loſt, and the phyſician is often diſappointed in his hopes by their miſconduct. When the cold bath is uſed as a medicine, it ought always to be by the advice of a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, and the nurſe ſhould adhere ſtrictly to his directions. I have ſeen wonderful cures in the moſt obſtinate ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous caſes performed by the cold bath. The ſalt water in this caſe is always to be preferred. That will ſucceed where all other medicines have failed.</p>
                        <p>EVERY child, when in health, ought to have its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities at leaſt waſhed with cold water daily. This is a partial uſe of the cold bath, and is better than none. In winter this may ſuffice; but in the warm ſeaſon, if a child be relaxed, or ſeem to have a tendency to the rickets or ſcrophula, its whole body ought to be daily immerſed in cold water. Care however muſt be taken not to do this when the body is hot, or the ſtomach full. The child ſhould be dipt only once at a time, ſhould be taken out immediately, and have its ſkin well rubbed with a dry cloth.</p>

                        <head>OF THE BAD EFFECTS OF UNWHOLESOME AIR UPON CHILDREN.</head>
                        <p>FEW things are more deſtructive to children than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined or unwholeſome air. This is one reaſon why ſo few of thoſe infants live who are put into hoſpitals, or pariſh-workhouſes. Theſe places are generally crowded with old, ſickly and infirm people. By that means the air is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſo extremely pernicious, that it becomes a poiſon to infants.</p>
                        <p>WANT of wholeſome air is likewiſe deſtructive to many of the children born in great towns. There the poorer ſort
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012338_0029_0F88EAAE5BC0D3F0"/>
of inhabitants live in low, dirty, confined houſes, where the freſh air has no acceſs. Though up-grown people, who are hardy and robuſt, may live for a number of years in ſuch ſituations, yet they generally prove fatal to their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, few of whom arrive at maturity, and thoſe who do, are weak and deformed. Such people, not being able to carry their children abroad into the open air, we muſt lay our account with loſing the greater part of their progeny. But the rich have not that excuſe. It is their buſineſs to ſee that their children be daily carried abroad, and that they be kept in the open air for a ſufficient time. This will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed better, if the mother goes along with them. Servants are often negligent in theſe matters, and allow a child to ſit or lie on the damp ground, in place of leading or carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about. The mother ſurely needs air as well as her children; and how can ſhe be better employed than in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them? Some may think this office below their dignity; but I know no ſituation in which a mother ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to ſuch advantage, as when ſurrounded by a circle of healthy children.</p>
                        <p>A very bad cuſtom prevails of making children ſleep in ſmall apartments, or crowding two or three beds into one chamber. In place of that, the nurſery ought always to be the largeſt and beſt aired room in the houſe. When children are confined in ſmall apartments, the air is not only unwholeſome, but ſuch places being generally too hot, their bodies are relaxed, and this diſpoſes them to catch cold when they go abroad, and has many other bad effects.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN who are kept within doors all day, and ſleep all night in warm cloſe apartments, may, with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, be compared to plants nurſed in a hot-houſe, in place of the open air. Though ſuch plants, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care, may be kept alive for ſome time; yet they never will arrive at that degree of ſtrength, vigour and magnitude, which they would have done in the open air, nor would they be able to bear it afterwards, ſhould they be expoſed to it.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN brought up in the country, who have been accuſtomed to freſh open air, ſhould not be too early ſent to great towns, where the air is confined and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. This is frequently done with a view to forward their education, but proves very hurtful to health. Thoſe who are grown up, do not ſuffer near ſo much from bad
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012338_0030_0F88EAAEEA7969C0"/>
air as young perſons. All ſchools and ſeminaries of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to be ſo ſituated as to have freſh, dry, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome air, and ſhould never be too much crowded.</p>
                        <p>WITHOUT entering into a detail of the particular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of wholeſome air to children, we ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when they enjoy that bleſſing, they generally ſleep well, eat well, and thrive accordingly. It braces and ſtrengthens their bodies, enlivens their ſpirits, and every way promotes their growth and health.</p>

                        <head>OF NURSES.</head>
                        <p>NURSES are guilty of many faults, which prove fatal to infants. It is therefore the duty of parents to watch over their conduct with the greateſt care, and to be extremely cautious in the choice of them.</p>
                        <p>ONE of the moſt common faults of nurſes is to doſe children with ſtupifactives, or ſuch things as lull them aſleep. An indolent nurſe, who does not give a child enough of exerciſe in the open air to make it ſleep, and does not chuſe to be diſturbed by it in the night, will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail to procure for it a doſe of laudanum, diacodium, ſaffron, or, what anſwers the ſame end, a dram of ſpirits, or other ſtrong liquors. Theſe, though they be certain poiſon to children, are every day adminiſtered by many who bear the character of very good nurſes.</p>
                        <p>A nurſe who has not enough of milk, is apt to imagine, that ſhe can ſupply that defect by giving the child wines, cordial waters, or other ſtrong liquors. This is an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious miſtake. The only thing that has any chance to ſupply the place of the nurſe's milk, muſt be ſomewhat nearly of the ſame quality, as cow's milk, aſs's milk, or the like, with good bread. It never can be done by the help of ſtrong liquors. Theſe, in place of nouriſhing an infant, never fail to produce the contrary effect.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN are often hurt by nurſes permitting them to cry long and vehemently. This ſtrains their tender bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and frequently occaſions ruptures, inflammations of the throat, lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The nurſe who can hear an infant cry till it has almoſt exhauſted itſelf, without endeavouring to pleaſe it, muſt be cruel indeed, and is unworthy to be truſted with the care of a human creature.</p>
                        <p>NURSES who deal much in medicine, are always to be ſuſpected. They truſt to it, and neglect their duty. I

never knew a good nurſe who had her Godfrey's cordials, Daffy's elixirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at hand. Such generally imagine, that a doſe of theſe will make up for all defects in food, air, exerciſe, cleanlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A very pernicious cuſtom of indolent nurſes is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of children to continue long wet. This is not only diſagreeable, but it galls and frets the infant, and by relaxing the ſolids, occaſions ſcrophulas, rickets, and other fatal diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>NATURE often attempts to free the bodies of children from bad humours, by throwing them out upon the ſkin: By that means fevers, and other diſeaſes are prevented. Nurſes are apt to miſtake ſuch critical eruptions for an itch, or ſome other infectious diſorder. Accordingly they take every method to drive them in. In this way many children loſe their lives; and no wonder, as nature is oppoſed in the very method that ſhe took to relieve them. It ought to be a rule which every nurſe ſhould obſerve, never to ſtop any eruption without proper advice, or being well aſſured, that it is not of a critical nature. At any rate it is never to be done without previous evacuations.</p>
                        <p>LOOSE ſtools is another method by which nature often prevents the diſeaſes of infants. If theſe proceed too far, no doubt they ought to be checked; but this is never to be done without the greateſt caution. Nurſes, upon the firſt appearance of looſe ſtools, frequently fly to the uſe of aſtringents, or ſuch things as bind the belly. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, fevers, and other fatal diſeaſes are brought on. A doſe of rhubarb, a gentle vomit, or ſome other evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould always precede the uſe of aſtringent medicines.</p>
                        <p>ONE of the greateſt faults of nurſes is concealing the diſeaſes of children from their parents. This they are extremely ready to do, eſpecially when the diſeaſe is the effect of their own negligence. Every perſon muſt have ſeen inſtances of people who were lame for life, by a fall out of the nurſe's arms, while ſhe, through fear, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the miſfortune till it was paſt cure. Every parent who intruſts a nurſe with the care of a child, ought to give her the ſtricteſt charge not to conceal the moſt trifling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order or misfortune that may befal it. Parents, inſtead of being angry, when a nurſe informs them of ſuch accidents, ought to reward her for her honeſty; this would encourage her to do the ſame upon other occaſions. We can ſee no reaſon why a nurſe ſhould not be puniſhed who conceals
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012338_0032_0F88EAB06F32F648"/>
any diſorder or misfortune that happens to a child under her care, till it loſes its life. A few examples of this would ſave many infant lives; but as there is little reaſon to expect, that it ever will be the caſe, we would earneſtly recommend it to all parents to look carefully after their children, and not to truſt ſo valuable a treaſure entirely in the hands of an hireling.</p>
                        <p>THESE, and many other faults, being daily committed by thoſe who have the care of children, it ought ſurely to rouſe the attention of all parents who have any regard for their offspring, and to make them very circumſpect in the choice of thoſe into whoſe hands they commit them. They ought at leaſt to take care that a nurſe be ſober, cleanly, honeſt, healthy, not too young, nor the contrary; that ſhe have the neceſſaries of life, and a comfortable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WERE it practicable to have all children nurſed and educated in the country, we ſhould loſe very few of them. One ſeldom ſees a country-farmer without a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, moſt of whom arrive at maturity. Many things conſpire to that end. The children of theſe people are generally nurſed by their mothers; they eat plain whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, enjoy the benefit of freſh air, and have enough of proper exerciſe; they have rural ſports and paſtimes ſuited to their age, and as they grow up, find employments adapted to their ſtrength, agreeable to their inclinations, and conducive to their health. They learn induſtry and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety from their parents, and ſeldom fail to practiſe theſe virtues for life. In fine, we cannot help joining with the learned Mr. Locke<note n="*" place="bottom">On Education.</note>, in recommending the example of theſe people as a model to all in the management of their children.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. EVERY mother ought to ſuckle her own child, if ſhe can do it with ſafety.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A weak, conſumptive, nervous, or hyſteric mother ought not to give ſuck, where a healthy nurſe can be had.</p>

3. No child ſhould be brought up without the breaſt, if it be poſſible to obtain a proper nurſe.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The cloaths of an infant ſhould be ſoft, light, looſe and eaſy for its body. They ought to be faſtened on with ſtrings rather than pins.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The cloths of children ought to be kept very clean.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. A new born infant ſhould not be kept too hot.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. AN infant ſhould be permitted to ſuck as ſoon as it ſhows an inclination for the breaſt.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. AN infant ſhould neither be crammed with food nor phyſic as ſoon as it is born; but permitted to lie quiet for ſome time, in order to recover the fatigue of the birth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. IF an infant muſt have food before it ſucks, let it be water-pap mixed with new milk, free of all wines, ſugars, ſpiceries, or the like.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. WHILE the child ſucks, it ſeldom needs much of any other food. It will however be right, about the third or fourth month, to begin to give it once or twice a-day a little of ſome food that is light and eaſy of digeſtion. This will make the weaning both leſs troubleſome and dangerous.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. A child ſhould not be weaned all at once, but by degrees; as all ſudden changes in the diet of children are dangerous.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. THE food of children ought at all times to be ſimple, but nouriſhing. It ſhould conſiſt of a proper mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of animal and vegetable ſubſtances.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. CHILDREN ſhould not be permitted to eat too much fruit, or roots of any kind; but all ſorts of green traſh ought to be kept from them with the greateſt care.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. CHILDREN ought not to be pinched in their food. They require to eat oftener than adults.—If their food be ſimple, and they know that they can have it when hungry, they will ſeldom or never eat more than enough.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. As ſoon as children can take exerciſe, they ought to be allowed as much as they pleaſe; till then it is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the nurſe to carry and toſs them about.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. A nurſe ought not only to carry an infant about, but to divert and amuſe it ſo as to keep it in good humour.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. AN infant ſhould never be ſuffered to cry long and vehemently.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. ERUPTIONS, or looſeneſs in children, ought not to be ſtopt, but with the greateſt caution.</p>

19. NURSES ſhould uſe no means to force children to ſleep; but they may always be permitted to take as much as they pleaſe.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. CHILDREN ought never to have medicine unleſs they are diſeaſed.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. CHILDREN ſhould neither be too early ſet to ſchool, nor confined to any mechanical employment within doors.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. SCHOOLMASTERS, and all who have the care of youth, ſhould allow them plenty of time for exerciſe and diverſions.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. ALL children ſhould be nurſed and educated in the country, if poſſible. When that cannot be done, they ought to be carried abroad every day, and kept for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time in the open air.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. THE children of delicate and diſeaſed parents muſt be managed with more care than thoſe of the hardy and robuſt.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. A mother ſhould never abandon her child ſolely to the care of a mercenary nurſe.</p>
                        <p>LET no one imagine theſe matters unworthy of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. On the proper management of children depend not only their health and uſefulneſs in life, but likewiſe the ſafety and proſperity of the ſtate to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Effeminacy ever muſt prove the ruin of any king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and when its foundations are laid in infancy, it can never afterwards be wholely eradicated. We would therefore recommend to all who wiſh well to their country, to ſtudy every method to render their offspring ſtrong and healthy.</p>

                        <p>HAVING endeavoured to point out ſome of the ſources from which the diſeaſes and mortality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants proceed, we ſhall next take a view of the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſes of diſeaſes, or ſuch things as endanger the health of mankind in the more advanced periods of life.</p>
                        <p>NO man, however careful, can at all times avoid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; yet nothing is more certain than that many of them, and thoſe too of the moſt dangerous nature, are often ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the want of care. The ſmalleſt cauſes, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, generally produce the greateſt effects. This is ſtrictly true with reſpect to diſeaſes. A little care would often prevent what no medicine can cure.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt common cauſe of diſeaſes in this iſland is an obſtructed perſpiration, or what commonly goes by the name of CATCHING COLD. The perſpiration is by far the moſt conſiderable diſcharge from the body; and ſo long as it goes on properly, we have ſeldom any complaints; but when it is obſtructed, the health muſt ſuffer. Men being leſs ſenſible of this than of the other evacuations, are conſequently not ſo attentive to the various cauſes which obſtruct it: We ſhall therefore point out ſome of the moſt conſiderable of them, in order to put people upon their guard.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>COMMON CAUSES OF CATCHING COLD.</head>
                        <p>COLDS are often occaſioned by ſudden changes in the atmoſphere. There is no country where ſuch changes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen more frequently than in Britain. The degrees of heat and cold are not only various in the different ſeaſons of the year, but often change from the one extreme to the other in a few days, and ſometimes even in the courſe of one day. As theſe changes cannot fail to increaſe or diminiſh the perſpiration, they muſt of courſe affect the health.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt method of fortifying the body againſt the changes of the weather, is to be abroad every day. Thoſe who keep much within doors, are moſt liable to catch cold.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012338_0036_0F88EAB689413F58"/>
Such people feel even the ſlighteſt changes in the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, and by their coughs, pains and oppreſſions of the breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> become a kind of living barometers.</p>
                        <p>THE frequent changes of the weather ought to make us cautious in changing our apparel. All perſons, but eſpecially the valetudinary, ſhould be careful not to put off their winter-garments too ſoon, nor to wear their ſummer ones too long. The commencement of our warm ſeaſon is ſo uncertain, that a few hot days in April or May often make us believe ſummer is arrived; when all of a ſudden the weather ſets in more intenſely cold than at Chriſtmas. The like ſudden changes frequently happen in September or October; and where no care is taken to guard againſt their influence, the gout, rheumatiſms, fluxes and fevers often enſue.</p>
                        <p>LABOURERS frequently ſuffer by not attending to the changes of the weather. They ſtrip to work while it is warm, but neglect to put on their cloaths when it grows cold; ſome are even thoughtleſs enough to diſregard being wet; ſuch however, in the end, generally find cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent their fool-hardineſs.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING more certainly obſtructs the perſpiration than WET CLOATHS. Nor is the moſt robuſt conſtitution proof againſt their effects. The perſpiration is not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by wet cloaths, but the moiſture is likewiſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed, which greatly encreaſes the danger.</p>
                        <p>It is impoſſible for people who go abroad, always to avoid being wet. But the danger might generally be leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, if not wholely prevented, by changing their cloaths ſoon; when that cannot be done, they ſhould keep in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till they dry. So far are many from obſerving this rule, that they will ſit, or even lie down in the fields with their cloaths wet, and frequently ſleep whole nights in that condition. Every perſon muſt have known inſtances of fevers, rheumatiſms, and even conſumptions, brought on in this way. Though theſe happen daily, yet they are not ſufficient to deter others from the like conduct.</p>
                        <p>EVEN wet feet often occaſion fatal diſeaſes. Coughs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the breaſt, and ulcers in the lungs, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from that cauſe. The cholic, a fit of the gout, the iliac paſſion, and <hi>cholera morbus,</hi> are likewiſe often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by wet feet. Habit will, no doubt, render this leſs dangerous; but it ought, as far as poſſible, to be avoided. The delicate, and thoſe who are not accuſtomed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012338_0037_0F88EAB72CD1C528"/>
to have their cloaths or feet wet, ſhould be peculiarly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this reſpect.</p>
                        <p>THE perſpiration is often obſtructed by NIGHT-AIR; the abſence of the ſun renders it damp and foggy. Even in ſummer the night-air ought to be avoided. The dews which fall plentifully after the hotteſt day, make the night more dangerous than when the weather is cool. Hence, in warm countries the dews are more hurtful than where the climate is more temperate.</p>
                        <p>IT is very agreeable indeed, after a warm day, to be abroad in the cool evening; but this is a pleaſure to be avoided by all who value their health. The effects of evening dews are gradual and almoſt imperceptible; but they are not the leſs to be dreaded: We would therefore adviſe travellers, labourers, and all who are much heated by day, carefully to avoid them. When the perſpiration has been great, theſe become dangerous in proportion: By not attending to this, in flat marſhy countries, where the exhalations and dews are copious, labourers often catch intermitting fevers, quinſies, and the like.</p>
                        <p>DAMP BEDS ſeldom fail to obſtruct the perſpiration. Beds become damp, either from want of uſe, ſtanding in damp houſes, or in rooms without fire. Nothing is more to be dreaded by travellers than damp beds, which are very common in all places where feuel is ſcarce. When a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller cold and wet arrives at an inn, he may by means of a good fire, and a dry bed, have the perſpiration reſtored; but if he be put into a cold room, and laid on a damp bed, it will be more obſtructed, and the worſt conſequences muſt enſue. Travellers ſhould avoid inns which are noted for damp beds, as they would a houſe infected with the plague; as no man, however robuſt, is proof againſt the danger ariſing from them.</p>
                        <p>BUT inns are not the only places where damp beds are to be met with. Beds kept in private families for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of ſtrangers, are no leſs dangerous. All kinds of linen and bedding, when not frequently uſed, become damp. How then is it poſſible, that beds which are not ſlept in above two or three times a-year, ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Nothing is more common than to hear of people having caught cold by changing their bed. The reaſon is obvious. Were they careful never to ſleep on a bed but what was frequently uſed, they would ſeldom find any ill conſequences from a change.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="unknown:012338_0038_0F88EABB9E925EC8"/>
NOTHING is more to be dreaded by a delicate perſon, when on a viſit, than being laid in the gueſt-chamber. That ill-judged piece of complaiſance becomes a real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. All the bad conſequences from this quarter might be eaſily prevented in private families, by cauſing their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſleep in the ſpare beds, and to reſign them to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers when they come. This is the cuſtom of many families in London, and we would earneſtly recommend it to all who value the health of their friends. In inns where the beds are uſed almoſt every night, nothing elſe is neceſſary than to keep the rooms well ſeaſoned by frequent fires, and the linen dry.</p>
                        <p>DAMP houſes frequently produce the like ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. For this reaſon thoſe who build, ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to chuſe a dry ſituation. A houſe which ſtands on a damp marſhy ſoil, muſt be hurtful to the health of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Not only a marſhy ſoil, but being ſituated in the neighbourhood of large woods, lakes, or ſtanding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt make a houſe damp. Large woods both prevent the free current of air, and ſend forth great quantities of moiſt exhalations, which render all places near them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome. This is one reaſon why new diſcovered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries commonly prove unhealthy, till they be cleared of their woods. Even in England, at this day, there is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more planting in ſeveral parts than is either conducive to the fertility of the ſoil, or the health of its inhabitants. This taſte, inſtead of being any improvement, is the way to reduce the country back to its original ſtate, and to render the climate leſs healthy than it otherwiſe would be.</p>
                        <p>COLD is not near ſo hurtful to the health as moiſture. Cold, in a moderate degree, braces and ſtrengthens the body; but moiſture relaxes and pre-diſpoſes it to diſeaſes. That is the reaſon why intermittents and other fevers are ſo frequent in low, damp, marſhy countries abounding with woods and ſtanding water. This likewiſe ſhews the danger of inhabiting new houſes before they be thoroughly dry. Nothing is more common than for people, merely to avoid ſome trifling inconveniency, to hazard their lives, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting a houſe almoſt as ſoon as the maſons, plaiſterers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have done with it. Such houſes are not only dangerous from their dampneſs, but likewiſe from the ſmell of lime, paints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The aſthma's, conſumptions, and other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the lungs, ſo common to people who work in theſe articles, are a plain proof of their being unwholeſome.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="unknown:012338_0039_0F88EABBB21AC070"/>
HOUSES are often rendered damp by an unſeaſonable piece of cleanlineſs, I mean the ridiculous cuſtom of waſhing rooms immediately before company is put into them. Many people are ſure to catch cold, if they ſit but a ſhort while in a room that has been lately waſhed. The delicate ought carefully to avoid ſuch a ſituation, and even the robuſt would run leſs hazard by ſitting without doors. People who are accuſtomed to live in dry houſes, ought, as far as poſſible, to ſhun damp ones, and by all means not to continue long in rooms that have been lately waſhed.</p>
                        <p>ALL houſes, unleſs where the ground is extremely dry, ſhould have the firſt floor a little raiſed. Such ſervants as are obliged to live for the moſt part in cellars and ſunk ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſeldom continue long in health; and ſurely maſters ought to pay ſome regard to the health of their ſervants as well as to their own.</p>
                        <p>EVEN houſes which are built for the poor, ought to be dry. Theſe people generally live on the ground-floor, and if it be damp, they muſt ſuffer. This is one cauſe of the aches, cramps and rheumatic pains, which poor people are ſo ſubject to in the decline of life.</p>
                        <p>BUT nothing ſo frequently obſtructs the perſpiration as SUDDEN TRANSITIONS from heat to cold. Colds are ſeldom caught, unleſs when people have been too much heated. Heat rarifies the blood, quickens the circulation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the perſpiration; but when theſe are ſuddenly checked, the conſequences muſt be bad. It is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for labourers not to be too hot upon certain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but it is generally in their power to put on their cloaths when they leave off work, to make choice of a dry place to reſt themſelves in, and to avoid falling aſleep in the fields. Theſe eaſy rules, if obſerved, would ſave many uſeful lives.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING is more common than for people, when hot, to drink freely of cold ſmall liquors. This conduct is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dangerous. Thirſt indeed is hard to bear, and the inclination to gratify that appetite, frequently gets the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reaſon, and makes us do what our judgment diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves. Every peaſant knows, if his horſe be permitted to drink his belly full of cold water after violent exerciſe, and be immediately put into the ſtable, or ſuffered to remain at reſt, that it will kill him. This they take the utmoſt care to prevent. It were well, if they were equally atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their own ſafety.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="36" facs="unknown:012338_0040_0F88EABC6C636B28"/>
THIRST may be quenched many ways without ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large quantities of cold liquor. The fields afford variety of acid fruits and plants, the very chewing of which would abate thirſt. Water kept in the mouth for ſome time, and ſpit out again, if frequently repeated, will have the ſame effect. If a bit of bread be eat along with a few mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of water, it will both quench thirſt more effectually, and make the danger leſs. When a perſon is extremely hot, a mouthful of brandy, or other ſpirits, ought to be preferred to any thing elſe, if it can be obtained. But if any one has been ſo fooliſh, when hot, as to drink freely of cold liquor, he ought to continue his exerciſe at leaſt, till what he drank be thoroughly warmed upon his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                        <p>IT would be tedious to enumerate all the bad effects which flow from drinking cold thin liquors when the body is hot. Sometimes this has occaſioned immediate death. Hoarſeneſs, quinſeys, and fevers of various kinds, are its common conſequences. Neither is it ſafe, when warm, to eat freely of raw fruits, ſallads, or the like. Theſe indeed have not ſo ſudden an effect on the body as cold liquors, but they are notwithſtanding dangerous, and ought to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>SITTING in a warm room, and drinking hot liquors till the pores are quite open, and immediately going into the cold air, is extremely dangerous. Colds, coughs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the breaſt, are the uſual effects of this conduct: Yet how common is it? Many people, after having drank warm liquors for ſeveral hours, walk or ride a number of miles in the coldeſt night; while others ſit up at their bottle all night, or ramble about in the ſtreets. Such conduct is one cauſe why coughs and colds are ſo common in the winter-ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>PEOPLE are very apt, when a room is hot, to throw open a window, and to ſit near it. This is a moſt ready way to catch cold. A delicate perſon had better ſit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors than in ſuch a ſituation, as the current of air is directed againſt one particular part of the body. Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory fevers and conſumptions have often been occaſioned by ſitting or ſtanding thinly cloathed near an open window. Nor is ſleeping with open windows leſs to be dreaded. That ought never to be done even in the hotteſt ſeaſon. I have known mechanics frequently contract fatal diſeaſes, by
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:012338_0041_0F88EAC2119B85C8"/>
working ſtript at an open window, and would adviſe all of them to beware of ſuch a practice.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING expoſes people more to catch cold than keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own houſes too warm; ſuch perſons may be ſaid to live in a ſort of hot-houſes; they can hardly ſtir abroad to viſit a neighbour, but at the hazard of their lives. Were there no other reaſon for keeping houſes in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree of warmth, that alone is ſufficient. But no houſe that is too hot, can be wholeſome. Heat deſtroys the ſpring and elaſticity of the air, and renders it leſs fit for expanding the lungs, and other purpoſes of reſpiration. Hence it is, that conſumptions and other diſeaſes of the lungs prove ſo fatal to people who work in forges, glaſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and the like.</p>
                        <p>SOME are even ſo fool-hardy, as to bathe themſelves, when hot, in cold water. Not only fevers, but madneſs itſelf, has frequently been the effect of this conduct. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it looks too like the action of a madman to deſerve a ſerious conſideration.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall conclude theſe obſervations on the common cauſes of catching cold, by recommending it to every one to avoid, with the utmoſt attention, all ſudden tranſitions from heat to cold, and to keep the body in as uniform a temperature as poſſible; or, where that cannot be done, to take care to cool gradually.</p>
                        <p>IT may be thought, that too ſtrict an attention to theſe things would tend to render people delicate. So far how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is this from being our deſign, that the firſt rule laid down for preventing colds, is to harden the body, by enur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it daily to bear the open air.</p>
                        <p>It is a true ſaying, that colds kill more than plagues. On examining patients, one finds moſt of them impute their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes either to violent colds, or to ſlight ones which had been neglected. This ſhows the importance of guarding againſt every thing that may obſtruct the perſpiration, and likewiſe of uſing proper means immediately to remove ſuch obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when it does happen. The want of due attention to theſe coſts Britain annually ſome thouſands of uſeful lives.</p>

                        <head>UNWHOLESOME FOOD.</head>
                        <p>AS our bodies conſiſt of what we eat and drink, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome food muſt be dangerous. There is no queſtion but the whole conſtitution of body may be changed by
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012338_0042_0F88EAC296CCD290"/>
diet. This is often done more quickly than people would imagine. A diet conſiſting too much of alkaline ſubſtances will ſoon render the humours putrid. On the other hand, if acids be uſed too freely, they will receive a taint of an oppoſite nature. The ſolids may be relaxed or weakened by the uſe of oily or watery ſubſtances, or they may be too much conſtricted by eating ſpiceries, auſtere vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is not eaſy to aſcertain the exact quantity and quality of food proper for every age, ſex and conſtitution: But a ſcrupulous nicety here is by no means neceſſary. The beſt rule is to avoid all extremes. Mankind were never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to weigh and meaſure their food. Nature teaches every creature when it has enough of food, and a very ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reaſon is ſufficient for the choice of it. Men ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom err in this reſpect through ignorance. The moſt knowing are generally the moſt guilty.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH <hi>moderation</hi> be the only rule neceſſary with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the quantity of food, yet the quality of it merits further attention. Many people, if they can ſatisfy the appetites of hunger and thirſt, are very indifferent what they eat or drink. The following obſervations will ſhow the danger of ſuch conduct.</p>
                        <p>PROVISIONS may be rendered unwholeſome various ways. Bad ſeaſons may either prevent the ripening of grain, or damage it afterwards. Wet and cold ſummers ſeldom bring the fruits of the earth to maturity; and if the harveſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prove rainy, they are often ſo damaged as to be very hurtful. Theſe indeed are acts of Providence; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our duty to ſubmit to them. But ſurely no puniſhment can be too ſevere for thoſe who ſuffer proviſions to be ſpoilt, by hoarding them on purpoſe to enhance the price. The ſoundeſt grain, if kept too long, muſt become unfit for uſe.</p>
                        <p>THE poor are generally the firſt who ſuffer by unſound proviſions: But the lives of the labouring poor are of the greateſt importance to the ſtate. Beſides, diſeaſes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by unwholeſome food often prove infectious, and by that means reach people in every ſtation. The poor judge ill in buying low-priced and coarſe proviſions. They had better have a ſmaller quantity of what is ſound and good; as that would both afford more nouriſhment, and be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with leſs danger.</p>
                        <p>ANIMAL as well as vegetable food becomes unwholeſome when kept too long. All animal ſubſtances have a conſtant tendency to putrefaction, and when that has proceeded too
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012338_0043_0F88EAC32B601488"/>
far, they not only become offenſive to the ſenſes, but hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to health. Diſeaſed animals, and ſuch as die of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ought not to be eaten. It is common enough in graſing countries for ſervants and poor people to eat ſuch animals as die of any diſeaſe in the ſpring or winter, or are killed by accident. I have been frequently told by people who live in places where this is done, that when much fleſh of that kind is eaten, it never fails to occaſion fevers.</p>
                        <p>THE injunctions given to the Jews, not to eat any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which died of itſelf, ſeem to have a ſtrict regard to health, and ought to be obſerved by Chriſtians as well as Jews. Animals never die of themſelves without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious diſeaſe; but how a diſeaſed animal ſhould be whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome food, is inconceivable. Even thoſe which die by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, muſt be hurtful, as their blood is mixed with the fleſh, and ſoon turns putrid.</p>
                        <p>ANIMALS which feed groſs, as tame ducks, ſwine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are neither eaſily digeſted, nor afford wholeſome nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No animal can be wholeſome food which does not take ſufficient exerciſe. Moſt of our ſtalled cattle, hogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are crammed with groſs food, but not allowed exerciſe nor free air, by which means they indeed grow fat, but their humours not being properly prepared or affimulated, they muſt remain crude. The fleſh of an animal which has not properly digeſted its own food, can never be eaſily digeſted by another: Yet ſuch are the delicacies of modern luxury, and ſuch the animals daily devoured even by the weak and valetudinary. Is it any wonder, that ſuch ſhould complain of crudities, indigeſtions, and oppreſſion of the ſpirits? Let them eat the ſame quantity of an animal which runs wild, and they will not feel any load on their ſtomach, or difficulty of digeſtion. We would not have people live on carrion; but ſurely the oppoſite extreme of eating animals which are gorged with groſs food till they are unfit to live, muſt be as pernicious.</p>
                        <p>ANIMALS may likewiſe be rendered unwholeſome by being over-heated. Heat cauſes a fever, exhalts the ſalts of the animal, and mixes the blood ſo intimately with the fleſh, that it cannot be ſeperated. For this reaſon people ought not to eat freely of ſuch animals as are hunted down, their fleſh being apt to occaſion putrid fevers. But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhould alſo be careful not to over-drive their cattle. No perſon would chuſe to eat the fleſh of an animal which had died in a high fever; yet that is the caſe with all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drove
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012338_0044_0F88EAC40C699CC0"/>
cattle, and the fever is often raiſed even to the degree of madneſs.</p>
                        <p>NO people in the world eat ſuch quantities of animal food as the Engliſh. That is one reaſon why they are ſo generally tainted with the ſcurvy, and its numerous train of conſequences, as indigeſtion, low ſpirits, hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driaciſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Animal food was ſurely deſigned for man, and with a proper mixture of vegetables, it will be found the moſt wholeſome; but to gorge beef, mutton, pork, fiſh and fowl twice or thrice a-day, is certainly too much. All who value health, ought to be contented with making one fleſh-meal in the twenty-four hours, and this ought to conſiſt of one kind only.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt obſtinate ſcurvy has often been cured by a vegetable diet; nay, milk alone will frequently do more in that diſeaſe than any medicine. From hence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if vegetables and milk were more uſed in diet, we ſhould have leſs ſcurvy, and likewiſe fewer putrid and inflammatory fevers.</p>
                        <p>OUR aliment ought neither to be too moiſt, nor too dry. Moiſt aliment relaxes the ſolids, and renders the body feeble. Thus we ſee females who live much on tea and other watery diet, generally become weak, and unable to digeſt ſolid food; from whence proceed hyſterics, and all their dreadful conſequences. On the other hand, food that is too dry, renders the ſolids in a manner rigid, and the humours viſcid, which prediſpoſes the body to inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory fevers, ſcurvies, and the like.</p>
                        <p>THE arts of cookery render many things unwholeſome, which are not ſo in their own nature. By jumbling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a number of different ingredients, in order to make a poignant ſauce, or rich ſoup, the compoſition proves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a poiſon. All high-ſeaſoning, pickles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are only incentives to luxury, and never fail to hurt the ſtomach. It were well for mankind, if cookery, as an art, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely prohibited. Plain roſting or boiling is all that nature points out, and all that the ſtomach requires. Theſe alone are ſufficient for people in health, and the ſick have ſtill leſs need of a cook.</p>
                        <p>THE liquid part of our aliment likewiſe claims our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Water is not only the baſis of moſt liquors, but alſo compoſes a great part of our ſolid food. Good water muſt therefore be of the greateſt importance in diet. The beſt water is that which is moſt pure, and free from any
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012338_0045_0F88EAC4B33544A8"/>
mixture of foreign bodies. Water takes up parts of every body with which it comes in contact; by which means it is often impregnated with metals and minerals of a hurtful or poiſonous nature.</p>
                        <p>THE inhabitants of ſome hilly countries have peculiar diſeaſes, which in all probability proceed from the water. Thus the people who live near the Alps in Switzerland, and the inhabitants of the Peak of Derby in England, have large tumours or wains on their necks. This diſeaſe is generally imputed to the ſnow-water; but there is more reaſon to believe it is owing to the minerals in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains through which the waters paſs. Were it owing to the ſnow-water, it ſhould happen to the inhabitants of all mountainous countries, where ſnow lies long; but there are many parts of Britain where the ſnow lies much longer than in the Peak of Derby; yet the inhabitants have no ſuch diſeaſe. The Peak of Derby is well known to be a bed of minerals of different kinds; and, as far as what is called the mineral country extends, theſe tumours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and generally go by the name of <hi>Derby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN water is impregnated with foreign bodies, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appears by its weight, colour, taſte, ſmell, heat, or ſome other ſenſible quality. Our buſineſs therefore is to chuſe ſuch water, for common uſe, as is lighteſt, and without any particular colour, taſte or ſmell. In moſt places of Britain the inhabitants have it in their power to make choice of their water, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ew things would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to health than a due attention to this article. But mere indolence often induces people to make uſe of the water that is neareſt them, without conſidering its qualities.</p>
                        <p>BEFORE water be brought into great towns, the ſtricteſt attention ought to be paid to it's qualities, as epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers are often occaſioned by bad water; and when it has been procured at a great expence, we are unwilling to give it up.</p>
                        <p>THE common methods of rendering water clear by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, of ſoft by expoſing it to the ſun and air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſo generally known, that it is unneceſſary to ſpend time in explaining them. We ſhall only in general adviſe all to avoid waters which ſtagnate long in ſmall lakes, ponds, or the like. Such waters often become putrid with inſects and other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which breed and die in them. Even cattle frequently ſuffer by drinking, in dry ſeaſons, water which
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012338_0046_0F88EACB1775A550"/>
has ſtood long in ſmall reſervoirs, without being ſupplied by ſprings, or freſhened with ſhowers. All wells ought to be kept clean, and to have a free communication with the air. When either animal or vegetable ſubſtances are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie at the bottom of wells, they corrupt and taint the water. Even the air itſelf, when confined in wells, becomes poiſonous, and muſt of courſe render the water unwholeſome.</p>
                        <p>MUCH noiſe has been made about the uſe of fermented liquors. They notwithſtanding ſtill continue to be the common drink of almoſt every perſon who can afford them. As this is, and in all probability will be the caſe, we ſhall rather endeavour to aſſiſt people in their choice of theſe liquors, than pretend to condemn what cuſtom has eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. It is not the moderate uſe of ſound fermented liquors which hurts mankind; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is exceſs, or the abuſe of them, and uſing ſuch as are ill-prepared or vitiated.</p>
                        <p>FERMENTED liquors which are too ſtrong hurt digeſtion, inſtead of aſſiſting it, by which means their intention is loſt, and the body, in place of being ſtrengthened by them, is weakened and relaxed. Many imagine, that hard labour could not be ſupported without drinking ſtrong liquors: This, though a common, is a very erroneous notion. Men who never taſte ſtrong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily. But ſuppoſe ſtrong liquors did enable men to do more work, they muſt nevertheleſs waſte the powers of life, and of courſe occaſion premature old age. They keep up a conſtant fever, which waſtes the ſpirits, heats and inflames the blood, and prediſpoſes the body to number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>BUT fermented liquors may be too weak as well as too ſtrong: When that is the caſe, they muſt either be drank new, or they become ſour and dead. When ſuch liquors are drank new, the fermentation not being over, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate air in the bowels, and occaſion flatulencies; and when kept till ſtale, they ſour on the ſtomach, and greatly hurt digeſtion. For this reaſon all malt-liquor, cyder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be of ſuch ſtrength as will make them keep till they be ripe, and then they ſhould be uſed. When ſuch liquors are kept too long, though they ſhould not become ſour, yet they generally contract a hardneſs, which renders them unwholeſome. Hence it is, that bottled ale hurts the ſtomach, occaſions the gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>

ALL families, who can, ought to prepare their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. Since preparing and vending of liquors became one of the moſt general branches of buſineſs, every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod has been tried to adulterate them. The great object both of the makers and venders of liquor is, to render it intoxicating. But it is well known, that this may be done by other ingredients than thoſe which ought to be uſed for that purpoſe. It would be imprudent even to name thoſe things which are daily made uſe of to render liquors heady. It is ſufficient to obſerve, that the practice is very common, and all the ingredients uſed for that purpoſe, are of an opiate or ſtupifactive nature. But as all opiates are of a poiſonous quality, it is eaſy to ſee what muſt be the conſequence of their general uſe. Though they do not kill ſuddenly, yet they hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the ſtomach, and of courſe ſpoil the digeſtion.</p>
                        <p>WERE fermented liquors faithfully prepared, not too ſtrong, nor too weak, kept to a proper age, and uſed in moderation, they would prove real bleſſings to mankind. But while they are ill prepared, various ways adulterated, and taken to exceſs, they muſt have many bad conſequences. Theſe however we ſhall not mention at preſent, as they will be pointed out under another article.</p>
                        <p>TO ſpecify the different kinds of aliment, to explain their nature and properties, and to point out their effects in different conſtitutions, would far exceed the limits of our deſign. Inſtead of a detail of this kind, which in all probability would be very little attended to, and would not be generally underſtood, we ſhall only mention the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſy rules with reſpect to the choice of aliment.</p>
                        <p>THOSE whoſe ſolids are weak and relaxed, ought to avoid all viſcid food, or ſuch things as are hard of digeſtion; and to take plenty of exerciſe in a dry open air.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as abound with blood, ſhould be ſparing in the uſe of every thing that is highly nouriſhing, as fat meat, rich wines, ſtrong ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their food ſhould conſiſt moſtly of bread and other vegetable ſubſtances, and their drink ought to be milk, whey, and the like.</p>
                        <p>FAT people ſhould not eat freely of oily nouriſhing diet. They ought frequently to uſe raddiſh, garlic, ſpices, or ſuch things as are heating, and promote per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and urine. Their drink ſhould be water, coffee, tea, or the like; and they ought to take much exerciſe and little ſleep.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="44" facs="unknown:012338_0048_0F88EACC2FA24660"/>
THOSE who are too lean, muſt follow an oppoſite courſe.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as abound with acidities, or whoſe food is apt to ſour on their ſtomach, ſhould live much on fleſh-meats; and thoſe who are troubled with alkaline eructations, or heat of the ſtomach, ought to uſe a diet conſiſting chiefly of acid vegetables.</p>
                        <p>PEOPLE who are affected with the gout, low ſpirits, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac or hyſteric diſorders, ought to avoid all flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent food, every thing that is viſcid or hard of digeſtion, all ſalted or ſmoke-dried proviſions, and whatever is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere, acid, or apt to ſour on the ſtomach. Their food ſhould be light, ſpare, cool, and of an opening quality.</p>
                        <p>THE diet ought not only to be ſuited to the age and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but alſo to the manner of life. A ſedentary or ſtudious perſon ſhould live more ſparingly than one who labours hard without doors. Food will nouriſh a peaſant very well, which would be almoſt indigeſtible to a citizen; and the latter will live upon a diet on which the former would ſtarve.</p>
                        <p>DIET ought not to be too uniform. The conſtant uſe of one kind of food might have bad effects. Nature points out this by the great variety of aliments which ſhe has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for man, and likewiſe by giving him an appetite for different kinds of food.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who labour under any particular diſeaſe, ought to avoid ſuch aliments as have a tendency to increaſe it. For example, a gouty perſon ſhould not uſe rich wines, ſtrong ſoups, or gravies, and ſhould avoid all acids. One who is troubled with the gravel, ought to ſhun all auſtere and aſtringent aliments; and thoſe who are ſcorbutic, ſhould not indulge in animal food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IN the firſt period of life our food ought to be light, nouriſhing, and of a diluting nature, but frequently uſed. Food that is ſolid, with a ſufficient degree of tenacity, is moſt proper for the ſtate of manhood. The diet ſuited to the laſt period of life, when nature is upon the decline, approaches near to that of the firſt. It ſhould be lighter, and more diluting than that of vigorous age, and likewiſe more frequently taken.</p>

                        <head>IRREGULARITIES IN DIET, SLEEP, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>IT is not only neceſſary for health, that our diet be wholeſome, but alſo that it be taken at regular periods.

Some imagine, that long faſting will atone for exceſs; but that, inſtead of mending the matter, never fails to make it worſe. When the ſtomach and inteſtines are over diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with food, they loſe their proper tone, and by long faſting they become weak, and inflated with wind. Thus either gluttony or faſting deſtroys the powers of digeſtion.</p>
                        <p>THE frequent repetition of aliment is not only neceſſary for repairing the continual waſte of our bodies, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to keep the humours ſound and ſweet. Our humours, even in the moſt healthy ſtate, have a conſtant tendency to become putrid, which can only be prevented by frequent ſupplies of freſh nouriſhment: When that is wanting too long, the putrefaction often proceeds ſo far, as to occaſion very dangerous fevers. From hence we may learn the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of regular meals. No perſon can enjoy a good ſtate of health, whoſe veſſels are either frequently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, or the humours long deprived of freſh ſupplies of chyle.</p>
                        <p>LONG faſting is extremely hurtful to young people; it vitiates their humours, and prevents their growth and ſtrength. Nor is it leſs injurious to the aged. Many in the decline of life are afflicted with wind: That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is not only increaſed, but even rendered dangerous, and often fatal, by long faſting. Old people, when their ſtomachs are empty, are frequently ſeized with giddineſs, headachs and faintneſs. Theſe complaints may generally be removed by a bit of bread and a glaſs of wine, or taking any other ſolid food; which plainly points out the method of preventing them. It is more than probable, that many of the ſudden deaths which happen in the advanced periods of life, are occaſioned by faſting too long, as it exhauſts the ſpirits, and fills the bowels with wind; we would therefore adviſe people, in the decline of life, never to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſtomachs to be too long empty. Many take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a few cups of tea and a bit of bread, from nine o'clock at night till two or three next afternoon. Such may be ſaid to faſt almoſt three fourths of their time. This can hardly fail to ruin the appetite, vitiate the humours, and fill the bowels with wind; all which might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a ſolid breakfaſt. That would tend more to ſtrengthen the nerves, and expel wind, than all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial or carminative medicines which can be adminiſtered.</p>
                        <p>THE ſtrong and healthy do not indeed ſuffer ſo much from faſting as the weak and delicate; but they run great

                           </abbr> repletion, Many diſeaſes, eſpecially fevers, are the effect of a plethora, or too great fulneſs of the veſſels. Strong people, in high health, have generally a great quantity of blood and other humours. When theſe are ſuddenly increaſed by an overcharge of rich and nouriſhing diet, the veſſels become diſtended, and being unable to contract themſelves, obſtructions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations enſue. Hence ſo many people are ſeized with inflammatory and eruptive fevers, after a feaſt or debauch. This ſhows the danger of all ſudden tranſitions from a ſpare to a full and luxurious diet.</p>
                        <p>EXCESS in diet is not peculiar to the rich and opulent; the poor are often guilty of it, and frequently feel its bad effects. The poor ſeldom loſe an opportunity of gorging themſelves either with meat or drink, when they can obtain it, and the leſs they are accuſtomed to it, the danger is the greater.</p>
                        <p>WHEN we recommend regularity in diet, we would not be underſtood as condemning every ſmall deviation from it. It is next to impoſſible for people at all times to avoid ſome degree to exceſs, and living too much by rule might make even the ſmalleſt deviation dangerous. It may therefore be prudent to vary a little, ſometimes taking more, ſometimes leſs than the uſual quantity of meat and drink, provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that regard be had to moderation.</p>
                        <p>SLEEP as well as diet ought to be duly regulated. Too little ſleep exhauſts the ſpirits, weakens the nerves, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions diſeaſes; and too much renders the mind dull, the body groſs, and diſpoſes it to apoplexies, lethargies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A medium therefore ought to be obſerved; but that is not eaſy to fix.

Beſides, the real quantity of ſleep cannot be meaſured by time; as one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be more refreſhed by five or ſix hours of ſleep, than another by eight or ten. The beſt way to make ſleep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>CHILDREN may be allowed as much ſleep as they chuſe; but for adults ſix or ſeven hours is certainly enough, and none ought to exceed eight. Thoſe who lie more than eight hours a-bed may ſlumber, but they can hardly be ſaid to ſleep; ſuch generally toſs and dream away the fore-part of the night, ſink to reſt towards morning, and doſe till
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012338_0051_0F88ED8D2B152108"/>
noon. Inſtead of encouraging a habit of this kind, riſing early would make them fall into a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>NATURE points out night as the proper time for ſleep. Thoſe who think it too vulgar to ſleep in that ſeaſon, ſeldom enjoy health. Nothing more certainly deſtroys the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution than night-watching. It is great pity that a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo deſtructive to health ſhould be ſo much in faſhion. How quickly the want of reſt in due ſeaſon will blaſt the moſt blooming complexion, or ruin the beſt conſtitution, is evident from the ghaſtly countenances of thoſe who, as the phraſe is, turn day into night, and night into day.</p>
                        <p>TO make ſleep refreſhing, the following things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Firſt, that we take enough of exerciſe in the open air, through the day; next, to eat a light ſupper; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to lie down with a mind chearful and ſerene.</p>
                        <p>IT is certain, that too much fatigue will prevent ſleep, as well as too little. We ſeldom, however, hear the active and laborious complain of reſtleſs nights. It is the indolent and ſlothful who generally have theſe complaints. Is it any wonder, that a bed of down ſhould not be refreſhing to a perſon who lolls all day in an eaſy chair? A great part of the pleaſure of life conſiſts in alternate reſt and motion; but they who neglect the latter can never reliſh the former. The labourer enjoys more true luxury in plain food and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THAT light ſuppers cauſe ſound ſleep, is true even to a proverb. Many, if they exceed the leaſt at that meal, are ſure to have uneaſy nights; and if they drop aſleep, the load and oppreſſion on their ſtomach and ſpirits occaſion frightful dreams, broken and diſturbed repoſe, with night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were the ſame perſons to go to bed with a light ſupper, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This is a good reaſon why every man ſhould endeavour to be as eaſy in his mind as poſſible, when he goes to reſt. Many, by neglecting this rule, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging

grief and anxious thoughts, have baniſhed ſleep ſo long, that they could never afterwards enjoy it.</p>
                        <p>FEW things contribute more to health than keeping the belly regular. When the foeces lie too long in the bowels, they become acrid, and ſpoil the humours; and when they are diſcharged too ſoon, the body is not properly nouriſhed. Regular ſtools depend greatly upon regularity in eating and drinking, and proper exerciſe; people have reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect a fault in one or other of theſe, whenever the belly is not regular.</p>
                        <p>TO prevent coſtiveneſs, one good rule is, to riſe betimes and go abroad in the open air. Not only the poſture in bed is unfavourable to regular ſtools, but likewiſe the warmth. This, by promoting the perſpiration, cannot fail to leſſen all the other diſcharges. Mr. Lock's advice, to ſolicit na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by going regularly to ſtool every morning, is a very good one, and has more effect than moſt people would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Any habit will in time become natural. It is always more ſafe to keep the belly regular by proper diet, exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than by the uſe of drugs. Thoſe who have frequent recourſe to medicine for that purpoſe, ſeldom fail to ruin their conſtitutions. But if opening medicines muſt be uſed, the ſafeſt is fine rhubarb, which may either be taken in ſmall doſes in powder, or a little of it chewed daily. Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom will render this ſufficiently agreeable.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as are troubled with habitual looſeneſs, ought to ſuit their food to the nature of their complaint. Looſeneſs may often be removed by a change of diet: For example, boiled milk may be uſed in place of raw, wheat bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that which is mixed, red wine, or brandy and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be drank in place of malt-liquor, white broths may be eat inſtead of fleſh, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <head>BAD AIR.</head>
                        <p>BAD air is a very common cauſe of diſeaſes. Few are aware of the danger ariſing from it; people generally pay ſome attention to what they eat and drink, but ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what goes into the lungs, though the one often proves fatal as well as the other.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="49" facs="unknown:012338_0053_0F88ED8EE5E8E908"/>
PERHAPS no air is perfectly pure; that, however, which has feweſt noxious particles in it, is no doubt the beſt. Air as well as water takes up parts of moſt bodies with which it comes into contact, and is often ſo repleniſhed with thoſe of a noxious quality, as to occaſion immediate death. But ſuch violent effects ſeldom happen, as people are generally on their guard againſt them. The leſs perceptible influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of bad air prove more hurtful to mankind; we ſhall therefore endeavour to point out ſome of theſe, and to ſhow wherein the danger conſiſts.</p>
                        <p>AIR may become noxious many ways. Whatever deſtroys its ſpring or elaſticity, renders it unfit for reſpiration: Wherever therefore great numbers of people are crowded into one place, if the air has not a free current, it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unwholeſome. Hence it is that delicate perſons are ſo apt to faint or be ſick, in crowded churches, aſſemblies, or any place where the air is exhauſted by breathing, fires, candles, or the like.</p>
                        <p>IN great cities ſo many things tend to pollute the air, that it is no wonder it proves ſo fatal to the inhabitants. The air in cities is not only breathed over and over by thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but is likewiſe exhauſted by fires, loaded with ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, ſmoke, and other exhalations, beſides the vapours continually ariſing from innumerable putrid ſubſtances. All poſſible care ſhould be taken to keep the ſtreets of large towns open and wide, that the air may have a free current. They ought likewiſe to be kept very clean. Nothing tends more to pollute and contaminate the air than dirty ſtreets, dunghills, ſlaughter-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is very common in this country to have church-yards in the middle of populous cities. Whether that be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ancient ſuperſtition, or owing to the increaſe of ſuch towns, is a matter of no conſequence. Whatever gave riſe to the cuſtom, it is a bad one. It is habit alone which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles us to theſe things; by means of it, the moſt ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, nay, pernicious cuſtoms, often become ſacred. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that thouſands of putrid carcaſes, ſo near the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth, in a place where the air ſtagnates, cannot fail to taint it; and that ſuch air being breathed into the lungs, and mixed with the blood, muſt occaſion diſeaſes<note n="*" place="bottom">In moſt eaſtern countries it is cuſtomary to bury the dead at ſome diſtance from any town. It were to be wiſhed the inhabitants of Europe would follow this example.</note>.</p>
                        <p>WHEREVER air ſtagnates long, it becomes unwholeſome. Hence the unhappy inmates of jails not only contract ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012338_0054_0F88ED92C6C60DF8"/>
fevers themſelves, but often communicate them to others. Nor are many of the holes, for we cannot call them houſes, poſſeſſed by the poor in great towns, much better than jails. Theſe low dirty habitations are the very lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places of bad air and contagious diſeaſes. Such as live in them ſeldom enjoy good health; and their children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly die young. In the choice of a houſe, the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ought always to be paid to free air.</p>
                        <p>THE various methods which luxury has invented to make houſes cloſe and warm, contribute not a little to render them unwholeſome. No houſe can be wholeſome unleſs the air has a free paſſage through it. For which reaſon, houſes ought daily to be ventilated by opening oppoſite win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and admitting a current of freſh air into every room. This would expel any noxious vapour, and could not fail to promote the health of the inhabitants. In hoſpitals, jails, ſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where that cannot be conveniently done, venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators ſhould be uſed. The method of expelling foul, and introducing freſh air, by means of ventilators, is a moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary invention, and is indeed the moſt uſeful of all our modern medical improvements. We wiſh, for the benefit of mankind, it were more generally regarded. It is capable of univerſal application, and fraught with numerous advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, both to thoſe in health and ſickneſs.</p>
                        <p>AIR not only loſes its ſpring, and becomes unwholeſome from heat and ſtagnation, but likewiſe from moiſture. Thus, in low marſhy countries, the air is generally bad, as alſo in countries over-run with wood, or any thing that ſends forth moiſt exhalations.</p>
                        <p>AIR that ſtagnates in mines, wells, cellars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be noxious. That kind of air is to be avoided as the moſt deadly poiſon. It often kills almoſt as quick as lightening. For this reaſon, people ſhould be very cautious in opening cellars that have been long ſhut, or going down into deep wells, eſpecially if they have been cloſe covered.</p>
                        <p>MANY people who have ſplendid houſes, chuſe to ſleep in ſmall apartments. This conduct is very imprudent. A bed-chamber ought always to be well aired; as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally occupied in the night only, when all doors and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are ſhut. If a fire be kept in it, the danger becomes ſtill greater. Many have been ſtifled when aſleep by a fire in a ſmall apartment. Some are even ſo inconſiderate as to make fires in bed-chambers which have no chimneys, and imagine by uſing that kind of coal which has little or no
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012338_0055_0F88ED946756A5F0"/>
ſmoke, that they are ſafe; whereas the danger becomes thereby the greater, ſuch coal generally abounding with ſulphur. The moſt fatal conſequences are always to be dreaded from every attempt of this nature.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who are obliged, on account of buſineſs, to ſpend the day in cloſe towns, ought, if poſſible, to ſleep in the country. Breathing good air in the night will, in ſome meaſure, make up for the want of it through the day. This practice would have a greater effect in preſerving the health of citizens than is commonly imagined.</p>
                        <p>CARE ſhould be taken to admit a conſtant ſtream of freſh air into all crowded places, as churches, aſſembly-rooms, colleges, courts of juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The neglect of this has had ſo many fatal conſequences, that it is ſufficient only to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it.</p>
                        <p>IT was neceſſary in former times, for ſafety, to ſurround cities, colleges, and even ſingle houſes, with high walls. Theſe, by obſtructing the current of air, never fail to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch places damp and unwholeſome. As ſuch walls are now, generally ſpeaking, become uſeleſs, they ought to be thrown down, and every method taken to admit a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the air. Were proper attention paid to AIR and CLEANLINESS, it would tend more to preſerve the health of the inhabitants of great towns than all the endeavours of the Faculty.</p>
                        <p>IF freſh air be neceſſary for thoſe in health, it is ſtill more ſo for the ſick, who often loſe their lives for the want of it. The notion that ſick people muſt be kept very hot, is ſo common, that one can hardly enter the chamber where a patient lies, without being ready to faint, by reaſon of the hot ſuffocating ſmell. How this muſt affect the ſick, any one may judge. No medicine is ſo beneficial to the ſick as freſh air. It is the moſt reviving of all cordials, if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred with prudence. We are not, however, to throw open doors and windows at random upon the ſick. Freſh air is to be let into the chamber gradually, and, if poſſible, by opening the windows of ſome other apartment.</p>
                        <p>THE air of a ſick perſon's chamber may be greatly freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and the patient much revived, by ſprinkling the floor, bed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frequently with vinegar, juice of lemon, or any other ſtrong vegetable acid.</p>
                        <p>IN places where numbers of ſick are crowded into the ſame houſe, or, which is often the caſe, into the ſame apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, freſh air becomes abſolutely neceſſary. Infirmaries,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:012338_0056_0F88ED95C52DD228"/>
hoſpitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often become ſo noxious for want of proper ventilation, that the ſick run more hazard from them than from the diſeaſe; this is particularly the caſe when dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, putrid fevers, or other infectious diſeaſes prevail.</p>
                        <p>PHYSICIANS, ſurgeons, and others who attend hoſpitals, ought, for their own ſake, to take care that they be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ventilated. They are obliged to ſpend much of their time amongſt the ſick, and run great hazard of being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves infected when the air is bad. All hoſpitals, and places for the ſick, ought to have an open ſituation, at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from any great town.</p>

Change of apparel greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the ſecretion from the ſkin, ſo neceſſary for health. When that matter which ought to be carried off by perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is either retained in the body, or re-abſorbed from dirty cloaths, it is apt to occaſion fevers and other diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>MOST diſeaſes of the ſkin proceed from want of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Theſe indeed may be caught by infection; but they will ſeldom continue long where cleanlineſs prevails. To the ſame cauſe muſt we impute the various kinds of vermine which infeſt the human body, houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be baniſhed by cleanlineſs alone. Perhaps, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of nature in permitting ſuch vermine to annoy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is to induce them to the practice of this virtue.</p>
                        <p>ONE common cauſe of putrid and malignant fevers is the want of cleanlineſs. Theſe fevers commonly begin among the inhabitants of cloſe, dirty houſes, who breathe bad air, take little exerciſe, uſe unwholeſome food, and wear dirty cloaths. There the infection is generally hatched, which often ſpreads far and wide, to the deſtruction of many. Hence cleanlineſs may be conſidered as an object of public attention. It is not ſufficient that I be clean myſelf, while the want of it in my neighbour affects my health as well as his own. If dirty people cannot be removed as a common nuiſance, they ought at leaſt to be avoided as infectious. All who regard their health ſhould keep at a diſtance even from their habitations.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="unknown:012338_0057_0F88ED9632CEED70"/>
IN places where great numbers of people are collected, cleanlineſs becomes of the utmoſt importance. It is well known, that infectious diſeaſes are communicated by taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed air. Every thing, therefore, which tends to pollute the air, or ſpread the infection, ought, with the utmoſt care, to be avoided. For this reaſon, in great towns, no filth of any kind ſhould be permitted to lie upon the ſtreets. Nothing is more apt to convey infection than the excrements of the diſeaſed. Theſe, in many caſes, are known to be highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. The ſtreets in many great towns are little better than dunghills, being frequently covered with aſhes and naſtineſs of every kind. How eaſily might this be prevented by active magiſtrates, who have it always in their power to make proper laws relative to things of this nature, and to enforce the obſervance of them?</p>
                        <p>WE are ſorry to ſay, that the importance of general clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs does by no means ſeem to be ſufficiently underſtood. It were well if the inhabitants of Britain would imitate their neighbours the Dutch in the cleanneſs of their ſtreets, houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Water, indeed, is eaſily obtained in Holland; but the ſituation of moſt towns in Britain is more favourable to cleanlineſs. Nothing can be more agreeable to the ſenſes, more to the honour of the inhabitants, or conducive to their health, than a clean town; nor does any thing impreſs a ſtranger ſooner with a diſreſpectful idea of any people than its oppoſite.</p>
                        <p>THE peaſants in moſt countries ſeem to hold cleanlineſs in a ſort of contempt. Were it not for the open ſituation of their houſes, they would often feel the bad effects of this diſpoſition. One ſeldom ſees a farm-houſe without a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill before the door, and frequently the cattle and their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lodge under the ſame roof. Peaſants are likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely careleſs with reſpect to change of apparel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> keeping their ſkins clean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are merely the effects of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and a dirty diſpoſition. Habit may indeed render them leſs diſagreeable; but no habit can ever make it ſalutary to wear dirty cloaths, or breathe unwholeſome air.</p>
                        <p>IN camps the ſtricteſt regard ſhould be paid to cleanlineſs. By negligence in this matter, infectious diſeaſes are often ſpread amongſt a whole army; and frequently more die of theſe than by the ſword. The Jews, during their encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the wilderneſs, received particular inſtructions with
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012338_0058_0F88ED96ECA11838"/>
reſpect to cleanlineſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Thou ſhalt have a place alſo without the camp, whither thou ſhalt go forth abroad; and thou ſhalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it ſhall be, when thou ſhalt eaſe thyſelf abroad, thou ſhalt dig therewith, and ſhalt turn back, and cover that which cometh from thee, <hi>&amp;c. Deuter.</hi> chap. xxiii. ver. 12. 13.</note> The rules enjoined them ought to be obſerved by all in the like ſituation. Indeed the whole ſyſtem of laws delivered to that people, has a manifeſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote cleanlineſs. Whoever conſiders the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their climate, and the diſeaſes to which they were liable, will ſee the propriety of ſuch laws.</p>
                        <p>IT is remarkable, that in moſt eaſtern countries clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs makes a great part of their religion. The Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan, as well as the Jewiſh religion, enjoins various ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, waſhings and purifications. No doubt theſe were deſigned to repreſent inward purity; but they are at the ſame time calculated for the preſervation of health. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever whimſical theſe waſhings may appear to ſome, few things would tend more to prevent diſeaſes than a proper attention to many of them. Were every perſon, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, after handling a dead body, viſiting the ſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to waſh before he went into company, or ſat down to meat, he would run leſs hazard either of catching the infection himſelf, or communicating it to others.</p>
                        <p>FREQUENT waſhing not only removes the filth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ordes which adhere to the ſkin, but likewiſe promotes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, braces the body, and enlivens the ſpirits. Even waſhing the feet tends greatly to preſerve health. The ſweat and dirt with which theſe parts are frequently co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, cannot fail to obſtruct the perſpiration. This piece of cleanlineſs would often prevent colds and fevers. Were people careful to bathe their feet and hands in warm water at night, after being expoſed to cold or wet through the day, they would ſeldom experience any of the fatal effects which often proceed from theſe cauſes.</p>
                        <p>A proper attention to cleanlineſs is no where more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than on ſhipboard. If epidemical diſtempers break out there, no one can be ſafe. The beſt way to prevent them is to take care that the whole company be cleanly in their cloaths, diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When infectious diſeaſes do break out, cleanlineſs is the moſt likely means to prevent their ſpreading. Above all things, the cloaths, bedding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the ſick ought to be carefully waſhed, and fumigated with brimſtone, or the like. Infection will lodge a long
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012338_0059_0F88ED97D6CDE7E8"/>
time in dirty cloaths, and will afterwards break out in the moſt terrible manner.</p>
                        <p>IN places where great numbers of ſick people are kept, cleanlineſs ought moſt religiouſly to be obſerved. The very ſmell in ſuch places is often ſufficient to make one ſick. It is eaſy to imagine what effect that is likely to have upon the diſeaſed. A perſon in perfect health has a greater chance to become ſick, than a ſick perſon has to get well, in an hoſpital or infirmary, where cleanlineſs is neglected.</p>
                        <p>THE brutes themſelves ſet us an example of cleanlineſs. Moſt of them ſeem uneaſy, and thrive ill, if they be not kept clean. A horſe that is kept thoroughly clean, will thrive better on a ſmaller quantity of food, than with a greater, where cleanlineſs is neglected. Even our own feelings are a ſufficient proof of the neceſſity of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. How refreſhed, how chearful and agreeable does one feel on being ſhaved, waſhed and dreſſed; eſpecially when theſe offices have been long neglected? Moſt people eſteem cleanlineſs; and even thoſe who do not practiſe it themſelves, often admire it in others. Superior cleanlineſs ſooner attracts our regard than even finery itſelf, and often gains eſteem where the other fails.</p>
                        <p>TO point out the numerous advantages ariſing from cleanlineſs of perſon, houſes, ſtreets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be a very uſeful and agreeable taſk; but as our plan only permits us to name things, we muſt conclude this article by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the practice of that virtue to people of all ſtations and conditions in life. We do not indeed pretend to rank cleanlineſs amongſt the <hi>cardinal virtues;</hi> but we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it as neceſſary for ſupporting the dignity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, as uſeful and agreeable to ſociety, and as highly conducive to health.</p>

                        <p>A modern author<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau.</note> obſerves, that temperance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe are the two beſt phyſicians in the world. He might have added, that if theſe were duly regarded, there would be little occaſion for any other. Temperance may juſtly be called the parent of health; but numbers of mankind act as if they thought diſeaſes and death too ſlow in their progreſs, and by intemperance and debauch ſeem, as it were, to ſollicit their approach.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="56" facs="unknown:012338_0060_0F88ED98899AFC00"/>
THE danger of intemperance appears from the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the human body. Health depends on that ſtate of the ſolids and fluids which fits them for the due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the vital functions; and ſo long as theſe go regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, we are ſound and well; but whatever diſturbs them, neceſſarily impairs health. Intemperance never fails to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the whole animal oeconomy; it ſpoils the digeſtion, relaxes the nerves, renders the different ſecretions irregular, vitiates the humours, and of courſe occaſions diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>THE analogy between the nouriſhment of plants and animals affords a ſtrong proof of the danger of intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Moiſture and manure greatly promote vegetation; but an over-quantity of either will entirely prevent it. The beſt things become hurtful, nay deſtructive, when carried to exceſs. From hence we learn, that the greateſt pitch of human wiſdom conſiſts in regulating our appetites and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo as to avoid all extremes. 'Tis that alone which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles us to the character of rational beings. The ſlave of appetite will ever be the diſgrace of human nature.</p>
                        <p>THE Author of nature hath endued us with various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the propagation of the ſpecies, the preſervation of the individual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Intemperance is the abuſe of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and in the proper regulation of them moderation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. Men, not content with ſatisfying the ſimple calls of nature, create artificial wants, and are perpetually in ſearch after ſomething that may gratify them; but imaginary wants can never be gratified. Nature is content with a little; but luxury knows no bounds. The epicure, the drunkard and the debauchee ſeldom ſtop in their career till caſh or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution fails: Then indeed they generally ſee their error, when too late.</p>
                        <p>IT is impoſſible to lay down determined rules of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, on account of the different conſtitutions of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The moſt ignorant perſon however certaily knows what is meant by exceſs; and it is in the power of every man to avoid it, if he chuſes. The great rule in regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our diet, is to ſtudy ſimplicity. Nature delights in the moſt plain and ſimple food, and every animal, except man, follows her dictates. Man alone riots at large, and ranſacks the whole creation in queſt of luxuries, to his own deſtruction. An elegant writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Addiſon.</note> of the laſt age ſpeaks thus of intemperance: <q>For my part, when I behold a faſhionable table ſet out in all its magnificence, I fancy
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:012338_0061_0F88ED9931008288"/>
that I ſee gouts and dropſies, fevers and lethargies, with other innumerable diſtempers, lying in ambuſcade among the diſhes.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>INTEMPERANCE does not hurt it's votaries alone; the innocent too often feel the direful effects of it. How many wretched orphans are to be ſeen embracing dunghills, whoſe parents, regardleſs of the future, ſpent in riot and debauch what might have ſerved decently to feed and cloath their offspring? How often do we behold the miſerable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with her helpleſs infants, pining in want, while the cruel father is indulging even at the expence of their lives!</p>
                        <p>FAMILIES are not only reduced to miſery, but extirpated by means of intemperance. Nothing tends ſo much to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent propagation, and to ſhorten the lives of children. The poor man who labours all day, and at night lies down contented with his humble fare, can boaſt a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, while his pampered lord, ſunk in eaſe and luxury, has neither ſon nor nephew. Even ſtates and empires feel the influence of intemperance, and riſe or fall as it prevails.</p>
                        <p>INSTEAD of mentioning the different kinds of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and pointing out their influence upon health, we ſhall confine our obſervations to one particular ſpecies of that vice, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> the abuſe of intoxicating liquors.</p>
                        <p>EVERY act of intoxication puts nature to the expence of a fever, in order to diſcharge the ſuperfluous load; but when that is repeated almoſt every day, it is eaſy to foreſee the conſequences. That conſtitution muſt be ſtrong indeed which is able long to hold out under a daily fever! But fevers occaſioned by drinking do not always go off in a day; they frequently end in an inflammation of the breaſt, liver or brain, and produce fatal effects.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH the drunkard ſhould not fall by an acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, he ſeldom eſcapes thoſe of a chronic nature. Intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating liquors, when uſed to exceſs, weaken the bowels and ſpoil the digeſtion; they deſtroy the power of the nerves, and occaſion paralytic and convulſive diſorders; they heat and inflame the blood, deſtroy it's balſamic qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, render it unfit for circulation, and the nouriſhment of the parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence obſtructions, atrophies, dropſies, and conſumptions of the lungs. Theſe are the common ways in which drunkards make their exit. Diſeaſes of this kind, when brought on by hard drinking, ſeldom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a cure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="unknown:012338_0062_0F88ED99E9A6BC28"/>
MANY people injure their health by drinking, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom get drunk. The continual habit of ſoaking, as it is called, though its effects be not ſo violent, is no leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. When the veſſels are kept conſtantly full and upon the ſtretch, the different digeſtions can neither be duly performed, nor the humours properly prepared. Hence moſt people of this character are afflicted with the gout, the gravel, ulcerous ſores in the legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders do not appear, they are ſeized with low ſpirits, hypochondriacal diſorders, and other ſymptoms of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion.</p>
                        <p>ALL intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poiſons. However diſguiſed, that is their real character, and ſooner or later they will have their effect. Conſumptions are now ſo common, that it is thought one tenth of the inhabitants of great towns die of that diſeaſe. Drunkenneſs is one of the cauſes to which we muſt impute the increaſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. The great quantities of viſcid malt-liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to render the blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>izy and unfit for circulation; from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed obſtructions and inflammations of the lungs. There are few great ale-drinkers who are not phthiſical; nor is that to be wondered at, conſidering the glutinous and almoſt indigeſtible nature of ſtrong ale. Thoſe who drink ardent ſpirits or ſtrong wines, do not run leſs hazard; theſe liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender veſſels of the lungs in pieces.</p>
                        <p>THE habit of drinking proceeds frequently from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes in life. The miſerable fly to it for relief. It af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them indeed a temporary eaſe. But alas, this ſolace is ſhort-lived, and when it is over, the ſpirits ſink as much below their natural pitch, as they had before been raiſed above it. Hence a repetition of the doſe becomes neceſſary, and every freſh doſe makes way for another, till the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy wretch becomes a ſlave to the bottle, and at length falls a ſacrifice to what nature intended only as a medicine. No man is ſo dejected as the drunkard when his debauch is gone off. Hence it is, that thoſe who have the greateſt flow of ſpirits while the glaſs circulates freely, are of all others the moſt melancholy when ſober, and often put an end to their own miſerable exiſtence in a fit of ſpleen or ill humour.</p>
                        <p>DRUNKENNESS not only proves deſtructive to health, but likewiſe to the faculties of the mind. It is ſtrange,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012338_0063_0F88ED9AAB1A7838"/>
that creatures who value themſelves on account of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior degree of reaſon to that of brutes, ſhould take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinking ſo far below them. Were ſuch as volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily deprive themſelves of the uſe of reaſon, to continue ever after in that condition, it would ſeem but a juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Though that be not the conſequence of one act of drunkenneſs, it ſeldom fails to ſucceed a courſe of intoxication. By a habit of drinking, the greateſt genius is often reduced to a mere dunce.</p>

                        <head>INACTIVITY.</head>
                        <p>MANY look upon the neceſſity man is under of earning his bread by labour as a curſe. Be that as it may, it is evident from the ſtructure of the body, that exerciſe is not leſs neceſſary for the preſervation of health, than food. Thoſe whom poverty obliges to labour for daily bread, are not only the moſt healthy, but generally the moſt happy. Induſtry ſeldom fails to place ſuch above want, and activity ſerves them inſtead of phyſic. This is peculiarly the caſe with thoſe who live by the culture of the ground. The great increaſe of inhabitants in infant-colonies, and the common longevity of ſuch as follow agriculture every where, evidently prove it the moſt healthful as well as the moſt uſeful employment.</p>
                        <p>THE love of activity ſhows itſelf very early in man. So ſtrong is this principle, that a healthy youth cannot be reſtrained from exerciſe, even by the fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Our love of motion is ſurely a ſtrong proof of its utility. Nature implants no diſpoſition in vain. Some imagine, that the love of motion was implanted in man, becauſe without it he could not obtain the neceſſaries of life; but ſuppoſe the neceſſaries of life could be univerſally obtained without motion, it would nevertheleſs be indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable. It ſeems to be a catholic law throughout the whole animal creation, that no creature, without exerciſe, can enjoy health. Every creature, except man, takes as much exerciſe as is neceſſary. He alone, and ſuch animals as are under his direction, deviate from this original law, and they ſuffer accordingly.</p>
                        <p>INACTIVITY never fails to bring on univerſal relaxation of the ſolids, which occaſions innumerable diſeaſes. When the ſolids are relaxed, neither the digeſtion, nor any of the ſecretions, can be duly performed. In this caſe the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012338_0064_0F88ED9BE1622C50"/>
worſt conſequences muſt enſue. How can thoſe who loll all day in eaſy chairs, and ſleep all night on a bed of down, fail to be relaxed? Nor do ſuch greatly mend the matter, who never ſtir abroad but in a coach, or ſedan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe elegant pieces of luxury are become ſo common, that the inhabitants of great towns ſeem to be in ſome danger of loſing the uſe of their limbs altogether. 'Tis now below any one to walk who can afford to be carried. How ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous would it ſeem to a perſon unacquainted with modern luxury, to behold the young and healthy ſwinging along on the ſhoulders of their fellow-creatures! or to ſee a fat carcaſe, over-run with diſeaſes occaſioned by inactivity, dragged through the ſtreets by half a dozen horſes.</p>
                        <p>GLANDULAR obſtructions generally proceed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity. Theſe are the moſt obſtinate of all maladies. So long as the liver, kidnies, and other glands, duly perform their functions, health is ſeldom impaired; but when they fail, nothing can preſerve it. Exerciſe is almoſt the only cure we know for glandular obſtructions; indeed it does not always ſucceed, but there is reaſon to believe, that it would ſeldom fail to prevent theſe complaints. One thing is certain, that amongſt thoſe who take enough of exerciſe, glandular diſeaſes are very little known; whereas the indolent and inactive are ſeldom free from them.</p>
                        <p>WEAK nerves are the conſtant companions of inactivity. Nothing but exerciſe and open air can brace and ſtrengthen the nerves, or prevent the endleſs train of diſeaſes which proceed from a relaxed ſtate of theſe organs. We ſeldom hear the active or laborious complain of nervous diſeaſes; theſe are reſerved for the ſons of eaſe and affluence. Many have been compleatly cured of nervous diſorders by being reduced from a ſtate of opulence to labour for their daily bread. This plainly points out the ſources from whence ſuch diſeaſes flow, and the means by which they may be prevented.</p>
                        <p>IT is abſolutely impoſſible to enjoy health without a free perſpiration; but that neceſſary diſcharge never goes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly on where exerciſe is wanting. When the matter which ought to be thrown off by perſpiration, is retained in the body, it cannot fail to vitiate the humours. Hence proceed the gout, fevers, rheumatiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, none of the vital or animal functions can be duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed when exerciſe is neglected.

                        <p>No piece of indolence hurts the health more than the modern cuſtom of lolling a-bed too long in a morning. This is univerſally the caſe in great towns. The inhabitants of cities ſeldom do much buſineſs before breakfaſt; but that is the beſt time for exerciſe, while the ſtomach is empty, and the body refreſhed with ſleep. Riſing early would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give thoſe who cannot leave their buſineſs through the day, an opportunity of taking exerciſe, but it would prevent the bad effects of loitering in bed too long. The morning air braces and ſtrengthens the nerves, and, in ſome meaſure, anſwers the purpoſe of a cold bath. Let any one who has been accuſtomed to lie a-bed till eight or nine o'clock, riſe by ſix or ſeven, ſpend a couple of hours in walking, riding, or any active diverſion without doors, and he will find his ſpirits chearful and ſerene through the day, his appetite keen, and his body braced and ſtrengthened. Cuſtom ſoon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders early riſing agreeable, and nothing contributes more to the preſervation of health.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE, if poſſible, ought always to be taken in the open air. When that cannot be done, various methods may be contrived for exerciſing the body within doors, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, fencing, the dumb bell, playing at tennis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not neceſſary to adhere ſtrictly to any particular kind of exerciſe. The beſt way is to take them by turns, and to uſe that longeſt which is moſt ſuitable to the ſtrength and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Theſe kinds of exerciſe which give action to moſt of the bodily organs, are always to be preferred, as riding, walking, running, digging, ſwimming, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>IT is much to be regretted, that active and manly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are now ſo little regarded. Diverſions make people take more exerciſe than they otherwiſe would do, and are of the greateſt ſervice to ſuch as are not under the neceſſity
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012338_0066_0F88EDA1AAD0D4A8"/>
of labouring for their bread. As active diverſions loſe ground, thoſe of a ſedentary kind ſeem to prevail. Sedentary diverſions are of no other uſe than to conſume the time which might be employed in exerciſe: Inſtead of relieving the mind, they often require more thought than either ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or buſineſs. Every thing that induces people to ſit ſtill, unleſs it be ſome neceſſary employment, ought to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>THE diverſions which afford the beſt exerciſe are, hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhooting, playing at cricket, hand-ball, golff<note n="*" place="bottom">Golff is a diverſion very common in North-Britain. It is well calculated for exerciſing the body, and may always be taken in ſuch moderation, as neither to over-heat nor fatigue. It has greatly the preference over cricket, tennis, or any of thoſe games which cannot be played without violence.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe exerciſe the limbs, promote perſpiration, and the other ſecretions. They likewiſe ſtrengthen the lungs, and give firmneſs and agility to the whole body.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as can, ought to ſpend two or three hours a-day on horſeback; thoſe who cannot, ſhould employ the ſame time in walking. The beſt time for taking exerciſe is in the morning, or at leaſt before dinner; but it ſhould never be continued too long. Over fatigue prevents the benefit of exerciſe, and weakens inſtead of ſtrengthening the body.</p>
                        <p>EVERY man ſhould lay himſelf under ſome ſort of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take exerciſe. Indolence, like all other vices, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, gains ground, and at length becomes agreeable. Hence, many who were fond of exerciſe in the early part of life, become quite averſe to it afterwards. This is the caſe of moſt hypochondriac and gouty people, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their diſeaſes in a great meaſure incurable.</p>
                        <p>IN ſome countries laws have been made, obliging every man, of whatever rank, to learn ſome mechanical employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whether ſuch laws were deſigned for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, or encouragement of manufacture, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of no importance. Certain it is, that if gentlemen were frequently to amuſe and exerciſe themſelves in this way, it might have many good effects. They would, at leaſt, derive as much honour from a few maſterly ſpecimens of their own workmanſhip, as from the character of having ruined moſt of their companions by gaming or hard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Beſides, men of leiſure, by applying themſelves to the mechanical arts, might improve them, to the great benefit of ſociety. This would afford a more comfortable reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the cloſe of life, than the conſciouſneſs of having lived in the world for no other purpoſe than to eat and drink.</p>
                        <p>

INDOLENCE not only occaſions diſeaſes, and renders men uſeleſs to ſociety, but promotes all manner of vice. To ſay a man is idle, is perhaps, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to call him vicious. The mind, if not engaged in ſome uſeful purſuit, is conſtantly in queſt of ideal pleaſures, or impreſſed with the apprehenſion of ſome imaginary evil. From theſe ſources proceed moſt of the miſeries of mankind. Sure man never was intended to be idle. Inactivity fruſtrates the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his creation. An active life is the beſt guardian of virtue, and the greateſt preſervative of health.</p>

                        <head>INFECTION.</head>
                        <p>MOST diſeaſes are infectious. Every perſon ought, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as far as he can, to avoid all communication with the diſeaſed. The common practice of viſiting the ſick, though well meant, has many ill conſequences. Far be it from us to diſcourage any act charity or benevolence, eſpecially towards thoſe in diſtreſs; but we cannot help blaming ſuch as endanger their own or neighbours lives by a miſtaken friendſhip, or an impertinent curioſity.</p>
                        <p>THE houſes of the ſick, eſpecially in the country, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally crowded from morning till night with idle viſitors. It is cuſtomary, in ſuch places, for ſervants and young people to wait upon the ſick by turns. It would be a miracle indeed ſhould ſuch always eſcape. Experience teaches us the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this conduct. People often catch fevers in this way, and communicate them to others, till at length they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come epidemic.</p>
                        <p>IT would be thought highly improper for one who had not had the ſmall-pox, to wait upon a patient in that diſeaſe; yet many other fevers are almoſt as infectious as the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, and not leſs fatal. Some imagine, that fevers prove more fatal in villages than in great towns, for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per medical aſſiſtance. How far that is true, we will not pretend to ſay; but we are inclined to think, that it rather proceeds from the cauſe above mentioned.</p>
                        <p>WERE a plan to be laid down for communicating infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it could not be done more effectually than by the common method of viſiting the ſick. Such viſitors not only endanger themſelves and their connections, but likewiſe hurt the ſick. By crowding the houſe, they render the air un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, and by their private whiſpers and diſmal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, diſturb the imagination of the ſick and depreſs
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:012338_0068_0F88EDA3D6A879E0"/>
his ſpirits. Sick perſons, eſpecially in fevers, ought to be kept as quiet as poſſible. The ſight of ſtrange faces, and every thing that diſturbs the mind, hurts them.</p>
                        <p>THE common practice in country places of inviting great numbers of people to funerals, and crowding them into the ſame apartment where the corpſe lies, is another way of ſpreading infection. The infection by no means dies with the patient. In many caſes it rather grows ſtronger as the body becomes putrid. This is peculiarly the caſe of thoſe who die of malignant fevers, or other putrid diſeaſes. Such ought not to lie long unburied; and people ſhould keep at a diſtance from them. It is very common for people, after attending the funeral of a friend, to be ſeized with the ſame diſeaſe of which he died, and to ſhare the ſame fate.</p>
                        <p>IT would tend greatly to prevent the ſpreading of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſeaſes, if thoſe in health were kept at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the ſick. The Jewiſh Legiſlator, among many other wiſe inſtitutions for preſerving health, has been pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly attentive to the means of preventing infection, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement,</hi> as it is called, either from a diſeaſed perſon or a dead body. In many caſes the diſeaſed were to be ſeparated from thoſe in health; and it was deemed a crime even to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their habitations. If a perſon only touched a dead body, he was appointed to waſh himſelf in water, and to keep for ſome time at a diſtance from ſociety.</p>
                        <p>INFECTIOUS diſeaſes are often communicated by cloaths. It is extremely dangerous to wear apparel which has been worn by the diſeaſed, as infection will lodge in it a long while, and afterwards produce very tragical effects. This ſhows the danger of buying at random the cloaths which have been uſed by other people.</p>
                        <p>INFECTIOUS diſorders are frequently imported. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, together with the riches of foreign climes, brings us alſo their diſeaſes. Theſe do often more than counterbalance all the advantages of that trade, by means of which they are introduced. It is to be regretted that ſo little care is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken, either to prevent the introduction or ſpreading of infectious diſeaſes. Some attention, indeed, is generally paid to the plague; but other diſeaſes paſs unregarded.</p>
                        <p>INFECTION is often ſpread by jails, hoſpitals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are frequently ſituated in the very middle of cities, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous towns; and when infectious diſeaſes break out in them, it is impoſſible for the inhabitants to eſcape. Were magiſtrates to pay any regard to the health of the people, this evil might be eaſily remedied.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="unknown:012338_0069_0F88EDA46B0054D0"/>
MANY are the cauſes which tend to diffuſe infection through populous cities. The whole atmoſphere of a large town is one contaminated maſs, abounding with every kind of infection, and muſt be pernicious to health. The beſt advice that we can give to ſuch as live in cities, is to chooſe an open ſituation; to avoid narrow, dirty, crowded ſtreets; to keep their own houſes and offices clean; to admit the freſh air every day into their apartments; and to be as much abroad as their time will permit.</p>
                        <p>IT would tend greatly to prevent the ſpreading of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſeaſes, were proper nurſes every where employed to take care of the ſick. This might often ſave a family, or even a whole town, from being infected by one perſon. We do not mean that people ſhould abandon their friends or relations in diſtreſs, but only to put them on their guard againſt being too much in company with thoſe who are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with diſeaſes of an infectious nature.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as wait upon the ſick in infectious diſeaſes, ought to ſtuff their noſes with tobacco, or ſome other ſtrong ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling herb, as rue, tanſy, or the like. They ought likewiſe frequently to ſprinkle the room where the patient lies with vinegar, or other ſtrong acids; and to avoid the patient's breath as much as they can.</p>
                        <p>HOWEVER eaſy theſe hints may ſeem; yet a proper atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them would ſave many lives. A fever, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious diſeaſe, ſeldom breaks out in a family, but it affects the moſt of them, and frequently ſeizes every individual. The ſcenes of calamity and diſtreſs produced by this means, are too often witneſſed by thoſe who attend the ſick.</p>
                        <p>YOUNG people are peculiarly liable to catch infection; and therefore ought to be kept at the greateſt diſtance from the diſeaſed. Their minds are eaſily affected with ſcenes of diſtreſs, and they often catch diſeaſes even by the force of imagination.</p>
                        <p>WE would not only recommend it to magiſtrates, to take proper meaſures to prevent the ſpreading of infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but alſo to maſters of families. A ſingle ſervant may ſpread a diſeaſe amongſt a whole family, which may prove fatal to many of them. For this reaſon, when a ſervant is ſeized with a fever, or other infectious diſeaſe, he ought to be kept in ſome ſeparate apartment, or rather ſent to an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital or infirmary. Servants would not only be taken better care of in this way, but fatal diſeaſes might be often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="unknown:012338_0070_0F88EDA52CD03AA0"/>
INFECTION is often caught by ſleeping with the diſeaſed. Every perſon knows that this is the caſe in conſumptions of the lungs; but other diſeaſes are infectious as well as conſumptions: Nay, we hardly know any diſeaſe that is not ſo in ſome degree. If a ſound perſon communicates health, ſurely a diſeaſed one muſt have the contrary effect. Were this attended to in the choice of companions for life, it would ſave many from a premature end.</p>
                        <p>NOT only the diſeaſes of the body, but alſo thoſe of the mind are infectious. For this reaſon, our companions ought to be of a ſound mind, as well as a ſound body. A melancholy perſon, for example, diffuſes a gloom all around him, and generally taints the minds of his companions with the temper of his own. Thoſe who would be healthy and happy, ought therefore to aſſociate with the young, the chearful, and good humoured.</p>

                        <head>THE PASSIONS.</head>
                        <p>THE paſſions have great influence both in the cauſe and cure of diſeaſes. How mind acts upon matter, will, in all probability, ever remain a ſecret. It is ſufficient for us to know, that there is eſtabliſhed a reciprocal influence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the mental and corporeal parts, and the whatever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders the one likewiſe hurts the other.</p>
                        <p>THE paſſion of <hi>anger</hi> ruffles the mind, diſtorts the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, hurries on the circulation of the blood, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the whole vital and animal functions. It often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions fevers, with other acute diſeaſes; and ſometimes brings on ſudden death. This paſſion is peculiarly hurtful to the delicate, and thoſe of weak nerves. I have known a hyſteric woman loſe her life by a violent fit of anger; all ſuch ought to guard againſt the exceſs of this paſſion with the utmoſt ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e.</p>
                        <p>IT is not always in our power of prevent being angry; but we may ſurely avoid harbouring reſentment in our breaſt. Reſentment preys upon the mind; it occaſions the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate chronical diſorders, and gradually waſtes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Nothing ſhows true greatneſs of mind more, than to forgive injuries: It promotes the peace of ſociety, and greatly conduces to our own eaſe, health, and felicity.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as value health ſhould avoid violent guſts of anger, as they would the moſt deadly infection. They ought never to indulge reſentment, but to endeavour at all times to keep
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:012338_0071_0F88EDA5ED375528"/>
their minds calm and ſerene. Nothing tends ſo much to the health of the body as a conſtant tranquillity of mind.</p>
                        <p>THE influence of fear, both in occaſioning and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating diſeaſes, is very great. No man ought to be blamed for a decent concern about life; but too great a deſire to preſerve it, is often the way to loſe it. Fear and anxiety, by depreſſing the ſpirits, pre-diſpoſe us to diſeaſes, and often render thoſe fatal, which an undaunted mind would overcome.</p>
                        <p>SUDDEN fear has generally violent effects. Epilectic fits, and other convulſive diſorders, are often occaſioned by it. Hence the danger of that practice, ſo common among young people, of frightening one another. By this many have loſt their lives, and others have been rendered uſeleſs ever after. It is dangerous to tamper with the human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. They may eaſily be thrown into ſuch diſorder as never again to act with regularity.</p>
                        <p>BUT the gradual effects of fear prove more generally hurtful. The conſtant dread of ſome future evil, by dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the mind, often occaſions the very evil itſelf. Hence it comes to paſs, that ſo many die of theſe diſeaſes, of which they long had a dread, or which ſome accident, or fooliſh prediction, had impreſſed on their minds. This often happens to women in childbed. Many of thoſe who die in that ſituation, are impreſſed with the notion of their death a long while before it happens; and there is reaſon to believe, that ſuch impreſſions are often the cauſe of it.</p>
                        <p>THE methods taken to impreſs the minds of women with apprehenſions of the great danger and peril of child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, are very hurtful. Few women die in labour, though many loſe their lives after it; which may be thus accounted for. A woman after delivery finding herſelf weak and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, immediately apprehends ſhe is in danger; but fear ſeldom fails to obſtruct the neceſſary evacuations, upon which her recovery depends. Thus the ſex often fall a ſacrifice to their own imaginations, when there would be no danger, did they apprehend none.</p>
                        <p>IT ſeldom happens, that two or three women, who are generally known, die in child-bed, but their death is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by many others. Every woman of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance who is with child, dreads the ſame fate, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe becomes epidemical by the mere force of imagination. This ſhould induce pregnant women to diſpiſe fear, and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:012338_0072_0F88EDA6AA849CF0"/>
by all means to avoid thoſe tattling goſſips, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually telling them the misfortunes of others. Every thing that may in the leaſt alarm a pregnant or child-bed woman, ought with the greateſt care to be guarded againſt. Many women have loſt their lives in child-bed by the old ſuperſtitious cuſtom, ſtill kept up in moſt parts of Britain, of tolling the pariſh-bell for every perſon who dies. People who think themſelves in danger, are very inquiſitive; and if they come to know, that the bell tolls for one who died in the ſame ſituation, what muſt be the conſequence?</p>
                        <p>BUT this cuſtom is not pernicious to child-bed women only. It is hurtful in many other caſes. When low fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in which it is difficult to ſupport the patient's ſpirits, prevail, what muſt be the effect of a funeral peal ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five or ſix times a day in his ears? His imagination will no doubt ſuggeſt, that others died of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which he labours under. Nor will the matter be at all mended by endeavouring to perſuade him of the contrary. This will tend rather to confirm than remove his ſuſpicions.</p>
                        <p>IF this childiſh cuſtom cannot be aboliſhed, we ought to keep the ſick as much from hearing it as poſſible, and from every thing elſe that may tend to alarm them. So far is this from being attended to, that many make it their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to viſit the ſick, on purpoſe to whiſper diſmal ſtories in their ears. Such may paſs for ſympathizing friends, but they ought rather to be reckoned enemies, and ranked amongſt murderers. All who wiſh well to the ſick, ought to keep ſuch perſons at the greateſt diſtance from them.</p>
                        <p>A cuſtom has long prevailed among phyſicians of prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticating, as they call it, the patient's fate, or foretelling the iſſue of the diſeaſe. Vanity no doubt introduced this practice, and ſtill ſupports it, in ſpite of common ſenſe and the ſafety of mankind. I have known a phyſician barbarous enough to boaſt, that he pronounced more <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> than all his Majeſty's judges. Would to God that ſuch ſentences were not often equally fatal! It may be alledged, that the doctor does not declare his opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the patient. So, much the worſe. A ſenſible patient had better hear what the doctor ſays, than learn it from the diſconſolate looks, the watery eyes, and the broken whiſpers of thoſe about him. It ſeldom happens, when the doctor gives an unfavourable opinion, that it can be
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:012338_0073_0F88EDA76BDA8060"/>
concealed from the patient. The very emberaſſment which generally appears in diſguiſing what he has ſaid, is ſufficient to diſcover the truth.</p>
                        <p>WE do not ſee what right any man has to announce the death of another, eſpecially if ſuch a declaration has a chance to kill him. Mankind are indeed very fond of prying into future events, and ſeldom fail to importune the phyſician for his opinion. A doubtful anſwer, however, or one that may tend to encourage the hopes of the patient, is ſurely the moſt ſafe. This conduct could neither hurt the patient nor the phyſician. Nothing tends more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the credit of phyſic than thoſe bold prognoſticators, who, by the by, are generally the moſt ignorant. The miſtakes which daily happen in this way, are ſo many ſtanding proofs of human vanity, and the weakneſs of ſcience.</p>
                        <p>THE vanity of foretelling the fate of the ſick is not peculiar to the Faculty. Others follow their example, and thoſe who think themſelves wiſer than their neighbours, often do much miſchief, in this way. Humanity ſurely calls upon every one to comfort the ſick, and not to add to their affliction, by alarming their fears. A phyſician may often do more good by a mild and ſimpathizing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour than by medicine, and ſhould never neglect to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter that greateſt of all cordials, HOPE.</p>
                        <p>GRIEF is the moſt deſtructive of all the paſſions. Its effects are permanent, and when it ſinks deep into the mind, it generally proves fatal. Anger and fear being of a more violent nature, ſeldom laſt long; but grief often changes into a fixed melancholy, which preys upon the ſpirits, and waſtes the conſtitution. We ſhould beware of the indulging this paſſion. It may generally be conquered at the beginning; but when it has gained ſtrength, all our attempts become vain.</p>
                        <p>NO perſon can prevent misfortunes; but it ſhows true greatneſs of mind to bear them with ſerenity. Many make a merit of indulging grief, and when misfortunes happen, they obſtinately refuſe all conſolation, till the mind, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with melancholy, ſinks under the load. Such conduct is not only deſtructive to health, but inconſiſtent with reaſon, religion and common ſenſe.</p>
                        <p>CHANGE of ideas is as neceſſary for health as change of poſture. When the mind dwells long upon one object, eſpecially of a diſagreeable nature, it hurts the whole func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:012338_0074_0F88EDA853753B50"/>
of the body. Thus grief indulged ſpoils the digeſtion, and deſtroys the appetite. By that means the ſpirits are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, the nerves relaxed, the bowels inflated with wind, and the humours, for want of freſh ſupplies of chyle, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. Thus many an excellent conſtitution has been ruined by a family-misfortune, or any thing that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned exceſſive grief.</p>
                        <p>IT is utterly impoſſible, that any perſon of a dejected mind ſhould enjoy health. Life may indeed be dragged on for a few years: But whoever would live to a good old age, muſt be good humoured and chearful. This indeed is not altogether in our own power; yet our temper of mind, as well as actions, depends greatly upon ourſelves. We can either think of agreeable or diſagreeable objects, as we chuſe; we can go into chearful or melancholy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; we can mingle in the amuſements and offices of life, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>it ſtill and brood over our calamities. Theſe, and many ſuch things, are certainly in our power, and from theſe the mind generally takes its caſt.</p>
                        <p>THE variety of ſcenes which preſent themſelves to the ſenſes, were certainly deſigned to prevent our attention from being too long fixed upon any one object. Nature abounds with variety, and the mind, unleſs fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating new objects. This at once points out the method of relieving the mind in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Turn the attention to other objects. Examine them with accuracy. When the mind begins to recoil, ſhift the ſcene. By this means a conſtant ſucceſſion of new ideas may be kept up, till the diſagreeable ones entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappear. Thus travelling, the ſtudy of any art or ſcience, reading or writing on ſuch ſubjects as engage the attention, will ſooner expel grief than the moſt ſprightly amuſements.</p>
                        <p>IT has already been obſerved, that exerciſe is abſolutely neceſſary for the health of the body; but it is no leſs ſo for that of the mind. Indolence nouriſhes grief. When the mind has nothing elſe to think of but calamities, no wonder that it dwells there. Few people who purſue buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with attention, are hurt by grief. Inſtead of abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves from the world or buſineſs, when misfortunes happen, we ought to engage in it with more than uſual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to diſcharge with double diligence the functions of our ſtation, and to mix with friends of an eaſy ſocial temper.</p>

INNOCENT amuſements are by no means to be neglected. Theſe, by leading the mind inſenſibly to the contemplation of agreeable objects, help to diſpel the gloom which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes caſt over it. They make time ſeem leſs tedious, and have many other happy effects.</p>
                        <p>SOME, when overwhelmed with grief, betake themſelves to drinking. This is making the cure worſe than the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. It ſeldom fails to end in the ruin of fortune, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt way to counteract the violence of any paſſion is to encourage its oppoſite. Thus, under the moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing calamities, HOPE is always to be kept in view. Hope is the very ſupport of life, and abſolutely neceſſary to the happineſs of a rational being.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD all other means of comfort fail, the Chriſtian religion affords an inexhauſtible ſource of conſolation. It teaches us, that the ſufferings of this life are deſigned to prepare us for a future ſtate of happineſs, and that all who purſue the paths of virtue, ſhall at laſt arrive at complete felicity.</p>

                        <p>THAT men are expoſed to particular diſeaſes from the occupations which they follow, is a fact well known; but to remedy that evil, is a difficult matter. People are under a neceſſity of purſuing the employments in which they are bred, whether they be favourable to health or not. Hence all that we can propoſe, under this article, is to point out thoſe diſeaſes to which men are more immediately expoſed from their particular occupations; and to ſhew how far ſuch diſeaſes, by due care, may be avoided.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt cauſe of the diſeaſes of artificers that we ſhall mention, is the unwholeſome ſmells and noxious exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which often proceed from thoſe materials in which they are employed. Thus tallow-chandlers, boilers of oil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

ſubſtances, are afflicted with diſeaſes of the ſtomach and lungs. Ill ſmells not only create a nauſea and hurt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, but even taint the humours themſelves, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prove the cauſe of fevers, conſumptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THESE occupations are not only hurtful to thoſe as are employed in them, but likewiſe to thoſe who live in the neighbourhood of the places where they are carried on; for which reaſon they ought always to be at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from any town.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt advice that we can give to ſuch as are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this way, is, to pay the utmoſt attention to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. They are indeed obliged to wear dirty cloaths while at work; but the moment they leave off, they ought to waſh themſelves, ſtrip of their dirty cloaths, put on clean ones, and remove at a proper diſtance from the ſmell of their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No one who has not made the trial, can imagine how far an attention to theſe, and other pieces of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will go in preſerving the health of thoſe artificers who are obliged to follow ſuch employments.</p>
                        <p>CHYMISTS, founders, glaſs-makers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beſides the noxious exhalations from thoſe bodies in which they work, are forced to breathe an air that is in a manner burnt, or at leaſt too much rarified to expand the lungs, or anſwer the important purpoſes of reſpiration. Such people are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thin, pale, and of a weak conſumptive habit. They are melted down with ſweat, in order to ſupply which eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, large quantities of liquor become neceſſary. Thus by hard working and faſt living their conſtitutions are worn out in a few years.</p>
                        <p>SUCH artiſts ought to work by turns, and ſhould never continue long near the furnace at a time. They ſhould be careful, when they leave off work, to cool gradually, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing that may ſuddenly check the perſpiration. The places where theſe occupations are carried on, ſhould be properly conſtructed for diſcharging the ſmoke and other exhalations, and admitting a free current of freſh air; otherwiſe the people who work in them, can never enjoy health.</p>
                        <p>THE exhalation from metals and minerals is not only hurtful to founders, chymiſts, and others who manufacture them for particular purpoſes, but likewiſe to miners, or thoſe who dig them out of the earth. Fallopius obſerves, that ſuch as work in mines of mercury, ſeldom live above three or four years. They are generally affected with palſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>

vertigos, and other diſeaſes of the nerves, which ſoon put an end to their miſerable lives. Thoſe alſo who work in lead-mines are very liable to paralytic diſorders, with gripes, cholics, and other complaints of the bowels.</p>
                        <p>MINERS ſuffer from their ſituation as well as from the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in which they work. The air in mines being totally excluded from the ſun's rays, by ſtagnation loſes its ſpring, and often becomes damp. This kind of air is to be avoided as the moſt deadly poiſon: Beſides, mines are often wet, which renders them ſtill more hurtful. This is one reaſon why miners are very ſubject to aches, cramps, and rheumatic pains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MINERS ſhould never continue too long under ground at a time; neither ought they at any time to go to work faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor to ſuffer their ſtomachs to be empty while they continue in the mines. They ought not to live too low; and their liquor ſhould be generous. They ſhould by all means avoid coſtiveneſs, by either taking food of an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature, or, when that does not ſucceed, a gentle purge. Oils are found to be a good preſervative againſt gripes from the affluvia of metals. Oils both open the belly, and ſheath the coats of the inteſtines, which prevents their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt by the poiſonous particles of the metal.</p>
                        <p>MINERS ſhould by all means take care that the air have a free current through the mines, and that neither it nor the water be ſuffered to ſtagnate. All who work in mines or metals ought to waſh when they leave off work, and to change their cloaths. Thoſe parts of the metal which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the ſkin or the cloaths, being continually abſorbed into the body, muſt neceſſarily do hurt. People are too apt to look upon ſuch circumſtances as unworthy their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but theſe ſmall cauſes, by being neglected, never fail to produce the moſt dreadful effects.</p>
                        <p>PLUMBERS, painters, gilders, and all who work in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, are ſubject to the ſame diſeaſes as thoſe who dig them. They are afflicted with colics, aſthmas, palſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhould obſerve the ſame precautions as miners. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for people thus employed, at all times to avoid ſome degree of danger; but it conſiſts with obſervation, that, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

AS it would greatly exceed our bounds to ſpecify the diſorders peculiar to every occupation, we ſhall therefore conſider mankind under the following general claſſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                           <hi>Laborious, Sedentary</hi> and <hi>Studious.</hi>

                        <head>The LABORIOUS.</head>
                        <p>THOUGH thoſe who follow laborious employments are in general the moſt healthy. yet the nature of their occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the places where they are carried on, expoſe them to many diſeaſes. Huſbandmen, for example, are expoſed to all the viciſſitudes of the weather, which are often very great and ſudden. They are likewiſe forced to work hard, and often to carry loads above their ſtrength, which by overſtraining the veſſels, occaſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes, as aſthmas, fevers, ruptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>INTERMITTENT fevers, or agues, are very common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe who labour without doors. Theſe are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the frequent viciſſitudes of heat and cold to which they are expoſed, by the bad water which they are often obliged to drink, by the low marſhy ſituation of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by their frequent expoſure to the evening dews, night-air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ASTHMAS and inflammations of the breaſt are very inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the laborious. Theſe are occaſioned by the violent exerciſe and the frequent extremes of heat and cold to which they are expoſed. Thoſe who bear heavy burdens, as porters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are obliged to draw in the air with much greater force, and alſo to keep their lungs diſtended with more violence than is neceſſary for common reſpiration: By this means the tender veſſels of the lungs are over diſtended. and often burſt, inſomuch that a ſpitting of blood or fevers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues. Hippocrates mentions an inſtance to this purpoſe of a man. who, upon a wager, had carried an aſs. The man, he ſays, was immediately ſeized with a fever, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of blood, and a rupture.</p>
                        <p>CARRYING very heavy burdens is often the effect of mere indolence, which prompt people to do at once, what ſhould be done at twice. It likewiſe proceeds frequently from bravado, or an emulation to outdo others. Hence it is that the ſtrongeſt men are moſt generally hurt by heavy burdens, hard labour, or feats of activity. It is rare to find one who excels in this way, without a hernia, a haemoptoe, or ſome other diſeaſe, which he enjoys as the fruit of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012338_0079_0F88EDAEEDCD5F50"/>
One would imagine, that the daily inſtances we have of the fatal effects of carrying great weights, running, wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be ſufficient to put a ſtop to ſuch practices.</p>
                        <p>THERE are indeed ſome employments which neceſſarily require a violent exertion of ſtrength, ſuch as blackſmiths, carpenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None ought to follow theſe occupations but men of a ſtrong body; and they ſhould never exert their ſtrength to the utmoſt, nor work too long. When the muſcles are violently ſtrained, frequent reſt is neceſſary, in order that they may recover their tone; where that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, the ſtrength and conſtitution will ſoon be wore out, and a premature old age brought on.</p>
                        <p>THE quinſy and eriſipelas, or St. Anthony's fire, are likewiſe diſeaſes very incident to the laborious. Theſe are occaſioned by whatever gives a ſudden check to the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as drinking cold liquor when the body is warm, keeping on wet cloaths, ſitting or lying on the cold ground, damp houſes, wet feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of theſe practices has already been pointed out, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to inſiſt upon them here.</p>
                        <p>THE laborious are often afflicted with the iliac paſſion, the colic, and other complaints of the bowels. Theſe are often occaſioned by wet feet, or wet cloaths; but they more generally proceed from flatulent and indigeſtable food. Labourers eat unfermented bread made of peas, beans, rye, and other windy ingredients. They alſo eat great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of unripe fruits, baked, ſtewed, or raw, with various kinds of roots and herbs, upon which they drink ſour milk, ſtale ſmall beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a compoſition cannot fail to fill the bowels with wind, and occaſion diſeaſes. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find theſe people in the decline of life univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally complaining of flatulencies; a diſorder which renders many of them very unhappy, and for which no cure is yet known. The beſt advice that we can give them is to avoid windy food as far as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>INFLAMMATIONS, whitlows, and other diſeaſes of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, are very common amongſt them who labour without doors. Theſe diſeaſes are often attributed to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, or ſome kind of poiſon; but they generally proceed either from ſudden heat after cold, or the contrary. When ſuch people come from the fields cold and wet, they run to the fire, and often plunge their hands in warm water, by which means the blood and other humours in theſe parts are ſuddenly expanded, the veſſels not yielding ſo quickly,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012338_0080_0F88EDB08FF37F00"/>
a ſtrangulation happens, and an inflammation or mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enſues.</p>
                        <p>WHEN labourers come home cold, they ought to keep at a diſtance from the fire for ſome time, to waſh their hands in cold water, and to rub them well with a dry cloth. It ſometimes happens that people are ſo benumbed with cold, as to loſe the uſe of their limbs altogether. In ſuch a caſe the only remedy is to rub the parts affected with ſnow, or, failing it, with cold water. If they be held near the fire, or plunged into warm water, a mortification will certainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
                        <p>LABOURERS in the hot ſeaſon are apt to lie down and ſleep in the ſun. This practice is ſo dangerous, that they often riſe in a high fever. The burning fevers which prove ſo fatal about the end of ſummer, and beginning of autumn, are often occaſioned by this means. When la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers leave off work, which they ought always to do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heat of the day, they ſhould go home, or, at leaſt, get under ſome cover, where they may repoſe themſelves in ſafety.</p>
                        <p>THE different ſeaſons of the year expoſe thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour without doors to different diſeaſes. Thus in the ſpring agues are frequent: in ſummer, as has been obſerved, burning fevers abound; and in autumn, dyſenteries and fluxes prevail. The latter proceed not only from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration being, at that time, obſtructed, but alſo from the green traſh, or unripe fruits, which country people eat in great quantities. Indeed if fruit be ripe, and eat in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it rather prevents than occaſions dyſenteries; but it is equally certain, that much bad fruit will bring on a flux.</p>
                        <p>LABOURERS are often hurt by long faſting. They fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follow their employments in the fields from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till night, without eating any thing. This cannot fail to hurt their health. However homely their fare be, they ought to have it at regular times, and the harder they work, the more frequently ſhould they eat.</p>
                        <p>LABOURERS likewiſe ſuffer from the nature of their food. They are extremely careleſs with reſpect to what they eat or drink, and often through mere indolence, eat unwholeſome food, when they might, for the ſame expence, have that which is wholeſome. The poor often hurt their health for want of a proper method of living, and in the end ſave nothing by it. In many parts of Britain, the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants are too careleſs to take the trouble of dreſſing their
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012338_0081_0F88EDB1C4044648"/>
victuals, though they have feuel for nothing. Such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will live upon one meal a-day in indolence, rather than labour, though it were to procure them the greateſt afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>POVERTY is doubtleſs a very general cauſe of diſeaſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the labouring part of mankind. Few of them have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ch foreſight; and if they had, it ſeldom is in their power to lay any thing up againſt hard times. They are glad to make a ſhift to live from day to day; and when any diſeaſe renders them unfit for work, their families are ready to ſtarve. Here the God-like virtue of charity ought ever to exert herſelf. To relieve the induſtrious poor when in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, is ſurely the moſt exalted act of religion, and can never loſe its reward. They alone who witneſs thoſe ſcenes of calamity, can form a notion of what numbers pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in diſeaſes for want of proper aſſiſtance, and even for want of the neceſſaries of life. It were to be wiſhed, for the honor of human nature, as well as for the good of ſociety, that theſe things were more looked into.</p>
                        <p>FEVERS of a very bad kind are often occaſioned by what is called <hi>poor living.</hi> When the body is not ſufficiently nouriſhed, the humours become bad, and the ſpirits ſink; from whence the moſt fatal conſequences muſt ever enſue. <hi>Poor living</hi> is likewiſe productive of cutaneous diſeaſes. It is remarkable that cattle, when pinched in their food, are generally affected with diſeaſes of the ſkin. Theſe diſeaſes ſeldom fail to diſappear when they are put upon good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture: which ſhews how much a good ſtate of the humours depends upon a ſufficient quantity of proper nouriſhment.</p>
                        <p>LABOURERS often ſuffer from a fooliſh emulation, which prompts them to vie with one another, till they drop down dead, or over-heat themſelves to ſuch a degree as to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fever. As this is the effect of vanity, it ought always to be checked by thoſe who have the ſuperintendance of them. Such as wantonly throw away their lives in this manner, deſerve to be looked upon in no better light than ſelf-murderers. It is pity that poor widows and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs children ſhould ſuffer by ſuch childiſh conduct: Could we ſpeak to the paſſions of men, we would bid them think of theſe, and then conſider of how great importance their lives are.</p>
                        <p>THE office of a ſoldier in time of war, may be ranked amongſt laborious employments. Soldiers ſuffer many hardſhips from the inclemency of ſeaſons, long marches,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012338_0082_0F88EDB22FE17240"/>
hunger, bad proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe occaſion fevers, flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, rheumatiſms, and other fatal diſeaſes, which often do more execution than the ſword, eſpecially when campaigns are continued too late in the ſeaſon. One week of cold rainy weather will kill more men than many months when it is dry and warm.</p>
                        <p>EVERY commander ſhould take care that his ſoldiers be well clothed and well fed. He ought alſo to endeavour to put an end to the campaign in due ſeaſon, and to provide his men with winter quarters that are dry and well-aired. Theſe eaſy rules, with taking care to keep the ſick at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſtance from thoſe in health, will go a great length in preſerving the lives of the ſoldiery.</p>
                        <p>IT is indeed to be regretted, that ſoldiers ſuffer no leſs by indolence and intemperance in time of peace, than from hardſhips in time of war. When men are idle, they will be vicious. It would therefore be of the greateſt importance, could a ſcheme be formed for rendering the military in time of peace leſs vicious, more healthy, and more uſeful to ſociety. All thoſe deſirable objects might certainly be promoted by only employing them five or ſix hours every day, and advancing their pay in proportion. By this means idleneſs, the mother of vice, would not only be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but the price of labour might be lowered. Public works, as harbours, canals, turn-pike roads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might be made without hurting manufactures; and ſoldiers might be enabled to marry, and bring up children.</p>
                        <p>A SCHEME of this kind might be ſo conducted as to raiſe inſtead of depreſſing the martial ſpirit, provided the men were never allowed to work above a certain number of hours, and obliged always to work without doors. No ſoldier ſhould ever be allowed to work too long, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to follow any ſedentary employment. Sedentary employments render men weak and effeminate, and quite unfit for the hardſhips of war; whereas working a few hours daily without doors would innure them to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brace their nerves, and promote their ſtrength and courage.</p>
                        <p>SAILORS may alſo be numbered amongſt the laborious. They undergo great hardſhips from change of climate, the violence of weather, hard labour, bad proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors are of ſo great importance both to the trade and ſafety of this kingdom, that too much pains can never be beſtowed in pointing out the proper means of preſerving their lives.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="79" facs="unknown:012338_0083_0F88EDB675D138C0"/>
EXCESS is one great ſource of the diſeaſes of ſea-faring people. When they get on ſhore, after being long at ſea, without regard to the climate, or their own conſtitutions, they plunge headlong into all manner of riot, and often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt till a fever puts an end to their lives. Thus intemperance, and not the climate, is often the cauſe why ſo many of our brave ſailors die on foreign coaſts. We would not have ſea-faring people live too low; but they will find tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the beſt defence againſt fevers, and many other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies.</p>
                        <p>SAILORS when on duty are often expoſed to cold and wet. When that happens, they ſhould change their cloaths as ſoon as they are relieved, and take every proper method to reſtore the perſpiration. In this caſe they ſhould not have recourſe to ſpirits, or other ſtrong liquors, but ſhould rather drink ſuch as are weak and diluted, of a proper warmth, and go immediately to bed, where a ſound ſleep and a gentle ſweat will ſet all to rights.</p>
                        <p>THE health of ſailors ſuffers moſt from unwholeſome food. The conſtant uſe of ſalted proviſions vitiates the whole humours, and occaſions the ſcurvy, and other obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate maladies. It is no eaſy matter to prevent this diſeaſe in long voyages; yet we cannot help thinking, that much might be done towards effecting ſo deſirable an end, were due pains beſtowed for that purpoſe. For example, various roots, greens, and fruits might be kept a long time at ſea, as potatoes, cabbages, lemons, oranges, tamarinds, apples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When fruits cannot be kept the juices of them either freſh or fermented, may. With theſe all the drink, and even the food of the ſhips company, ought to be acidulated in long voyages. But ſuppoſe the vegetable acids ſhould fail, yet the chymical, as cream of tartar, elixir of vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be kept for any length of time; and as they are attended with no expence, it is in the power of every ſailor to lay in enough of theſe for the longeſt voyage. Theſe, though not ſo good as vegetable acids, are ſtill better than none, and ſhould always be uſed when the others fail.</p>
                        <p>STALE bread and beer likewiſe contribute to vitiate the humours. Meal will keep for a long while on board, of which freſh bread might frequently be made. Malt too might be kept on board, and infuſed with boiling water at any time. This liquor, when drank even in the form of wort, is very wholeſome, and is found to be an excellent antidote againſt the ſcurvy. Small wines and cyder might
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012338_0084_0F88EDB770E70EE8"/>
likewiſe be plentifully laid in, and ſhould they turn ſour, they would ſtill be uſeful, as vinegar. Vinegar is a very great antidote againſt diſeaſes, and ſhould be uſed by all travellers, eſpecially at ſea.</p>
                        <p>SUCH animals as can be kept alive ought likewiſe to be carried on board, as hens, ducks, pigs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Freſh broths made of portable ſoup, and puddings made of peas, or other vegetables, ought to be uſed frequently. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things will occur to people converſant in theſe matters, which would tend to preſerve the health of that brave and uſeful ſet of men. Pity it is that ſo little attention ſhould be paid to theſe things by ſuch as have it in their power to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them; but intereſt binds the eyes of ſome, while others, totally regardleſs of the future, will make no proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſeaſes till they feel them.</p>
                        <p>THERE is reaſon to believe, if care were taken with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the diet, air, cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ſea-faring people, that they would be the moſt healthy ſet of men in the world; but when theſe are not duly regarded, the very reverſe muſt happen.</p>
                        <p>PERUVIAN bark is the beſt <hi>medical antidote</hi> that we can recommend to ſailors or ſoldiers on foreign coaſts. This will often prevent fevers, and other fatal diſeaſes. A dram or ſo of it may be chewed every day, or if this ſhould prove diſagreeable, an ounce of bark, with half an ounce of orange-pill, and two drams of ſnake-root coarſely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, may be infuſed for two or three days in an Engliſh quart of brandy, and half a wine glaſs of it taken twice or thrice a-day, when the ſtomach is moſt empty. This has been found to be an excellent antidote againſt fluxes, putrid, intermitting, and other fevers, in unhealthy climates. It is not material in what form this medicine be adminiſtred. It may either be infuſed in water, wine, or ſpirits, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended above, or made into an electuary with ſyrup of lemons, oranges, or the like.</p>

                        <head>The SEDENTARY.</head>
                        <p>THOUGH nothing can be more contrary to the nature of man than a ſedentary life, yet the far greater part of the human ſpecies are comprehended under this claſs. Almoſt the whole female world, and, in manufacturing countries, the major part of the males, may be reckoned ſedentary.</p>
                        <p>AGRICULTURE, the firſt and moſt healthful of all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, is now followed by few who are able to carry on any other buſineſs. Thoſe who imagine that the culture of the earth is not ſufficient to employ all its inhabitants, are greatly miſtaken. An ancient Roman, we are told, could maintain his family from the produce of one acre of ground. So might a modern Briton, if he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to live like a Roman. This ſhows what an immenſe increaſe of inhabitants Britain might admit of, and all of them live by the culture of the ground. Agriculture is the great ſource of domeſtic riches. It is of all employments the moſt favourable to health and population. When it is neglected, whatever wealth may be imported from abroad, poverty, wretchedneſs, and miſery will abound at home. Such is, and ever will be, the fluctuating nature of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, that ten thouſand people may be in bread to-day, and in beggary to-morrow. This can never happen to thoſe who cultivate the ground. They can eat the fruit of their labour, and can always by induſtry obtain, at leaſt, the neceſſaries of life.</p>
                        <p>THO' ſedentary employments be neceſſary, yet there ſeems to be no reaſon why any perſon ſhould be confined for life to theſe alone. Were ſuch employments intermixed with the more active and laborious, they would never do hurt. It is conſtant confinement that ruins the health. A man many not be hurt by ſitting four or five hours a-day, who, were he obliged to ſit ten or twelve, would ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>BUT it is not want of exerciſe alone which hurts ſedenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry people; they often ſuffer from the unwholeſome air which they breathe. It is very common to ſee ten or a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

continue for many hours at a time, with often the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ſundry candles, which help to waſte the air, and render it leſs fit for reſpiration. Air that is breathed over and over, loſes its ſpring, and becomes unfit for expanding the lungs. This is one cauſe of the phthiſical coughs, and other complaints of the breaſt, ſo incident to ſedentary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers.</p>
                        <p>EVEN the perſpiration from a great number of bodies pent up together, renders the air unwholeſome. The danger from this quarter is greatly increaſed, if any of them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to have bad lungs, or to be other ways diſeaſed. Thoſe who ſit near him, being forced to breathe the ſame air, can hardly fail to be infected. It would be a rare thing indeed to find a dozen of ſedentary people all ſound. The danger of crouding them together muſt therefore be evident to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one.</p>
                        <p>MANY of thoſe who follow ſedentary employments are conſtantly in a bending poſture, as ſhoemakers, taylors, cutlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such a ſituation is extremely hurtful. A bending poſture obſtructs all the vital motions, and of courſe muſt ruin the health. Accordingly we find ſuch artificers generally complain of indigeſtions, flatulencies, headaches, pains of the breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſuch people the firſt concoction is generally bad, and as that fault can never be mended in any of the ſubſequent ones, it cannot fail to induce a total vitium of the humours, which paves the way to innumerable diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>THE aliment in ſedentary people, inſtead of being puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forwards by an erect poſture, the action of the muſcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in a manner confined in the bowels. Hence coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wind, and other hypocondriacal ſymptoms, the never failing companions of the ſedentary. Indeed none of the ſecretions can be duly performed where exerciſe is wanting, and when any one of theſe is retained too long in the body, it muſt have bad effects, as it is again taken up into the maſs of humours.</p>
                        <p>A bending poſture is very hurtful to the lungs. When this organ is compreſſed, the air cannot have free acceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all its parts, ſo as to expand them properly. Hence tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercles, adheſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are formed, which often end in conſumptions. The proper action of the lungs is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary for making good blood. When that organ fails, the humours ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

is abſolutely neceſſary to life, and being of a ſoft texture, their functions are eaſily obſtructed by any ſort of preſſure.</p>
                        <p>THE ſedentary are not only hurt by preſſure on the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but alſo on the inferior extremities, which obſtructs the circulation in theſe parts, and renders them weak and feeble. Thus taylors, ſhoemakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> frequently loſe the uſe of their legs altogether; beſides the blood and other humours, by ſtagnating in theſe parts, are vitiated; from whence proceed the ſcab, ulcerous ſores, foul blotches, and other cutaneous diſeaſes, ſo common among ſedentary artificers.</p>
                        <p>A bad figure of body is a very common conſequence of cloſe application to ſedentary employments. The ſpine, for example, by being continually bent, puts on a crooked ſhape, and generally remains ſo ever after. But a bad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of body has already been obſerved to be hurtful to health, as the vital functions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are thereby impeded.</p>
                        <p>A ſedentary life never fails to occaſion an univerſal relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſolids. This is the grand ſource from whence moſt of the diſeaſes of ſedentary people flow. The ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fula, conſumption, rickets, and many other maladies which now abound, were little known in this country before ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary artificers became ſo numerous; and they are very little known ſtill among ſuch of our people as follow active employments without doors, though in the great manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing towns, at leaſt two thirds of the inhabitants are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with them.</p>
                        <p>IT is the more difficult to remedy thoſe evils, becauſe many who have been accuſtomed to a ſedentary life, like rickety children, loſe all inclination for exerciſe; we ſhall however give a few hints with reſpect to the moſt likely means for preſerving the health of this uſeful ſet of people, which ſome of them, we hope, will be wiſe enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                        <p>IT has been obſerved, that ſedentary artificers are often hurt by their bending poſture. They ought therefore to ſtand or ſit as erect as the nature of their employments will permit. They ſhould likewiſe change poſtures frequently, and ſhould never ſit too long at a time, but leave off work and walk, ride, run, or do any thing that will promote the vital functions.</p>
                        <p>SEDENTARY artificers are allowed too little time for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe; yet, ſhort as it is, they ſeldom employ it properly. A journeyman taylor or weaver, inſtead of walking abroad
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:012338_0088_0F88EDBA2CA99BE8"/>
for exerciſe and freſh air, at his hours of leiſure, chooſes often to ſpend them in a publick houſe, or in purſuing ſome ſedentary diverſion, at which he generally loſes both his time and money.</p>
                        <p>THE awkward poſtures in which many ſedentary artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers work, ſeem rather to be the effect of cuſtom than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. For example, a table might ſurely be contrived for ten or a dozen taylors to ſit round it, with liberty for their legs either to hang down, or reſt upon a foot-board, as they ſhould chooſe. A place might be cut out in the table for every perſon to ſit in, by which means his work would lie as ready to his hand, as in the preſent mode of ſitting croſs-legged.</p>
                        <p>WE would recommend to all ſedentary artificers the moſt religious regard to cleanlineſs. Both their ſituation and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations render this highly neceſſary. Nothing would contribute more to preſerve ſedentary artificers in health, than a ſtrict attention to this rule; and ſuch of them as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect it, not only run the hazard of loſing their health, but of becoming a nuiſance to ſociety.</p>
                        <p>SEDENTARY people ſhould live ſpare. They ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to avoid food that is windy, or hard of digeſtion, and ſhould pay the ſtricteſt regard to ſobriety. A perſon who works hard without doors will ſoon throw off an overcharge of liquor, but one who ſits has by no means an equal chance. Hence it often happens, that ſedentary people are ſeized with fevers after hard drinking. When ſuch people feel their ſpirits low, inſtead of running to the tavern for relief, they ſhould ride, or walk into the fields. This would remove the complaint more effectually than ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and would never hurt the conſtitution.</p>
                        <p>INSTEAD of multiplying rules for preſerving the health of the ſedentary, we ſhall recommend the following general plan, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That every perſon who follows a ſedentary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment ſhould cultivate a piece of ground with his own hands. This he might dig, plant, ſow, and weed at his leiſure-hours, ſo as to make it both an exerciſe and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while it produced many of the neceſſaries of life. After working an hour in a garden, a man will return with more keenneſs to his employment within doors, than if he had been all the while idle.</p>
                        <p>LABOURING the ground is every way conducive to health. It not only gives exerciſe to every part of the body, but the very ſmell of the earth and freſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012338_0089_0F88EDBAE92DEE60"/>
chear the ſpirits, whilſt the perpetual proſpect of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing coming to maturity, delights and entertains the mind. We are ſo made as to be always pleaſed with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in proſpect, however diſtant or however trivial. Hence the happineſs that moſt men feel in planting, ſowing, building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe ſeem to have been the chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the early ages; and when kings and conquerors cultivated the ground, there is reaſon to believe, that they knew as well wherein true happineſs conſiſted as we do.</p>
                        <p>IT may ſeem romantic to recommend gardening to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturers in great towns; but obſervation proves, that the plan is very practicable. In the town of Sheffield, in Yorkſhire, where the great iron manufacture is carried on, there is hardly a journeyman cutler who does not occupy a piece of ground which he cultivates as a garden. This practice has many ſalutary effects. It not only induces theſe people to take exerciſe without doors, but alſo to eat many greens, roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of their own produce, which they would not think of purchaſing. There ſeems to be no reaſon why manufacturers in any other town in Great-Britain ſhould not follow this example.</p>
                        <p>MECHANICS are too much inclined to crowd into great towns. This ſituation may have ſome advantages, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſadvantages. All mechanics who live in the country, have it in their power, and indeed moſt of them do, occupy a piece of ground, which not only gives them exerciſe, but enables them to live more comfortably. So far at leaſt as our obſervation reaches, mechanics who live in the country are far more happy than thoſe in great towns. They enjoy better health, live in greater affluence, and ſeldom fail to rear a healthy and numerous-offspring.</p>
                        <p>IN a word, exerciſe without doors, in one ſhape or other, is abſolutely neceſſary to health. Thoſe who neglect it, though they may for a while drag out life, can hardly be ſaid to enjoy it. Their humours are generally vitiated, their ſolids relaxed and weak, and their ſpirits low and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>

                        <p>INTENSE thought is ſo deſtructive to health, that few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can be produced of ſtudious perſons who live to an extreme old age. Hard ſtudy always implies a ſedentary life; and when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>SO great is the power of the mind over the body, that by its influence the whole vital motion may be accelerated or retarded, to almoſt any degree. Chearfulneſs and mirth quicken the circulation, and promote all the ſecretions; whereas ſadneſs and profound thought never fail to retard them. Thus even a degree of thoughtfulneſs is neceſſary to health. The perpetual thinker ſeldom enjoys either health or ſpirits; while the perſon who can hardly be ſaid to think at all, ſeldom fails to enjoy both. The mind, by a habit of thinking, in ſome meaſure, loſes the power of unbending itſelf. This may be called a diſeaſe of the mind, and ſhould be as carefully guarded againſt as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malady.</p>
                        <p>PERPETUAL thinkers, as they are called, ſeldom think to much purpoſe. Such people, in a courſe of years, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally become quite ſtupid, and exhibit a melancholy proof how readily the greateſt bleſſings may be abuſed. Thought, like all other things, when carried to extreme, becomes a vice. Hence nothing can afford a greater proof of wiſdom than for a man frequently and ſeaſonably to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend his mind. This may always be done by a chearful company, active diverſions, muſic, or the like.</p>
                        <p>THE gout is the common companion of the ſtudious. This excruciating diſeaſe generally proceeds from indigeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and an obſtructed perſpiration. It is impoſſible that the man who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

are diſordered, nature generally attempts to free her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the offending cauſe, by the urinary paſſages; but when theſe become unfit for performing their proper func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this attempt muſt fail, and conſequently diſeaſes will enſue.</p>
                        <p>OBSTRUCTIONS of the liver prove often fatal to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. Diſeaſes of that organ are very obſtinate, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally complicated. The circulation in the liver being ſlow, obſtructions can hardly fail to be the conſequence of inactivity. Hence ſedentary people are frequently afflicted with ſchirrous livers, the jaundice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The proper ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcharge of the bile is ſo neceſſary a part of the animal oeconomy, that where it is not duly performed, the health muſt needs be impaired. Indigeſtion, loſs of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and a waſting of the whole body, ſeldom fail to be the conſequences of a vitium, or obſtructions of the bile.</p>
                        <p>FEW diſeaſes prove more fatal to the ſtudious than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of the lungs. It has already been obſerved, that this organ cannot be duly expanded in thoſe who do not take proper exerciſe, and where that is the caſe, obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, adheſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt enſue. Not only want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, but the poſture in which ſtudious people often ſit, is very hurtful to the lungs. Thoſe who read or write much are apt to contract a habit of bending forwards, and often preſs with their breaſt upon a table or bench, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is impoſſible this poſture ſhould fail to hurt the lungs. It ought therefore to be avoided with the utmoſt care.</p>
                        <p>THE ſtudious are often afflicted with want of appetite and indigeſtions. Theſe lay the foundation of numerous diſeaſes. When the digeſtions fail, the humours muſt ſoon be depraved, to which ſucceed low ſpirits, weak nerves, with the whole train of hyſteric and hypochondriac mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                        <p>HEADACHES often afflict the ſtudious. Theſe proceed from long and intenſe thinking, and ſometimes they are ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by coſtiveneſs. The beſt way to prevent them is never to ſtudy too long, and to keep the belly regular ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by proper food, or taking frequently a little of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening medicine.</p>
                        <p>Diſeaſes of the eyes often afflict the ſtudious. Such therefore as read or write much ſhould early accuſtom themſelves to uſe <hi>preſerves.</hi> Night-ſtudy is moſt deſtructive to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

the whole body. Nothing more certainly ruins the health, than the practice of ſpending thoſe hours in the cloſet which ſhould be allotted to ſleep. Studious perſons will find their eyes greatly ſtrengthened by bathing them frequently in cold water, or brandy and water mixed.</p>
                        <p>THE dropſy is another of thoſe diſeaſes which commonly affect the ſtudious, and very often puts an end to their lives. It has already been obſerved, that the ſecretions are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally defective in the ſtudious, and that various diſeaſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which is the dropſy, are occaſioned by the retention of theſe humours which ought to be thrown off in that way. Any perſon may obſerve, that ſitting makes his legs ſwell, and that this will go off by exerciſe; which clearly points out the method of prevention to all who can take it. To thoſe who cannot take exerciſe, we would recommend the uſe of the fleſh-bruſh, cold bathing, and ſuch food as is of a bracing and ſtrengthening nature.</p>
                        <p>FEVERS, eſpecially of the nervous kind, are often the effect of ſtudy. Nothing is ſo deſtructive to the nerves as intenſe thought. It is able, in a manner, to unhinge the whole machine. It not only hurts the vital motions, but diſorders the mind itſelf. Hence a delirium, melancholy, and even madneſs, are often the effect of cloſe application to ſtudy. There is no diſeaſe which can proceed either from a bad ſtate of the humours, a defect of the uſual ſecreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or a debility of the nervous ſyſtem, which may not be brought on by intenſe thinking.</p>
                        <p>BUT the moſt afflicting of all the diſeaſes which attack the ſtudious, are the hypochondriacal. Theſe ſeldom fail to be the companions of deep thought, and may rather be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a complication of maladies than a ſingle one. To what a wretched paſs are the beſt of men often reduced by theſe maladies? Their ſtrength and appetite fail. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual gloom hangs over their minds. They live in the conſtant dread of death, and are continually in ſearch of relief from medicine, where, alas! it is not to be found. This diſeaſe far exceeds all deſcription, and thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under it, though they be often made the ſubject of ridicule, juſtly claim our higheſt ſympathy and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING can be more prepoſterous than for any man to make ſtudy his ſole buſineſs. A mere ſtudent is ſeldom a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> an uſeful invention is the effect of ſtudy. The farther that
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:012338_0093_0F88EDC26BD04730"/>
men dive into profound reſearches, they generally deviate the more from common ſenſe, and too often loſe ſight of it altogether. Hence it is that profound ſpeculations, inſtead of making men wiſer or better, generally render them mere ſceptics, and overwhelm them in doubt and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. All that is neceſſary for man to know, in order to be happy, is eaſily obtained, and the reſt, like the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tree, ſerves only to increaſe his miſery.</p>
                        <p>STUDIOUS people, in order to relieve their minds; muſt not only diſcontinue to read and write, but engage in ſome employment or amuſement, that will ſo far occupy the thought as to make them forget the buſineſs of the cloſet. A ſolitary ride or walk are ſo far from relieving the mind, that they rather encourage thought. Nothing can divert the mind, when it gets into a train of ſerious thinking, but an attention to ſubjects of a more trivial nature. Theſe, when compared with the other, prove a kind of play to the mind, and conſequently relieve it.</p>
                        <p>THINKING men are apt to contract a contempt for what they call trifling company. They are aſhamed to be ſeen with any but philoſophers. This however is no proof of their being philoſophers themſelves. No man deſerves the name of a philoſopher who is aſhamed to unbend his mind by aſſociating with the cheerful and gay. Even the ſociety of children will relieve the mind, and expel the gloom which application to ſtudy is too apt to occaſion. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that ſuch as have numerous families; whatever hardſhips they may labour under, are generally the moſt cheerful and happy.</p>
                        <p>AS ſtudious people are neceſſarily much within doors, they ſhould make choice of a large and well-aired place for ſtudy. That would not only prevent the bad effects which attend confined air, but would cheer the ſpirits, and have a moſt happy influence both on the body and mind. It is ſaid of Euripides, the Tragedian, that he uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to a dark cave to compoſe his tragedies; and of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, the Grecian orator, that he choſe a place for ſtudy where nothing could either be heard or ſeen. With all deference to ſuch venerable names, we cannot help con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning this taſte. A man may ſurely think to as good purpoſe in an elegant apartment as in a cave; and may have as happy ideas where the all-cheering rays of the ſun <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>der the air wholeſome, as in places where they never reach.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="unknown:012338_0094_0F88EDC32E349D00"/>
THOSE who read or write much ſhould be very attentive to their poſture. They ought to ſit and ſtand by turns, always keeping as near an erect poſture as poſſible. Thoſe who dictate may do it walking. It has an excellent effect frequently to read or ſpeak aloud. This not only exerciſes the lungs, but almoſt the whole body, Hence ſtudious people are greatly benefited by delivering diſcourſes in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Such indeed ſometimes hurt themſelves by over-act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their part; but that is their own fault. The man who dies a martyr to mere vociferation merits not our ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>
                        <p>THE morning has by all medical writers been reckoned the beſt time for ſtudy. It is ſo. But it is alſo the moſt proper ſeaſon for exerciſe, while the ſtomach is empty, and the ſpirits refreſhed with ſleep. Studious people ſhould therefore frequently ſpend the morning in ſome manly diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion abroad. This would make them return to ſtudy with greater alacrity, and would be of more ſervice than twice the time after their ſpirits are worn out with fatigue. It is not ſufficient to take diverſion only when we can think no longer. Every ſtudious perſon ſhould make it a part of his buſineſs, and ſhould let nothing interrupt his hours of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation more than thoſe of ſtudy.</p>
                        <p>MUSIC has a moſt happy effect in relieving the mind. It would be well if every ſtudious perſon were ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with that ſcience as to amuſe himſelf after ſevere thought, by playing ſuch airs as have a tendency to rouſe the ſpirits, and inſpire cheerfulneſs and good humour.</p>
                        <p>STUDIOUS perſons generally ſpend their mornings in the cloſet, and their evenings in company. It were better to invert this rule. It is the reproach of learning, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her ſons, to relieve the mind after ſtudy, betake themſelves to the uſe of ſtrong liquors. This indeed is a remedy; but it is a deſperate one, and always ends in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Would ſuch perſons, when their ſpirits are low, get on horſe-back, and gallop ten or a dozen miles, they would find it a more effectual remedy than all the ſtrong liquors in the world. A good horſe is the beſt preventive medicine that we can recommend to the ſtudious. This is better than all the nervous antidotes of the ſhops, and will in the end be found much cheaper.</p>
                        <p>IT is really to be regretted that men, while in health, pay ſo little regard to theſe things! How common is it to ſee a wretch, over-run with nervous diſeaſes, bathing,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:012338_0095_0F88EDC3F6CFFB80"/>
walking, riding, and in a word, doing every thing for health after it is gone; yet if any one had recommended theſe things by way of prevention, his advice would have been treated with contempt, or, at leaſt, with neglect. Such is the weakneſs of human nature, and ſuch the folly and want of foreſight, even of thoſe who ought to be the wiſeſt of mankind!</p>

                        <p>BEFORE we proceed to the particular treatment of diſeaſes, it will be neceſſary to lay down ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rules for diſtinguiſhing one diſeaſe from another, as the danger of miſtaking the diſeaſe often deters people from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to relieve the ſick.</p>
                        <p>TO diſtinguiſh diſeaſes is the moſt difficult part of the practice of phyſic. So near a reſemblance do the ſymptoms of one diſeaſe often bear to thoſe of another, that they may deceive the moſt ſkilful phyſician. We do not mean in this place to give the diſtinguiſhing marks of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſeaſe, but only to put the reader upon his guard by pointing out a few of thoſe diſeaſes which have the neareſt reſemblance to one another, and which the unwary and inattentive may be moſt apt to miſtake.</p>
                        <p>THE ſmall-pox and meaſles are both preceded by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhivering, with heat and cold by turns, a quick pulſe, great thirſt, and other ſymptoms of a fever. In both the eruption appears about the third or fourth day in little ſpots reſembling flea-bites. Thus far the diſeaſe cannot be certainly known; but on the ſecond or third day from the eruption, the ſmall-pox begin to riſe and to fill with matter; which plainly ſhows the nature of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>THE petechial or ſpotted fever, may be known from the miliary by this mark, that in the former the ſpots never riſe above the ſkin; whereas in the latter the ſkin is rough, and before the eruption appears the patient complains of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, itching in the ſkin, and oppreſſion of the breaſt.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH there be a great ſimilarity in the firſt ſymptoms of all fevers, yet an attentive obſerver may generally diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to what claſs they belong. Thus a burning fever may
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:012338_0097_0F88EDC575802EA8"/>
be known by the intenſe heat of the whole body, a dry parched ſkin, a chapt tongue, and unquenchable thirſt. An inflammatory fever generally affects one particular part, as the lungs, the ſtomach, the brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This kind of fever has a natural tendency to a mortification. Malignant fevers are generally owing to infection. They may be known by the patient's ſudden loſs of ſtrength, perpetual watching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A catarrhal fever is known by a running at the noſe, a hoarſeneſs, and a ſenſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE peripneumony and pleuriſy may be diſtinguiſhed by this, that in the latter the pain is more acute, and in the former the oppreſſion of the breaſt, and difficulty of breathing are greater, and the ſpittle is generally tinctured with blood.</p>
                        <p>INTERMITTENT fevers or agues are known by their leaving the patient, and returning at certain periods, as once a day, once in two days, three days, or the like. They are denominated from the ſpace between the fits, as quotidian, or every day agues, tertian, or ſuch as return every other day, quartan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A hectic fever may be known by its ſupervening to ſome other diſorder, as the dropſy, conſumption, ſcurvy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It differs from a ſlow fever in this, that the pulſe is always quick, but remarkably ſo in the morning; whereas the pulſe in a ſlow fever is more natural in a morning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meals, though it be more quick after eating: Beſides, in a ſlow fever the weakneſs is not ſo great as in a hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</p>
                        <p>AN inflammation of the ſtomach may be diſtinguiſhed from a cardialgia, an inflammation of the liver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a ſenſe of the moſt intenſe heat in the ſtomach, a fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a quick, unequal and weak pulſe, and a prodigious uneaſineſs upon taking any thing into the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>AN inflammation in the concave part of the liver may be diſtinguiſhed from the baſtard pleuriſy, by the fever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs violent, the breathing eaſier, and the pain lower down. Beſides, the baſtard pleuriſy generally goes off on the ſeventh day; whereas the inflammation of the liver is a tedious diſeaſe, and often ends in an abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

about the head and temples, which always attend it. It differs from a delirium in being more violent, from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in being an accute diſeaſe, and from the hydrophobia in this, that the patient has no averſion from liquids.</p>
                        <p>A nephritis, or inflammation of the kidneys, may be diſtinguiſhed from a fit of the gravel, by a fixed, dull, preſſing pain in the loins, which continues long; whereas the pain in a fit of the gravel is more violent, leſs fixed, and generally extends downwards.</p>
                        <p>EXTERNAL inflammations are eaſily diſtinguiſhed. An <hi>eryſipelas,</hi> or St. Anthony's fire, only affects the ſkin with redneſs, tumour and pain; whereas a <hi>phlegmon</hi> reaches to the ſubjacent muſcles, and a <hi>gangrene</hi> penetrates not only the muſcles, but even the tendinous and nervous parts, and is attended with great heat, pain, and redneſs, which at length change into a livid or black colour.</p>
                        <p>A ſtone deſcending by the uriters may eaſily be miſtaken for a fit of the colic, as both are attended with violent pain, vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the former, however, the pain is more fixed in the loins, is attended with ſhiverings, and as the ſtone deſcends, the pain reaches downwards, and occaſions a numbneſs of the thigh on the ſide affected; there is alſo a frequent inclination to paſs water, with ſome degree of ſtrangury; whereas in the colic the pain is chiefly about the navel, and the belly is generally diſtended with wind.</p>
                        <p>THE gout may be diſtinguiſhed from the rheumatiſm by its attacking the extremities chiefly, and being attended with a greater inflammation, and more violent pain. It may likewiſe be diſtinguiſhed from venereal pains, by its being more violent in the day; whereas they are moſt ſevere in the night.</p>
                        <p>THE piles may be miſtaken for a dyſentary, as both tinge the ſtools with blood, though the one be a dangerous diſeaſe, and the other in many caſes a ſalutary evacuation. In the piles however the blood flows without pain or gripes; whereas in the dyſentary the ſtools are attended with the moſt violent gripes, ſpaſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>COUGHS may be owing to cold, an ulcer in the lungs, an aſthma, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The beſt way to diſtinguiſh them is to examine into the cauſe, to obſerve what the patient ſpits, and to mark the continuance of the diſeaſe. A cough occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by catching cold is generally attended with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of phlegm, and is ſeldom of long continuance. That
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:012338_0099_0F88E9B76E5FF6A8"/>
which is owing to an ulcer of the lungs is generally attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an hectic fever, and the ſpittle is mixed with matter. An aſthmatic cough is generally owing to wind or ſpaſms, and ſeldom admits of relief from medicine.</p>
                        <p>A headach, which proceeds from too great a quantity of blood being forced into the veſſels of the brain, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attended with heat, redneſs, and a ſwelling of the face, a great pulſation of the arteries of the neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That kind of headach, which is the effect of venereal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageon, may be known by its being generally worſt in the night. When the headach is owing to an effuſion of ſerum or blood into the ſinuoſities of the bones of the forehead, the pain is obſtinate, ſharp and fixed; it is generally ſituated in the bottom of the forehead, and above the eyes. When the head is diſordered from crudities in the ſtomach or wind, it may be known from belching, and the increaſe of the diſorder upon uſing flatulent food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AN apoplexy may be diſtinguiſhed from a ſyncope or fainting fit, by the colour of the face, the breathing, and the pulſe continuing much the ſame as in health; whereas in a ſyncope the pulſe and breathing are imperceptible, the face is pale, and the body grows cold. An apoplexy may be diſtinguiſhed from a catalepſy, becauſe the latter comes on ſuddenly, and keeps the member quite rigid, and in the ſame poſture as at the time of the attack</p>
                        <p>A proper attention to the age, ſex, conſtitution, temper of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the patient would greatly aſſiſt us in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and diſtinguiſhing diſeaſes. Thus, in children the fibres are lax and ſoft; in adults, rigid and tenſe. In young people the nerves are extremely irritable, and the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids thin. In old age the nerves become almoſt inſenſible, and many of the veſſels imperviable. Theſe, and number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs other peculiarities, render the diſeaſes of the young and thoſe of the aged very different; and of courſe they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire different treatment.</p>
                        <p>NOT only the age, but alſo the ſex of the patient, claims our attention. Females are liable to many peculiar diſeaſes. Their nervous ſyſtem being weak and delicate, they are eaſier affected with ſpaſtic or convulſive diſorders than males. This is the true ſource of moſt of the diſeaſes of the fair ſex, and ought always to be kept in view in the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their diſorders.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="96" facs="unknown:012338_0100_0F88E9B840180858"/>
WE ought likewiſe to attend to the particular conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This not only prediſpoſes perſons to peculiar diſeaſes, but likewiſe makes it neceſſary, that their diſeaſes be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a very different manner. For example, a delicate perſon with weak nerves, can neither bear bleeding, nor any other evacuation, to the ſame extent as one whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is hardy and robuſt.</p>
                        <p>THE temper of mind ought likewiſe to be attended to in diſeaſes. Fear, anxiety, and a fretful temper both occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aggravate diſeaſes. The medicine of the mind is too little regarded. In vain do we apply medicines to the body to remove diſeaſes which proceed from the mind. When that is the caſe, the beſt medicine is to ſooth the paſſions, divert the mind from anxious thought, and to cheriſh the hopes of the patient.</p>
                        <p>ATTENTION ought likewiſe to be paid to the place where the patient lives, the air he breathes, his diet, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such as live in low marſhy countries, are ſubject to many diſeaſes which are unknown to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the high countries. Thoſe who breathe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure air of cities have many maladies, to which the more happy ruſtics are ſtrangers. Such as feed groſs, and indulge in ſtrong liquors are liable to diſeaſes which do not affect the temperate and abſtemious. The ſituation of life, as has been obſerved, likewiſe prediſpoſes men to peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar diſeaſes. Thus the laborious, the ſedentary, the ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are liable to particular maladies from the very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations which they follow.</p>
                        <p>IT is neceſſary to enquire whether or not the patient has been guilty of any exceſs in eating or drinking, if he has overſtrained himſelf, has drank cold liquor when he was warm, lain on the damp ground, changed his uſual cloathing, or, in a word, done any thing that might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the perſpiration. It will alſo be proper to inquire, if any uſual evacuation, as ſweating of the feet, iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> has been ſtopped. The ſtate of the belly ſhould likewiſe be enquired into. Coſtiveneſs alone will occaſion diſeaſes, and the removing of it will cure them.</p>
                        <p>IT is likewiſe neceſſary to inquire what diſeaſes the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has formerly been moſt liable to, and what medicines were moſt beneficial. If medicines have been adminiſtered, it will be proper to enquire into their effect. It will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be neceſſary to inquire, what kind of medicines are
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:012338_0101_0F88E9B991101290"/>
moſt agreeable to the patient, or if he has an averſion to any particular drug, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT is alſo neceſſary to inquire whether the patient can perform with eaſe all the animal and vital functions, or which of them gives him pain; and alſo to inquire, if all the different ſecretions go duly on, as the perſpiration, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE nature of the diſeaſe is likewiſe to be inquired into, as whether it be primary or ſecondary; whether ſimple or complicated with ſome other diſeaſe; whether it be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or internal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether epidemic or not; whether it be the effect of age, intemperance, infection, or owing to a vitiated ſtate of the humours, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>OF FEVERS IN GENERAL.</head>
                        <p>A Fever is the moſt general diſeaſe incident to mankind. It attacks every age, ſex, and conſtitution, and effects every part of the body; nor is the mind itſelf free from its influence. A fever is known by a quick pulſe, an increaſed heat, and a difficulty in performing ſome of the vital or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal functions, as breathing, walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FEVERS are divided into continual, remitting, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting. By a continual fever is meant that which never leaves the patient during the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, or which ſhews no remarkable increaſe or abatement in the ſymptoms. This kind of fever is likewiſe divided into acute, flow, and malignant. The fever is called <hi>acute,</hi> when its progreſs is quick, and the ſymptoms violent; but when theſe are more gentle, it is generally denominated <hi>flow.</hi> When livid or petechial ſpots, ſhow a putrid ſtate of the humours, the fever is called <hi>malignant, putrid,</hi> or <hi>pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A remitting fever differs from a continual, only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. It has frequent increaſes and decreaſes, or exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and remiſſions, but never wholly leaves the patient during the courſe of the diſeaſe. Intermitting fevers, or agues, are thoſe which, during the time that the patient may be ſaid to be ill, have evident intervals or remiſſions of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>AS a fever is nothing elſe but an effort of nature to free herſelf from an offending cauſe, it is the buſineſs of thoſe who have the care of the ſick, to obſerve with diligence
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:012338_0102_0F88E9B9DC9FD1E0"/>
which way nature points, and to endeavour to aſſiſt her ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Our bodies are ſo framed as to have a conſtant ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to expel or throw off whatever is injurious to health. This is generally done by urine, ſweat, ſtool, expectoration, vomit, or ſome other evacuation.</p>
                        <p>THERE is reaſon to believe, if the efforts of nature, at the beginning of a fever, were duly attended to and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, it would ſeldom continue longer than twenty-four hours; but when her attempts are either neglected, or counteracted, it is no wonder if the diſeaſe be prolonged. There are daily inſtances of perſons, who, after catching cold, have all the ſymptoms of a beginning fever; but by keeping warm, drinking diluting liquors, bathing their feet in warm water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſymptoms in a few hours diſappear, and the danger is prevented. In a word, almoſt every fever proceeding from an obſtructed perſpiration, might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off, or its danger prevented, by timely care.</p>
                        <p>OUR deſign is not to enter into a critical inquiry into the nature, cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of fevers, but to mark their moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſymptoms, and to point out the proper treatment of the patient with reſpect to his diet, drink, air, warmth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the different ſtages of the diſeaſe. In theſe articles the inclinations of the patient will, in a great meaſure, direct our conduct.</p>
                        <p>ALMOST every perſon in a fever complains of great thirſt, and calls out for drink, eſpecially of a cooling nature. This at once points out the uſe of <hi>water,</hi> which we may venture to call the greateſt febrifuge in nature. What is ſo likely to abate the heat, attenuate the humours, remove ſpaſms and obſtructions, promote perſpiration, increaſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of urine, and, in ſhort, produce every ſalutary effect in an ardent or inflammatory fever, as drinking plentifully of warm water, thin gruel, or any other weak, diluting liquor, of which water is the baſis? The neceſſity of diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors is pointed out by the dry tongue, the parched ſkin, and the burning heat, as well as by the unquenchable thirſt of the patient.</p>
                        <p>MANY cooling liquors, which are extremely grateful to patients in a fever, may be prepared from fruits, roots, and acid vegetables, as decoctions of tamarinds, apple-tea, orange-whey, and the like. Mucilaginous liquors might alſo be prepared from marſh-mallow roots, linſeed, lime-tree-buds, and many other vegetables. Theſe liquors, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:012338_0103_0F88E9BB78898E78"/>
when acidulated, are highly agreeable to the patient, and ſhould never be denied him.</p>
                        <p>AT the beginning of a fever, the patient generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of great laſſitude or wearineſs, and has no inclination to move. This evidently ſhows the propriety of keeping him eaſy, and, if poſſible, in bed; that relaxes the ſpaſms, abates the violence of the circulation, and gives nature an opportunity of exerting all her force to overcome the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The bed alone would often remove a fever at the beginning; but when the patient ſtruggles with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, inſtead of driving it off, he only fixes it the deeper, and renders it more dangerous. This obſervation is often veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in travellers, who happen, when on a journey, to be ſeized with a fever. Their anxiety to get home, induces them to travel with the fever upon them, which conduct ſeldom fails to render it fatal.</p>
                        <p>IN fevers, the mind as well as the body ſhould be kept eaſy. Company is ſeldom agreeable to the ſick. Indeed, every thing that diſturbs the imagination increaſes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which reaſon, every perſon in a fever ought to be kept perfectly quiet, and neither allowed to ſee nor hear any thing that may in the leaſt affect or diſcompoſe his mind.</p>
                        <p>THO' the patient in a fever has the greateſt inclination for drink, yet he ſeldom has any appetite for ſolid food; from whence we may ſee the impropriety of loading his ſtomach with victuals. Much ſolid food in a fever is every way hurtful to the patient. It oppreſſes nature, and inſtead of nouriſhing the patient, ſerves only to feed the diſeaſe. What food the patient takes ſhould be in ſmall quantity, light, and eaſy of digeſtion. It ought to be chiefly of the vegetable kind, as water-pap, roaſted apples, groat-gruel, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>POOR people, when any of their family are taken ill, run directly to their rich neighbours for cordials, and pour wines, ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the patient, who perhaps never had been accuſtomed to taſte ſuch liquors when in health. If there be any degree of fever, this conduct muſt increaſe it, and if there be none, this is the ready way to raiſe one. Stuffing the patient with ſweat-meats and other delicacies, is likewiſe very pernicious. Theſe are always harder to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt then common food, and cannot fail to hurt the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING is more deſired by a patient in a fever than freſh air. It not only removes his anxiety, but cools the blood, revives the ſpirits, and proves every way beneficial.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012338_0104_0F88E9BD2645FD28"/>
Many patients are in a manner ſtiffled to death in fevers, for want of freſh air; yet ſuch is the unaccountable infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of many people, that the moment they think a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a fever, they imagine he ſhould be kept in a cloſe chamber, into which not one particle of freſh air muſt be admitted. There ought to be a conſtant ſtream of freſh air into a ſick perſon's chamber, ſo as to keep it always in a temperate degree of warmth, which ought never to be greater than is agreeable to one in perfect health.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING ſpoils the air of a ſick perſon's chamber, or hurts the patient more than a number of people breathing in it. When the blood is inflamed, or the humours in a putrid ſtate, air that has been breathed over and over will greatly increaſe the diſeaſe. Such air not only loſes its ſpring, and becomes unfit for the purpoſes of reſpiration, but acquires a noxious quality, which renders it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poiſonous to the ſick.</p>
                        <p>IN fevers, when the patient's ſpirits are low and depreſſed, he is not only to be ſupported with cordials, but every method ſhould be taken to cheer and comfort his mind. Many, from a miſtaken zeal, when they think a perſon in danger, inſtead of ſolacing his mind with the hopes and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion, fright him with the views of hell and damnation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would be unſuitable here to dwell upon the impropriety and dangerous conſequences of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; it often hurts the body, and there is reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſeldom benefits the ſoul.</p>
                        <p>AMONGST common people, the very name of a fever ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuggeſts the neceſſity of bleeding. This notion ſeems to have taken its riſe from moſt fevers having been formerly of an inflammatory nature; but true inflammatory fevers are now ſeldom to be met with. Sedentary occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a different manner of living, has ſo changed the ſtate of diſeaſes in Britain, that there is now hardly one fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ten where the lance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is neceſſary. In moſt low, ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and putrid fevers, which are now ſo common, bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is really hurtful, as it weakens the patient, and ſinks his ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We would recommend this general rule, never to bleed at the beginning of a fever, unleſs there be evident ſigns of an inflammation. Bleeding is an excellent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine when neceſſary, but ſhould never be wantonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>IT is likewiſe a common notion, that it is always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to raiſe a ſweat in the beginning of a fever. As fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012338_0105_0F88E9BD94D57348"/>
often proceed from an obſtructed perſpiration, this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ill founded. If the patient only lies in bed, bathes his feet and legs in warm water, and drinks freely of water-gruel, or any other weak, diluting liquor, he will ſeldom fail to perſpire freely. The warmth of the bed, and the diluting drink, will relax the univerſal ſpaſm, which generally affect the ſolids at the beginning of a fever; it will open the pores, and promote the perſpiration, by means of which the fever may often be carried off. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, the common practice is to heap cloaths upon the patient, and to give him things of a hot nature, as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſpiceries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which fire his blood, increaſe the ſpaſms, and render the diſeaſe more dangerous.</p>
                        <p>IN all fevers a proper attention ſhould be paid to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's longings. Theſe are the calls of nature, and often point out what may be of real uſe. Patients are not to be wantonly indulged in every thing that the ſickly appetite may crave; but it is generally right to let them have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of what they eagerly deſire, though it may not ſeem al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together proper. What the patient longs for, his ſtomach will generally digeſt; and ſuch things have ſometimes a very happy effect.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a patient is recovering from a fever, great care is is neceſſary to prevent a relapſe. Many perſons, by too ſoon imagining themſelves well, have relapſed, or contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome other diſeaſe of an obſtinate nature. As the body after a fever is weak and delicate, it is neceſſary to guard againſt catching cold. Moderate exerciſe in the open air will be of uſe; agreeable company will alſo have a good effect. The diet muſt be light, but nouriſhing. It ſhould be taken frequently, but in ſmall quantities. It is very dangerous at ſuch a time to eat as much as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach craves.</p>

                        <head>OF INTERMITTING FEVERS OR AGUES.</head>
                        <p>INTERMITTING fevers afford the beſt opportunity both of obſerving the nature of a fever, and alſo the effects of medicine. No perſon can be at a loſs to diſtinguiſh an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fever from any other diſeaſe, and the proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for it is now almoſt univerſally known.</p>
                        <p>THE ſeveral kinds of intermitting fevers, as has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, take their names from the period in which the fit returns, as quotidians, tertians, quartans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="102" facs="unknown:012338_0106_0F88E9B6E17F60E0"/>
CAUSES.—Agues are occaſioned by moiſt air. This is evident from their abounding in rainy ſeaſons, and being moſt frequent in countries where the ſoil is marſhy, as in Holland, the fens of Cambridgeſhire, the Hundreds of Eſſex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This diſeaſe is alſo occaſioned by eating too much ſtone-fruit, a poor watery diet, damp houſes, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dews, lying upon the wet ground, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the inhabitants of a high country remove to a low one, they ſeldom fail to catch an intermitting fever, and to ſuch the diſeaſe is moſt apt to prove fatal. In a word, whatever relaxes the ſolids, diminiſhes the perſpiration, or obſtructs the circulation in the capillary or ſmall veſſels, prediſpoſes the body to agues.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—An intermitting fever gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally begins with a pain of the head and loins, wearineſs of the limbs, coldneſs of the extremities, ſtretching, yawning, with ſometimes great ſickneſs and vomitting; to which ſucceed ſhivering and violent ſhaking. Afterwards the ſkin becomes moiſt, and a profuſe ſweat breaks out, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally terminates the fit or paroxyſm. Sometimes, indeed, the diſeaſe comes on ſuddenly, when the perſon thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perfect health; but it is more commonly preceded by liſtleſſneſs, loſs of appetite, and the ſymptoms mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—While the fit continues, the patient may drink feely of water-gruel, orange-whey, weak camomile-tea; or, if his ſpirits be low, ſmall wine-whey, ſharpened with the juice of lemon. His drink ought to be a little warm, as that will aſſiſt in bringing on the ſweat, and conſequently ſhorten the paroxyſm.</p>
                        <p>BETWEEN the paroxyſms the patient muſt be ſupported with food that is nouriſhing, but light and eaſy of digeſtion, as veal or chicken broths, ſago-gruel, with a little wine, light puddings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His drink may be ſmall negas, acidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the juice of lemons or oranges, and ſometimes a little weak punch. He ought alſo to drink infuſions of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as camomile, wormwood, or water trefoil tea, and may now and then take a glaſs of ſmall wine, in which gentian root, centaury, or ſome other bitter, has been infuſed.</p>
                        <p>AS the chief intentions of cure in an ague are to brace the ſolids, and promote perſpiration, the patient ought to take as much exerciſe between the fits as he can bear. If he be able to go abroad, riding on horſeback, or in a machine, will be
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012338_0107_0F88E9C096AC0BF0"/>
of great ſervice. But if he cannot bear that kind of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, he ought to take ſuch as his ſtrength will permit. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tends more to prolong an intermitting fever, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a lazy, indolent diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p>INTERMITTING fevers, under a proper regimen, will generally cure of themſelves; and when the diſeaſe is mild, in an open dry country, there is ſeldom any danger from allowing it to take its courſe; but when the patient's ſtrength is exhauſted, and the paroxyſms are ſo violent, that his life is in danger, medicine ought immediately to be adminiſtered. This however ſhould never be done till the diſeaſe be properly formed, that is to ſay, till the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has had ſeveral fits of ſhaking and ſweating.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—The firſt thing to be done in the cure of an intermitting fever, is to cleanſe the firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. This not only renders the application of other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines more ſafe, but likewiſe more efficacious. In this diſeaſe the ſtomach is generally overcharged with cold vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcid phlegm, and frequently great quantities of bile are diſcharged by vomit; which plainly points out the neceſſity of ſuch evacuations. Vomits are therefore to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered before the patient takes any other medicine. A doſe of ipecacuanha will generally anſwer this purpoſe very well. Half a dram of the powder will be ſufficient for an adult, and for a younger perſon the doſe muſt be leſs in proportion. After the vomit begins to operate, it may be wrought off by drinking plentifully of weak camomile tea. The vomit ſhould be taken two or three hours before the coming on of the fit, and may be rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>ed two or three times at the diſtance of three or four days from each other. Vomits not only cleanſe the ſtomach, but increaſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and all the other ſecretions, which render them of ſuch importance, that they often cure intermitting fevers without the aſſiſtance of any other medicine. Of this I have ſeen many inſtances, and remember myſelf to have been compleatly cured of a regular tertian, by taking two vomits of ipecacuanha, and obſerving proper regimen.</p>
                        <p>PURGING medicines are likewiſe uſeful, and often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in intermitting fevers. A ſmart purge has been known to cure an obſtinate ague, after the Jeſuits bark and other medicines had been uſed in vain. Vomits, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are more ſuitable in this diſeaſe, and render purging leſs neceſſary; but if the patient be afraid to take a vomit,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:012338_0108_0F88E9C14AFAC2B0"/>
he ought in this caſe to cleanſe the bowels by a doſe or two of Glauber's ſalts, jalap, or rhubarb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BLEEDING may ſometimes be proper at the beginning of an intermitting fever, when exceſſive heat, a delirium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> give reaſon to ſuſpect an inflammation; but as the blood is very ſeldom in an inflammatory ſtate in intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fevers, this operation is rarely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>AFTER proper evacuations, the patient may ſafely uſe the Jeſuits bark, which may be taken in any way that is moſt agreeable to him. As it would anſwer no purpoſe to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply forms, we ſhall only mention the following.</p>
                        <p>Two ounces of the beſt Jeſuits bark, half an ounce of Virginian ſnake-root, and a quarter of an ounce of ginger, all fine powdered, may be divided into twenty-four doſes. Theſe may be either made into boluſſes, as they are uſed, with a little ſyrup of lemon, or mixed in a glaſs of red wine, a cup of camomile-tea, water-gruel, or the like.</p>
                        <p>IN an ague which returns every day, a doſe of the above may be taken every two hours during the interval of the fit. By this method the patient will be able to take five or ſix doſes between each paroxyſm. In a tertian, or third-day ague, it will be ſufficient to take a doſe every third hour, during the interval, and in a quartan every fourth. If the patient cannot take ſo large a doſe of the bark, he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide each of the powders into two parts, and take one every hour. For a young perſon, a ſmaller quantity of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine will be ſufficient, and the doſe muſt be adapted to the age, conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE above will ſeldom fail to remove an ague; but the patient ought not to leave off taking the medicine ſo ſoon as the paroxyſms are ſtopped, but ſhould continue to uſe it till ſuch time as there is reaſon to believe the diſeaſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely overcome. Moſt of the failures in the cure of this diſeaſe are owing to the patients not continuing to uſe the medicine long enough. They are generally directed to take it till their fits are ſtopped, then to leave it off, and begin again at ſome diſtance of time; by which means the diſeaſe gathers ſtrength, and often returns with as much violence as before. A relapſe may always be prevented by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's continuing to take ſmall doſes of the medicine for ſometime after the ſymptoms diſappear. This is both the moſt ſafe and effectual method of cure.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH the bark alone will generally cure intermitting fevers; yet it may be aſſiſted by alkaline ſalts, acid and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:012338_0109_0F88E9C207406A30"/>
aſtringent vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Many have been cured of an intermitting fever, after the bark had failed, by taking twice or thrice a-day a dram of the ſalt of wormwood in water-gruel. Some have ſtopped an ague by eating a boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lemon, with the rind, immediately before the coming on of the fit. We would rather recommend a medicine which is the reſult of theſe two when joined together, than either of them ſeparately. Thus, a dram of ſalt of wormwood may be diſſolved in an ounce and half of freſh lemon juice, to which may be added three or four ounces of boiling water, and half a glaſs of brandy. Theſe will make an agreeable medicine; a tea cupful of which may be taken three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>AN ounce of gentian root, calamus aromaticus, and orange-peel of each half an ounce, with three or four handfuls of camomile flowers, and an handful of coriander ſeed, all bruiſed together in a mortar, may be uſed in form of infuſion or tea. About half an handful of theſe ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients may be put into a tea-pot, and an Engliſh pint of boiling water poured on them. A cup of this infuſion may be drank three or four times a-day. This ſtrengthens the ſtomach, rectifies the blood, and greatly promotes the cure. Such patients as cannot drink the watery infuſion, may put two handfuls of the ſame ingredients into a bottle of white wine, and take a glaſs of it twice or thrice a-day. If pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients drink freely of the above, or any other proper infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of bitters, a much ſmaller quantity of bark than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed, will be ſufficient to cure an ague.</p>
                        <p>THERE is reaſon to believe, that ſundry of our own plants or barks, which are very bitter and aſtringent, would ſucceed well enough in the cure of intermitting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, eſpecially when aſſiſted by aromatics. But as the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits bark has been long approved in the cure of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and is now to be obtained at a very reaſonable rate, it is of leſs importance to ſearch after new medicines. We cannot however omit taking notice, that the Jeſuits bark is very often adulterated, and that it requires conſiderable ſkill to diſtinguiſh between the genuine and the falſe. This ought to make people very cautious of whom they purchaſe it.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who cannot ſwallow the bark in ſubſtance, may take it in decoction or infuſion. An ounce of bark in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may be infuſed in a bottle of white wine for four or five days, frequently ſhaking the bottle, afterwards let the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:012338_0110_0F88E9C2B6E84640"/>
powder ſubſide, and pour off the clear liquor. A wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs may be drank three or four times a-day, or oftener, as there is occaſion. If a decoction be more agreeable, an ounce of the bark, and two drams of ſnakeroot bruiſed, with a dram of ſalt of wormwood, may be boiled in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per quantity of water, into half an Engliſh pint. To the ſtrained liquor may be added an equal quantity of red wine, and a glaſs of it taken thrice a-day, or oftener, if neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                        <p>IN obſtinate agues the bark will be found much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious when aſſiſted by warm cordials, than if taken alone. This I have had frequently occaſion to obſerve in a country where intermitting fevers were endemical. The bark ſeldom ſucceeded unleſs aſſiſted by ſnakeroot, ginger, canella alba, or ſome other warm aromatic. When the fits are very frequent and violent, in which caſe the fever often approaches towards an inflammatory nature, it will be ſafer to leave out the ginger, and to add in its place half a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ounce of ſalt of wormwood. But in obſtinate tertians or quartans, in the end of autumn, or beginning of winter, warm and cordial medicines are abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>AS autumnal and winter agues generally prove much more obſtinate than thoſe which attack the patient in ſpring or ſummer; it will be neceſſary to continue the uſe of medicines longer in the former than in the latter. A perſon who is ſeized with an intermitting fever in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of winter, ought frequently, if the ſeaſon proves rainy, to take a little medicine, although the diſeaſe be cured, to prevent a relapſe, till the return of the warm ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He ought likewiſe to take care not to be much abroad in wet weather, eſpecially in cold, moiſt, eaſterly winds.</p>
                        <p>WHEN agues are not properly cured, they often degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into obſtinate chronical diſeaſes; as the dropſy, jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this reaſon, all poſſible care ſhould be taken to have them radically cured, before the humours be vitiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the conſtitution ſpoiled.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH nothing is more rational than the method of treating intermitting fevers, yet, by ſome ſtrange Infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more charms and whimſical remedies are daily uſed for removing this than any other diſeaſe. There is hardly an old woman who is not poſſeſſed of a noſtrum for ſtopping an ague; and there is reaſon to fear, that many by truſting to them loſe their lives. Thoſe in diſtreſs eagerly graſp at any thing that promiſes ſudden relief; but the ſhorteſt way
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012338_0111_0F88E9C36D78A7D0"/>
is not always the ſafeſt in the treatment of diſeaſes. The only method to obtain a ſafe and laſting cure, is gradually to aſſiſt nature in removing the cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>SOME people try bold, or rather fool-hardy experiments to cure agues, as drinking ſtrong liquors, jumping into a river, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may ſometimes have the deſired effect, but muſt always be attended with danger. When there is any degree of inflammation, or the leaſt tendency to it, ſuch experiments may prove fatal. The only perſon whom I remember to have ſeen die in an intermitting fever, evidently killed himſelf by drinking ſtrong liquor, which ſome perſon had perſuaded him would prove an infallible remedy.</p>
                        <p>MANY out of the way things are extolled for the cure of intermitting fevers, as cobwebs, ſnuffings of candles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though theſe may ſometimes ſucceed, yet their very naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſufficient to ſet them aſide, eſpecially when cleanly medicines will anſwer the purpoſe better. The only medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that can be depended upon, for thoroughly curing an intermitting fever, is the Jeſuits bark. It may always be uſed with ſafety: And I can honeſtly declare, that in all my practice I never knew it fail, when properly applied, and duly perſiſted in.</p>
                        <p>WHERE agues are endemical, even children are often afflicted with that diſeaſe. Such patients are very difficult to cure, as they can ſeldom be brought to take the bark, or any other diſagreeable medicine. One method of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this medicine more palatable is, to make it into a mixture with diſtilled waters and ſyrup, and afterward to give it an agreeable ſharpneſs with the elixir of ſpirit of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol. This both improves the medicine, and takes off the nauſeous taſte. The bark may be adminiſtered to children in form of clyſter when they will not take it by the mouth. Wine whey is a very proper drink for a child in an ague; to half an Engliſh pint of which may be put a tea-ſpoonful of the ſpirit of hartſhorn. Exerciſe is likewiſe of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice; and when the diſeaſe proves obſtinate, the child ought, if poſſible, to be removed to a warm dry air. Their food ought to be nouriſhing, and they ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have a little generous wine.</p>
                        <p>WE have been the more full upon this diſeaſe, becauſe it is very common, and becauſe few patients in an ague apply to phyſicians unleſs in extremities. There are, however, many caſes in which the diſeaſe is very irregular, being
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:012338_0112_0F88E9C42D8EC010"/>
complicated with other diſeaſes, or attended with ſypmtoms which are both very dangerous, and difficult to underſtand. All theſe we have purpoſely paſſed over, as they would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewilder the generality of readers. When the diſeaſe is very irregular, or the ſymptoms dangerous, the patient ought immediately to apply to a phyſician, and ſtrictly to follow his advice.</p>
                        <p>TO prevent agues, people muſt avoid their cauſes. Theſe have been already pointed out in the beginning of this ſection; we ſhall therefore only add one preventive medicine, which may be of uſe to ſuch as are obliged to live in low marſhy countries, or who are liable to frequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>TAKE an ounce of the beſt Jeſuits bark, half an ounce of Virginian ſnake-root, and half an ounce of orange-peel, bruiſe them all together, and infuſe for five or ſix days in a bottle of brandy, Holland-gin, or any good ſpirit; afterwards pour off the clear liquor, and take a wine glaſs of it twice or thrice a day. This indeed is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending a dram; but the bitter in a great meaſure takes off the ill effects of the ſpirit. Thoſe who do not chooſe it in brandy may infuſe it in wine; and ſuch as can bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to chew the bark, will find that method ſucceed very well. Gentian-root, or calamus aromaticus, may alſo be chewed by turns for the ſame purpoſe. All bitters ſeem to be antidotes to agues, eſpecially thoſe that are warm and aſtringent.</p>

                        <head>OF AN ACUTE CONTINUAL FEVER.</head>
                        <p>THIS fever is denominated acute, ardent, or inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. It moſt commonly attacks the young, or thoſe about the prime or vigour of life, eſpecially ſuch as live full, abound with blood, and whoſe fibres are ſtrong and elaſtic. It ſeizes people at all ſeaſons of the year; but is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the ſpring and beginning of ſummer.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—An ardent fever may be occaſioned by any thing that overheats the body, as violent exerciſe, ſleeping in the ſun, drinking ſtrong liquors, eating ſpiceries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe be occaſioned by any thing that obſtructs the perſpiration, as lying on the damp ground, drinking cold liquor when the body is hot, night-watching, or ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="unknown:012338_0113_0F88E9B22A993E30"/>
SYMPTOMS.—A rigor or chillneſs generally uſhers in this fever, which is ſoon ſucceeded by great heat, a frequent and full pulſe, a pain of the head, dry ſkin, redneſs of the eyes, a florid countenance, pains in the back, loins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To theſe ſucceed difficulty of breathing, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with an inclination to vomit. The patient complains of great thirſt, has no appetite for ſolid food, is reſtleſs, and his tongue generally appears black and rough.</p>
                        <p>A delirium, exceſſive reſtleſsneſs, great oppreſſion of the breaſt, with laborious reſpiration, ſtarting of the tendons, hiccup, cold, clammy ſweats, and an involuntary diſcharge of urine, are generally the forerunners of death.</p>
                        <p>AS this diſeaſe is always attended with danger, the beſt medical aſſiſtance ought to be procured as ſoon as poſſible. A phyſician may be of uſe at the beginning, but his ſkill is often of no avail afterwards.</p>
                        <p>WE cannot here omit, once for all, taking notice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the unaccountable conduct of thoſe who have it in their power, at the beginning of a fever, to procure the beſt medical aſſiſtance, yet put off till things come to an extremity. When the diſeaſe, by delay or wrong treatment, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incurable, and has exhauſted the ſtrength of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, it is in vain to hope for relief from medicine. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians may indeed aſſiſt nature; but their attempts muſt ever prove fruitleſs, when ſhe is no longer able to co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with their endeavours.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—From the ſymptoms of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it is evident, that the blood muſt be thick and viſcous, by which its circulation thorough the ſmall veſſels is imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the perſpiration, urine, and all the other ſecretions, are in too ſmall quantity; that the veſſels are too rigid, and the heat of the whole body too great: All theſe clearly point out the neceſſity of a regimen, calculated to dilute the blood, allay the exceſſive heat, remove the ſpaſmodic ſtricture of the veſſels, and promote the ſecretions.</p>
                        <p>THESE important purpoſes may be greatly promoted by drinking plentifully of diluting liquors, as thin water-gruel, oat-meal tea, clear whey, barley-water, balm-tea, apple-tea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe ſhould be ſharpened with juice of orange, jelly of currants, raſpberries, and ſuch like: Orange-whey is likewiſe an excellent cooling drink. It is made by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bitter orange, ſliced, among milk and water, till the curd ſeparates. If no orange can be had, a lemon, a little cream of tartar, or a few ſpoonfuls of vinegar, will have
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012338_0114_0F88E9C5168F9AB0"/>
the ſame effect. Two or three ſpoonfuls of white wine may be occaſionally added to the liquor when boiling.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be coſtive, an ounce of tamarinds, with two ounces of ſtoned raiſins of the ſun, and a couple of figs, may be boiled in three Engliſh pints of water to a quart. This makes a very pleaſant drink, and may be uſed at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. The common pectoral decoction is likewiſe a very proper drink in this diſeaſe. It is made by boiling barley, ſtoned raiſins and figs, of each two ounces, with half an ounce of liquorice-root ſliced, in two Engliſh quarts of water, till one half be conſumed. The barley ſhould be boiled ſome time before the other ingredients are put in. This, with the addition of two or three drams of purified nitre, or ſal-prunel, will not only be a proper drink, but prove an exceeding good medicine. A tea-cupful of it may be taken every two hours, or oftener, if the patient's heat and thirſt be very great.</p>
                        <p>THE above liquors muſt all be drank a little warm. They may be uſed in ſmaller quantities at the beginning of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but more freely afterwards, in order to aſſiſt in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the morbid matter by the different excretions. We have mentioned a variety of liquors, that the patient may have it in his power to chooſe that which is moſt agreeable; and that, when tired of one, he may have recourſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's diet muſt be very ſpare and light. All ſorts of meat, and even chicken-broths, are to be avoided. He may be allowed groat-gruel, panada, or light bread boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in water, and afterwards ſtrained; to which may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few grains of common ſalt, and a little ſugar, which will render it more palatable. He may eat roaſted apples with ſugar, toaſted bread with jelly of currants ſpread upon it, boiled prunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IT will greatly relieve the patient, eſpecially in an hot ſeaſon, to have freſh air frequently let into his chamber, This, however, muſt always be done in ſuch a manner as not to endanger his catching cold.</p>
                        <p>IT is a common practice to load the patient with bed-cloaths, under the pretence of making him ſweat, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him from the cold. This cuſtom has many ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It increaſes the heat of the body, fatigues the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and retards, inſtead of promoting, the perſpiration.</p>
                        <p>SITTING upright in bed, if the patient be able to bear it, will often have a good effect. It relieves the head, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012338_0115_0F88E9C6AB39A0C8"/>
the motion of the blood to the brain. But this poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought never to be continued too long: And if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be inclined to ſweat, it will be more ſafe to let him lie ſtill, only raiſing his head with pillows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SPRINKLING the chamber with vinegar, juice of lemon, or vinegar and roſe-water, with a little nitre diſſolved in it, will greatly refreſh the patient. This ought to be done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, eſpecially if the weather be hot.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's mouth ſhould be often waſhed with warm water, mixed with honey, and a little vinegar; or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of figs in barley-water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His feet and hands ought likewiſe frequently to be bathed in lukewarm water; eſpecially if the head be effected.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould be kept as quiet and eaſy as poſſible. Company, noiſe, and every thing that diſturbs the mind is hurtful. Even too much light, or any thing that affects the ſenſes, is to be avoided. His attendants ſhould be as few as poſſible, and they ought not to be too often changed. His inclinations ought rather to be ſoothed than contradicted; even the promiſe of what he craves will often ſatisfy him as much as its reality.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—In this and all other fevers ariſing from too great a quantity, and too rapid a motion of the blood, bleeding is of the greateſt importance. This opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought always to be performed as ſoon as the ſymptoms of an inflammatory fever appear. The quantity of blood to be let muſt be in proportion to the ſtrength of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and the violence of the diſeaſe. If after the firſt bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fever ſeems to riſe, and the pulſe feels hard, there will be a neceſſity for repeating it a ſecond, and perhaps a third time, which may be done at the diſtance of twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four hours, as the ſymptoms require. If the pulſe continues ſoft, and the patient is tolerably eaſy after the firſt bleeding, it ought not to be repeated till ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p>THE cooling febrifuge draught, recommended in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fever, page 105, will likewiſe be very proper here; only the brandy muſt be left out, and half a dram of purified nitre added in its ſtead.</p>
                        <p>IF the above cannot be conveniently obtained, forty or fifty drops of the dulcified or ſweet ſpirit of vitriol may be made into a draught, with an ounce of roſe-water, two ounces of common water, and half an ounce of ſimple ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup, or a bit of loaf-ſugar. This draught may be given to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:012338_0116_0F88E9C72B25F5A0"/>
the patient every three hours while the fever is violent; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, once in five or ſix hours will be ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be afflicted with reaching or an inclination to vomit, it will be right to aſſiſt nature's attempts, by giving him weak camomile tea or lukewarm water to drink.</p>
                        <p>IF the belly be bound, the patient ought daily to receive a clyſter of milk and water with a little ſalt, and a ſpoonful of ſweet oil or freſh butter. If this has not the deſired effect, a tea-ſpoonful of magneſia alba, or cream of tartar, may be frequently put into his drink. He may likewiſe eat tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds, boiled prunes, roaſted apples, and the like.</p>
                        <p>IF about the 10th, 11th, or 12th day, the pulſe becomes more ſoft, the tongue moiſter, and the urine begins to let fall a reddiſh ſediment, there is reaſon to expect a favourable iſſue to the diſeaſe. But if, inſtead of thoſe ſymptoms, the patient's ſpirits grow languid, his pulſe ſinks, and his breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes difficult; with a ſtupor, tremors of the nerves, ſtarting of the tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is reaſon to fear that the conſequences will be fatal. In this caſe, bliſtering plaiſters muſt be applied to the head, ancles, inſide of the thighs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the patient muſt be ſupported with cordials, as ſtrong wine-whey, negas, ſago-gruel, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>A proper regimen is not only neceſſary during the fever, but likewiſe after the patient begins to recover. By ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting that, many relapſe, or fall into other diſeaſes, and continue valetudinary for life, Tho' the body be weak after a fever, yet the food for ſome time ought to be rather cleanſing than of too nouriſhing a nature. The perſon ſhould take great care not to exceed in any thing. Too much food, drink, ſleep, exerciſe, company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided. The mind ought likewiſe to be kept eaſy, and the perſon ſhould not attempt to purſue ſtudy, or any thing that requires intenſe thinking.</p>
                        <p>IF the digeſtion be bad, or the perſon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>WHEN the patient's ſtrength is pretty well recovered, he ought to take ſome gentle laxative. An ounce of tamarinds and a dram of ſenna, may be boiled for a few minutes in an Engliſh pint of water, and an ounce of manna diſſolved in the decoction; afterwards, it may be ſtrained, and a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupful drank every hour till it operates.

                        <head>OF THE PLEURISY.</head>
                        <p>THE true pleuriſy is an inflammation of that membrane, called the <hi>pleura,</hi> which lines the inſide of the breaſt. It is diſtinguiſhed into the moiſt and the dry. In the former, the patient ſpits freely; but in the latter, little or none at all. There is likewiſe a ſpecies of this diſeaſe, which is called the <hi>ſpurious</hi> or <hi>baſtard pleuriſy,</hi> in which the pain is more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and chiefly affects the muſcles between the ribs. This diſeaſe abounds among labouring people, eſpecially ſuch as work without doors, and are of a ſanguine conſtitution. It is moſt frequent in the ſpring-ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The pleuriſy is occaſioned by whatever obſtructs the perſpiration; as cold northerly winds, drinking cold liquors when the body is hot, ſleeping without doors on the damp ground, wet cloaths, plunging the body into cold water, or expoſing it to the cold air when covered with ſweat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe be occaſioned by drinking ſtrong liquors; by the ſtoppage of uſual evacuations, as old ulcers, iſſues, ſweating of the feet or hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſudden ſtriking in of any eruption, as the itch, the meaſles, or the ſmall-pox. Thoſe who have been accuſtomed to bleed at a certain ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, are apt, if they neglect it, to be ſeized with a pleuriſy. Keeping the body too warm by means of fire, cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> renders it more liable to this diſeaſe. A pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy may likewiſe be occaſioned by violent exerciſe, as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, wreſtling, leaping, or by ſupporting great weights, eſpecially on the breaſt. The very make of the body ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prediſpoſes perſons to this diſeaſe, as a narrow cheſt, a ſtraitneſs of the arteries of the pleura, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—This, like moſt other fevers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with chillneſs and ſhivering, which are followed by heat, thirſt, and reſtleſſneſs. To theſe ſucceed a violent pricking pain in one of the ſides amongſt the ribs. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the pain extends towards the backbone, ſometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the forepart of the breaſt, and at other times towards the ſhoulder-blades. The pain is generally moſt violent when the patient draws in his breath.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="114" facs="unknown:012338_0118_0F88E9C981553F60"/>
THE pulſe in this diſeaſe is generally hard, the urine high coloured; and if blood be let, it is covered with a tough cruſt, or buffy coat. The patient's ſpittle is at firſt thin, but afterwards it becomes groſſer, and is often ſtreaked with blood</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Nature endeavours to carry off this diſeaſe either by a critical diſcharge of blood from the noſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by expectoration, ſweat, looſe ſtools, thick urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the violence of the fever is not broken by theſe, or other evacuations, it often ends in an abſceſs o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſuppuration; to which enſues an ulcer, mortification, and death.</p>
                        <p>THE violence of this diſeaſe may generally be checked by leſſening the force of the circulation, relaxing the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, diluting the humours, and promoting expectoration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>FOR theſe purpoſes, the diet, as in the former diſeaſe, muſt be cool, ſlender, and diluting. The patient muſt avoid food that is viſcid, hard of digeſtion, or that affords much nouriſhment, as fleſh, butter, cheeſe, eggs, milk, and alſo every thing that is of a heating nature. His drink muſt be ſweet whey, or decoctions and infuſions of the pectoral and balſamic vegetables.</p>
                        <p>TAKE a table ſpoonful of linſeed, a quarter of an ounce of liquorice-root ſliced, and half an ounce of the leaves of coltsfoot. Put theſe ingredients in a cloſe veſſel, pour on them a quart of boiling water, and let them ſtand near a fire for eight or ten hours; afterwards ſtrain off the liquor; of which the patient may take a cupful frequently for his ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>BARLEY-WATER ſweetened with honey, or ſharpened with the jelly of currants, is likewiſe a very proper drink in this diſeaſe. It is made by boiling an ounce of pearl-barley in three Engliſh pints of water to two, which muſt afterwards be ſtrained. The decoction of figs, raiſins, and barley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> recommended in the continual fever, p. 110. is here likewiſe very proper. Theſe, and other diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, are not to be drank in large quantities at a time; but the patient ought, in a manner, keep continually ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, ſo as to render his mouth and throat always moiſt. All his food and drink muſt be taken a little warm.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould be kept quiet, cool, and every way ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, as directed under the foregoing diſeaſe. His feet and hands
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012338_0119_0F88E9CA2C7A0838"/>
ought daily to be bathed in warm water; and he may ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it up in bed for a ſhort ſpace, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his head.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Almoſt every perſon knows when a fever is attended with a violent pain of the ſide, and a quick, hard pulſe, that bleeding is neceſſary. When theſe ſymptoms appear, the ſooner this operation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the better; and the quantity at firſt muſt be pretty large, provided the patient be able to bear it. A large quantity of blood let at once, in the beginning of a pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, has a much greater effect than ſeveral repeated ſmall bleedings. An adult perſon may loſe ten or twelve ounces of blood as ſoon as it is certainly known that he is ſeized with a pleuriſy. For a younger perſon, or one of a delicate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, the quantity muſt be leſs.</p>
                        <p>IF after the firſt bleeding, the ſtitch, with the other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſymptoms, ſhould continue, it will be neceſſary, at the diſtance of twelve or eighteen hours, to let eight or nine ounces more. If the ſymptoms do not then abate, and the blood ſhows a ſtrong buffy coat, a third or even a fourth bleeding may be requiſite. If the pain of the ſide abates, the pulſe becomes ſofter, or the patient begins to ſpit free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a brown or reddiſh colour, bleeding ought not to be repeated. This operation is ſeldom neceſſary after the third or fourth day of the fever, and ought not then to be performed without the advice of a phyſician, unleſs in the moſt urgent circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>THE blood may be many ways attenuated without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it off. There are likewiſe many things that may be done to eaſe the pain of the ſide beſides bleeding. Thus, after the firſt or ſecond bleeding, emollient fomentations may be applied to the part affected. Theſe may be made by boiling a handful of the flowers of elder, camomile, and common mallows, or any other ſoft vegetables, in a proper quantity of water. The herbs may be either put into a bag, and applied warm to the ſide, or flannels may be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the decoction, afterwards wrung out, and applied to the part affected, with as much warmth as the patient can eaſily bear. As the cloths grow cool, they muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and great care taken that the patient do not catch cold: An ox's bladder may be half filled with warm milk and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and applied to to the ſide, if the above method of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting be found inconvenient. Fomentations not only
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:012338_0120_0F88E9CAF7F40D08"/>
eaſe the pain, but by relaxing the veſſels, prevent the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the blood and other humours.</p>
                        <p>THE ſide may likewiſe be frequently rubbed with a little of the following liniment. Take two table ſpoonfuls of the oil of ſweet almonds, olives, or any other ſweet oil, and two tea ſpoonfuls of ſpirit of hartſhorn: Shake them well together, and rub about a tea ſpoonful upon the ſide, with a warm hand, three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>SOME recommend dry applications to the affected ſide, as burnt oats, toaſted bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe, though they may be uſeful, are not ſo proper as moiſt ones. Could it be properly conducted, we would recommend putting the patient into a bath of warm milk and water, in which emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient vegetables had been boiled; but as this cannot always be obtained, we ſhall recommend what is in every perſon's power, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> to apply ſoft poultices, or cataplaſms to the part affected. Theſe may be made of wheat bread and milk, ſoftened with oil or freſh butter.</p>
                        <p>LEAVES of various plants might likewiſe be applied to the patient's ſide with advantage. We have often ſeen, and even felt, the benefit of young cabbage leaves applied warm to the ſide in a pleuriſy. Theſe not only relax, but likewiſe draw off a little moiſture, and may prevent the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of bliſtering plaiſters; which, however, when other things fail, muſt be applied.</p>
                        <p>IF the ſtitch continues after repeated bleedings, fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a bliſtering plaiſter muſt be laid upon the part affected, and ſuffered to remain for two days. This not only procures a diſcharge from the ſide, but actually thins the blood, and by that means aſſiſts in removing the cauſe of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>TO prevent a ſtranguary when the bliſtering plaiſter is on, the patient may drink freely of the following emulſion: take an ounce of ſweet almonds blanched, and beat them well in a mortar, with an equal quantity of fine ſugar; then diſſolve half an ounce of gum arabic in an Engliſh quart of barley water warm. Let it ſtand till cool, and afterwards pour it by little and little upon the almonds and ſugar, continually rubbing them till the liquor becomes uniformly white or milky. Afterwards ſtrain it, and let the patient uſe it for ordinary drink. A quart bottle, at leaſt, may be drank daily.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be coſtive, a clyſter of warm water, or of barley water, in which a handful of mallows, or any
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:012338_0121_0F88E9CBE9B40680"/>
other emollient vegetable, has been boiled, may be daily adminiſtered. This will not only empty the bowels, but have the effect of a warm fomentation applied to the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior viſcera, which will help to make a derivation from the breaſt.</p>
                        <p>THE expectoration, or ſpitting, may be promoted by ſharp, oily, and mucilaginous medicines. For this purpoſe, an ounce of the oxymel or vinegar of ſquills may be added to ſix ounces of the pectoral decoction, and two table ſpoonfuls of it taken every two hours.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD the ſquill diſagree with the ſtomach, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the oil of ſweet almonds, or oil of olives, and two ounces of the ſyrup of violets, may be mixed with as much ſugar-candy powdered as will make an electuary of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of honey. The patient may take a little of this frequently, when the cough is troubleſome.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD oily medicines happen to prove nauſeous, which is ſometimes the caſe, two drams of gum ammoniac may be diſſolved in half an Engliſh pint of barley water, in the following manner: The gum muſt be well rubbed in a mortar, and the water gradually poured upon it till it be quite diſſolved. Three or four ounces of ſimple pennyroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al water may be added to the above quantity, and two table ſpoonfuls of it taken three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient does not perſpire, but has a burning heat upon his ſkin; and paſſes very little water, ſome ſmall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of purified nitre and camphire will be of uſe. Two drams of the former may be rubbed with five or ſix grains of the latter in a mortar, and the whole divided into ſix do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, one of which may be taken every five or ſix hours, in a little of the patient's ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>BUT the beſt medicine, which ſome indeed reckon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a ſpecific in the pleuriſy, is the decoction of the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca rattleſnake root. Two ounces of the root, groſsly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, muſt be boiled in two Engliſh pints and an half of water, till one half the water be conſumed. It muſt not be boiled quickly, but gradually ſimmered over a ſlow fire. After bleeding, and other evacuations have been premiſed, the patient may take two, three, or four table ſpoonfuls of this decoction, according as his ſtomach will bear it, three or four times a-day. If it ſhould occaſion vomiting, two or three ounces of ſimple cinnamon water, may be mixed with the quantity of decoction above mentioned, or it may be taken in ſmaller doſes. As this medicine at once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012338_0122_0F88E9CCC15B6598"/>
perſpiration, urine, and keeps the belly eaſy, it bids the faireſt of any thing yet known to anſwer all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of cure in a pleuriſy, or any other inflammation of the breaſt.</p>
                        <p>NO one will imagine, that theſe medicines are all to be uſed at the ſame time. We have mentioned different things, on purpoſe that people may have it in their power to chooſe; and, likewiſe, that when one thing cannot be obtained, they may make uſe of another. Different medicines are no doubt neceſſary in the different periods of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and where one fails of ſucceſs, or diſagrees with the patient, it will be proper to try another.</p>
                        <p>WHAT is called the criſis, or height of the fever, is ſometimes attended with very alarming ſymptoms; as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of breathing, an irregular pulſe, convulſive motions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are apt to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight the attendants, and induce them to do improper things, as bleeding the patient, giving him ſtrong ſtimulating medicines, or the like. But they are only the ſtruggles of nature to overcome the diſeaſe, in which ſhe ought to be aſſiſted by plenty of diluting drink, which is then peculiarly neceſſary, as the febrile matter is now ready to be diſcharged. If the patient's ſtrength, however, be much exhauſted by the diſeaſe, it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, at this time, to ſupport him with frequent ſmall draughts of wine whey, or the like.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the pain and fever are gone, it will be proper, after the patient has gathered ſufficient ſtrength, to give him ſome gentle purges, as thoſe directed under the acute, continual fever, page 112. He ought likewiſe to uſe a light diet, of eaſy digeſtion; and, his drink ſhould be butter-milk, whey, and other things of a cleanſing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>THAT ſpecies of pleuriſy, which is called the <hi>baſtard,</hi> or <hi>ſpurious,</hi> generally goes off by keeping warm for a few days, drinking plenty of diluting liquors, and obſerving a proper regimen.</p>
                        <p>IT is known by a dry cough, a quick pulſe, and a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of lying on the affected ſide, which laſt does not always happen in the true pleuriſy. Sometimes, indeed, this diſeaſe proves obſtinate, and requires bleeding, with cupping, and ſcarifications of the affected ſide. Theſe, together with the uſe of nitrous, and other cooling medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſeldom fail to effect a cure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="119" facs="unknown:012338_0123_0F88E9CFF40AE040"/>
THE <hi>paraphrenitis,</hi> or inflammation of the diaphragm, is ſo nearly connected with the pleuriſy, and reſembles it ſo much in the manner of treatment, that it is ſcarce neceſſary to conſider it as a ſeparate diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>IT is attended with a very acute fever, and an extreme pain of the part affected, which is generally augmented by coughing, ſneezing, drawing in the breath, taking food, going to ſtool, making water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence the patient breathes quick, and draws in his bowels to prevent the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diaphragm, is reſtleſs, anxious, has a dry cough, a hiccup, and often a delirium. A convulſive laugh, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a kind of involuntary grin, is no uncommon ſymptom of this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>EVERY method muſt be taken to prevent a ſuppuration, as it is impoſſible to ſave the patient's life when that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens. The regimen and medicine are in all reſpects the ſame as in the pleuriſy. We ſhall only add, that in this diſeaſe emollient clyſters are peculiarly uſeful, as they relax the bowels, and by that means draw the humours from the part affected.</p>

                        <p>AS this diſeaſe affects an organ which is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to life, it muſt always be attended with danger.

                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—Moſt of the ſymptoms of a pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, likewiſe attend an inflammation of the lungs; only in the latter, the pulſe is more ſoft, and the pain leſs acute; but the difficulty of breathing, and oppreſſion of the breaſt, are generally greater.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—As the regimen and medicine are in all reſpects the ſame in the true peripneumony as in the pleuriſy, we ſhall not here repeat them, but refer the reader to the treatment of that diſeaſe. It may not, however, be improper to add, that the aliment ought to be more ſlender and thin in this than in any other inflammatory diſeaſe. The learned Dr. Arbuthnot aſſerts, that even common whey is ſufficient to ſupport the patient, and that decoctions of barley, and infuſions of fennel-roots in warm water with milk, are the moſt proper both for drink and nouriſhment. He likewiſe recommends the ſteam of warm water taken in by the breath, which ſerves as a kind of internal fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and helps to attenuate the impacted humours. If the patient has looſe ſtools, but is not weakened by them, they are not to be ſtopped, but rather promoted by the uſe of emollient clyſters.</p>
                        <p>IT has already been obſerved, that the <hi>ſpurious</hi> or <hi>baſtard</hi> peripneumony is occaſioned by a viſcid pituitous matter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing the veſſels of the lungs. It commonly attacks the old, infirm, and phlegmatic, in winter or wet ſeaſons.</p>
                        <p>THE patient, at the beginning, is cold and hot by turns, has a ſmall quick pulſe, feels a ſenſe of weight upon his breaſt, breathes with difficulty, and ſometimes complains of a pain and giddineſs of his head. His urine is commonly pale, and his colour very little changed.</p>
                        <p>THE diet in this, as well as in the true peripneumony, muſt be very ſlender, as weak broths ſharpened with the juice of orange or lemon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His drink may be thin wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-gruel ſweetened with honey, or a decoction of fennel-root, liquorice, and roots of quick graſs.

                        <p>BLEEDING and purging are generally proper at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this diſeaſe; but if the patient's ſpittle be pretty thick, or well concocted, neither of them are neceſſary. It

will be ſufficient to aſſiſt the expectoration by ſome of the ſoft balſamic medicines, recommended for that purpoſe in the pleuriſy. Bliſtering plaiſters have generally a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ought to be applied pretty early. They may either be applied to the neck or ancles, or both, if neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient does not ſpit, he muſt be bled, if his ſtrength will permit, and have a gentle purge adminiſtered. Afterwards his belly may be kept open by clyſters, and the expectoration promoted, by taking every four hours two table ſpoonfuls of the ſolution of gum ammoniac, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the pleuriſy, page 117.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an inflammation of the breaſt does not yield to bleeding, bliſtering, and the other means mentioned above, it commonly ends in a ſuppuration, which is more or leſs dangerous, according to the part where it is ſituate. When this happens in the pleura, it ſometimes breaks outwardly, and the matter is discharged by the wound.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the ſuppuration happens within the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or body of the lungs; in which caſe the matter may be diſcharged by expectoration; but if the matter floats in the cavity of the breaſt, between the pleura and the lungs, it can only be diſcharged by an inciſion made betwixt the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>A conſumption is a waſting or decay of the whole body, from an ulcer, tubercles, or concretion of the lungs; from an empyema, a nervous atrophy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>DR. Arbuthnot obſerves, that in his time conſumptions made up above one tenth part of the bills of mortality about London. There is reaſon to believe, they have rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſince that time; and we know for certain, that they are not leſs fatal in ſeveral other towns in England than in London.</p>

YOUNG perſons betwixt the age of fifteen and thirty, of a ſlender make, long neck, high ſhoulders, and flat breaſts, are moſt liable to this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>CONSUMPTIONS prevail more in England than in any other part of the world, owing, perhaps, to the great uſe of animal food, and ſtrong liquors, the general application to ſedentary employments, and the great quantity of pit-coal which is there burnt; to which we may add, the perpetual changes in the atmoſphere, or variableneſs of the weather.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—It has already been obſerved, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations of the breaſt often end in an impoſthume: Conſequently, whatever prediſpoſes to thoſe diſeaſes, muſt likewiſe be conſidered as a cauſe of conſumptions.</p>
                        <p>MANY other diſeaſes, by vitiating the humours, may likewiſe occaſion conſumptions; as the ſcurvy, the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula or king's evil, the venereal diſeaſe, the aſthma, ſmall-pox, meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>As this diſeaſe is ſeldom cured, it will be neceſſary to point out its cauſes more particularly, in order that people may be the better enabled to avoid it. Theſe are:</p>
                        <p>—WANT of exerciſe. Hence it comes to paſs, that this diſeaſe is ſo common amongſt the inhabitants of great towns, who follow ſedentary employments, and likewiſe amongſt the rich, who are not under the neceſſity of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for their bread.</p>
                        <p>—CONFINED or unwholeſome air. Air which ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, or is Impregnated with the fumes of metals or mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, is extremely hurtful to the lungs, and often corrodes the tender veſſels of that neceſſary organ.</p>
                        <p>—VIOLENT paſſions or affections of the mind; as grief, diſappointment, anxiety, or cloſe application to the ſtudy of abſtruſe arts or ſciences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>—EXCESSIVE evacuations; as ſweating, diarrhoeas, diabetes, exceſſive venery, the flour albus, an over-diſcharge of the menſtrual flux, giving ſuck too long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>—CHANGING ſuddenly from a hot to a very cold cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, or whatever greatly leſſens the perſpiration.</p>
                        <p>—FREQUENT and exceſſive debaucheries. Late watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drinking of ſtrong liquors, which generally go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, can hardly fail to deſtroy the lungs.

                        <p>—OCCUPATIONS in life. Thoſe artificers who ſit much, and are conſtantly leaning forward, or preſſing upon their ſtomachs and breaſts, as cutlers, taylors, ſhoemakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often die of conſumptions.</p>
                        <p>—COLD. More conſumptive patients date their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders from wet feet, damp beds, night air, wet cloaths, and ſuch like, than from all other cauſes.</p>
                        <p>SHARP, ſaline, and aromatic aliments, which heat and inflame the blood, are likewiſe frequently the cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall only add, that this diſeaſe is often owing to an hereditary taint; in which caſe, it is generally incurable.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—This diſeaſe generally begins with a dry cough, which often continues for ſome months. If a diſpoſition to vomit after eating be excited by it, there is great reaſon to fear an approaching conſumption. The patient complains of a more than uſual degree of heat, a pain and oppreſſion of the breaſt, eſpecially after motion; his ſpittle is of a ſaltiſh taſte, and ſometimes mixed with blood. He is apt to be ſad; his appetite is bad, and his thirſt great. There is generally a ſenſe of weight on the breaſt, with a quick, ſoft, ſmall pulſe; though ſometimes the pulſe is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty full, and rather hard. Theſe are the common ſymptoms of a beginning conſumption.</p>
                        <p>AFTERWARDS the patient begins to ſpit a greeniſh, white, or bloody matter. His body is extenuated by the hectic fever and colliquative ſweats, which mutually ſucceed one another, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> the one towards the night, and the other in the morning. A looſeneſs, and exceſſive diſcharge of urine, are often troubleſome ſymptoms at this time, and greatly weaken the patient. There is a burning heat in the palms of the hands, and the face generally fluſhes after eating; the fingers become remarkably ſmall, the nails are bent inwards, and the hairs fall off.</p>
                        <p>AT laſt, the ſwelling of the feet and legs, the total loſs of ſtrength, the ſinking of the eyes, the difficulty of ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the coldneſs of the extremities, ſhow the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate approach of death, which, however, the patient ſeldom believes to be ſo near. Such is the uſual progreſs of this
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:012338_0128_0F88E9D40DEDB838"/>
fatal diſeaſe, which, if not early checked, commonly ſets all medicine at defiance.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—On the firſt appearance of this diſeaſe, if the patient lives in a large town, or any place where the air is confined, he ought immediately to quit it, and to make choice of a ſituation in the country, where the air is pure, dry and free. Here he muſt not remain inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but take every day as much exerciſe as he can bear.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt method of taking exerciſe is to ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, as this gives the body a great deal of motion without much fatigue. Such as cannot bear this kind of exerciſe, muſt make uſe of a machine. A long journey, as it amuſes the mind by a continual change of objects, is greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to riding the ſame ground over and over. Care, however, muſt be taken to avoid catching cold from wet cloaths, damp beds, or ſuch like. At any rate, the patient muſt ride; his life depends upon it; and it is almoſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible remedy, if begun in time, and duly perſiſted in.</p>
                        <p>IT is pity thoſe who attend the ſick ſeldom recommend riding in this diſeaſe, till the patient is either unable to bear it, or the malady is become incurable. Patients are always apt to trifle with every thing that is in their own power. They cannot ſee how one of the common actions of life ſhould prove a remedy in an obſtinate diſeaſe, and therefore they reject it, while they greedily hunt after relief from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, merely becauſe it is unknown.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who have ſtrength and courage to undertake a pretty long voyage, may expect great advantage from it. This has frequently cured a conſumption after the patient was thought to be in the laſt ſtage of that diſeaſe, and where medicine had proved ineffectual. It is reaſonable from hence to conclude, that if a voyage were undertaken in due time, it would ſeldom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>il to perform a cure.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as try this method of cure, ought to carry as much freſh proviſions along with them as will ſerve for the whole time they are at ſea. As milk is not to be obtained in this ſituation, they ought to live upon fruits and the broth of chickens, or other young animals which can be kept alive on board. It is ſcarce neceſſary to add, that ſuch voyages ſhould be undertaken, if poſſible, in the mildeſt ſeaſon, and that they ought to be towards a warmer climate.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who have not courage for a long voyage may travel into a more ſouthern climate, as the ſouth of France, Spain, or Portugal; and if they find the air of theſe countries
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:012338_0129_0F88E9D4B3BE3F10"/>
agree with them, they ſhould continue there, at leaſt till their health be confirmed.</p>
                        <p>NEXT to proper air and exerciſe, we would recommend a due attention to the diet. The patient muſt eat nothing that is either heating or hard of digeſtion, and his drink muſt be of a ſoft and cooling nature. All the diet muſt be calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leſſen the acrimony of the humours, and abate the rapid motion of the blood. For this purpoſe the patient muſt keep ſtrictly to the uſe of vegetables and milk. Milk, alone, is of more value in this diſeaſe, than the whole <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria medica.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ASSES milk is generally reckoned preferable to any other; but it cannot always be obtained; beſides, it is generally taken as a medicine, whereas, to produce any conſiderable effects, it ought, in a manner, to make the principal part of the patient's food. It is hardly to be expected, that a gill or two of aſſes milk, drank in the ſpace of twenty-four hours, ſhould be able to produce any conſiderable change in the humours in a ſhort time; but when people do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive its effects ſoon, they loſe hope, and ſo leave it off. Hence it comes to paſs, that this medicine, however valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, very ſeldom performs a cure. The reaſon is obvious; it is commonly uſed too late, is taken in too ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and is not duly perſiſted in.</p>
                        <p>I have known very extraordinary effects from aſſes milk in obſtinate coughs, which threatened a conſumption of the lungs; and do verily believe, if uſed at this period, that it would ſeldom fail; but if it be delayed till an ulcer is formed, which is generally the caſe, how can it be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſucceed?</p>
                        <p>ASSES milk ought to be drank, if poſſible, in its natural warmth, and in the quantity of half an Engliſh pint at a time. Inſtead of taking this quantity night and morning only, the patient ought to take it four times, or, at leaſt, thrice a-day, and to eat a little light bread along with it, ſo as to make it a kind of meal.</p>
                        <p>IF aſſes milk ſhould happen to purge the patient, it may be mixed with old conſerve of roſes, which is itſelf a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able medicine in this diſeaſe. If that cannot be obtained, the powder of crabs claws may be uſed in its ſtead. Aſſes milk is uſually ordered to be drank warm in bed; but as it generally throws the patient into a ſweat, when taken in this way, it would be proper to give it after he riſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="126" facs="unknown:012338_0130_0F88E9D607E491A0"/>
SOME extraordinary cures in conſumptive caſes have been performed by breaſt milk. Could this be obtained in ſufficient quantity, we would recommend it preferable to any other. It is better if the patient can ſuck it from the breaſt than to drink it afterwards. I knew a man who was reduced to ſuch a degree of weakneſs in a conſumption, as not to be able to turn himſelf in bed. His wife was that time giving ſuck, and the child happening to die, he ſucked her breaſts, not with a view to reap any advantage from the milk, but to make her eaſy. Finding himſelf however greatly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it, he continued to ſuck her till perfectly recovered, and is at preſent a ſtrong and healthy man.</p>
                        <p>SOME prefer butter-milk to any other, and it certainly is a very valuable medicine, if the ſtomach be able to bear it. It does not agree with every perſon at firſt; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore often laid aſide without a ſufficient trial. It ſhould at firſt be taken ſparingly, and the quantity gradually increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until it comes to be almoſt the ſole food. I never knew it ſucceed, unleſs where the patient almoſt entirely lived upon it.</p>
                        <p>COWS milk is moſt readily obtained of any; and tho' it be not ſo eaſily digeſted as that of aſſes or mares, it may be rendered lighter, by adding to it an equal quantity of barley water, or allowing it to ſtand for ſome hours, and afterwards taking off the cream. If it ſhould, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, lie heavy on the ſtomach, a table ſpoonful of rum or brandy, and a bit of loaf-ſugar, may be put into half an Engliſh pint.</p>
                        <p>IT is not to be wondered, that milk ſhould, for ſome time, diſagree with a ſtomach that has not been accuſtomed to digeſt any thing but fleſh and ſtrong liquors, which is the caſe of moſt of thoſe who fall into conſumptions. We do not, however, adviſe thoſe who have been accuſtomed to animal food and ſtrong liquors, to leave them off all at once. This might be dangerous. It will be neceſſary for ſuch to eat a little once a-day of the fleſh of ſome young animal, or rather to uſe the broth made of chickens, veal, lamb, or ſuch like. They ought likewiſe to drink a little wine made into negas, or diluted with twice or thrice its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water, and to make it gradually weaker till they can leave it off altogether.</p>
                        <p>THESE muſt be uſed only as preparatives to a diet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſolely of milk and vegetables, which the ſooner the patient can be brought to bear, the better. Rice and milk,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:012338_0131_0F88E9D65A23F888"/>
or barley and milk boiled, with a little ſugar, is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food. Ripe fruits, roaſted, baked, or boiled, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proper; as gooſe or currant-berry tarts, apples roaſted, or boiled in milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The jellies, conſerves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of ripe ſubacid fruits, ought to be eat plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as the jelly of currants, conſerve of roſes, preſerved plumbs, cherries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHOLESOME air, proper exerciſe, and a diet conſiſting ſolely of theſe and other vegetables, with milk, is the only courſe that can be depended on in the beginning of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. If the patient has ſtrength and ſufficient reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to perſiſt in this courſe, he will ſeldom be diſappointed of a cure.</p>
                        <p>IN a populous town in England, where conſumptions are very common, I have frequently ſeen conſumptive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who had been ſent to the country with orders to ride, and live upon milk and vegetables, return in a few months quite plump, and free of any complaint. This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was not always the caſe, eſpecially when the diſeaſe was hereditary, or far advanced; but it was the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in which ſucceſs was to be expected; where it failed, I never knew medicine ſucceed.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient's ſtrength and ſpirits flag, he muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by rich broths, jellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some recommend ſhell-fiſh in this diſorder, and we are inclined to think with reaſon; they are very nouriſhing, at the ſame time that they cool the blood, and blunt the acrimony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. All the food and drink ought to be taken in ſmall quantities, leſt an overcharge of freſh chyle ſhould oppreſs the lungs, and too much accelerate the circulation of the blood.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's mind ought to be kept as eaſy and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as poſſible. Conſumptions are often occaſioned by a melancholy caſt of mind; for which reaſon, muſic, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful company, and every thing that inſpires mirth, are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beneficial. The patient ought ſeldom to be left alone, as brooding over his calamities is ſure to render them worſe.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Though we know no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that will cure a confirmed conſumption; yet the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing things may be of ſervice, in abating ſome of the more violent ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>IN the firſt ſtage of a conſumption, the cough may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be appeaſed by bleeding; and expectoration promoted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:012338_0132_0F88E9D7F16A8728"/>
by the following medicines. Take freſh ſquills, gum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, and powdered cardamum ſeeds, of each a quarter of an ounce; beat them together in a mortar, and if the maſs proves too hard for pills, a little of any kind of ſyrup may be added to it. This may be formed into pills of a moderate ſize, and four or five of them taken twice or thrice a-day, according as the patient's ſtomach will bear them.</p>
                        <p>THE lac ammoniacum, or milk of gum ammoniac, as it is called, is likewiſe a proper medicine in this ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. It may be prepared and uſed, as directed page 117.</p>
                        <p>A ſyrup made of equal parts of lemon juice, fine honey, and ſugar-candy, may likewiſe be uſed. Four ounces of each of theſe may be ſimmered together in a ſauce-pan, over a ſlow fire, and a table ſpoonful of it taken at any time when the cough is troubleſome.</p>
                        <p>IT is common, in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, to load the patient's ſtomach with balſamic medicines, and at the ſame time, to drench him with decoctions, infuſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the pectoral vegetables. The former of theſe, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the cauſe of the diſeaſe, tend rather to increaſe it, by heating the blood, while the latter pall the appetite, relax the ſolids, and prove every way hurtful to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Whatever is uſed for removing the cough, beſides, riding, and other proper regimen, ought to be medicines of a ſharp and cleanſing nature.</p>
                        <p>FOR the patient's drink, we would recommend infuſions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the leſſer centaury, camomile flowers, or water trefoil. Theſe infuſions may be drank at pleaſure. They ſtrengthen the ſtomach, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote digeſtion, rectify the blood, and at the ſame time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the purpoſes of dilution, and quench thirſt much better than things that are luſcious or ſweet.</p>
                        <p>BUT if the patient ſpits blood, he ought to uſe the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing decoction for his ordinary drink. Take an ounce of comfrey root, of liquorice and marſh-mallow roots, each half an ounce. Boil them in two Engliſh quarts of water to one. If a tea ſpoonful of the acid elixir of vitriol be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this decoction, when cold, it will be a very proper medicine. A tea cupful of it may be taken at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>THERE are many other mucilaginous plants and ſeeds, of a healing and agglutinating nature, from which decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or infuſions may be prepared with the ſame intention; as the orches, the quince ſeed, coltsfoot, linſeed, ſarſaparilla, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not neceſſary to mention the different forms in
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:012338_0133_0F88E9D86E11CED8"/>
which theſe may be uſed. Simple infuſion, or boiling, is all that is neceſſary, and the doſe may be at diſcretion.</p>
                        <p>THE conſerve of roſes is here peculiarly proper. It may either be put into the decoction above preſcribed, or eat by itſelf. No benefit is to be expected from trifling doſes of this medicine. I never knew it of any ſervice, unleſs where three or four ounces at leaſt were uſed daily. In this way I have ſeen it produce very extraordinary effects, and would recommend it wherever there is a diſcharge of blood from the lungs.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the ſpitting up of groſs matter, oppreſſion of the breaſt, and the hectic ſymptoms ſhow that an impoſthume is formed in the lungs, we would recommend the Jeſuits bark, that being the only drug which has any chance to counteract the tendency which the humours then have to putrefaction.</p>
                        <p>AN ounce of the bark, in powder, may be divided into eighteen or twenty doſes, of which one may be taken every three hours through the day, in a little ſyrup, or a cup of the patient's ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>IF the bark ſhould happen to purge, it may be made into an electuary, with the conſerve of roſes: thus; take old conſerve of roſes, a quarter of a pound; Jeſuits bark, in powder, an ounce; ſyrup of orange, or lemon, as much as will make it of the conſiſtence of honey. This quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will ſerve the patient four or five days, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as there is occaſion.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as cannot take the bark in ſubſtance, may infuſe it in cold water. This ſeems to be the beſt medium for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the virtues of that drug. Half an ounce of bark, in powder, may be infuſed for twenty-four hours in half an Engliſh pint of water. Afterwards let it be paſſed through a fine ſtrainer, and an ordinary tea cupful of it taken three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>WE would not recommend the bark while there are any ſymptoms of an inflammation of the breaſt; but when it is certainly known, that matter is collecting there, it is the only medicine upon which any ſtreſs can be laid. Few pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have reſolution enough to give the bark a fair trial, at this period of the diſeaſe; otherwiſe, we have reaſon to believe, that great benefit might be reaped from it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN it is evident, that there is an impoſthume in the breaſt, and the matter can neither be ſpit up, nor carried off by abſorption, the patient muſt endeavour to make it
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012338_0134_0F88E9DABB992038"/>
break inwardly, by drawing in the ſteams of warm water or vinegar with his breath, coughing, laughing, or bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When it happens to burſt within the lungs, the matter may be diſcharged by the mouth. Sometimes, indeed, the burſting of the vomica, occaſions immediate death, by ſuffocating the patient. When the quantity of matter is great, and the patient's ſtrength exhauſted, this is apt to happen. At any rate, the patient is ready to fall into a ſwoon, and ſhould have volatile ſpirits, or ſalts, held to the noſe.</p>
                        <p>IF the matter diſcharged be thick, and the cough, and breathing, become eaſier, there may be ſome hopes of a cure. The diet, at this time, ought to be light, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative; as, ſmall chicken broths, ſago gruel, rice-milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The drink, butter-milk, or whey, ſweetened with honey. This is likewiſe a proper time for uſing the Jeſuits bark, which may be taken as before directed.</p>
                        <p>IF the vomica, or impoſthume, ſhould diſcharge itſelf into the cavity of the breaſt, betwixt the pleura and the lungs, there is no way of getting the matter out, but by an inciſion, as has already been obſerved. As this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt always be performed by a ſurgeon, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us to deſcribe it. We ſhall only obſerve, that it is not ſo dreadful as people are apt to imagine, and that it is the only chance the patient has for his life. It is, indeed, a pity that this operation, like moſt others, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally delayed till too late. When the whole maſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is tainted, the body waſted, and the ſtrength decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is in vain to attempt to ſave the patient's life by an operation.</p>
                        <p>A NERVOUS CONSUMPTION, is a waſting, or decay of the whole body, without any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of a fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing. It is attended with indigeſtion, weakneſs, and want of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THOSE who are of a fretful temper, who indulge in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, or who breathe an unwholeſome air, are moſt liable to this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>WE would chiefly recommend, for the cure of a ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous conſumption, a light and nouriſhing diet; enough of exerciſe, in a free open air; and the uſe of ſuch bitters, as brace and ſtrengthen the ſtomach; as, the Jeſuits bark,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:012338_0135_0F88E9DB77AB82B8"/>
gentian root, camomile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may be infuſed in wine, and a glaſs of it drank frequently.</p>
                        <p>IT will greatly aſſiſt the digeſtion, and promote the cure of this diſeaſe, to take, twice a-day, twenty or thirty drops of the elixir of vitriol in a glaſs of wine or water.</p>
                        <p>THE chalybeate wine is likewiſe an excellent medicine in this caſe. It ſtrengthens the ſolids, and powerfully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts nature in the preparation of good blood. It is made by putting three ounces of the filings of ſteel, or iron, into a bottle of Rheniſh wine, and allowing it to digeſt for three weeks, frequently ſhaking the bottle. Afterwards the wine muſt be filtered for uſe. A table ſpoonful of it may be taken twice or thrice a-day.</p>
                        <p>AGREEABLE amuſements, cheerful company, and riding about, are, however, preferable to all medicines in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. For this reaſon, when the patient can afford it, we would recommend a long journey of pleaſure, as the moſt likely means to reſtore his health.</p>
                        <p>WHAT is called a <hi>ſymptomatic conſumption</hi> cannot be cured without firſt removing the diſeaſe by which it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned. Thus, when a conſumption proceeds from the ſcrophula, or king's evil, from the ſcurvy, the aſthma, the venereal diſeaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a due attention muſt be paid to the malady from whence it ariſes, and the regimen and medicine directed accordingly.</p>
                        <p>WHEN exceſſive evacuations, of any kind, occaſion a conſumption, they muſt not only be reſtrained; but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ſtrength muſt be reſtored by gentle exerciſe, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing diet, and generous cordials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Young and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate mothers, often fall into conſumptions, by giving ſuck too long. As ſoon as they perceive their ſtrength and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite begin to fail, they ought immediately to wean the child, or give it to another nurſe, otherwiſe they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a cure.</p>
                        <p>BEFORE quitting this ſubject, we would earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to all who wiſh to avoid conſumptions, to take as much exerciſe without doors as they can; to avoid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome air, and to ſtudy ſobriety. Conſumptions owe their preſent increaſe not a little to the faſhionable mode of ſpending every evening over a punch-bowl, or a bottle of wine. Theſe liquors not only ſpoil the appetite, and hurt the digeſtion, but heat and inflame the blood, and ſet the whole conſtitution on fire.</p>

                        <head>THE SLOW OR NERVOUS FEVER.</head>
                        <p>NERVOUS fevers have increaſed greatly of late years in this iſland, owing, doubtleſs, to the increaſe of luxury and ſedentary employments; as this diſeaſe commonly attacks perſons of a weak relaxed habit, who neglect exerciſe, eat little ſolid food, ſtudy hard, or indulge in ſpirituous liquors.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—Nervous fevers are occaſioned by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever depreſſes the ſpirits, or impoveriſhes the blood; as grief, fear and anxiety, want of ſleep, intenſe thought; living on poor watery diet, as unripe fruits, cucumbers, melons, muſhrooms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are likewiſe occaſioned by damp, confined, or unwholeſome air. Hence they are very common in rainy ſeaſons, and prove moſt fatal to thoſe who live in dirty, low houſes, crowded ſtreets, hoſpitals, jails, or ſuch like places.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS whoſe conſtitutions have been broken by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive venery, frequent ſalivations, too free an uſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative medicines, or the like, are very liable to this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>KEEPING on wet cloaths, ſleeping in the ſun, lying on the damp ground, exceſſive fatigue, and whatever obſtructs the perſpiration, or cauſes a ſpaſmodic ſtricture of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, may likewiſe occaſion nervous fevers. We ſhall only add, frequent and great irregularities in eating and drinking. Too great abſtinence, as well as exceſs, is hurtful. Nothing tends ſo much to preſerve the humours in a ſound ſtate as a regular diet; nor can any thing contribute more to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion fevers of the worſt kind than its contrary.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—Low ſpirits, want of appetite, weakneſs, wearineſs after motion, watchfulneſs, deep ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dejection of mind, are generally the forerunners of this diſeaſe. Theſe are ſucceeded by a quick low pulſe, a dry tongue, without any conſiderable thirſt, chillneſs and fluſhing in turns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AFTER ſome time, the patient complains of a giddineſs and pain of his head, has a nauſea, with reachings and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting; his pulſe is quick, and ſometimes intermitting; his urine pale, reſembling dead ſmall bear, and his breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is difficult, with oppreſſion of the breaſt, and ſlight alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of mind.</p>
                        <p>IF towards the ninth, tenth, or twelfth day, the tongue becomes more moiſt, with a plentiful ſpitting, a gentle diarrhoea, or a moiſture upon the ſkin; or if a ſuppuration happens in one or both ears, or large puſtules break out
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:012338_0137_0F88E9DCEF54E1E0"/>
about the lips and noſe, there is reaſon to hope for a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able criſis.</p>
                        <p>BUT, if there be an exceſſive looſeneſs, or waſting ſweats, with frequent fainting fits; if the tongue, when put out, trembles exceſſively, and the extremities feel cold, with a fluttering or ſlow creeping pulſe; if there be a ſtarting of the tendons, an almoſt total loſs of ſight and hearing, and an involuntary diſcharge by ſtool and urine, there is great reaſon to fear that death is approaching.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—It is highly neceſſary in this diſeaſe to keep the patient eaſy and quiet. The leaſt motion will fatigue him, and will be apt to occaſion wearineſs, and even faintings. His mind likewiſe ought not only to be kept eaſy, but ſoothed and comforted with the hopes of a ſpeedy recovery. Nothing is more hurtful in low fevers of this kind, than preſenting to the patient's mind gloomy or frightful ideas. Theſe often occaſion nervous fevers, and it is not to be doubted but they will likewiſe increaſe the danger.</p>
                        <p>THE patient muſt not be kept too low. His ſtrength and ſpirits ought to be ſupported by nouriſhing diet and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous cordials. For this purpoſe, his gruels, panadas, or whatever food he takes, muſt be ſtrengthened with wine, according as the ſymptoms may require. Pretty ſtrong wine-whey, or ſmall negas ſharpened with the juice of orange or lemon, will be proper for his drink.</p>
                        <p>WINE, in this diſeaſe, if it could be obtained genuine, would be almoſt the only medicine that we ſhould need. Good wine poſſeſſes all the virtues of the cordial medicines, while it is free from many of their bad qualities. I ſay, good wine; for, however common that article of luxury is now become, it is rarely to be obtained genuine, eſpecially by the poor, or ſuch as purchaſe it in ſmall quantities.</p>
                        <p>I have ſeen a patient in a low nervous fever, whoſe pulſe could hardly be felt, with a conſtant delirium, coldneſs of the extremities, and almoſt every other mortal ſymptom, recover by uſing, in whey, gruel, and negas, a bottle of ſtrong wine every day. Good wine is not only the moſt proper cordial, but ſeems alſo to be an excellent antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic medicine; and conſequently it muſt be highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in all diſeaſes ariſing from a poor vapid ſtate of the blood, and too great a ſtricture of the ſolids.</p>
                        <p>MUSTARD whey is a very proper drink in this fever. It is made by tying in a linen rag a table ſpoonful of common
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:012338_0138_0F88E9DE17124000"/>
muſtard bruiſed, and boiling it a little in half an Engliſh pint of water, with an equal quantity of milk. Two or three ſpoonfuls of wine may be added to it when boiling, to make the curd ſeparate more perfectly, and to render the whey more cordial. A tea cupful of this may be given fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for the patient's ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>IN a word, the great aim in this diſeaſe is to ſupport the patient's ſpirits, by giving him frequently ſmall quantities of the above, or other drinks of a warm and cordial nature. He is not, however, to be over-heated either with liquor or cloaths; and his food ought to be light, and given in ſmall quantities.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Where a nauſea, load, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at ſtomach prevail at the beginning of the fever, it will be neceſſary to give the patient a gentle vomit. Fifteen or twenty grains of ipecacuanha will generally anſwer this purpoſe very well. This may be repeated any time before the third or fourth day, if the above ſymptoms continue. Vomits not only clean the ſtomach, but, by the general ſhock which they give, promote the perſpiration, and have many other excellent effects in ſlow fevers, where there are no ſigns of inflammation, and nature wants rouſing.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as dare not venture upon a vomit, may clean the bowels by a ſmall doſe of Turkey rhubarb, or an infuſion of ſenna and manna.</p>
                        <p>IN all fevers, the great point is to regulate the ſymptoms, ſo as to prevent their going to either extreme. Thus, in fevers of the inflammatory kind, where the force of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is too great, or the blood denſe, and the fibres too rigid, bleeding and other evacuations are neceſſary. But where nature flags, where the blood is vapid and poor, and and the ſolids weak and relaxed, there the lancet is to be avoided. Hence, bleeding is never to be permitted in ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fevers unleſs there be evident ſigns of an inflammation, which very ſeldoms happens.</p>
                        <p>IT is the more neceſſary to caution people againſt bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this diſeaſe, as there is generally, at the beginning, an univerſal ſtricture upon the veſſels, which even to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient himſelf often gives the idea of a plethora, or too great a quantity of blood. I have known ſome of the profeſſion deceived by their own feelings in this reſpect, ſo far as to inſiſt upon being bled, when it was evident that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was improper.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="135" facs="unknown:012338_0139_0F88E9DE6B5D1EB8"/>
I remember to have attended an apothecary in a nervous fever, who, at the beginning, was ſo fully perſuaded of the exiſtence of a plethora, and the neceſſity of bleeding, that when I objected to it, he told me he was ſo certain of the neceſſity of that operation from his own feelings, that if it was not performed he could not live; and that if no body elſe would bleed him, he was determined to do it himſelf. He was accordingly bled, but was ſoon convinced of his error. The blood ſhewed no ſigns of inflammation, and he was ſo remarkably worſe after the operation, that he nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped with his life. His pulſe and ſpirits ſunk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, ſo that he could hardly be ſupported by a bottle of ſtrong wine in the day, beſides other cordial medicines.</p>
                        <p>THO' bleeding be improper in this diſeaſe, yet bliſtering is highly neceſſary. Bliſtering plaſters may be applied at all times of the fever with great advantage; we would, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, adviſe people not to make too free with them at the beginning, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t there ſhould be more occaſion for them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. If the patient be delirious, he ought to be bliſtered on the neck, and it will be the ſafeſt courſe, while the fever continues; as ſoon as the diſcharge occaſioned by one plaſter abates, to apply another ſome where elſe, and by that means keep up a continual ſucceſſion of them till the patient be out of danger.</p>
                        <p>I have been more ſenſible of the advantage of bliſtering in this diſeaſe, than of any other medicine. It not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the circulation by ſtimulating the ſolids, but likewiſe occaſions a continual diſcharge, which may, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſupply the want of critical evacuations, which ſeldom happen in this kind of fever.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be coſtive through the courſe of the diſeaſe, it will be neceſſary to procure a ſtool, by giving him every other day a clyſter of milk and water, with a little ſugar, to which may be added a ſpoonful of common ſalt, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD a violent looſeneſs come on, it may be checked, by giving the patient frequently a ſmall quantity of Venice treacle, or any thing that will promote the perſpiration.</p>
                        <p>THO' bliſtering and cordial liquors are the only medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to be depended on in this kind of fever, yet, for thoſe who may chooſe to uſe them, we ſhall mention one or two of the forms of medicine which are commonly preſcribed in it.</p>
                        <p>THUS, when the patient is low, ten grains of Virginian ſnakeroot, and the ſame quantity of contrayerva root, with
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:012338_0140_0F88E9E185018A38"/>
five grains of Ruſſian caſtor, all in fine powder, may be made into a bolus, with a little of the cordial confection or ſyrup of ſaffron. One of theſe may be taken every four or five hours.</p>
                        <p>THE following powder may be uſed for the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Take wild Valerian root, in powder, one ſcruple; ſaffron and caſtor, each four grains. Mix theſe by rubbing them together in a mortar, and give it in a cup of wine whey three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>IN deſperate caſes, where the hiccup and ſtarting of the tendons have already come on, we have ſometimes ſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effects from large doſes of muſk frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. This is doubtleſs a great antiſpaſmodic, and may be given to the quantity of a ſcruple three or four times a-day. Sometimes, it may be proper to add to the muſk a few grains of camphire, and ſalt of hartſhorn, as theſe tend to promote perſpiration and urine. Thus, fifteen grains of muſk, with three grains of camphire, and ſix grains of ſalt of hartſhorn, may be made into a doſe and given as above.</p>
                        <p>IF the fever ſhould happen to intermit, which it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does towards the decline, or if the patient's ſtrength ſhould be waſted with colliquative ſweats, it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give him an infuſion of the Jeſuits bark, with ſnake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root, in wine or brandy.</p>
                        <p>HALF an ounce of the bark, with a dram of Virginian ſnakeroot, half a dram of ſaffron, and half an ounce of orange-peel, all groſsly powdered, may be infuſed in half an Engliſh pint of brandy for three or four days. Afterwards ſtrain it, and give the patient two tea ſpoonfuls in a glaſs of water, or ſmall wine, three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as don't chooſe ſpirits, may infuſe the above ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients in a bottle of Liſbon wine, and take a glaſs of it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; this will reſtore the ſtrength, prevent a relapſe, and help to carry off the remains of the fever.</p>
                        <p>IT will likewiſe be proper, at this time, to interpoſe now and then a gentle doſe of rhubarb, or ſome other mild open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicine, taking care, at the ſame time, to ſupport the patient's ſtrength with chicken-broth, jellies, and ſuch like.</p>

                        <p>CAUSES.—This fever is occaſioned by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, putrid, or ſtagnating air. Hence it prevails in jails, hoſpitals and infirmaries, eſpecially where ſuch places are greatly crowded, and cleanlineſs is neglected.</p>
                        <p>A cloſe conſtitution of the air, with long rainy or foggy weather, likewiſe occaſions putrid fevers. Hence they often ſucceed great inundations in low and marſhy countries, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when theſe are preceded or followed by a hot and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>LIVING too much upon animal food, without a proper mixture of vegetables, or eating fiſh or fleſh that has been kept too long, are likewiſe apt to occaſion this kind of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Hence, ſailors on long voyages, and the inhabitants of beſieged cities, are very often viſited with putrid fevers.</p>
                        <p>CORN that has been greatly damaged by rainy ſeaſons, or long keeping, and water that has become putrid by ſtagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will likewiſe occaſion putrid fevers. The exceſſive uſe of alkaline ſalts will alſo have this effect.</p>
                        <p>DEAD carcaſes tainting the air, eſpecially in hot ſeaſons, are very apt to occaſion putrid fevers. Hence this kind of fever often prevails in camps, and ſuch countries as are the ſcenes of war and bloodſhed. This ſhews the neceſſity of removing church-yards, ſlaughter-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at a proper diſtance from great towns.</p>
                        <p>WANT of cleanlineſs is a very general cauſe of putrid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Hence they prevail amongſt the poor inhabitants of large towns, who breathe a confined, unwholeſome air, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect cleanlineſs, and are forced to live upon ſpoiled or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome proviſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such mechanics as carry on dirty employments, and are conſtantly confined within doors, are likewiſe very liable to putrid fevers.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall only add, that all putrid, malignant, or ſpotted fevers, are very infectious; and are, therefore, often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in this way. For which reaſon, all perſons ought to keep at a diſtance from ſuch as are affected with theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, unleſs thoſe whoſe attendance is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The malignant fever is generally preceded by a remarkable weakneſs, or loſs of ſtrength, without any apparent cauſe. This is ſometimes ſo great,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012338_0142_0F88E9E2EDD92AD8"/>
that the patient can ſcarce walk, or even ſit upright, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being in danger of fainting away. His mind too is greatly dejected; he ſighs, and is full of dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
                        <p>THERE is a nauſea, and ſometimes vomiting of bile; a violent pain of the head, with a ſtrong pulſation, or throbbing of the temporal arteries; the eyes often appear red and inflamed, with a pain at the bottom of the orbit; there is a noiſe in the ears, the breathing is laborious, and often interrupted with a ſigh; the patient complains of a pain about the region of the ſtomach, and in his back and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oins; his tongue is at firſt white, but afterwards it appears black and chapped; and his teeth are covered with a black cruſt. He ſometimes paſſes worms both upwards and downwards, is affected with tremors, or ſhaking, and often becomes delirious.</p>
                        <p>IF blood be let, it appears diſſolved, or with a very ſmall degree of coheſion, and ſoon becomes putrid; the ſtools ſmell extremely foetid, and are ſometimes of a greeniſh, black, or reddiſh caſt. Spots of a pale, purple, dun, or black colour, often appear upon the ſkin, and ſometimes violent haemorrhages, or diſcharges of blood from the mouth, eyes, noſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> happen.</p>
                        <p>PUTRID fevers may be diſtinguiſhed from the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, by the ſmallneſs of the pulſe, the dejection of mind, the diſſolved ſtate of the blood, the petechiae, or purple ſpots, and the putrid ſmell of the excrements. They may likewiſe be diſtinguiſhed from the low or nervous fever, by the heat and thirſt being greater, the urine of a higher co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and the other ſymptoms more violent.</p>
                        <p>IT ſometimes, however, happens, that the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nervous, and putrid ſymptoms, are ſo blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as to render it very difficult to determine to which claſs the fever belongs. In this caſe, the greateſt caution and ſkill are requiſite. All endeavours muſt be uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the moſt urgent ſymptoms; and the efforts of nature are carefully to be watched, in order that we may give her what aſſiſtance we can in expelling the cauſe of the diſeaſe in her own way.</p>
                        <p>INFLAMMATORY and nervous fevers are often converted into malignant and putrid, by too hot a regimen, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper medicines.</p>
                        <p>THE period of putrid fevers is extremely uncertain; ſometimes they terminate betwixt the ſeventh and fourteenth
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012338_0143_0F88E9E3B1D0A7B0"/>
day, and at other times, they are prolonged for five or ſix weeks. Their duration depends greatly upon the conſtitution of the patient, and the manner of treating the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt favourable ſymptoms are, after the fourth or fifth day, a gentle looſeneſs, with a warm, mild ſweat. Theſe, when continued for a conſiderable time, often carry off the fever, and ſhould never be imprudently ſtopped. Small miliary puſtules appearing between the petechiae, or purple ſpots, are likewiſe favourable; as alſo, hot ſcabby eruptions about the mouth and noſe. It is a good ſign when the pulſe riſes upon the uſe of wine, or other cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the nervous ſymptoms abate; deafneſs coming on towards the decline of the fever, is likewiſe a favourable ſymptom, and ſo are abſceſſes in the groin, or parotid glands.</p>
                        <p>AMONGST the unfavourable ſymptoms may be reckoned an exceſſive looſeneſs, with a hard ſwelled belly. Large black or livid blotches breaking out upon the ſkin, are a proof of the putrid diſſolution of the blood, and ſhew the danger to be very great. Aphthae in the mouth, and cold clammy ſweats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are unfavourable ſigns; as alſo, blindneſs, change of the voice, a wild ſtaring of the eyes, difficulty of ſwallowing, an inability to put out the tongue, and a conſtant inclination to uncover the breaſt. When the ſweat and ſaliva are tinged with blood, and the urine is black, or depoſites a black, ſooty ſediment, the patient is in great danger. Starting of the tendons, and foetid, ichorous, involuntary ſtools, attended with coldneſs of the extremities, are generally the forerunners of death.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—In the management of this diſeaſe, we are to endeavour, as far as poſſible, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the putrid tendency of the humours; to ſupport the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ſtrength and ſpirits; and to aſſiſt nature in expelling the morbific matter, by gently promoting perſpiration and the other evacuations.</p>
                        <p>IT has been obſerved, that putrid fevers are often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by unwholeſome air, and, of courſe, they muſt be aggravated by it. Care muſt, therefore, be taken to prevent the air from ſtagnating in the patient's chamber, to keep it cool, and renew it frequently, by opening the doors or windows of ſome adjacent apartment. The breath and perſpiration of perſons in perfect health, ſoon render the air of a ſmall apartment noxious; but this will ſooner
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012338_0144_0F88E9E485E77980"/>
happen from the perſpiration and breath of a perſon whoſe whole maſs of humours are in a putrid ſtate. Theſe fevers are often ſo heightened by the ſame infected air being breathed over and over, that the patient is, in a manner, ſuffocated by his own atmoſphere.</p>
                        <p>BESIDES the frequent admiſſion of freſh air, we would recommend the uſe of vinegar, verjuice, juice of lemon, Sevil orange, or any kind of vegetable acid that can be moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obtained. Theſe ought frequently to be ſprinkled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the floor, the bed, and every part of the room. They may alſo be evaporated with an hot iron, or by boiling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The freſh ſkins of lemons or oranges ought likewiſe to be laid in different parts of the room, and they ſhould be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently help to the patient's noſe. The uſe of acids in this manner would not only prove very refreſhing to the patient, but would tend greatly to prevent the infection from ſpreading among thoſe who attend him. Strong ſmelled herbs, as rue, tanſy, roſemary, wormwood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may likewiſe be laid in different parts of the houſe, and ſmelled by thoſe who go near the patient.</p>
                        <p>THE patient muſt not only be kept cool, but likewiſe quiet and eaſy. The leaſt noiſe will affect his head, and the ſmalleſt fatigue will be apt to make him faint away.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING is of ſo great importance in this diſeaſe, as the liberal uſe of acids. Theſe are to be mixed with all the patient's food, as well as drink. Orange, lemon, or vinegar whey, are all very proper, and may be drank in turns, according to the patient's inclination. Theſe may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered cordial, by the addition of wine, in ſuch quantity as the patient's ſtrength ſeems to require. When he is very low, he may drink negas, with only one half water, and ſharpened with the juice of orange or lemon. In ſome caſes, a glaſs of clear wine may now and then be allowed. The moſt proper wine is Rheniſh; but if the belly be open, red Port, or claret, is to be preferred.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the belly is bound, a tea ſpoonful of the cream of tartar may be put into a cup of the patient's drink, as there is occaſion; or he may eat a few tamrinds, which will both quench his thirſt, and keep his belly eaſy.</p>
                        <p>IF camomile tea will ſit upon the ſtomach, it is a very proper drink in this diſeaſe. It may be ſharpened by add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every cup of the tea fifteen or twenty drops of the elixir of vitriol.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="141" facs="unknown:012338_0145_0F88E9E52BF2DAC0"/>
THE food muſt be light, as panada, groat-gruel, and ſuch like; to theſe a little wine may be added, if the patient be weak and low, and they ought all to be ſharpened with the juice of orange, or the jelly of currants, raſpberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The patient ought likewiſe to eat freely of ripe fruits, either baked, roaſted, or raw, as roaſted apples, currant, or gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry tarts, preſerved cherries, plumbs, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>THE patient muſt never be long without nouriſhment. Taking a little food or drink frequently, not only ſupports the ſpirits, but counteracts the putrid tendency of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; for which reaſon, he ought conſtantly to be ſipping ſmall quantities of ſome of the acid liquors mentioned above, or any that may be more agreeable to his palate, or more readily obtained.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be delirious, his feet and hands ought to be frequently fomented with ſtrong infuſions of camomile flowers. This, or an infuſion of the bark, to ſuch as can afford it, cannot fail to have a good effect. Fomentations of this kind not only relieve the head, by relaxing the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the extremities, but as their contents are abſorbed, and taken into the blood, they muſt, by their antiſeptic qualities, aſſiſt in preventing the putreſcency of the humours.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be not able to put his feet and hands into the decoction, cloths dipt in it may be applied to them.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—If a vomit be taken at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this fever, it will hardly fail to have a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but if the fever has gone on for ſome days, and the ſymptoms are violent, vomits muſt not be taken without proper advice.</p>
                        <p>BLEEDING is ſeldom neceſſary in putrid fevers. If there be ſigns of an inflammation, it may ſometimes be permitted at the firſt onſet; but the repetition of it often proves fatal.</p>
                        <p>BLISTERING plaſters are never to be uſed unleſs in the greateſt extremities. If the petechiae, or ſpots, ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diſappear, the patient's pulſe ſink remarkably, and a delirium, with other bad ſymptoms, come on, bliſtering may be permitted. In this caſe, the bliſtering plaſters are to be applied to the head, and the inſides of the legs or thighs. But as they are ſometimes apt to occaſion a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, we would rather recommend warm poultices or cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms to be applied to the feet, having recourſe to bliſters only in the utmoſt extremities.</p>
                        <p>A very ridiculous notion has long prevailed, of expelling the poiſonous matter of malignant diſeaſes by ſtrong doſes
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:012338_0146_0F88E9E7C4D219B0"/>
of cordial or alexipharmic medicines. In conſequence of this notion, the contrayerva root, the cordial confection, and the mithridate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have been extolled as infallible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. There is reaſon to believe, that theſe oftener do harm than good. Where cordials are neceſſary, we know none that is ſuperior to good wine; and therefore again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it both as the ſafeſt and beſt. Wine, with other acid and antiſeptic medicines, are the only things to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on in the cure of malignant fevers.</p>
                        <p>WE have already recommended acids in various forms, and ſhall only add one more, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> camphorated vinegar. This is made, by rubbing a dram of camphor, with a ſmall quantity of ſpirits of wine in a mortar, till it becomes ſoft, then adding half an ounce of loaf-ſugar, and rubbing the whole together till perfectly united. Afterwards, take an Engliſh pint of warm vinegar, and add it by little and little, ſtill continuing the trituration, till they be uniformly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let it ſtand to cool, and afterwards ſtrain it. This may be taken in the doſe of a table ſpoonful or two, every two or three hours, according as it agrees with the ſtomach. If it ſhould heat the patient, or occaſion a nauſea, it muſt be diſcontinued.</p>
                        <p>IN the moſt dangerous ſpecies of this diſeaſe, when it is attended with purple, livid, or black ſpots, the Jeſuits bark is the only medicine that can be depended upon. I have ſeen it, when joined with acids, almoſt perform wonders, even in caſes where the petechiae had the moſt threatening aſpect. But, to anſwer this purpoſe, it muſt not only be given in large doſes, but duly perſiſted in.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt method for adminiſtering the bark is certainly in ſubſtance. An ounce of it, in powder, may be mixed with half an Engliſh pint of water, and the ſame quantity of red wine, and ſharpened with the elixir of ſpirit of vitriol, which will both make it ſit eaſier on the ſtomach, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more beneficial. Two or three ounces of the ſyrup of lemon may be added, and two table ſpoonfuls of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taken every two hours, or oftener, if the ſtomach will bear it.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who cannot take the bark in ſubſtance may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it in wine, as recommended in page 136.</p>
                        <p>IF there be a violent looſeneſs, the bark muſt be boiled in red wine, with a little cinnamon, and ſharpened with the elixir of vitriol, as above. Nothing can be more beneficial
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:012338_0147_0F88E9EAEB966AB0"/>
in this kind of looſeneſs than plenty of acids, and ſuch things as promote the perſpiration.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be troubled with vomiting, a dram of the ſalt of wormwood diſſolved in an ounce and an half of freſh lemon juice, and made into a draught with an ounce of ſimple cinnamon water, or peppermint water, and a bit of ſugar, may be given to the patient, and repeated as often as it is neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IF ſwellings of the glands appear, there ſuppuration is to be promoted by the application of poultices, ripening cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as ſoon as there is any appearance of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them, they ought to be laid open, and the poultices continued.</p>
                        <p>I have known patients, in the decline of this fever, have large ulcerous ſores break out in various parts of the body, of a livid gangrenous appearance, and a moſt putrid cada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous ſmell. Theſe gradually healed, and the patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the plentiful uſe of Jeſuits bark mixed in wine, and ſharpened with the ſpirits of vitriol.</p>
                        <p>ALL who would avoid this dreadful diſeaſe, ſhould ſtudy univerſal cleanlineſs, and ſhould live regularly, avoiding the extremes of too high or too low a diet with equal care.</p>
                        <p>INFECTION, above all things, is to be avoided. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is proof againſt it. I have known perſons ſeized with a putrid fever, by only making a ſingle viſit to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in it; others have caught it by going through a town where it prevailed; and ſome by attending the funerals of ſuch as died of it.</p>
                        <p>ANY one who is apprehenſive of having caught the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ought immediately to take a vomit, and to work it off by drinking plentifully of camomile tea. This may be repeated in a day or two, if the apprehenſions ſtill continue, or any unfavourable ſymptoms appear.</p>
                        <p>THE perſon ought likewiſe to take an infuſion of the bark and camomile flowers for his ordinary drink; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes to bed, he may drink an Engliſh pint of pretty ſtrong negas, or a few glaſſes of generous wine. I have been frequently obliged to follow this courſe when malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fevers prevailed, and have likewiſe recommended it to others with conſtant ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>PEOPLE generally fly to bleeding and purging as antidotes againſt infection; but theſe are ſo far from ſecuring them, that they often increaſe the danger.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="144" facs="unknown:012338_0148_0F88E9ECC16DAD48"/>
PHYSICIANS, and ſuch as attend the ſick in putrid fevers, ought always to have a piece of ſpunge, or a handkerchief dipt in vinegar, or juice of lemon, to hold at their noſe. They ought likewiſe to waſh their hands, and, if poſſible, to change their cloaths, before they viſit any other patient.</p>

                        <p>THIS fever takes its name from the ſmall puſtules or bladders which appear on the ſkin, reſembling, in ſhape and ſize, the ſeeds of millet. The puſtules are either red or white, and ſometimes both are mixed together.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the whole body is covered with puſtules; but they are generally more numerous where the ſweat is moſt abundant, as on the breaſt, the back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A gentle ſweat, or moiſture on the ſkin, greatly promotes the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but where the ſkin is dry, the eruption is both more painful and dangerous.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES this is a primary diſeaſe; but it is much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener only a ſymptom of ſome other malady, as the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, meaſles, ardent, putrid, or nervous fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all theſe caſes it is generally the effect of too hot a regimen or medicines.</p>
                        <p>THE miliary fever chiefly attacks the idle and the phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, or perſons of a relaxed habit. The young and the aged are more liable to it than thoſe in the vigour and prime of life. It is likewiſe more incident to women than men, eſpecially the delicate, and the indolent, who, neglecting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, keep continually within doors, and live upon weak, watery diet. Such females are extremely liable to be ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this diſeaſe in child-bed, and often loſe their lives by it.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The miliary fever is often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by violent paſſions or affections of the mind; as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive grief, anxiety, thoughtfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be occaſioned by exceſſive watching, great evacuations, a weak, watery diet, rainy ſeaſons, eating too freely of cold, watery, unripe fruits, as plumbs, cherries, cucum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, melons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Impure waters, or proviſions which have been ſpoiled by rainy ſeaſons, long keeping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may likewiſe cauſe miliary fevers.

But its moſt general cauſe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence. Such women as indulge an eaſy, ſedentary life, during pregnancy, and, at the ſame time, live groſs and full, can hardly eſcape this diſeaſe in childbed. Hence it proves extremely fatal to women of faſhion, and likewiſe to thoſe women in manufacturing towns, who, in order to aſſiſt their huſbands, ſit cloſe, within doors, for almoſt the whole of their time. But, among women who are active and laborious, who live in the country, and take enough of exerciſe without doors, this diſeaſe is very little known.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—When this is a primary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, it makes its attack, like moſt other eruptive fevers, with a ſlight ſhivering, which is ſucceeded by heat, loſs of ſtrength, faintiſhneſs, ſighing, a low quick pulſe, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing, with great anxiety and oppreſſion of the breaſt. The patient is reſtleſs, and ſometimes delirious; the tongue appears white, and the hands ſhake, with often a burning heat in the palms; and, in childbed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the milk generally goes away, and the other diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſtop.</p>
                        <p>THE patient feels an itching or pricking pain under the ſkin, after which innumerable ſmall puſtules of a red or white colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> begin to appear. Upon this the ſymptoms generally abate, the pulſe becomes more full and ſoft, the ſkin grows moiſter, and the ſweat, as the diſeaſe advances, begins to have a peculiar foetid ſmell; the great load on the breaſt, and oppreſſion of the ſpirits, generally go off, and the cuſtomary evacuations gradually return. About the ſixth or ſeventh day from the eruption, the puſtules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to dry and fall off, which occaſions a very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able itching in the ſkin.</p>
                        <p>IT is impoſſible to aſcertain the exact time when the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtules will either appear or go off. They generally come out on the third or fourth day, when the eruption is criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; but, when ſymptomatical, they may appear at any time of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the puſtules appear, and vaniſh, by turns. When that is the caſe, there is always danger; but when they ſtrike in, all of a ſudden, and do not appear again, the danger is very great.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="146" facs="unknown:012338_0150_0F88E9EE9718B840"/>
IN childbed women, the puſtules are commonly at firſt filled with clear water, afterwards they grow yellowiſh. Sometimes they are interſperſed with puſtules of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. When theſe only appear, the diſeaſe goes by the name of a <hi>raſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—In all eruptive fevers, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kind, the chief point is to prevent the ſudden ſtriking in of the puſtules. For this purpoſe, the patient muſt be kept in ſuch a temperature, as neither to puſh out the eruption too faſt, nor cauſe it to retreat prematurely. The diet and drink ought therefore to be in a moderate degree, nouriſhing and cordial; but neither ſtrong nor heating. The patient's chamber ought neither to be kept too hot nor too cold; and he ſhould not be too much covered with cloaths. Above all, the mind is to be kept eaſy and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Nothing ſo certainly makes an eruption ſtrike in, as fear, or the apprehenſion of danger.</p>
                        <p>THE food muſt be weak chicken broth, with bread, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pap, with ſago, and groat gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to a gill of which may be added a ſpoonful or two of wine, as the patient's ſtrength requires, with a few grains of ſalt and a little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Good apples, roaſted or boiled, with other ripe fruits, of an opening, cooling nature, may be eat.</p>
                        <p>THE drink muſt be ſuited to the ſtate of the patient's ſtrength and ſpirits. If theſe be pretty high, the drink ought to be weak; as water gruel, balm tea, or the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing decoction:</p>
                        <p>TAKE two ounces of the ſhavings of hartſhorn, and the ſame quantity of ſarſaparilla, boil them in two Engliſh quarts of water. To the ſtrained decoction add a little white ſugar, and let the patient take it for his ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient's ſpirits are low, and the eruption does not riſe ſufficiently, his drink muſt be a little more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous; as wine whey, or ſmall negas, ſharpened with the juice of orange or lemon, and made ſtronger or weaker, as the circumſtances may require.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the miliary fever approaches towards a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid nature; in which caſe the patient's ſtrength muſt be ſupported with generous cordials, joined with acids; and if the degree of putreſcency be great, the Jeſuits bark muſt be adminiſtered. If the head be much affected, the belly muſt be kept open by emollient clyſters.</p>
                        <p>IN the <hi>Commercium Literarium</hi> for the year 1735, we have the the hiſtory of an epidemical miliary fever, which reged
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012338_0151_0F88E9EF0090ED90"/>
at Straſburg in the months of November, December, and January; from which we learn the neceſſity of a temperate regimen in this diſeaſe, and likewiſe that phyſicians are not always the firſt who diſcover the proper treatment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. "This fever made terrible havoc among men of robuſt conſtitutions, and all medicine proved in vain. They were ſeized in an inſtant with ſhivering, yawning, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pains in the back, ſucceeded by a moſt intenſe heat; at the ſame time, there was a great loſs of ſtrength and appetite. On the ſeventh or ninth day the miliary eruptions appeared, or ſpots like flea-bites, with great anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a delirium, reſtleſſneſs, and toſſing in bed. Bleeding was fatal. While matters were in this unhappy ſituation, a midwife, of her own accord, gave to a patient, in the height of the diſeaſe, a clyſter of rain-water and butter, without ſalt, and for his ordinary drink a quart of ſpring-water, half a pint of generous wine, the juice of one lemon, and ſix ounces of the whiteſt ſugar, gently boiled till a ſcum aroſe, and this with great ſucceſs; for the belly was ſoon looſened, the grievous ſymptoms vaniſhed, and the patient was reſtored to his ſenſes, and ſnatched from the jaws of death." This practice was imitated by others with the like happy effects.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—If the food and drink be properly regulated, there will be little occaſion for medicine in this diſeaſe. Should the eruption, however, not riſe, or the ſpirits flag, it will be neceſſary to ſupport the patient with cordials, and to apply bliſters. The moſt proper cordial, in this caſe, is good wine, which may either be taken in the patient's food or drink; and if there be any ſigns of putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which frequently happens, the bark and acids may be mixed with wine, as directed in the putrid fever.</p>
                        <p>SOME recommend bliſters through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe; and where nature flags, and the eruption comes and goes, it may be neceſſary to keep up a ſtimulus, by a continual ſucceſſion of ſmall bliſters; but we would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend above one at a time. If, however, the pulſe ſhould ſink remarkably, the puſtules ſtrike in, and the head be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, it will be neceſſary to apply ſeveral bliſtering plaſters to the moſt ſenſible parts, as the inſide of the legs and thighs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>BLEEDING is ſeldom neceſſary in this diſeaſe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it does much hurt, as it weakens the patient, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his ſpirits. It is, therefore, never to be attempted
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012338_0152_0F88E9EB8C0A1F70"/>
unleſs by the advice of a phyſician. We mention this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it has been cuſtomary to treat this diſeaſe in childbed women by bleeding, and other evacuations, as if it were highly inflammatory. But this practice is generally very unſafe. Patients, in this ſituation, bear evacuations very ill. And, indeed, the diſeaſe ſeems often to be more of a putrid than an inflammatory nature.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH this fever be often occaſioned in childbed women by too hot a regimen, yet it would be dangerous to leave that off all of a ſudden, and have recourſe to a very cool regimen, and large evacuations. We have reaſon to believe, that ſupporting the patient's ſpirits, and promoting the natural evacuations, is here much ſafer than to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to artificial ones, as every thing that tends to depreſs the patient's ſpirits conſtantly increaſes the danger.</p>
                        <p>IF this diſeaſe proves tedious, or the recovery ſlow, we would recommend the Jeſuits bark, which may either be taken in ſubſtance, or infuſed in wine or water, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient inclines.</p>
                        <p>THE miliary fever, like other eruptive diſeaſes, after it is gone, requires purging, which ſhould not be neglected as ſoon as the patient's ſtrength will permit.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this diſeaſe, a pure dry air, plenty of exerciſe and wholeſome food, are neceſſary. Pregnant women ſhould guard againſt coſtiveneſs, and take daily as much exerciſe as they can bear, avoiding all green traſhy fruits, and other unwholeſome things; and when in childbed, they ought ſtrictly to obſerve a cool regimen.</p>

                        <head>OF THE SMALL-POX.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe is ſo general, that very few eſcape it at one time of life or another. It is the moſt contagious malady in theſe parts; and has, for upwards of a thouſand years, proved the ſcourge of Europe.</p>
                        <p>THE ſmall-pox generally appear towards the ſpring. They are very frequent in ſummer, leſs ſo in autumn, and leaſt of all in winter. Children are moſt liable to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; and thoſe whoſe food is unwholeſome, who want pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exerciſe, and abound with groſs humours, run the greateſt hazard from it.</p>
                        <p>THE diſeaſe is diſtinguiſhed into the diſtinct and conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kind; the latter of which is always attended with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:012338_0153_0F88E9F0A08DADE0"/>
There are likewiſe other diſtinctions of the ſmall-pox; as the lymphatic, the cryſtalline, the bloody, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The ſmall-pox are commonly caught by infection. Since the diſeaſe was brought into Europe, the infection has never been wholely extinguiſhed; nor have any proper methods, ſo far as we know, ever been taken for that purpoſe; ſo that now it has become in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional. Children who have over-heated themſelves by running, wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or adults after a debauch, are very apt to be ſeized with this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—This diſeaſe is ſo generally known, that a minute deſcription of it is unneceſſary. Children commonly look a little dull, ſeem liſtleſs and drowſy for a few days before the more violent ſymptoms of the ſmall-pox appear. They are likewiſe more inclined to drink than uſual, have little appetite for ſolid food, complain of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and, upon taking exerciſe, are apt to ſweat. Theſe are ſucceeded by ſlight fits of cold and heat in turns, which, as the time of the eruption approaches, become more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and are accompanied with pains of the head and loins, vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The pulſe is quick, with a great heat of the ſkin, and reſtleſſneſs. When the patient drops aſleep, he wakes in a kind of horror, with a ſudden ſtart, which is a very common ſymptom of the approaching eruption; as are alſo convulſion fits in very young children.</p>
                        <p>ABOUT the third or fourth day from the time of ſicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſmall-pox generally begin to appear; ſometimes, indeed, they appear ſooner, but that is no advantage. At firſt they very nearly reſemble flea-bites, and are moſt early diſcovered on the face, arms and breaſt.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt favourable ſymptoms are a ſlow eruption, and an abatement of the fever as ſoon as the puſtules appear. In a mild diſtinct kind of ſmall-pox, the puſtules ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the fourth day from the time of ſickening, and they generally keep coming out gradually for ſeveral days after. Puſtules, which are diſtinct, with a florid red baſis, and which fill with thick purulent matter, firſt of a whitiſh, and afterwards of a yellowiſh colour, are the beſt.</p>
                        <p>A livid brown colour of the puſtules is an unfavourable ſymptom; as alſo, when they are ſmall and flat, with black ſpecks in the middle. Puſtules which contain a thin wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ichor are very bad. A great number of pox on the face is always a bad ſign, eſpecially if they be confluent, or run into one another.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="150" facs="unknown:012338_0154_0F88E9B65B38CFA0"/>
BUT the moſt unfavourable ſymptom is the petechiae, or purple, brown and black ſpots interſperſed among the puſtules. Theſe are ſigns of a putrid diſſolution of the blood, and ſhow the danger to be very great. Bloody ſtools or urine, with a ſwelled belly, are bad ſymptoms; as is alſo, a continual ſtrangury. When the urine is very pale, and there is a violent throbbing of the arteries of the neck, it portends a delirium or convulſion fits. When the face does not ſwell, or falls before the pox come to maturity, it is a very bad ſign. If the face begins to fall about the eleventh or twelfth day, and the hands begin to ſwell, and afterwards the feet, the patient generally does well; but when theſe do not ſucceed, there is reaſon to apprehend danger. When the tongue is covered with a brown cruſt, it is an unfavourable ſymptom. Cold ſhivering fits coming on at the height of the diſeaſe, are likewiſe unfavourable. Grinding of the teeth, when it proceeds from an affection of the nervous ſyſtem, is a bad ſign; but, ſometimes, it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by worms, or a diſordered ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—When the firſt ſymptoms of the ſmall-pox appear, people are ready to be alarmed, and often fly to the uſe of medicine, to the great danger of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's life. I have known children, to appeaſe the anxiety of their parents, bled, bliſtered, purged, and vomited, during the fever which preceded the eruption of the ſmall-pox, to ſuch a degree, that nature was not only diſturbed in her operation, but rendered unable to ſupport the puſtules after they were out; ſo that the patient, exhauſted by mere eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, ſunk under the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>WHEN convulſions appear, they give a dreadful alarm. Immediately ſome noſtrum is applied, as if this were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary diſeaſe; whereas, it is only a ſymptom, and far from being an unfavourable one, of the approaching eruption. As the fits generally go off before the actual appearance of the ſmall-pox, it is attributed to the medicine, which, by this means, acquires a reputation without any merit.</p>
                        <p>ALL that is, generally ſpeaking, neceſſary during the eruptive fever, is to keep the patient within doors, and to allow him to drink freely of ſome weak diluting liquors; as balm tea, barley water, clear whey, gruels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhould neither be kept in too warm a room, nor confined to bed; but ſhould ſit up as much as he is able, and ſhould have his feet and legs frequently bathed in lukewarm water.
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012338_0155_0F88E9F12F1BD080"/>
His food, if he takes any, ought to be very light; and he ſhould be as little diſturbed with noiſe and company as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>MUCH miſchief is done at this period by confining the patient too ſoon to his bed, and plying him with warm cordials, or ſudorific medicines. Every thing that heats and inflames the blood, increaſes the fever, and puſhes out the puſtules too faſt. This has numberleſs ill effects. It not only increaſes the number of puſtules, but likewiſe tends to make them run into one another; and when they have been puſhed out with too great violence, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall in before they come to maturity.</p>
                        <p>THE good women, as ſoon as they ſee the ſmall-pox begin to appear, commonly ply their tender charge with cordials, ſaffron or marygold teas, wines, punch, and even brandy itſelf. All theſe are given with a view to throw out the eruption, as they pretend, from the heart. This, like moſt other popular miſtakes, is the abuſe of a very juſt obſervation, <hi>That when there is a moiſture on the ſkin, the pox riſe better, and the patient is eaſier than when it continues dry and parched.</hi> But that is no reaſon for forcing the patient into a ſweat. Sweating never relieves, unleſs where it comes ſpontaneouſly, or is the effect of drinking weak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting liquors.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ought to have no more covering in bed than is neceſſary to prevent his catching cold, and he ſhould be frequently taken up, if it were only for a few minutes; this will both keep him cool, and prevent too great a flux of blood towards the head.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN are often ſo peeviſh that they will not lie a-bed without a nurſe conſtantly by them. This, we have reaſon to believe, has many bad effects. Even the natural heat of the nurſe cannot fail to augment the fever of the child; but if ſhe too proves feveriſh, the danger muſt be increaſed. I have known a nurſe contract a malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by lying in bed with a child the whole time of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill of a bad kind of ſmall-pox.</p>
                        <p>LAYING ſeveral children who have the ſmall-pox in the ſame bed, has many ill conſequences. They ought, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, never to be in the ſame chamber, as the perſpiration, the heat, and the ſmell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all tend to augment the fever, and to heighten the diſeaſe. It is common, among the poor, to ſee two or three children lying in the ſame bed, with ſuch a load of puſtules, that their very ſkins ſtick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:012338_0156_0F88E9F3385FEA50"/>
One can hardly view a ſcene of this kind without being ſickened by the ſight and ſmell. How much more muſt theſe affect the poor patients, many of whom periſh by this uſage?</p>
                        <p>THIS obſervation is likewiſe applicable to hoſpitals, workhouſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where numbers of children happen to have the ſmall-pox at the ſame time. I have ſeen above forty children cooped up in one apartment all the while they had this diſeaſe, without any of them being admitted to breathe the freſh air. No one can be at a loſs to ſee the impropriety of ſuch conduct, which generally proceeds from a piece of ill-judged oeconomy, to ſave the trifling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a few nurſes. It ought to be a rule, not only in hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals for the ſmall-pox, but likewiſe for other diſeaſes, that no patient ſhould be within ſight or hearing of another. This is a matter to which too little regard is paid in moſt hoſpitals and infirmaries, where the ſick, the dying, and the dead are often to be ſeen in the ſame apartment.</p>
                        <p>A very dirty cuſtom prevails amongſt the lower ſort of people, of allowing children in the ſmall-pox to keep on the ſame linen during the whole period of that loathſome diſeaſe. This is done leſt they ſhould catch cold, but it has many ill conſequences. The linen becomes hard, by the moiſture which it abſorbs, and frets the tender ſkin. It likewiſe occaſions a bad ſmell, which is very pernicious both to the patient, and thoſe about him; beſides the filth and ſordes, which adhere to the linen, being abſorbed, or taken up again into the body, greatly augment the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>A patient ſhould not be kept dirty in any diſeaſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the ſmall-pox. Cutaneous diſorders are often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by naſtineſs alone, and are always increaſed by it. Were the patient's linen to be changed every day, it would greatly refreſh him. Care, indeed, is to be taken that the linen be thoroughly dry. It ought, likewiſe, to be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and put on when the patient is moſt cool.</p>
                        <p>SO ſtrong is the vulgar prejudice in this country, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that has been ſaid againſt keeping children too warm in the ſmall-pox, that numbers ſtill fall a ſacrifice to that error. I have ſeen poor women travelling in the depth of winter, and carrying their children along with them in the ſmall-pox; and have frequently obſerved others begging by the way-ſide, with infants in their arms, covered with the puſtules; yet I could never learn that one of theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren died by this ſort of treatment. We would not, however,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012338_0157_0F88E9F3C154A708"/>
propoſe this as an example worthy of imitation; we only mention it to ſhew, that the danger of expoſing children to the open air in this diſeaſe is not ſo great as people are apt to imagine.</p>
                        <p>STRONG prejudices, when got over, often produce the oppoſite extreme. We would, therefore, adviſe people, when they avoid one error, not to run into another. Some celebrated inoculators order their patients to walk about all the while they are under the diſeaſe, as if nothing were the matter. We ſhould think it adviſable, however, to keep within doors, at leaſt during the eruption, as cold air is apt to check the perſpiration, and to prevent the pox from riſing, or filling with matter. I do not remember ever to have ſeen large, well-filled puſtules where the patient was expoſed to the external air. In winter the air of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is abundantly cool within doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s, and in ſummer a patient may be kept more uniformly cool in the houſe than he can be out of it. For theſe, and other reaſons, we ſhould think it right to confine the patient to the houſe while the eruption is out; but never to allow the heat of his chamber to be greater than is agreeable to a perſon in perfect health.</p>
                        <p>THE food in this diſeaſe ought to be very light, and of a cooling nature, as water pap, rice, or bread, boiled with milk, good apples, roaſted, or boiled with milk, and ſweetened with a little ſugar, or ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>THE drink may be equal parts of milk and water, clear ſweet whey, barley water, or thin gruel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the pox are full, butter-milk is an excellent drink, it being of an opening and cleanſing nature.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—This diſeaſe is generally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four different periods, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> the fever which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the eruption, the eruption itſelf, the ſuppuration, or maturation of the puſtules, and the ſecondary fever.</p>
                        <p>IT has already been obſerved, that little more is neceſſary during the primary fever, than to keep the patient cool and quiet, allowing him to drink diluting liquors, and bathing his feet frequently in warm water. Though this be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the ſafeſt courſe that can be taken with infants, yet adults of a ſtrong conſtitution and plethoric habit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times require bleeding. When a pulſe, a dry ſkin, and other ſymptoms of inflammation, render this operation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it ought to be performed. But, unleſs theſe ſymptoms are urgent, it is ſafer to truſt to fomentations;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:012338_0158_0F88E9F432C0D7F8"/>
and, if the belly be bound, emollient clyſters may be thrown in.</p>
                        <p>IF there be a great nauſea or vomiting, weak camomile tea, or lukewarm water, may be drank, in order to clean the ſtomach. At the beginning of a fever, nature general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempts a diſcharge, either upwards or downwards; which, if promoted by gentle means, would tend greatly to abate the force or violence of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH every method is to be taken during the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fever, by a cool regimen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prevent too great an eruption; yet, after the puſtules have made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, our buſineſs is to promote the ſuppuration, by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle warmth, diluting drink, light food, and, if nature ſeems to flag, by generous cordials; but the latter ought never to be given unleſs where there is an abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When a low, creeping pulſe, faintiſhneſs, and great loſs of ſtrength, render cordials neceſſary, we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend good wine, which may be made into negas, with an equal quantity of water, and ſharpened with the juice of orange, the jelly of currants, or the like. Wine whey, ſharpened as above, is likewiſe a proper drink in this caſe; great care, however, muſt be taken not to overheat the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient by any of theſe things. This would retard inſtead of promoting the eruption.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the riſing of the ſmall-pox is prevented by the violence of the fever; in which caſe, the cool regimen is ſtrictly to be obſerved. For example, the patient's chamber muſt be kept cool; he ought likewiſe frequently to be taken out of bed, and to be lightly covered with cloaths while in it.</p>
                        <p>EXCESSIVE reſtleſſneſs often prevents the riſing and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſmall-pox. When that happens, gentle opiates are neceſſary. Theſe, however, ought always to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered with the greateſt caution. To an infant, a tea ſpoonful of the ſyrup of poppies may be given every five or ſix hours, till it has the deſired effect. An adult perſon will require a table ſpoonful in order to anſwer the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and to others, the doſe muſt be proportioned to their age, and the violence of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be troubled with a ſtrangury, or ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of urine, which often happens in the ſmall-pox, he ſhould be frequently taken out of bed, and, if he be able, ſhould walk acroſs the room with his feet bare. When he cannot do this, he may be frequently ſet on his knees in
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:012338_0159_0F88E9F4F041AB10"/>
bed, and ſhould endeavour to paſs his urine as often as he can. When theſe do not ſucceed, a tea ſpoonful of the ſweet ſpirits of nitre may be occaſionally mixed in his drink. Nothing more certainly relieves the patient, or is more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial in the ſmall-pox, than a plentiful diſcharge of urine.</p>
                        <p>IF the mouth be foul, and the tongue dry and chapped, it ought to be frequently waſhed, and the throat gargled with warm water and honey, ſharpened with a little vinegar or currant jelly.</p>
                        <p>DURING the riſing of the ſmall-pox, it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the patient is eight or ten days without a ſtool. This not only tends to heat and inflame the blood, but the foeces, by lodging ſo long in the body, become acrid and even putrid, from whence bad conſequences muſt enſue. It will therefore be proper, when the belly is bound, to throw in an emollient clyſter every ſecond or third day, through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. This will greatly cool and relieve the patient.</p>
                        <p>WHEN petechiae, or purple, black, or livid ſpots appear among the ſmall-pox, the Jeſuits bark muſt immediately be adminiſtered in as large doſes as the patient's ſtomach can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ear. For a child, two drams of the bark in powder may be mixed in three ounces of common water, one ounce of ſimple cinnamon-water, and two ounces of the ſyrup of orange or lemon. This may be ſharpened with the ſpirits of vitriol, and a table ſpoonful of it given every hour. If it be given to an adult in the ſame form, he may take at leaſt three or four ſpoonfuls every hour. This medicine ought not to be trifled with, but muſt be thrown in as faſt as the ſtomach can bear; in which caſe it will often produce very happy effects. I have frequently ſeen the petechiae diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and ſmall-pox, which had a very threatening aſpect, riſe and fill with laudable matter, by the uſe of the Jeſuits bark and acids.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's drink ought likewiſe, in this caſe, to be acidulated with the ſpirits of vitriol, vinegar, juice of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, jelly of currants, or ſuch like. His food muſt conſiſt of apples, roaſted or boiled, preſerved cherries, plumbs and other ſharp fruits.</p>
                        <p>CAMOMILE tea, if the patient's ſtomach will bear it, is likewiſe a very proper drink in this caſe. It may be ſharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any of the acids mentioned above, and drank at pleaſure. When the pulſe and ſpirits are low, red wine
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:012338_0160_0F88E9F5CC28BF48"/>
negas, or pretty ſtrong wine whey, ſharpened with the juice of lemon, muſt be given for the patient's ordinary drink.</p>
                        <p>THE bark and acids are not only neceſſary when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae or putrid ſymptoms appear, but likewiſe in the lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic or cryſtalline ſmall-pox, where the matter is thin, and not duly prepared. The Jeſuits bark ſeems poſſeſſed of a ſingular power to aſſiſt nature in preparing laudable pus, or what is called good matter; conſequently it muſt be very beneficial, both in this and other diſeaſes whoſe criſis depends on a ſuppuration. I have often obſerved, where the ſmall-pox were flat, and the matter contained in them quite clear and tranſparent, and where they had the appearance of running into one another, that the uſe of a few drams of the Jeſuits bark, acidulated as above, not only promoted the ſuppuration, but changed the colour and conſiſtence of the matter, and produced the moſt happy effects.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eruption ſubſides ſuddenly, or, as the good women term it, when the ſmall-pox ſtrike in, before they have arrived at maturity, the danger is very great. This is often the effect of a hot regimen, or medicines which at the beginning puſh out the matter before it has been properly prepared. When this happens, bliſtering plaſters muſt be immediately applied to the wriſts and ancles, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ſpirits ſupported with cordials.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES bleeding has a ſurpriſing effect in raiſing the puſtules after they have ſubſided; but it requires ſkill to know when this is proper, or to what length the patient can bear it. Sharp cataplaſms, however, may be applied to the feet and hands, as they tend to promote the ſwelling of theſe parts, and by that means to draw the humour towards the extremities.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt dangerous period of the diſeaſe is what we call the ſecondary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>mes on when the ſmall-pox begin to turn on the face; and moſt of thoſe who die of the ſmall-pox are carried off by this fever.</p>
                        <p>NATURE generally attempts, at the turn of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox to relieve the patient by looſe ſtools. Her endeavours this way, are by no means to be counteracted, but promoted, and the patient at the ſame time ſupported by things of a light but nouriſhing nature. Patients have often been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably relieved at this time by a few looſe ſtools, either brought on by nature or procured by art. That ſhould
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:012338_0161_0F88E9F66B75C738"/>
encourage us to endeavour to aſſiſt nature in this way, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the ſymptoms be threatening, and the belly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues bound.</p>
                        <p>IF at the approach of the ſecondary fever, the pulſe be very quick, hard, and ſtrong, the heat intenſe, and the breathing laborious, with other ſymptoms of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the breaſt, the patient muſt immediately be bled, otherwiſe a fatal peripneumony will enſue. The quantity of blood to be let muſt be regulated by the patient's ſtrength, age, and the urgency of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>BUT, in the ſecondary fever, if the patient be faintiſh, the puſtules become pale and ſhrink, and if there be great coldneſs of the extremities, bliſtering plaſters muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the patient muſt be ſupported with generous wine. Wine, and even ſpirits have ſometimes been given in ſuch deſperate caſes with amazing ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>AS the ſecondary fever is in great meaſure, if not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, owing to the abſorption of the matter, it would ſeem highly conſonant to reaſon, that the puſtules, as ſoon as they come to maturity, ſhould be opened. That is every day practiſed in other phlegmons which tend to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there ſeems to be no reaſon why it ſhould be leſs proper here. On the contrary, we have reaſon to believe, that by this means the ſecondary fever might always be leſſened, and often wholely prevented.</p>
                        <p>THE puſtules ſhould be opened when they begin to turn of a yellow colour. Very little art is neceſſary for this operation. They may either be opened with a pair of ſciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or a needle, and the matter abſorbed by a wet ſpunge, or a little lint. As the puſtules are generally firſt ripe on the face, it will be proper to begin with opening theſe, and the others in courſe as they become ripe. The puſtules generally fill again, a ſecond, or even a third time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which cauſe the operation muſt be repeated, or rather continued ſo long as there is any conſiderable appearance of matter in the puſtules.</p>
                        <p>WE have reaſon to believe, that this operation, rational as it is, has been neglected from a piece of miſtaken tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in parents. They believe, that it muſt be great pain to the poor child; and therefore would rather ſee it die than have it thus tortured. This notion, however, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely without foundation. It is only the ſcarf-ſkin that is cut, which, upon the top of the puſtules, by the time they are ripe, becomes quite inſenſible. I have frequently open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012338_0162_0F88E9F978F31618"/>
the puſtules when the patients did not ſee me, without their being in the leaſt ſenſible of it; but ſuppoſe it were attended with a little pain, that is nothing in compariſon to the advantages which ariſe from it.</p>
                        <p>OPENING the puſtules not only prevents the abſorption of the matter into the blood, but likewiſe takes off tenſion of the ſkin, and by that means greatly relieves the patient. It likewiſe prevents the pitting, which is a matter of no ſmall importance. Acrid matter, by lodging long in the puſtules, cannot fail to corrode the tender ſkin; by which many a handſome face becomes ſo deformed as hardly to bear a reſemblance to the human figure.</p>
                        <p>IT is always neceſſary, after the ſmall-pox are gone off, to purge the patient. If, however, the belly has been open through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe, or, if butter-milk, and other things of an opening nature, have been given, after the height of the ſmall-pox, purging becomes leſs neceſſary; but it ought never wholely to be neglected.</p>

Thoſe who are farther advanced muſt take me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of a ſharper nature. For example, a child of four or five years of age, may take ten grains of fine rhubarb in powder over night, and the ſame quantity of jalap in powder next morning, with two or three grains of calomel, mixed in currant jelly, or made into a bolus with a little honey. He ought to keep the houſe all day, and to drink nothing that is cold. The doſe may be repeated three or four times, five or ſix days intervening betwixt each doſe. For children further advanced, and adults, the doſe muſt be increaſed in proportion to the age and conſtitution.</p>

                           </gap>now, as almoſt all the danger from it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by inoculation. This ſalutary invention has been known in Europe about half a century; but, like moſt other uſeful diſcoveries, it has met with great oppoſition. It muſt, however, be acknowledged, to the honour of this country, that inoculation has met with a more favourable reception here than by any of our neighbours. It is ſtill, however, far from being general, which we have reaſon to fear will ever be the caſe, ſo long as the practice continues in the hands of the faculty.</p>
                        <p>NO diſcovery can ever be of general utillity while the practice of it is kept in the hands of a few. Had the inocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſmall-pox been introduced as a faſhion, and not as a medical diſcovery, and had it been practiſed by the ſame kind of operators here as it is in thoſe countries from whence we had it, it had long ago been univerſal. The fears, the jealouſies, the prejudices, and the oppoſite inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the faculty, are, and ever will be, the moſt effectual obſtacles to the progreſs of any ſalutary diſcovery. Hence it is, that the practice of inoculation never became, in any meaſure, general, even in England, till taken up by men not bred to phyſic. Theſe have not only rendered the practice more extenſive, but likewiſe more ſafe, and, by acting under leſs reſtraint than the regular practitioners, have taught them that the patient's greateſt danger aroſe, not from the want of care, but from the exceſs of it.</p>
                        <p>THEY know very little of the matter, who impute the ſucceſs of modern inoculators to any ſuperior ſkill, either in preparing the patient or communicating the diſeaſe. Some operators indeed, from a ſordid deſire of ingroſſing the whole practice to themſelves, pretend to have extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſecrets or noſtrums in preparing perſons for inoculation, which never fail of ſucceſs. But this is only a pretence calculated to blind the ignorant and inattentive. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and prudence alone are ſufficient both in the choice of the ſubject, and management of the operation. Whoever is poſſeſſed of theſe may perform this office for his children whenever he finds it convenient, provided they be in a proper ſtate of health; and may reſt aſſured, that he will ſucceed as well as the moſt celebrated inoculator.</p>
                        <p>THIS ſentiment is not the reſult of theory, but of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Though few phyſicians have had more opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of trying inoculation in all its different forms, ſo little
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:012338_0164_0F88E9FAEDC679B0"/>
appears to me to depend on theſe, generally reckoned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant circumſtances, of preparing the body, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the infection by this or the other method, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that for ſeveral years paſt I have cauſed the parents or nurſes perform the whole themſelves, and have found that method followed with equal ſucceſs, while it is free from many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that attend the other.</p>
                        <p>A critical ſituation, too often to be met with, firſt put me upon trying this method. A gentleman who had loſt all his children, except one ſon, by the natural ſmall-pox, was determined to have him inoculated. He told me his intention, and deſired I would perſuade the mother and grandmother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of its propriety. But that was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They were not to be perſuaded, and either could not get the better of their fears, or were determined againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. It was always a point with me not to perform the operation without the conſent of parties concerned. I therefore adviſed the father, after giving his ſon a doſe or two of rhubarb, to go to a patient who had the ſmall-pox of a good kind, to open two or three of the puſtules, taking up the matter with a little cotton, and as ſoon as he came home to take his ſon into a private room, and give his arm a ſlight ſcratch with a pin, as if it had been by accident, afterwards to rub the place well with the cotton, and take no farther notice of it. All this he punctually performed; and, at the uſual period, the ſmall-pox made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which were of an exceeding good kind, and ſo mild as not to confine the boy an hour to his bed. None of the other relations knew but the diſeaſe had come in the natural way till the patient was well.</p>
                        <p>WE do not propoſe this as the only method in which the ſmall-pox can be communicated. It appears from experience, that this may be done various ways with equal ſucceſs. In Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, from whence we learned the practice, the women commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the diſeaſe to children, by opening a bit of the ſkin with a needle, and putting into the wound a little matter taken from a ripe puſtule. On the coaſt of Barbary, they paſs a thread wet with the matter through the ſkin, between the thumb and fore-finger; and in Europe inoculation is generally performed by making a ſmall inciſion through the cuticle of the arm or leg with a lancet, and laying a bit of thread wet with the matter upon the wound, which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a piece of ſticking plaſter, and kept on for two or three days.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="161" facs="unknown:012338_0165_0F88E9FBAE2D8C68"/>
SOME of the people in England, who make a trade of inoculation, only open one of the ripe puſtules with a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, and while it is wet with the matter, make a ſlight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the arm of the perſon to whom they want to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the diſeaſe; afterwards they cloſe up the wound, and leave it without any other dreſſing. This ſeems to be no real improvement. It frequently fails to communicate the diſeaſe, and is far leſs certain than when a ſcratch with a pin or needle is made, and a bit of thread wet with the matter kept on the wound for ſome days by a ſticking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
                        <p>INDEED, if the matter be applied long enough to the ſkin, there is no occaſion for any wound at all. Let a bit of thread, about half an inch long, wet with the matter, be applied to the arm, midway between the ſhoulder and elbow, and covered with a piece of the common black ſticking plaſter, and kept on for eight or ten days. This will ſeldom fail to communicate the diſeaſe. We mention this method, becauſe many people are afraid of a wound; and, doubtleſs, the more eaſily the operation can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it has the greater chance to become general. Some people imagine, that the diſcharge from a wound leſſens the eruption; but there is not much ſtreſs to be laid upon this notion: Beſides, deep wounds often ulcerate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come troubleſome.</p>
                        <p>WE do not find that inoculation is at all conſidered as a medical operation in thoſe countries from whence we learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. In Turkey it is performed by the women, and in the Eaſt-Indies by the Brachmins or prieſts. In this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try the cuſtom is ſtill in its infancy; we make no doubt, however, but it will become ſo familiar, that parents will think no more of inoculating their own children than at preſent they do of giving them a doſe of phyſic.</p>
                        <p>NO ſet of men have it ſo much in their power to render the practice of inoculation general as the clergy; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt oppoſition to it ſtill ariſing from ſome ſcruples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which they alone can remove. We would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to them, not only to endeavour to remove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious objections which weak minds may have to this ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary practice, but to enjoin it as a duty, and to point out the danger of neglecting to make uſe of a mean which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has put in our power for ſaving the lives of our offspring. Surely ſuch parents as wilfully neglect th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012338_0166_0F88E9FC6D1751D8"/>
put them to death. We wiſh this matter were duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No one is more ready to make allowance for human weakneſs and religious prejudices, yet I cannot help recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it, in the warmeſt manner, to parents to conſider how great an injury they do their children, by neglecting to give them this diſeaſe in the early period of life.</p>
                        <p>THE numerous advantages attending inoculation of the ſmall-pox, have been pretty fully pointed out by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. McKenzie in his Hiſtory of Health: "Many and great, ſays this humane author, are the dangers attending the natural infection, from all which the inoculation is quite ſecure. The natural infection may invade weak or diſtempered bodies, by no means diſpoſed for its kindly reception. It may attack them at a ſeaſon of the year either violently hot, or intenſely cold. It may be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from a ſort of ſmall-pox impregnated with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt virulence. It may lay hold upon people unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, when a dangerous ſort is imprudently imported into a maritime place. It may ſurprize us ſoon after exceſſes committed in luxury, intemperance, or lewdneſs. It may likewiſe ſeize on the innocent, after indiſpenſible watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, hard labour, or neceſſary journies. And is it a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial advantage, that all theſe unhappy circumſtances can be prevented by inoculation? By inoculation numbers are ſaved from deformity as well as from death. In the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſmall-pox, how often are the fineſt features, and the moſt beautiful complexions, miſerably disfigured?

being ſeized with this diſtemper on ſhipboard, where they muſt quickly ſpread the infection among ſuch of the crew who never had it before, and where they have ſcarce any chance to eſcape, being half-ſtifled with the cloſeneſs of their cabbins, and but very indifferently nurſed? Laſtly, with regard to the ſoldiery, the miſeries attending theſe poor creatures, when attacked by the ſmall-pox on a march, is inconceivable, without attendance, without lodgings, without an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>WE ſhall only add, that ſuch as have not had the ſmall-pox in the early period of life, are not only rendered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, but likewiſe, in a great meaſure, unfit for ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of the moſt uſeful and important offices. Few people would chooſe even to hire a ſervant who have not had the ſmall-pox, far leſs to purchaſe a ſlave who had the chance of dying with this diſeaſe. How could a phyſician, or a ſurgeon, who had never had the ſmall-pox himſelf, attend others under that malady? Thus, beſides, the continual fears and anxiety which haunt thoſe perſons who have not had the ſmall-pox, we might ſhew numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies which ariſe from it. For example,</p>
                        <p>HOW deplorable is the ſituation of females, who arrive at mature age without having had the ſmall-pox! A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with child ſeldom ſurvives this diſeaſe: And, if an infant happens to be ſeized with the ſmall-pox upon the mother's breaſt, who has not had the diſeaſe herſelf, the ſcene muſt be diſtreſſing! If ſhe continues to ſuckle the child, it is at the peril of her own life; and, if ſhe weans it, in all probability, it will periſh. How often is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mother forced to leave her houſe, and abandon her children, at the very time when her care is moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? But ſhould parental affection get the better of her fears, the conſequences will often prove fatal. I have known the tender mother and her inſant child laid in the ſame grave, both untimely victims to this dreadful malady. But theſe are ſcenes too ſhocking even to mention. Let parents who run away with their children to avoid the ſmall-pox, or who refuſe to inoculate them in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, conſider to what deplorable ſituations they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this miſtaken tenderneſs.</p>
                        <p>AS the ſmall-pox has now become a conſtitutional diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in moſt parts of the known world, no other choice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but to render the malady as mild as poſſible; that
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012338_0168_0F88E9FFD0AA3858"/>
is the only manner of extirpation now left in our power; and, though it may ſeem paradoxical, this artificial method of planting the diſeaſe, could it be rendered univerſal, would amount to nearly the ſame thing as rooting it out. It is a matter of ſmall conſequence, whether a diſeaſe be entirely extirpated, or rendered ſo mild, as neither to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy life, nor hurt the conſtitution; but that this may be done by inoculation, does not now admit of a doubt. The numbers who die under inoculation, hardly deſerve to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e named. In the natural way, one in four or five generally die; but by inoculation, not one of a thouſand. Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, ſome can boaſt of having inoculated ten thouſand without the loſs of a ſingle patient.</p>
                        <p>I have often wiſhed to ſee ſome plan eſtabliſhed for ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this ſalutary practice univerſal; but am afraid I ſhall never be ſo happy. The difficulties indeed are many; yet the thing is by no means impracticable. The aim is great; no leſs than ſaving the lives of one fourth of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. What ought not to be attempted in order to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh ſuch an end?</p>
                        <p>THE firſt ſtep towards rendering the practice univerſal, muſt be to remove the religious prejudices againſt it. This, as already obſerved, can only be done by the clergy. They muſt not only recommend it as a duty to others, but likewiſe practiſe it on their own children. Example will ever have more influence than precept.</p>
                        <p>THE next thing requiſite is to put it in the power of all. For this purpoſe we would recommend it to the Faculty to inoculate the children of the poor <hi>gratis.</hi> It is hard that thoſe who are certainly the moſt uſeful part of mankind, ſhould, by their poverty, be excluded from ſuch a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD this fail, it is ſurely in the power of any ſtate to render the practice general, at leaſt, as far as their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion extends. We do not mean, that it ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by a law: That, there is reaſon to believe, would rather tend to obſtruct its progreſs. The way to promote it, would be to employ a ſufficient number of operators at the public expence to inoculate the children of the poor. This would only be neceſſary, till the practice became general; afterwards cuſtom, the ſtrongeſt of all laws, would oblige every one to inoculate their children, to prevent reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="165" facs="unknown:012338_0169_0F88EA016F186D50"/>
IT may be objected to this ſcheme, that the poor would refuſe to employ the inoculators: That is eaſily removed. A ſmall premium to enable mothers to attend their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren while under the diſeaſe, would be a ſufficient induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; beſides, the ſucceſs attending the operation, would ſoon baniſh all objections to it. Even conſiderations of profit, would induce the poor to embrace this plan. They often bring up their children to the age of ten or twelve, and when they come to be uſeful, they are ſnatched away by this malady, to the great loſs of their parents, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the public.</p>
                        <p>THE Britiſh legiſlature has, of late years, ſhown great attention to the preſervation of infant lives, by ſupporting the foundling hoſpital, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we will venture to ſay, if one tenth part of the ſums laid out in ſupporting that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, had been beſtowed towards promoting the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of inoculation of the ſmall-pox among the poor, that not only more uſeful lives had been ſaved, but the practice, before now, rendered quite univerſal in this iſland. It is not to be imagined, what effect example, and a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, will have upon the poor; yet, if left to themſelves, they will go on for ever in the old way, without thinking of any improvement. We only mean this as a hint to the humane and public ſpirited. Should ſuch a ſcheme be ever put in practice, a proper plan might eaſily be laid down for the execution of it.</p>
                        <p>AS all public plans are very difficult to bring about, and, often, by the ſelfiſh views, or miſconduct, of thoſe intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the execution of them, fail of anſwering the noble purpoſes for which they were deſigned: We ſhall, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, point out ſome other methods by which the benefits of inoculation may be extended to the poor.</p>
                        <p>THERE is no doubt but inoculators will be daily more numerous. We would, therefore, have every pariſh in Britain, to allow one of them a ſmall annual ſalary for inoculating all the children of the pariſh at a proper age. Though ſome refractory perſons might for a while object to this method, they would ſoon be obliged to comply with it, or run the hazard of being reckoned the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their own children.</p>
                        <p>TWO things chiefly operate to prevent the progreſs of inoculation. The one is a wiſh to put the evil day as far off as poſſible. This is a principle in our nature; and as inoculation ſeems rather to be anticipating a future evil,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:012338_0170_0F88EA03125B91D8"/>
it is no wonder mankind are ſo averſe from it. But this objection is ſufficiently anſwered by the ſucceſs. Who, in his ſenſes, would not prefer a leſſer evil to-day, to a greater to-morrow, provided it were equally certain?</p>
                        <p>THE other obſtacle is the fear of reflections. This has very great weight with the bulk of mankind. Should the child die, they think the world would look down upon them. This they cannot bear. Here lies the difficulty which pinches, and till that be removed, inoculation will make but ſmall progreſs. Nothing can remove it but cuſtom. Make the practice faſhionable, and all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections at once vaniſh. It is faſhion alone that has led the multitude ſince the beginning of the world, and will lead them to the end. We muſt, therefore, call upon the more enlightened part of mankind, to ſet a pattern to the reſt. Their example, though it may, for ſome time, meet with oppoſition, muſt, at length, infallibly prevail.</p>
                        <p>I am aware of an objection to this practice, from the expence with which it may be attended; this is eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated. We do not mean that every pariſh ought to employ a Sutton, or a Dimſdale, as inoculators. Theſe have, by their ſucceſs, already recommended themſelves to crowned heads, and are beyond the vulgar reach; but have not others an equal chance to ſucceed? They certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have. Let them make the ſame trial, and the difficulties will ſoon vaniſh. There is not a pariſh, and hardly a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in Britain, deſtitute of ſome perſon who can bleed. But this is a far more difficult operation, and requires both more ſkill and time than inoculation.</p>
                        <p>THE perſons to whom we would chiefly recommend the performance of this operation are the clergy. Moſt of them know ſomething of medicine. Almoſt all of them bleed, and can order a purge; which are all the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary for the practice of inoculation. The prieſts among the leſs enlightened Indians perform this office; and why ſhould a Chriſtian teacher think himſelf above it? Surely the bodies of men, as well as their ſouls, merit a part of the paſtor's care; at leaſt, the greateſt Teacher who ever appeared among men ſeems to have thought ſo.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD all other methods fail, we would recommend it to parents to perform the operation themſelves. Let them take any method of communicating the diſeaſe they pleaſe, provided the ſubject be healthy, and of a proper age; and we may venture to warrant their ſucceſs. I have known
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:012338_0171_0F88EA03B2722F40"/>
many inſtances of parents performing the operation, and never ſo much as heard of one bad conſequence. A plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in one of the Weſt-India iſlands is ſaid to have inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with his own hand, in one year, three hundred of his ſlaves, who, notwithſtanding the warmth of the climate, and other unfavourable circumſtances, all did well. Common mechanics have often, to my knowledge, performed the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with as good ſucceſs as phyſicians. We do not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, mean to diſcourage thoſe, who have it in their power, from employing people of ſkill to inoculate their children, and attend them while under the diſeaſe, but only to ſhew, that where ſuch cannot be had, the operation ought not, upon that account, to be neglected.</p>
                        <p>INSTEAD of multiplying arguments to this effect, I ſhall juſt beg leave to mention the method I took with my own child, an only ſon. After giving him two gentle purges, I ordered the nurſe to take a bit of thread, which had been previouſly wet with freſh matter from a pock, and to lay it upon his arm, covering it with a piece of ſticking plaſter. This ſtaid on ſix or ſeven days, till it was rubbed off by accident. At the uſual time, the ſmall-pox made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and were exceedingly favourable. Sure this, which is all that is neceſſary, may be done without any ſkill in medicine.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt ſeaſon of the year for inoculation, is towards the end of the ſpring, and in the beginning of ſummer. It may, however, be done at any time of the year, if circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances render it neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper age for inoculation is betwixt two and five. Many diſagreeable circumſtances attend inoculating children upon the breaſt, which we have not time to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate. Neither ſhould the operation be too long delayed. When the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ibres begin to grow rigid, and children make uſe of groſſer food, the ſmall-pox become more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN, who have conſtitutional diſeaſes, muſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, be inoculated. It will often mend the habit of body; but ought to be performed at a time when they are moſt healthy. Accidental diſeaſes ſhould always be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved before inoculation.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt healthy ſtate is always to be choſen, as that muſt be the beſt preparation. The next ſtep is to regulate the diet for ſometime before the diſeaſe is communicated. In children great alteration in diet is ſeldom neceſſary, their food being
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:012338_0172_0F88EA03F8F519B8"/>
commonly of the the moſt ſimple and wholeſome kind; as milk, water pap, ſmall broths, bread, light pudding, mild roots, and white meats.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN, however, who have been accuſtomed to a hotter diet, who are of a groſs habit, or abound with bad humours, ought to be put upon a ſpare diet, before they be inoculated. Their food ſhould be of a light cooling nature; and, their drink, whey, butter-milk, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>WE would recommend no other medicinal preparation, but two or three mild purges, which ought to be ſuited to the age and ſtrength of the patient. It is, no doubt, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by purgative and mercurial medicines, to leſſen the eruption; but it very ſeldom happens, that the eruption, in this way, proves too great, and, we have always obſerved, that thoſe children who had a pretty free eruption, and where the pox filled well, enjoyed the beſt health after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                        <p>THE regimen, during the diſeaſe, muſt be the ſame as under the natural ſmall-pox. The patient muſt be kept cool, his diet muſt be light, and his drink weak and dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should any bad ſymptoms appear, which ſeldom happens, they muſt be treated in the ſame way as directed in the natural ſmall-pox. Purging is not leſs neceſſary, after the ſmall-pox by inoculation, than in the natural way, and ought, by no means, to be neglected.</p>

                        <p>THE meaſles appeared about the ſame time with the ſmall-pox, and are nearly related to that diſeaſe. They both came from the Eaſt, are both infectious, and ſeldom attack people more than once. The meaſles are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the ſpring ſeaſon, and generally diſappear in the ſummer. The diſeaſe itſelf, when properly managed, is ſeldom dangerous; but its conſequences are often fatal.</p>
                        <p>CAUSE.—This diſeaſe, like the ſmall-pox, proceeds from infection, and is more or leſs dangerous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtitution of the patient, the ſeaſon of the year, the climate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The meaſles, like other fevers, are preceded by alternate fits of heat and cold, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loſs of appetite. The tongue is white, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally moiſt. There is a ſhort cough, a heavineſs of the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:012338_0173_0F88EA04B9F27130"/>
head and eyes, drowſineſs, and running of the noſe. Sometimes, indeed, the cough does not come before the eruption. The eye-lids frequently ſwell ſo as to occaſion blindneſs. The patient generally complains of his throat; and vomiting or looſeneſs often precedes the eruption. The ſtools in children are commonly greeniſh; they complain of an itching of the ſkin, and are remarkably peeviſh. Bleeding at the noſe is common, both before and in the progreſs of the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>ABOUT the fourth day, ſmall ſpots, reſembling flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites, appear, firſt upon the face, then upon the breaſt, and, afterwards, on the extremities: Theſe may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the ſmall-pox, by their ſcarcely riſing above the ſkin. The fever, cough, and difficulty of breathing, inſtead of being removed by the eruption, as in the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, are rather increaſed; but the vomiting generally ceaſes.</p>
                        <p>ABOUT the ſixth day, the meaſles begin to grow dry on the face, and, afterwards, upon the body; ſo that by the ninth day they entirely diſappear. The fever, however, and difficulty of breathing, often continue, eſpecially if the patient has been kept upon too hot a regimen. Petechiae, or purple ſpots, may likewiſe be occaſioned by this error.</p>
                        <p>A violent looſeneſs ſometimes ſucceeds the meaſles, in which caſe the patient's life is in imminent danger.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as die of the meaſles generally expire about the ninth day, and are evidently carried off by a peripneumony, or inflammation of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt favourable ſymptoms are, a moderate looſeneſs, gentle ſweats, and a plentiful diſcharge of urine.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eruption ſuddenly falls in, and the patient is ſeized with a delirium, he is in the greateſt danger. If the meaſles turn of a pale colour, it is an unfavourable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as are alſo, great weakneſs, vomiting, reſtleſſneſs, and difficulty of ſwallowing. Purple, or black ſpots, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing among the meaſles, are very unfavourable. When a continual cough, with hoarſeneſs, ſucceeds the diſeaſe, there is reaſon to ſuſpect an approaching conſumption of the lungs.</p>
                        <p>OUR buſineſs in this diſeaſe is to aſſiſt nature, if her ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts be too languid, in throwing out the morbid matter, by proper cordials; but when they are too violent, they muſt be reſtrained by evacuations, and cool diluting liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ought, likewiſe, to endeavour to appeaſe the
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:012338_0174_0F88EA0570758C50"/>
moſt urgent ſymptoms, as the cough, reſtleſſneſs, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The regimen in this diſeaſe ſhould be of the ſame kind with that recommended in the ſmall-pox, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> cooling and diluting. Acids, however, do not anſwer ſo well here as in the ſmall-pox, as they tend to exaſperate the cough. Small beer, likewiſe, though a good drink in the ſmall-pox, is here improper. The moſt ſuitable liquors are decoctions of liquorice, with marſh-mallow roots, and ſarſaparilla; infuſions of linſeed, or of the flowers of elder with milk, clarified whey, barley water, and ſuch like. Theſe, if the belly be bound, may be ſweetened with honey; or, if that ſhould diſagree with the ſtomach, a little manna may occaſionally be added to them.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—The meaſles being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diſeaſe, without any critical diſcharge of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in the ſmall-pox, bleeding is commonly neceſſary, eſpecially when the fever runs high, with difficulty of breathing, and great oppreſſion of the breaſt. But if the diſeaſe be of a mild kind, bleeding may be omitted.</p>
                        <p>BATHING the feet and legs in lukewarm water, both tends to abate the violence of the fever, and to promote the eruption.</p>
                        <p>THE patient is often greatly relieved by vomiting. When there is a tendency this way, it ought not to be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but encouraged, by drinking lukewarm water, or weak camomile tea.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the cough is very troubleſome, with dryneſs of the throat, and difficulty of breathing, it will greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the patient, if he holds his head over the ſteam of warm water, and draws the ſteam into his lungs.</p>
                        <p>HE may likewiſe lick a little ſpermaceti and ſugar-can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pounded together; or take now and then a ſpoonful of the oil of ſweet-almonds, with ſugar-candy diſſolved in it. Theſe will ſoften the throat, and relieve the tickling cough.</p>
                        <p>IN caſe the meaſles ſhould ſuddenly diſappear, it will be neceſſary to purſue the ſame method which we have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended when the ſmall-pox fall in. The patient muſt be ſupported with wine and cordials. Bliſtering plaſters muſt be applied to the extremities, and the body rubbed all over with warm flannels. Warm poultices may, likewiſe, be applied to the feet, and palms of the hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="171" facs="unknown:012338_0175_0F88EA0637646F68"/>
WHEN purple, or black ſpots appear, the patient's drink ſhould be ſharpened with ſpirits of vitriol; and, if the putrid ſymptoms run high, the Jeſuits bark muſt be adminiſtered in the ſame manner as directed in the ſmall-pox.</p>
                        <p>OPIATES are ſometimes neceſſary, but ſhould never be given except in caſe of extreme reſtleſſneſs, a violent looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or when the cough is very troubleſome. For chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the ſyrup of poppies is ſufficient. A tea ſpoonful or two may be occaſionally given, according to the patient's age, or the violence of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the meaſles are gone off, purging is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. This may be conducted in the ſame manner as directed in the ſmall-pox.</p>
                        <p>IF a violent looſeneſs ſucceeds the meaſles, it may be checked by taking, for ſome days, a gentle doſe of rhubarb in the morning, and an opiate over night; but, if theſe do not remove it, bleeding will ſeldom fail to have that effect.</p>
                        <p>PATIENTS recovering after the meaſles, ſhould be very careful what they eat or drink. Their food, for ſome time, ſhould be light, and in ſmall quantities, and their drink diluting, and rather of an opening nature; as butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk, whey, and ſuch like. They ought, alſo, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of expoſing themſelves to the cold air, leſt a ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting catarrh, an aſthma, or a conſumption of the lungs ſhould enſue.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD a cough, with difficulty of breathing, and other ſymptoms of a conſumption, remain after the meaſles, we would recommend ſmall quantities of blood to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently let at proper intervals, as the patient's ſtrength and conſtitution will bear. He ought, likewiſe, to drink aſſes milk, to remove to a free air, if neceſſary, and to ride daily on horſeback. He muſt keep cloſe to a diet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of milk and vegetables; and, laſtly, if theſe do not ſucceed, let him remove to a warmer climate.</p>

                        <head>OF THE SCARLET FEVER.</head>
                        <p>THE ſcarlet fever is ſo called from the colour of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's ſkin, which appears as if it were tinged with red wine. It happens at any ſeaſon of the year, but is moſt common in the latter end of ſummer; at which time it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeizes whole families, eſpecially children.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="172" facs="unknown:012338_0176_0F88EA06F8DC3A88"/>
IT begins with coldneſs and ſhivering, as in other fevers, without any violent ſickneſs. Afterwards the ſkin is covered with red ſpots, which are broader, more florid, and leſs uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form than the meaſles. They continue two or three days, and then diſappear; after which the cuticle, or ſcarf-ſkin, falls off.</p>
                        <p>THERE is ſeldom any occaſion for medicine in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The patient ought, however, to keep within doors, to abſtain from fleſh, ſtrong liquors, and cordials, and to take plenty of cool diluting drink. If the fever be high, the belly muſt be kept gently open by emollient clyſters, or ſmall doſes of nitre and rhubarb. A ſcruple of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, with five grains of the latter, may be taken thrice a-day, or oftener, if neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN, and young perſons, are ſometimes ſeized, at the beginning of this diſeaſe, with a kind of ſtupor, and epileptic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>AFTER the fever is gone off, the patient ought to be purged once or twice.</p>

                        <head>OF THE ERYSIPELAS, OR ST. ANTHONY's FIRE.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe, which in many parts of Britain is called <hi>the roſe,</hi> attack perſons at all periods of life, but is moſt common between the age of thirty and forty. Perſons of a ſanguine or plethoric habit, are moſt liable to it. It often attacks young people, and pregnant women; and ſuch as have once been afflicted with it, are very liable to have it again. Sometimes it is a primary diſeaſe, and, at other times only a ſymptom of ſome other malady. Every part of the body is liable to be attacked by an eryſipelas, but it moſt frequently ſeizes the legs or face, eſpecially the latter. It prevails moſt in autumn, or when hot weather is ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cold and wet.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The eriſipelas is frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by violent paſſions or affections of the mind; as, fear, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is likewiſe occaſioned by cold. When the body has been heated to a great degree, and is immediately expoſed to the cold air, ſo that the perſpiration is ſuddenly checked, an eryſipelas will often enſue. It
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:012338_0177_0F88EA07AC5E46C0"/>
may alſo be occaſioned by exceſs of ſtrong liquor, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing too long in a warm bath, or by any thing that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heats the blood. If any of the natural evacuations be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, or in too ſmall a quantity, it may cauſe an ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas. The ſame effect will follow from a ſtoppage of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial evacuations; as, iſſues, ſetons or the like.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The eryſipelas attacks with a violent ſhaking, heat, thirſt, loſs of ſtrength, pain in the head and back, reſtleſſneſs, and a quick pulſe; to which may be added, vomiting, and ſometimes a delirium. On the ſecond, third, or fourth day, the part ſwells, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes red, and ſmall puſtules appear; at which time the fever generally abates.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eryſipelas ſeizes the foot, the parts contiguous ſwell, the ſkin ſhines; and, if the pain be violent, it will aſcend to the leg, and will not bear to be touched.</p>
                        <p>WHEN it attacks the face, it ſwells, appears red, and the ſkin is covered with ſmall puſtules, filled with clear water. One or both eyes are generally cloſed with the ſwelling; and there is a difficulty of breathing. If the mouth or noſtrils be very dry, and the patient drowſy, there is reaſon to expect an inflammation of the brain.</p>
                        <p>IF the eryſipelas effects the breaſt, it ſwells, and becomes exceedingly hard, with great pain, and is apt to ſuppurate.</p>
                        <p>THERE is a violent pain in the armpit on the ſide affected, where an abſceſs is often formed.</p>
                        <p>THERE is a kind of eryſipelas, which in ſome parts of Britain goes by the name of the <hi>ring worm.</hi> It frequently attacks children about the region of the navel, where it ſurrounds the body like a girdle, and is not without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                        <p>THE event of this diſeaſe depends greatly upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the patient. It is ſeldom dangerous; yet I have known it prove fatal to people in the decline of life, who were of a ſcorbutic habit, or whoſe humours were vitiated by irregular living, or unwholeſome diet.</p>
                        <p>IF, in a day or two, the ſwelling ſubſides, the heat and pain ceaſe, the roſy colour turns yellow, and the cuticle breaks and falls off in ſcales, the danger is over.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eryſipel as is large, deep, and affects a very ſenſible part of the body, the danger is great. If the red colour changes into black or blue, it will end in a mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Sometimes the inflammation cannot be diſcuſſed, but comes to ſuppuration; in which caſe, ſiſtulas, a gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:012338_0178_0F88EA09D31BB558"/>

or mortification, generally enſue. Where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was bad, I have frequently ſeen the leg ſwell to a prodigious ſize, and the cure prove extremely difficult.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as die of this diſeaſe, are moſtly carried off by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ever, which is attended with difficulty of breathing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a delirium, and great drowſineſs. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally die about the ſeventh or eighth day.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—In this diſeaſe the patient muſt neither be kept too hot nor cold, as either of theſe extremes will tend to make the diſeaſe retreat, which is always to be guarded againſt. When the diſeaſe is mild, it will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep the patient within doors, without confining him to his bed, and to promote the perſpiration by diluting liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE diet ought to be very ſpare, and of a moderately cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moiſtening quality; as groat gruel, panada, ſmall chicken or barley broth, with cooling herbs and fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> avoiding fleſh, fiſh, ſtrong drink, ſpices, pickles, and all other things that may heat and inflame the blood; the drink may be barley water, an infuſion of elder flowers, common whey, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>BUT if the pulſe be low, and the ſpirits ſunk, the patient muſt be ſupported with ſmall negas and other things of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial nature. His food may be ſago gruel with a little wine, and nouriſhing broths, taken in ſmall quantities, and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. Great care, however, muſt be had not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heat him.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—In this diſeaſe much miſchief is often done by medicine, eſpecially external applications. People, when they ſee an inflammation, immediately think of ſome external applications. Theſe, indeed, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in large phlegmons; but, in an eryſipelas, the ſafer courſe is to apply nothing. Almoſt all ointments, ſalves and plaſters, are of a greaſy nature, and tend rather to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and repel, than promote any diſcharge from the part. At the beginning of this diſeaſe, it is neither ſafe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a ſuppuration, nor to repel the matter too quickly. The eryſipelas, in many reſpects, reſembles the gout, and is to be treated with the greateſt caution. Fine wool, or very ſoft flannel, are the ſafeſt applications to the part. Theſe not only defend it from the external air, but likewiſe promote the perſpiration, which has a great tendency to carry off the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="175" facs="unknown:012338_0179_0F88EA0B661874E8"/>
IT is a common thing to bleed in the eryſipelas; but this likewiſe requires caution. If, however, the fever be high, the pulſe hard and ſtrong, and the patient vigorous, it will be proper to bleed; but the quantity muſt be regulated by theſe circumſtances, and the operation repeated or not, as the ſymptoms may require. If the patient has been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to ſtrong liquors, and the diſeaſe attacks his head, bleeding is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>BATHING the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water, when the diſeaſe attacks the face or brain, has an excellent effect. It tends to draw the humours of the head towards the inferior extremities, and ſeldom fails to relieve the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. When bathing proves ineffectual, poultices, or ſharp ſinapiſms, may be applied to the ſoles of the feet for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>IN caſes where bleeding is requiſite, it is likewiſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to keep the belly gently open. This may be effected by emollient clyſters, or ſmall doſes of nitre and rhubarb, ſuch as are preſcribed in the foregoing diſeaſe. Some, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, recommend very large doſes of nitre in this caſe; but nitre ſeldom ſits eaſy on the ſtomach when taken in large quantities. It is, however, one of the beſt medicines in this caſe; and, when the fever and inflammation run high, half a dram of it may be taken in the patient's ordinary drink, three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>THE ſaline julep, as it is called, is likewiſe a very proper medicine in the eryſipelatous fever. It may be made by diſſolving two drams of ſalt of wormwood, or ſalt of tartar, in three ounces of freſh lemon juice, to which may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, two ounces of common water, and an ounce or two of peppermint water, with as much white ſugar as will render it agreeable. Of this two table ſpoonfuls may be taken every two or three hours.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eryſipelas leaves the extremities, and ſeizes the head, ſo as to occaſion a delirium, or ſtupor, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to open the belly. If clyſters and mild purgatives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ail to have that effect, ſtronger ones muſt be given. Bliſtering plaſters muſt, likewiſe, be applied to the neck, or behind the ears, and ſharp cataplaſms laid to the ſoles of the feet.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the eryſipelas cannot be diſcuſſed, and the pain lies deep, and ſeems to reach to the membrane which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the bones, and the part has a tendency to ulcerate, it will then be proper to promote ſuppuration, which may
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:012338_0180_0F88EA0B79390C40"/>
be done by the application of ripening poultices, with ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, warm fomentations, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the black, livid, or blue colour of the part, ſhews a tendency to mortification, the Jeſuits bark muſt be adminiſtered. It may be taken along with acids, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the ſmall-pox, or in any other form more agreeable to the patient. It muſt not, however, be trifled with, as the patient's life is at ſtake. Half a dram may be taken every two hours, or oftener, if the ſymptoms be threatening, and cloths dipped in warm camphorated ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of wine, or the tincture of myrrh and aloes, may be applied to the part, and frequently renewed.</p>
                        <p>IN what is commonly the ſcorbutic eryſipelas, which continues for a conſiderable time, it will only be neceſſary to give gentle laxatives, and ſuch things as purify the blood. Medicines which promote the perſpiration are likewiſe proper. Thus, after the inflammation has been checked by opening medicines, a decoction of the ſudorific woods, as ſaſſafras and guaiacum, with liquorice root, may be drank, and afterwards a courſe of bitters, which will both ſtrengthen the ſtomach, and purify the blood.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as are liable to frequent attacks of the eryſipelas, ought carefully to guard againſt all violent paſſions; to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſtrong liquors, and all fat, viſcid, and highly nouriſhing food. They ſhould take abundance of exerciſe, carefully avoiding the extremes of heat or cold. Their food ſhould conſiſt chiefly of milk, and ſuch fruits, herbs, and roots, as are of a cooling quality; and their drink ought to be ſmall beer, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, butter-milk, and ſuch like. They ſhould never ſuffer themſelves to be too long coſtive. If that cannot be prevented by diet alone, it will be proper to take frequently a gentle doſe of rhubarb and cream of tartar, the lenitive electuary, or ſome other mild purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

                        <p>THIS is ſometimes a primary diſeaſe, but oftener only a ſymptom of ſome other malady; as the inflammatory, eruptive, or ſpotted fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is very common, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as a primary diſeaſe in warm climates, and is moſt incident to perſons about the prime and vigour of life.

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe whoſe nervous ſyſtem is weak, are very liable to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="177" facs="unknown:012338_0181_0F88EA0C2EF2D068"/>
CAUSES.—This diſeaſe is often occaſioned by night-watching, eſpecially when joined with hard ſtudy: It, likewiſe, proceeds from hard drinking, from anger, grief, or anxiety. It may, alſo, be occaſioned by a ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, or the ſtoppage of uſual evacuations; as the bleeding piles in men, the cuſtomary diſcharges of women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such as imprudently expoſe themſelves to the heat of the ſun, eſpecially by ſleeping without doors, in a hot ſeaſon, with their heads uncovered, are often ſuddenly ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an inflammation of the brain, ſo as to awake quite delirious. When repellents are imprudently uſed in an eryſipelas, an inflammation of the brain is often the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It may, likewiſe, be occaſioned by external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, as blows, or bruiſes upon the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The ſymptoms which precede a true inflammation of the brain are, pain of the head, redneſs of the eyes, a violent fluſhing of the face, diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſleep, or a total want of it, great dryneſs of the ſkin, coſtiveneſs, a retention of urine, a ſmall dropping of blood from the noſe, ſinging of the ears, and extreme ſenſibility of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the inflammation is formed, the ſymptoms, in general are ſimilar to thoſe of the inflammatory fever. The pulſe, indeed, is often weak, irregular, and trembling; but, ſometimes, it is hard and contracted. When the brain itſelf is inflamed, the pulſe is always ſoft and low; but when the inflammation only affects the integuments of the brain, it is hard. A remarkable quickneſs of hearing, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſymptom of this diſeaſe; but that ſeldom continues long. Another uſual ſymptom is, a great throbbing or pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the arteries of the neck and temples. The tongue is often black and dry; yet the patient ſeldom complains of thirſt, and even refuſes drink. The mind chiefly runs after ſuch objects as have before made a deep impreſſion upon it; and, ſometimes, from a ſullen ſilence, the patient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all of a ſudden quite outrageous.</p>
                        <p>A conſtant trembling and ſtarting of the tendons, is an unfavourable ſymptom, as alſo, a ſuppreſſion of the urine; a total want of ſleep; a conſtant ſpitting; a grinding of the teeth, which muſt be conſidered as a kind of convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When this diſeaſe ſucceeds an inflammation of the lungs, of the inteſtines, or of the throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is owing to a tranſlation of the morbific matter from theſe parts to the brain, and generally proves fatal. Hence we learn the neceſſity of proper evacuations, and the danger of repellents in all inflammatory diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="178" facs="unknown:012338_0182_0F88EA0D061CE930"/>
THE favourable ſymptoms are, a free perſpiration or ſweating, a copious diſcharge of blood from the noſe, the bleeding piles, a plentiful diſcharge of urine, which lets fall a copious ſediment. Sometimes the diſeaſe is carried off by a looſeneſs, and in women by an exceſſive flow of the <hi>menſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>AS this diſeaſe often proves fatal in a few days, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the moſt ſpeedy applications. When it is prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or improperly treated, it ſometimes ends in madneſs, or a kind of ſtupidity, which continues for life.</p>
                        <p>IN the cure, two things are chiefly to be attended to, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> to leſſen the quantity of blood in the brain, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the circulation towards the head.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The patient ought to be kept very quiet. Company, noiſe, and every thing that affects the ſenſes, or diſturbs the imagination, increaſes the diſeaſe. Even too much light is hurtful; for which reaſon, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's chamber ought to be a little darkened, and he ſhould neither be kept too hot nor cold. It is not, however, neceſſary to exclude the company of an agreeable friend, as this has a tendency to ſooth and quiet the mind. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould the patient be kept too much in the dark, leſt it ſhould occaſion a gloomy melancholy, which is too often the conſequence of this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>THE patient muſt, as far as poſſible, be ſoothed and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured in every thing. Contradiction will ruffle his mind, and increaſe his malady. Even when he calls for things which are not to be obtained, or which might prove hurtful, he is not to be poſitively denied them, but rather put off with the promiſe of having them as ſoon as they can be obtained, or by ſome other excuſe. A little of any thing that the mind is ſet upon, though not quite proper, will hurt the patient leſs than a poſitive refuſal. In a word, whatever the patient is fond of, or uſed to be delighted with when in health, may here be tried, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtories, ſoft muſic, or whatever has a tendency to ſooth the paſſions, and compoſe the mind. Boerhaave pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ſeveral mechanical experiments for this purpoſe; as the ſoft noiſe of water diſtilling by drops into a baſon, and the patient trying to reckon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Any uniform ſound, if low and continued, has a tendency to procure ſleep, and, conſequently, may be of ſervice.</p>
                        <p>THE aliment ought to be light, of farinaceous ſubſtances; as panado, and water gruel, ſharpened with jelly of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:012338_0183_0F88EA0DB339FBB0"/>

                        <p>MEDICINES.—In an inflammation of the brain, nothing more certainly relieves the patient than a free diſcharge of blood from the noſe. When this comes of its own accord, it is by no means to be ſtopped, but promoted, by applying cloths dipped in warm water to the part. When bleeding at the noſe does not happen ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, it may be provoked by putting a ſtraw, or any other ſharp body up the noſtril.</p>
                        <p>BLEEDING in the temporal arteries greatly relieves the head; but as this operation cannot be generally performed, we would recommend in its ſtead bleeding in the jugular veins. When the patient's pulſe and ſpirits are ſo low, that he cannot bear bleeding with the lancet, leeches may be applied to the temples. Theſe not only draw off the blood more gradually, but by being applied nearer to the part affected, generally give more immediate relief.</p>
                        <p>A diſcharge of blood from the haemorrhoidal veins is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of great ſervice, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, by all means, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. If the patient has been ſubject to the bleeding piles, and that diſcharge has been ſtopped, every method muſt be tried to reſtore it; as the application of leeches to the parts, ſitting over the ſteams of warm water, ſharp cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or ſuppoſitories made of honey, aloes, and rock ſalt.</p>
                        <p>IF the inflammation of the brain be occaſioned by the ſtoppage of any evacuation, either natural or artificial, as the menſes, iſſues, ſetons, or ſuch like, all means muſt be uſed to reſtore it as ſoon as poſſible, or to ſubſtitute ſome other in its ſtead.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be coſtive, his belly muſt be kept open by emollient clyſters, or gentle purgatives; as manna, rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, cream of tartar, or ſuch like. Theſe may either be given ſeparately or together in ſmall doſes, and repeated as there may be occaſion.</p>
                        <p>SMALL quantities of nitre ought frequently to be mixed with the patient's drink. Two drams, or more, if the caſe be dangerous, may be uſed every twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>THE head ſhould be ſhaven, and frequently rubbed with vinegar and roſe water a little warm. Cloths dipped in it may likewiſe be applied to the temples.</p>

                        <head>OF THE INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may be occaſioned by external injuries; as ſtrokes, duſt thrown into the eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is often cauſed by the ſtoppage of cuſtomary evacuations; as the healing of old ſores, drying up of iſſues, or the like. Nothing more certainly brings on an inflammation of the eyes, than the ſuppreſſion of gentle morning ſweats, or the ſweating of the feet. Long expoſure to the night air, eſpecially in cold northerly winds, or whatever ſuddenly checks the perſpiration, eſpecially after the body has been much heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is very apt to cauſe an inflammation of the eyes. View<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnow or other white bodies for a long time, or looking ſtedfaſtly at the ſun, a clear fire, or any bright object, will likewiſe occaſion this malady. A ſudden tranſition from darkneſs to very bright light, will often have the ſame effect.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING more certainly occaſions an inflammation of the eyes than night watching eſpecially reading or writing by candle light. Drinking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

The acrid fumes of metals, and of ſeveral kinds of fuel, are likewiſe very perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Sometimes an inflammation of the eyes proceeds from a venereal taint, and often from a ſcrophulous or gouty habit. It may likewiſe be occaſioned by hairs in the eye-lids turning inwards, and hurting the eyes. Sometimes the diſeaſe is epidemic, eſpecially after wet ſeaſons; and I have frequently known it prove infectious, particularly to thoſe who lived in the ſame houſe with the patient. It may be occaſioned by moiſt air, or living in low, damp houſes, eſpecially where people are not accuſtomed to ſuch ſituations. In children, it often proceeds from imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drying up of ſcabbed heads, a running behind the ears, or any other diſcharge of the ſame nature<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> Inflammations of the eyes often ſucceed the ſmall-pox, or meaſles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in children of a ſcrophulous habit.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—An inflammation of the eyes is attended with acute pain, heat, redneſs, and ſwelling. The patient is not able to bear the light, and ſometimes he feels a pricking pain, as if his eyes were pierced with a
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:012338_0185_0F88EA0FED5EF1C8"/>
thorn. Sometimes he imagines his eyes are full of motes, or thinks he ſees flies dancing before him, the eyes are fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a ſcalding rheum, which ruſhes forth in great quantities, whenever the patient attempts to look up. The pulſe is generally quick and hard, with ſome degree of fever. When the diſeaſe is violent, the neighbouring parts ſwell, and there is a throbbing or pulſation in the temporal arteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſlight inflammation of the eyes, eſpecially from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe, is eaſily cured; but when the diſeaſe is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and continues long, it leaves ſpecks upon the eyes, or dimneſs of ſight, and ſometimes total blindneſs.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be ſeized with a looſeneſs, it has a good effect; and when the inflammation paſſes from one eye to another, as it were by infection, it is no unfavourable ſymptom. When the diſeaſe is accompanied with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain of the head, and continues long, the patient is in great danger of loſing his ſight.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The diet, unleſs in ſcrophulous caſes, can hardly be too ſpare, eſpecially at the beginning. The patient muſt abſtain from every thing of a heating na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His food muſt conſiſt chiefly of mild vegetables, weak broths, and gruels. His drink may be barley water, balm tea, common whey, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's chamber muſt be darkened, or his eyes ſhaded by a green cover, ſo as to exclude the light, but not to preſs upon the eyes. He ſhould not look at a candle, the fire, or any luminous object; and ought to avoid all ſmoke, as the fumes of tobacco, or any thing that may cauſe cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſneezing, or vomiting. He ſhould be kept quiet, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all violent efforts, either of body or mind, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging ſleep, as much as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—This is one of thoſe diſeaſes wherein great hurt is done by external applications. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every perſon pretends to be poſſeſſed of a remedy for the cure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ore eyes. Theſe remedies generally conſiſt of eye-waters and ointments, with other external applications. All which do miſchief twenty times for once they do good. People ought, therefore, to be very cautious how they uſe ſuch things, as the very preſſure upon the eyes often increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the malady.</p>
                        <p>BLEEDING, in a violent inflammation of the eyes, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary. This ſhould be performed as near the part affected as poſſible. An adult may loſe ten or twelve ounces
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:012338_0186_0F88EA11179F5530"/>
of blood from the jugular vein, and the operation may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated according to the urgency of the ſymptoms. If it be not, however, convenient to bleed in the neck, the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity may be let from the arm, or any other part of the body.</p>
                        <p>LEECHES are often applied to the temples, or under the eyes with good effect. The wounds muſt be ſuffered to bleed for ſome hours, and if the bleeding ſtop ſoon, it may be promoted by the application of cloths dipt in warm water. In obſtinate caſes, it will be neceſſary to repeat this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral times.</p>
                        <p>OPENING and diluting medicines are by no means to be neglected. The patient may take a ſmall doſe of Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's ſalts and cream of tartar, every ſecond or third day, or a decoction of tamarinds with ſenna. If theſe be not agreeable, gentle doſes of rhubarb and nitre, a little of the lenitive electuary, or any other mild purgative, will anſwer the ſame end. The patient, at the ſame time, muſt drink freely of water gruel, tea, or any other weak diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. He ought likewiſe to take, at bed-time, a large draught of very weak wine whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, in order to promote per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. His feet and legs muſt frequently be bathed in lukewarm water, and his head ſhaved twice or thrice a-week, and afterwards waſhed in cold water. This has a remarkable good effect.</p>
                        <p>AFTER theſe evacuations have been continued for ſome time, if the inflammation does not yield to them, bliſtering plaſters muſt be applied behind the ears, to the temples, or upon the neck, and kept open for ſome time by the mild bliſtering ointment. I never knew theſe, if long enough kept open, fail to remove the moſt obſtinate inflammation of the eyes; but, for this purpoſe it is often neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the diſcharge for ſeveral weeks.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe has been of long ſtanding, I have ſeen very extraordinary effects from a ſeton in the neck, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſhoulders, eſpecially the latter. It ſhould be put upwards and downwards, or in the direction of the ſpine, and in the middle between the ſhoulder-blades. It may be dreſſed twice a-day with yellow baſilicon. I have known patients, who had been blind for ſeveral months, recover ſight by means of a ſeton betwixt the ſhoulders. When the ſeton is put a-croſs the neck, it ſoon wears out, and is both more painful and troubleſome than between the ſhoulders; beſides, it leaves a diſagreeable mark, and does not diſcharge ſo freely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="183" facs="unknown:012338_0187_0F88EA117826AA10"/>
WHEN the heat and pain of the eyes is very great, a ſoft poultice of bread and milk, with plenty of ſweet oil or freſh butter, may be applied to them, at leaſt all night; and they may be bathed with lukewarm milk and water every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient cannot ſleep, which is ſometimes the caſe, he muſt take ten or twelve drops or laudanum, or two ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of the ſyrup of poppies, over night, more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his age, or the violence of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the inflammation is gone off, if the eyes ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main weak and tender, they may be bathed every night and morning with cold water and a little brandy, ſix parts of the former to one of the latter. A method ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived by which the eyes can be quite immerſed in the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and water, where they ſhould be kept for ſome minutes. I have generally ſound this as good a ſtrengthener of the eyes as any of the moſt celebrated collyriums.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an inflammation of the eyes proceeds from a ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous habit, it generally proves very obſtinate. In this caſe the patient's diet muſt not be too low, and he may be allowed to drink ſmall negas, or now and then a glaſs of wine. The moſt proper medicine is the Jeſuits bark, which may either be given in ſubſtance, or prepared in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>TAKE an ounce of Jeſuits bark in powder, with two drams of Winter's bark, and boil them in an Engliſh quart of water to a pint; when it has boiled nearly long enough, add half an ounce of liquorice root ſliced. Let the liquor be ſtrained. Two, three, or four table ſpoonfuls, according to the age of the patient, may be taken three or four times a-day. It is impoſſible to ſay how long this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhould be continued, as the cure is ſooner performed in ſome than others; but, in general, it requires a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time to produce any laſting effects.</p>
                        <p>DR. Cheyne ſays, "That aethiops mineral never fails in inflammations of the eyes, even ſcrophulous ones, if given in a ſufficient doſe, and perſiſted in for a ſufficient time." Both this and other mercurial preparations, are no doubt proper when the diſeaſe proves obſtinate; more eſpecially, when there is reaſon to ſuſpect that it may proceed from a venereal taint; but as theſe medicines can never be ſafely adminiſtered unleſs under the direction of a phyſician, we ſhall omit ſpecifying their particular doſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="184" facs="unknown:012338_0188_0F88EA1317665F28"/>
IT will be proper frequently to look into the eyes, to ſee if any hairs be turned inwards, or preſſing upon them, in order that they may be cut off without delay.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as are liable to frequent returns of this diſeaſe, ought conſtantly to have an iſſue in one or both arms. Bleeding or purging in the ſpring and autumn, will be very beneficial to ſuch perſons. They ought likewiſe to live re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, avoiding ſtrong liquor, and every thing of a heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality.

                        <head>OF THE QUINSEY, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE THROAT.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe is very common in Britain, and is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attended with great danger. It prevails in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſpring, and is moſt fatal to young people of a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine or plethoric habit.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—In general, it proceeds from the ſame cauſes as other inflammatory fevers, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> an obſtructed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or whatever heats or inflames the blood. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the throat is often occaſioned by omitting ſome part of the covering uſually worn about the neck, by drinking cold liquor when the body is warm, by riding or walking againſt a cold northerly wind, or any thing that greatly cools the throat, and parts adjacent. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proceed from the neglect of bleeding, purging, or any cuſtomary evacuation.</p>
                        <p>SINGING, ſpeaking loud and long, or whatever ſtrains the throat, may likewiſe cauſe an inflammation of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. I have often known the quinſey prove fatal to jovial companions, after ſitting long in a warm room, drinking hot liquors and ſinging with vehemence; eſpecially, when they were ſo imprudent as afterwards to go abroad in the cold night air. Sitting with wet feet, or keeping on wet cloaths, are very apt to occaſion this malady. It is likewiſe frequently occaſioned by continuing long in a moiſt place, ſleeping in a damp bed, ſitting in a room that has been newly plaſtered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know people who never fail to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their throat after ſitting but a very ſhort while in a room that has been lately waſhed.</p>
                        <p>ACRID or irritating food may likewiſe inflame the throat, and occaſion a quinſey. It may alſo proceed from bones, pins, or other ſharp ſubſtances ſticking in the throat, or
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:012338_0189_0F88EA13AB597150"/>
from the cauſtic fumes of metals or minerals, as arſenic, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taken in by the breath. This diſeaſe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times epidemic and infectious.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The inflammation of the throat is evident from inſpection, the parts appearing red and ſwelled; beſides, the patient complains of pain in ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing. His pulſe is quick and hard, with other ſymptoms of a fever. If blood be let, it is generally covered with a tough coat of a whitiſh colour, and the patient ſpits a tough phlegm. As the ſwelling and inflammation increaſe, the breathing and ſwallowing become the more difficult, the pain affects the ears; the eyes generally appear red, and the face ſwells. The patient is often obliged to keep himſelf in an erect poſture, being in danger of ſuffocation; there is a conſtant nauſea, or inclination to vomit, and the drink, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of paſſing into the ſtomach, is often returned by the noſe. The patient is frequently ſtarved at laſt, merely from an inability of ſwallowing any kind of nouriſhment. When the breathing is performed with a hiſſing noiſe, and the pulſe begins to intermit, death is at hand.</p>
                        <p>AS ſeveral of the organs neceſſary for life are affected by this diſeaſe, it can never be without danger; no time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be loſt in attempting to remove it, as a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay often renders it incurable.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the breathing is laborious, with ſtraitneſs of the breaſt and anxiety, the danger is great. Though the pain of ſwallowing be very great, yet while the patient breathes eaſy, there is not ſo much danger. An external ſwelling is no unfavourable ſymptom; but if it ſuddenly falls, and the morbific matter is thrown upon the breaſt, the danger is very great. When a quinſey is the conſequence of ſome other diſeaſe, which has already weakened the patient, his ſituation is dangerous. A frothing at the mouth, with a ſwelled tongue, a pale ghaſtly countenance, and coldneſs of the extremities, are fatal ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The regimen in this diſeaſe is in all reſpects the ſame as in the pleuriſy or peripneumony. The food muſt be light, and in ſmall quantity, and the drink plentiful, weak, and diluting, mixed with acids.</p>
                        <p>IT is highly neceſſary, in this diſeaſe, that the patient be kept eaſy and quiet. Violent paſſions of the mind, or great efforts of the body, may prove fatal. He ſhould not even attempt to ſpeak but in a low voice. Such a degree of warmth as to promote a conſtant gentle ſweat is proper. When the
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:012338_0190_0F88EA15A10CCCD8"/>
patient is in bed, his head ought to be raiſed a little higher than uſual.</p>
                        <p>IT is peculiarly neceſſary that the throat be kept warm; for which purpoſe ſeveral folds of ſoft flannel may be wrapt round the neck: That alone will often remove a ſlight complaint of the throat, eſpecially if applied in due time. We cannot here omit obſerving the propriety of a cuſtom which prevails amongſt the peaſants of this country; when they feel any uneaſineſs of the throat, they wrap a ſtocking about it all night. So effectual is this remedy, that, in many places, it paſſes for a charm, and the ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is applied with particular ceremonies: The cuſtom, however, is undoubtedly a good one, and ſhould never be neglected. When the throat has been thus wrapt up all night, it muſt not be expoſed to the cold air through the day, but a handkerchief, or a piece of flannel, kept about it, till the inflammation be gone.</p>
                        <p>THE jelly of black currants is a medicine very much in eſteem for complaints of the throat; and indeed the whole <hi>materia medica</hi> cannot afford a better. It ſhould be almoſt conſtantly kept in the mouth, and ſwallowed down leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It may likewiſe be mixed in the patient's drink, or taken any other way. When it cannot be obtained, the red currant jelly, or the mulberry, may be uſed in its ſtead.</p>
                        <p>GARGIES for the throat are likewiſe very beneficial. They may be made by adding to half an Engliſh pint of the pectoral decoction mentioned in page 110, two or three ſpoonfuls of honey, and the ſame quantity of currant jelly. This may be uſed three or four times a-day; and, if the patient be troubled with tough viſcid phlegm, the gargle may be made more ſharp and cleanſing, by adding to it a tea ſpoonful of the ſpirits of <hi>ſal ammoniac.</hi> Some recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend gargles made of a decoction of the leaves or bark of the blackberry buſh; but where the jelly can be had, theſe are unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>THERE is no diſeaſe wherein the benefits of bathing the feet and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>MEDICINE.—An inflammation of the throat being one of the moſt acute and dangerous diſtempers, which ſometimes takes off the patient in a few hours, the moſt early remedies are, with the greateſt care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to be adminiſtered. In the very firſt attack, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when it is violent, it will be proper to bleed in the arm, or rather in the jugular vein, and to repeat the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration if the ſymptoms require.</p>
                        <p>THE belly ſhould likewiſe be gently opened. This may either be done by giving the patient for his ordinary drink a decoction of figs and tamarinds, or ſmall doſes of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and nitre, as recommended in page 172. Theſe may be increaſed according to the age of the patient, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till they have the deſired effect.</p>
                        <p>I have often known very good effects from a bit of <hi>ſal prunel,</hi> or purified nitre, held in the mouth, and ſwllowed down as it melted. This promotes the diſcharge of <hi>ſaliva,</hi> by which means it anſwers the end of a gargle, while, at the ſame time, it cools the blood, by promoting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE throat ought, likewiſe, to be rubbed twice or thrice a-day with a little of the volatile liniment. This may be made by taking an ounce of oil of ſweet almonds, and half an ounce of ſpirit of hartſhorn, and ſhaking them together in a vial till they be united. I do not remember ever to have ſeen this fail to produce ſome good effects. The throat ſhould be carefully covered with wool or flannel, to prevent the cold from penetrating the ſkin, as this application ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very tender. Many other external applications are recommended in this diſeaſe, as a ſwallow's neſt, poultices made of the funges called Jews-ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as we do not look upon any of theſe to be preferable to a common poultice of bread and milk, we ſhall take no farther notice of them.</p>
                        <p>BLISTERING upon the neck, or behind the ears, in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inflammations of the throat, is very beneficial. After the plaſters are taken off, the part ought to be kept running by the application of ſharp ointment, till the inflammation is gone; otherwiſe, upon their drying up, the patient will be in danger of a relapſe.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient has been treated as above, a ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeldom happens. This, however, is ſometimes the caſe, in
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:012338_0192_0F88EA16AC09E918"/>
ſpite of all our endeavours to prevent it. When the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſwelling continue, and it is evident that a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration will enſue, it ought to be promoted by drawing the ſteam of warm water into the throat through a tunnel, or the like. Soft poultices ought, likewiſe, to be applied outwardly, and the patient may keep a roaſted fig conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his mouth.</p>
                        <p>IT ſometimes happens, before the tumour breaks, that the ſwelling is ſo great, as entirely to prevent any thing from getting down into the ſtomach. In this caſe, the patient muſt inevitably periſh, unleſs he can be ſupported in ſome other way. This can only be done by nouriſhing clyſters of broth, or gruel with milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Patients have often been ſupported by theſe for ſeveral days, till the tumour has broke; and afterwards they have recovered.</p>
                        <p>NOT only the paſſage of the food, but the breathing is often prevented by the tumour. In this caſe, nothing can ſave the patient's life, but opening the <hi>trachea</hi> or windpipe, That has been ſo often done with ſucceſs, that no perſon, in ſuch deſperate circumſtances, ought to heſitate a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about the operation; but as it can only be performed by a ſurgeon, it is not neceſſary here to give any directions about it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a difficulty of ſwallowing is not attended with an acute pain or inflammation, it is generally owing to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the glands about the throat, and only requires that the part be kept warm, and the throat frequently gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ſomewhat that may gently ſtimulate the glands, as a decoction of figs with vinegar and honey; to which may be added a little muſtard, or a ſmall quantity of ſpirits.</p>
                        <p>BUT this kind of gargle is never to be uſed where there are ſigns of an inflammation. This ſpecies of <hi>angina</hi> has various names among the common people, as the <hi>pap of the throat,</hi> the falling down of the <hi>almonds of the ears, &amp;c.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, to remove it, they pull the patient up by the hair of the head, and thruſt their fingers under his jaws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which practices are, at beſt, uſeleſs, and often hurtful.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who are ſubject to inflammations of the throat, in order to prevent too great a fulneſs of blood and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ought to live temperately. Such as do not chooſe to obſerve this rule, muſt have frequent recourſe to purging and other evacuations, to diſcharge the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. They ought likewiſe to beware of catching cold,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:012338_0193_0F88EA1777DE1408"/>
and ſhould abſtain from aliment and medicines of an aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or ſtimulating nature.</p>
                        <p>VIOLENT exerciſe, by increaſing the motion and force of the blood, is apt to occaſion an inflammation of the throat, eſpecially if cold liquor be drank immediately after it, or the body ſuffered ſuddenly to cool. Thoſe who would avoid this diſeaſe, ought, therefore, after ſpeaking aloud, ſinging, running, drinking warm liquor, or doing any thing that may ſtrain the throat, or increaſe the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood towards it, to take care to cool gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and to wrap plenty of coverings about their necks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I have often known perſons who had been ſubject to ſore throats, kept intirely free from that complaint by only wearing a ribband, or a bit of flannel, conſtantly about their necks, or by wearing a pair of thicker ſhoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may ſeem trifling, but they have great effect. There is danger indeed in leaving them off, after perſons have been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to them; but ſurely the inconveniency of uſing ſuch things for life, is not to be compared with the danger which may attend the neglect of them.</p>

                        <head>OF THE MALIGNANT QUINSEY, OR PUTRID, ULCEROUS SORE THROAT.</head>
                        <p>THIS kind of quinſey is but little known in the northern parts of Britain, though, for ſome time paſt, it has been very fatal in the more ſouthern counties. Children are more ſubject to it than adults, females than males, and the delicate than thoſe who are hardy and robuſt. It prevails moſt in autumn, or after a long courſe of damp, or fultry weather.</p>
                        <p>CAUSE.—This is evidently a contageous diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and is generally communicated by infection. Whole families, and even entire villages often receive the infection from one perſon. This ought to put people upon their guard againſt going near ſuch patients as labour under the diſorder; as by that means they endanger not only their own lives, but likewiſe thoſe of their friends and connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—It begins with alternate fits of ſhivering and heat. The pulſe is quick, but low and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, and generally continues ſo through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. The patient complains greatly of weakneſs
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:012338_0194_0F88EA182F289608"/>
and oppreſſion of the breaſt; his ſpirits are low, and he is apt to faint away when ſet upright; he is troubled with a nauſea, and often with a vomiting or purging. The two latter are moſt common in children. The eyes appear red and watery, and the face ſwells. The urine is at firſt pale and crude; but, as the diſeaſe advances, it turns more of a yellowiſh colour. The tongue is white, and generally moiſt, which diſtinguiſhes this from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diſeaſe. Upon looking into the throat it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſwelled, and of a florid red colour. Pale, or aſh-coloured ſpots, however, are here and there interſperſed, and ſometimes one broad patch or ſpot, of an irregular fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and pale white colour, ſurrounded with florid red only appears. Theſe whitiſh ſpots, or ſloughs, cover ſo many ulcers underneath.</p>
                        <p>AN effloreſcence, or eruption upon the neck, arms, breaſt, and fingers, about the ſecond or third day, is a common ſymptom of this diſeaſe. When it appears, the purging and vomiting generally ceaſe.</p>
                        <p>THERE is often a ſlight degree of delirium, and the face frequently appears blotted, and the inſide of the noſtrils red and inflamed. The patient complains of a diſagreeable, putrid ſmell, and his breath is very offenſive.</p>
                        <p>THE putrid, ulcerous ſore throat, may be diſtinguiſhed from the inflammatory, by the vomiting and looſeneſs, with which it is generally uſhered in; by the foul ulcers in the throat, covered with a white or livid coat; and, by the exceſſive weakneſs of the patient; with other ſymptoms of a putrid fever.</p>
                        <p>UNFAVOURABLE ſymptoms are, an obſtinate purging, extreme weakneſs, dimneſs of the ſight, a livid or black colour of the ſpots, and frequent ſhiverings, with a weak, fluttering pulſe. If the eruption upon the ſkin ſuddenly diſappears, or becomes of a livid colour, with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of blood from the noſe or mouth, the danger is very great.</p>
                        <p>IF a gentle ſweat breaks out about the third or fourth day, and continues with a ſlow, firm, and equal pulſe; if the ſloughs caſt off in a kindly manner, and appear clean and florid at the bottom; and if the breathing be ſoft and free, with a lively colour of the eyes, there is reaſon to hope for a ſalutary criſis.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The patient muſt be kept quiet, and, for the moſt part, in bed, as he will be apt to faint when taken out of it. His food muſt be nouriſhing and
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:012338_0195_0F88EA19D394FC38"/>
reſtorative; as ſago gruel with red wine, jellies, broths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His drink ought to be generous, and of an antiſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic quality; as red wine negas, white wine whey, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—The medicine in this kind of quinſey is entirely different from that which is proper in the inflammatory. All evacuations, as bleeding, purging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which weaken the patient, muſt be avoided. Cooling medicines, as nitre, and cream of tartar, are, likewiſe, hurtful. Strengthening cordials alone can be uſed with ſafety; and theſe ought never to be neglected.</p>
                        <p>IF, at the beginning, there be a great nauſea, or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to vomit, the patient muſt drink an infuſion of green tea, camomile flowers, or <hi>carduus benedictus,</hi> in order to clean the ſtomach. If theſe be not ſufficient, he may take a few grains of the powder of ipecacuanha, or any other gentle vomit.</p>
                        <p>IF the diſeaſe be mild, the throat may be gargled with an infuſion of ſage and roſe leaves, to a gill of which may be added a ſpoonful or two of honey, and as much vinegar as will make it agreeably ſharp; but, when the ſymptoms are urgent, the ſloughs large and thick, and the breath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offenſive, the following gargle may be uſed.</p>
                        <p>TO ſix or ſeven ounces of the pectoral decoction, when boiling, add half an ounce of contrayerva root; let it boil for ſome time, and afterwards ſtrain the liquor; to which add two ounces of white wine vinegar, an ounce of fine honey, and an ounce of the tincture of myrrh. This ought not only to be uſed as a gargle, but a little of it ſhould frequently be injected with a ſyringe to clean the mouth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the patient takes any meat or drink. This method is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly neceſſary for children, who cannot uſe a gargle.</p>
                        <p>IT will be of great benefit if the patient frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into his mouth, through an inverted funnel, the ſteams of warm vinegar, myrrh, and honey.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the putrid ſymptoms run high, and the diſeaſe is attended with danger, the only medicine that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon is the Jeſuits bark. It may be taken in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if the patient's ſtomach will bear it. If not, an ounce of bark groſsly powdered, with two drams of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian ſnakeroot, may be boiled in an Engliſh pint and an half of water, to half a pint; to which a tea ſpoonful of the elixir of vitriol may be added, and an ordinary tea cupful of it taken every three or four hours. Bliſtering plaſters
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:012338_0196_0F88EA1A7801A198"/>
are very beneficial in this diſeaſe, eſpecially when the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's pulſe and ſpirits are low. They may be applied to the throat, behind the ears, or upon the back-part of the neck.</p>
                        <p>SHOULD the vomiting prove troubleſome, it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give the patient two table ſpoonfuls of the ſaline ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep, recommended in page 175, every two hours, or oftener, if neceſſary. Tea made of mint and a little cinnamon, will likewiſe be a proper drink, eſpecially if an equal quantity of red wine be mixed with it.</p>
                        <p>IN caſe of a violent looſeneſs, the ſize of a nutmeg of <hi>diaſcordium,</hi> or the Japonic confection, may be taken two or three times a-day, or oftener, if neceſſary; and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's drink muſt be red wine negas.</p>
                        <p>IF a diſcharge of blood from the noſe happens, the ſteams of warm vinegar may be received up the noſtrils fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; and the drink may be ſharpened with ſpirits of vitriol, or tincture of roſes.</p>
                        <p>IN caſe of a ſtrangury, the belly muſt be fomented with warm water, and emollient clyſters given three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the violence of the diſeaſe is over, the belly ſhould be opened with mild purgatives; as manna, ſenna, rhubarb, or the like.</p>
                        <p>IF great weakneſs and dejection of ſpirits, or night ſweats, with other ſymptoms of a conſumption, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main after this diſeaſe, we would recommend it to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to continue the uſe of the Jeſuits bark, with the elixir of vitriol, and to take frequently a glaſs of generous wine. Theſe, together with a milk diet, and riding on horſeback, are the moſt likely means for recovering his ſtrength.</p>

                        <p>IT has already been obſerved, that colds are the effect of an obſtructed perſpiration; the common cauſes of which we have likewiſe endeavoured to point out, and ſhall not here repeat them. Neither ſhall we ſpend time in enumerating all the various ſymptoms of colds, as they are pretty generally known. It may not, however, be amiſs to obſerve, that almoſt every cold is a kind of fever, and only differs in degree from ſome of thoſe which have already been treated of.</p>

                           </gap>able to catch cold, nor can even the greateſt circumſpection defend them againſt its attacks. Indeed, if the human body could be kept conſtantly in an uniform degree of warmth, ſuch a thing as catching cold would be impoſſible: But as that cannot be effected by any means, the perſpiration muſt be liable to many changes. Such changes, however, when ſmall, do not affect the health; but, when exceſſive, they muſt prove hurtful. Hence the great ſecret of preventing colds, lies in avoiding, as far as poſſible, all extremes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heat or cold.</p>
                        <p>WHEN oppreſſion of the breaſt, a ſtuffing of the noſe, unuſual wearineſs, or a pain of the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> give ground to believe that the perſpiration is obſtructed, or, in other words, that the perſon has caught cold, he ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to leſſen his diet, at leaſt, the uſual quantity of his ſolid food, and to abſtain from all ſtrong liquors. Inſtead of fleſh, fiſh, eggs, milk, and other nouriſhing diet, he may eat light bread pudding, veal, or chicken broth, paps, or gruels, and ſuch like. His drink may be water gruel, ſweetened with a little honey; an infuſion of balm, or linſeed, ſharpened with the juice of orange or lemon; a decoction of barley and liquorice, with tamarinds, or any other cool, diluting acid liquor.</p>
                        <p>ABOVE all, his ſupper ſhould be light; as ſmall poſſet, or water gruel, ſweetened with honey, and a little toaſted bread in it. If honey ſhould diſagree with the ſtomach, the gruel may be ſweetened with treacle, or coarſe ſugar, and ſharpened with the jelly of currants. Thoſe who have been accuſtomed to generous liquors, may take white wine whey inſtead of gruel, which may be ſweetened as above.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ought to lie longer than uſual in bed, and to encourage a gentle ſweat, which is eaſily brought on towards morning, by drinking tea, or any kind of warm diluting liquor. I have often known this practice, in a day or two, carry off a cold, which, in all probability, had it been neglected, would have coſt the patient his life, or have confined him for ſome months to his bed. Would people ſacrifice a little time to eaſe and warmth, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice a moderate degree of abſtinence when the firſt ſymptoms of a cold appear, we have reaſon to believe, that moſt of the bad effects which flow from an obſtructed perſpiration,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:012338_0198_0F88EA1C419CB070"/>
might be prevented. But, after the diſeaſe has gathered ſtrength by delay, all attempts to remove it, often prove in vain. A pleuriſy, a peripneumony, or a fatal conſumption of the lungs, are the common effects of colds that have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been totally neglected, or treated improperly.</p>
                        <p>MANY attempt to cure a cold, by getting drunk. But this, to ſay no worſe of it, is a very hazardous and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardy experiment. No doubt it may ſometimes ſucceed, by ſuddenly reſtoring the perſpiration; but when there is any degree of inflammation, which is frequently the caſe, ſtrong liquors, inſtead of removing the malady, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. By this means a common cold is often convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into an inflammatory fever.</p>
                        <p>WHEN thoſe who labour for their daily bread have the misfortune to catch cold, they grudge to loſe a day or two, in order to keep themſelves warm, and take a little medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, by which means the diſorder is often ſo aggravated, as to confine them for a long while, or even to render them ever after unable to ſuſtain hard labour. Such of the labouring poor as can afford to take care of themſelves, are often too hardy to do it; they affect to deſpiſe colds, and as long as they can crawl about, ſcorn to be confined by what they call a <hi>common cold.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, that colds deſtroy ſuch numbers of mankind. Like an enemy deſpiſed, they gather ſtrength from delay, till, at length, they become invincible. We often ſee this verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in travellers, who, rather than loſe a day in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their buſineſs, throw away their lives, by purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their journey with this diſeaſe upon them, even in the coldeſt ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>BUT colds may be too much as well as too little indulged. When a perſon, for a ſlight cold, ſhuts himſelf up in a warm room, and drinks great quantities of warm liquor, it may bring on ſuch a general relaxation of the ſolids as will not be eaſily removed. It will, therefore, be proper, when the diſeaſe will permit, and the weather is mild, to join to the regimen mentioned above, gentle exerciſe; as walking, riding on horſeback, or in a machine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An obſtinate cold, which no medicine can remove, will yield to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per courſe of exerciſe when duly perſiſted in.</p>
                        <p>BATHING the feet and legs every night in warm water, has a great tendency to reſtore the perſpiration. But care muſt be taken that the water be not too warm, otherwiſe it will do hurt. It ſhould never be warmer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>BUT when the ſymptoms do not yield to abſtinence, warmth, and diluting liquors, there is reaſon to fear the approach of ſome other diſeaſe, as an inflammation of the breaſt, an ardent fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the pulſe, therefore, be hard and frequent, the ſkin hot and dry, and the patient complains of his head and breaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it will be neceſſary to bleed, and to give the cooling opening powders menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in page 172, every three or four hours, till they give a ſtool.</p>
                        <p>IT will likewiſe be proper to put a bliſtering plaſter on the back, to give two table ſpoonfuls of the ſaline mixture ordered in page 175, every three hours, and, in ſhort, to treat the patient, in all reſpects, as for a ſlight fever. I have often ſeen this courſe, when obſerved at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, remove the complaint in two or three days, when the patient had all the ſymptoms of an approaching ardent fever, or an inflammation of the breaſt.</p>

                        <p>A cough is generally the effect of a cold, which has ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been improperly treated, or intirely neglected. When it proves obſtinate, there is always reaſon to fear the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as this ſhews a weak ſtate of the lungs, and is often the forerunner of a conſumption.</p>
                        <p>IF the cough be violent, and the patient young and ſtrong, with a hard quick pulſe, bleeding will be neceſſary, to leſſen the quantity of the humours, and prevent a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the blood-veſſels of the lungs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in weak and relaxed habits, bleeding rather prolongs the diſeaſe. When the patient ſpits freely, bleeding is unneceſſary, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurtful, as it tends to leſſen that diſcharge.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the cough is not attended with a fever, and the ſpittle is viſcid and tough, ſharp pectoral medicines are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered; as gum ammoniac, ſquills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſolution of gum ammoniac may be prepared as directed in page 117,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:012338_0200_0F88EA212E5DACB8"/>
and two table ſpoonfuls of it taken three or four <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> a-day, more or leſs, according to the age and conſtitution of the patient. Squills may be given various ways; two ounces of the vinegar, the oxymel, or the ſyrup, may be mixed with the ſame quantity of ſpirituous cinnamon water, to which may be added, an ounce of common water, and an ounce of balſamic ſyrup. Two table ſpoonfuls of this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be taken three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>A ſyrup made of equal parts of lemon juice, honey and ſugar-candy, is likewiſe very proper in this kind of cough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A table ſpoonful of it may be taken at pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the defluxion is ſharp and thin, theſe medicines rather do hurt. In this caſe, gentle opiates, oils, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilages are proper. A cup of the infuſion of wild poppy leaves, with marſh mallow roots, or the flowers of coltsfoot, may be taken frequently; or a tea ſpoonful of the parego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric elixir may be put into the patient's drink twice a-day. He may likewiſe take an emulſion made of an ounce and an half of olive oil, ſix ounces of water, one ounce of pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral ſyrup, and a tea ſpoonful of ſpirits of hartſhorn. Theſe muſt be well ſhaken together, and two table ſpoonfuls of the mixture taken every three or four hours. Fuller's Spaniſh infuſion is alſo a very proper medicine in this caſe, and may be taken, if the above ſhould diſagree with the patient's ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. It is made by infuſing in an Engliſh quart of boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, two drams of ſalt of tartar, half a dram of ſaffron cut into ſmall pieces, and an ounce of Spaniſh juice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cut ſmall. Theſe muſt ſtand in a cloſe veſſel for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours, in a gentle degree of warmth. Afterwards, let the infuſion be ſtrained, and a tea cupful of it taken three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a cough is occaſioned by acrid humours tickling the throat and <hi>fauces,</hi> the patient ſhould keep ſome ſoft pectoral lozenges almoſt conſtantly in his mouth; as the Pontefract liquorice cakes, barley ſugar, the Spaniſh juice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe blunt the acrimony of the humours, and by taking off their ſtimulating quality, help to appeaſe the cough.</p>
                        <p>IN obſtinate coughs, proceeding from a flux of humours upon the lungs, it will often be neceſſary, beſides expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torating medicines, to have recourſe to iſſues, ſetons, or ſome other drain. In this caſe, I have always obſerved the moſt happy effects from a Burgundy pitch plaſter applied between the ſhoulders. I have ordered this ſimple remedy in the moſt obſtinate coughs, in a great number of caſes, and in many different conſtitutions, without ever knowing
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:012338_0201_0F88EA22020C8D28"/>
it fail, unleſs where there were evident ſigns of an ulcer in the lungs. About the bulk of a nutmeg of Burgundy pitch may be ſpread thin upon a piece of ſoft leather, about the ſize of the hand, and laid between the ſhoulder-blades. It may be taken off and wiped every three or four days, and ought to be renewed once a fortnight or three weeks. This is indeed a cheap and ſimple medicine, and conſequently apt to be deſpiſed; but we will venture to affirm, that the whole <hi>materia medica</hi> does not afford an application more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious in almoſt every kind of cough. It has not, indeed, an immediate effect; but, if continued long enough, it will ſucceed where moſt other medicines fail.</p>
                        <p>THE only inconveniency attending this plaſter is the itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which it occaſions in the part to which it is applied; but ſurely this may be diſpenſed with, conſidering the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which the patient may expect to reap from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; beſides, when the itching becomes very uneaſy, the plaſter may be taken off, and the part rubbed with a dry cloth, or waſhed with a little warm milk and water. Some caution, indeed, is neceſſary in diſcontinuing the uſe of ſuch a plaſter; this, however, may be ſafely done by making it ſmaller by degrees, and at length quitting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in a warm ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>BUT coughs proceed from many other cauſes beſides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions upon the lungs. In theſe caſes the cure is not to be attempted by pectoral medicines. Thus, in a cough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a foulneſs and debility of the ſtomach, ſyrups, oils, mucilages, and all kind of balſamic medicines, do hurt. This cough may be known from one that is owing to a fault in the lungs by this mark, that in the latter the patient coughs whenever he inſpires, or draws in his breath fully; but in the former that does not happen.</p>
                        <p>THE cure of this cough depends chiefly upon cleanſing and ſtrengthening the ſtomach; for which purpoſe gentle vomits and bitter purgatives are moſt proper. Thus, after a vomit or two, the ſacred tincture, as it is called, may be taken for a conſiderable time, in the doſe of a table ſpoonful or two twice a-day, or as often as it is found neceſſary to keep the belly gently open. People may make this tincture themſelves, by infuſing an ounce of <hi>hiera picra</hi> in an Engliſh pint of white wine, letting it ſtand a few days, and then ſtraining it off for uſe.</p>
                        <p>IN coughs, which proceed from a debility of the ſtomach, the Jeſuits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ark is, likewiſe, of conſiderable uſe. It may
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:012338_0202_0F88EA22C0845300"/>
either be chewed, taken in powder, or made into a tincture along with other ſtomachic bitters.</p>
                        <p>A <hi>nervous cough</hi> can only be removed by change of air, and proper exerciſe; to which may be added the uſe of gentle opiates. A tea ſpoonful of the paregoric elixir, or two of the ſaponaceous pills may be taken twice a-day. If theſe prove too weak, ten, fifteen, or twenty drops of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid laudanum, more or leſs, as circumſtances require, may be taken at bed-time, or when the cough is moſt troubleſome. Putting the feet and hands in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will often appeaſe the violence of a nervous cough.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a cough is only the ſymptom of ſome other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, it is in vain to attempt to remove it without firſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the diſeaſe from which it proceeds. Thus, when a cough is occaſioned by the cutting of teeth; keeping the belly open, ſcarifying the gums, or whatever facilitates the teething, likewiſe appeaſes the cough. In like manner, when worms occaſion a cough, ſuch medicines as remove theſe, will generally cure the cough; as bitter purgatives, oily clyſters, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>WOMEN, during the laſt months of pregnancy, are often greatly afflicted with a cough, which is generally relieved by bleeding, and keeping the belly open. They ought to avoid all flatulent food, and to wear a looſe eaſy dreſs.</p>
                        <p>A cough is not only a ſymptom, but is often, likewiſe, the forerunner of diſeaſes. Thus, the gout is frequently uſhered in by a very troubleſome cough, which affects the patient for ſome days before the coming on of the fit. A pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of the gout generally removes this cough, which ſhould, therefore, be promoted, by keeping the extremities warm, drinking warm liquors, and bathing the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water.</p>

                        <head>OF THE CHIN-COUGH.</head>
                        <p>THIS cough ſeldom affect adults, but is often epidemical among children. Such children as live upon thin watery diet, who breathe unwholeſome air, and have too little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, are moſt liable to this diſeaſe, and generally ſuffer moſt from it.</p>
                        <p>THE chin-cough is ſo well known, even to nurſes, that no deſcription of it is neceſſary. Whatever hurts the digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, obſtructs the perſpiration, or relaxes the ſolids, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:012338_0203_0F88EA2385727090"/>
to this diſeaſe; conſequently its cure muſt depend upon cleaning and ſtrengthening the ſtomach, bracing the ſolids, and, at the ſame time, promoting perſpiration, and the different ſecretions.</p>
                        <p>THE diet in this diſeaſe muſt be light, and of eaſy digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; for children, good bread made into pap or pudding, chicken broth, with other light ſpoon meats, are proper; but thoſe who are farther advanced, may be allowed ſago gruel, and, if the fever be not high, a little boiled chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or other white meats. The drink may be pennyroyal tea, ſweetened with honey or ſugar-candy, ſmall wine whey; or, if the patient be weak, he may ſometimes be allowed a little negas.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt effectual remedy in this diſeaſe is change of air. This often removes the malady, even when the change ſeems to be from a purer to a leſs wholeſome air. This may, in ſome meaſure, depend on the patient's being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the place where the infection prevails. Moſt of the diſeaſes of children are infectious; nor is it at all uncommon to find the chin-cough prevailing in one town or village, when another, at a very ſmall diſtance, is quite free from it. But, whatever be the cauſe, we are ſure of the fact. No time ought, therefore, to be loſt in removing the patient at ſome diſtance from the place where he caught the diſeaſe, and, if poſſible, into a more pure and dry air.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe proves violent, and the patient is in danger of being ſuffocated by the cough, he ought to be bled, eſpecially if there be a fever with a hard full pulſe. But, as the chief intention of bleeding is to prevent a rupture of the blood veſſels of the lungs, and to render it more ſafe to give vomits, it will ſeldom be neceſſary to repeat the operation; yet, if there be ſymptoms of an inflammation of the lungs, a ſecond, or even a third bleeding may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
                        <p>IT is a favourable ſymptom when the patient vomits after the fit. This cleans the ſtomach, and greatly relieves the cough. It will, therefore, be proper to promote the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, either by camomile tea, or lukewarm water; and, when theſe are not ſufficient, ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha may be given. A child of three or four years of age may take five or ſix grains; and to others, leſs or more muſt be given, according to their age and ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>IT is very difficult to make children drink after a vomit. I have often ſeen them happily deceived, by infuſing a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:012338_0204_0F88EA24358C6B78"/>
or half a dram, of the powder of ipecacuanha in a tea-pot, with half an Engliſh pint of boiling water. If this be diſguiſed with a few drops of milk, and a little ſugar, they will imagine it tea, and drink it very greedily. A ſmall tea cupful of this may be given every quarter of an hour, or rather every ten minutes, till it operates. When they begin to puke, there will be no occaſion for drinking any more, as the water already on their ſtomach will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                        <p>VOMITS not only clean the ſtomach, which, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is generally loaded with viſcid phlegm, but they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe promote the perſpiration and other ſecretions; and ought, therefore, to be repeated, according to the obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the diſeaſe. They ſhould not, however, be too ſtrong; gentle vomits, frequently repeated, are both leſs dangerous, and more beneficial than ſtrong ones.</p>
                        <p>AS the patient is generally coſtive, it will be proper to keep his belly gently open. The beſt medicines for this purpoſe are rhubarb and its preparations, or the ſacred tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if the patient can be brought to take it. Of this a tea ſpoonful or two may be given to a young child twice or thrice a-day, as there is occaſion. To ſuch as are farther advanced, the doſe muſt be proportionally increaſed, and repeated till it has the deſired effect. Thoſe who cannot be brought to take the bitter tincture, may have an infuſion of ſenna and prunes, ſweetened with manna, coarſe ſugar, or honey; or a few grains of rhubarb, mixed with a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or two of ſyrup, or currant jelly, ſo as to diſguiſe the taſte. Moſt children are fond of ſyrups and jellies, and ſeldom refuſe even a bitter medicine when mixed with them.</p>
                        <p>MANY people believe that oily, pectoral, and balſamic medicines, poſſeſs wonderful virtues for the cure of the chin-cough, and accordingly exhibit them plentifully to patients of every age and conſtitution, without conſidering that every thing of this nature muſt load the ſtomach, hurt the digeſtion, and, of courſe, aggravate the diſorder.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>millepedes,</hi> or woodlice, are greatly recommended for the cure of a chin-cough. Thoſe who chooſe to make uſe of theſe inſects, may infuſe two ounces of them bruiſed in an Engliſh pint of ſmall white wine for one night. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the liquor may be ſtrained through a cloth, and a table ſpoonful of it given to the patient three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="201" facs="unknown:012338_0205_0F88EA2510FFBAF8"/>
OPIATES are ſometimes neceſſary to allay the violence of the cough. For this purpoſe, a little of the ſyrup of poppies, or ten, fifteen, or twenty drops, according to the age of the patient, of the paregoric elixir, may be taken in a cup of hyſſop, or pennyroyal tea, three or four times a-day. An adult may take a table ſpoonful of the ſyrup, or a tea ſpoonful of the elixir.</p>
                        <p>THE garlic ointment is a well known remedy in North-Britain for the chin-cough. It is made by beating in a mortar garlic with an equal quantity of hogs lard, but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or oil. With this the ſoles of the feet may be rubbed twice or thrice a-day, or it may be ſpread thin upon a rag, and applied as a plaſter. It ſhould be renewed every night and morning at leaſt, as the garlic ſoon loſes its virtue. This is an exceeding good medicine, both in the chin-cough, and in moſt other coughs of an obſtinate nature. It ought not, however, to be uſed when the patient is very hot, or feveriſh, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t it increaſe theſe ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>THE feet ſhould be bathed once every two or three days in warm water; and the Burgundy pitch plaſter, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in page 196, may be applied betwixt the ſhoulders. But when the diſeaſe proves very violent, it will be neceſſary, inſtead of it, to apply a bliſtering plaſter, and to keep the part open for ſome time with iſſue ointment.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe is prolonged, and the patient is free of a fever, the Jeſuits bark, and other bitters, are the moſt proper medicines. The bark may either be taken in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or in a decoction or infuſion, as is moſt agreeable to the patient. For a child, ten, fifteen, or twenty grains may be given for a doſe, according to the age of the patient. For an adult, half a dram, or two ſcruples, will be proper. Some give the extract of the bark with cantharides; but to manage this, requires ſome ſkill and attention. It is more ſafe to give a few grains of caſtor along with the bark. A child of ſix or ſeven years of age may take ſeven or eight grains of caſtor, with fifteen grains of powdered bark, for a doſe. This may be made into a mixture, with two or three ounces of any ſimple diſtilled water, and a little ſyrup, and taken three or four times a-day.</p>

                        <head>INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.</head>
                        <p>THIS is a dangerous diſeaſe, and requires the moſt ſpeedy aſſiſtance, as it frequently ends in a ſuppuration; and ſometimes in a mortification, which is certain death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="202" facs="unknown:012338_0206_0F88EA25ADE515A0"/>
CAUSES.—It may proceed from any of the cauſes which produce an inflammatory fever; as cold li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor drank while the body is warm, an obſtructed perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the ſudden ſtriking in of any eruption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe proceed from the acrimony of the bile, or from acrid and ſtimulating ſubſtances taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; as ſtrong vomits or purges, corroſive poiſons, and ſuch like. When the gout has been repelled from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, either by cold or improper applications, it often occaſions an inflammation of the ſtomach. Hard or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtable ſubſtances taken into the ſtomach, as bones, the ſhells of nuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have likewiſe that effect.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—It is attended with a fixed pain and burning heat in the ſtomach; great reſtleſſneſs and anxiety; a ſmall, quick, hard pulſe; vomiting, or, at leaſt, a nauſea and ſickneſs; exceſſive thirſt; coldneſs of the extremities; difficulty of breathing; cold clammy ſweats; and ſometimes convulſions and fainting fits. The ſtomach is ſwelled, and often feels hard to the touch. One of the moſt certain ſigns of this diſeaſe is the ſenſe of pain, which the patient feels upon taking any kind of food or drink, eſpecially if too hot or cold, into his ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient vomits every thing he eats or drinks, is extremely reſtleſs, has a hiccup, with an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting pulſe, and frequent fainting fits, the danger is very great.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The patient muſt, with the greateſt care, avoid all acrimonious, heating, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting food and drink. His weakneſs may deceive the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders, and induce them to give him wines, ſpirits, or other cordials; but all theſe increaſe the diſeaſe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten occaſion ſudden death. The inclination to vomit, may likewiſe impoſe on the attendants, and make them think a vomit neceſſary; but that too is almoſt certain death.</p>
                        <p>THE food muſt be light, thin, cool, and eaſy of digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. It muſt be given in ſmall quantities, and ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be quite cold nor too hot. Thin gruel made of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley or oatmeal, light toaſted bread, diſſolved in boiling water, or very weak chicken broth, are the moſt proper. The drink ſhould be clear whey, barley water, or decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of emollient vegetables; or liquorice and marſh mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>

MEDICINE.—Bleeding in this diſeaſe is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and is almoſt the only medicine that can be depended on. When the diſeaſe proves obſtinate, it will often be neceſſary to repeat this operation ſeveral times, nor muſt the low ſtate of the pulſe deter us from doing ſo. The pulſe in this diſeaſe generally riſes upon bleeding, and ſo long as that is the caſe, the operation is ſafe.</p>
                        <p>FREQUENT fomentations with warm water, or a decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of emollient vegetables, are likewiſe beneficial. Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel cloths dipped in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE feet and legs ought, likewiſe, to be frequently bathed in lukewarm water, and warm bricks, or poultices, may be applied to the ſoles of the feet.</p>
                        <p>THE only internal medicines which we ſhall venture to recommend in this diſeaſe, are mild clyſters. Theſe may be made of warm water, or thin water gruel, and, if the patient be coſtive, a little ſweet oil, honey or manna, may be added. Clyſters anſwer the purpoſe of an internal fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, while they keep the belly open, and, at the ſame time, nouriſh the patient, who is often, in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, unable to retain any thing upon his ſtomach. For theſe reaſons they muſt not be neglected, as the patient's life may depend on the application of them.</p>

                        <head>OF THE ILIAC PASSION.</head>
                        <p>THIS is one of the moſt painful and dangerous diſeaſes that mankind are liable to. It proceeds from the ſame <hi>cauſes</hi> as the inflammation of the ſtomach; to which may be added coſtiveneſs, worms, eating unripe fruits, or great quantities of nuts, drinking hard windy malt liquors, as ſtale beer, bottled ale, or ſour wine, cider, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may, likewiſe, be occaſioned by a rupture, ſcirrhous tumours of the inteſtines, or by their oppoſite ſides growing together.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>ſymptoms</hi> here are nearly the ſame as in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſe; only the pain, if poſſible, is more acute, and is ſituate lower down about the region of the navel. The vomiting is likewiſe more violent, and ſometimes even the excrements, together with the clyſters and ſuppoſitaries,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:012338_0208_0F88EA272A8ADA98"/>
are diſcharged by the mouth. The patient is continually belching up wind, and has often an obſtruction of his urine.</p>
                        <p>WHILE the pain ſhifts, and the vomiting only returns at certain intervals, and while the clyſters paſs downwards, there is ground to hope; but when the clyſters and <hi>foeces</hi> are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and the patient is exceeding weak, with a low fluttering pulſe, a pale countenance, and a diſagreeable, or ſtinking breath, there is great reaſon to fear, that the conſequences will prove fatal. Clammy ſweats, black foetid ſtools, with a ſmall intermitting pulſe, and a total ceſſation of pain, are the ſigns of a gangrene, and approaching death.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The regimen in this diſeaſe is in general the ſame as in an inflammation of the ſtomach. The patient muſt be kept quiet, avoiding cold, and all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent paſſions of the mind. His food muſt be thin, weak, and given in ſmall quantities; his drink weak and diluting; as clear whey, barley water, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Bleeding in this, as well as in the inflammation of the ſtomach, is the remedy moſt to be depended on. It ſhould be performed as ſoon as the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms appear, and muſt be repeated according to the ſtrength of the patient, and the violence of the ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>A bliſtering plaſter applied immediately over the part where the moſt violent pain is, has often a very good effect. Even clyſters, which before had no effect, will operate when the bliſter begins to riſe.</p>
                        <p>FOMENTATIONS and laxative clyſters are by no means to be omitted. The patient's feet and legs ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be bathed in warm water; and cloths dipped in it applied to his belly. Bladders, filled with warm water, may likewiſe be applied to the region of the navel, and warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, to the ſoles of the feet. The clyſters may be made of barley wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or thin gruel, and ſoftened with plenty of ſweet oil, or freſh butter. Theſe may be adminiſtered every two or three hours, or oftener, if the patient continues coſtive.</p>
                        <p>IF common clyſters have not the deſired effect, we would recommend the ſmoke of tobacco. It may be blown into the bowels through an inverted pipe. This may be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after ſome time, unleſs the effect of the firſt renders it unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IF the diſeaſe does not yield to clyſters and fomentations, recourſe muſt be had to pretty ſtrong purgatives; but as
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:012338_0209_0F88EA29A113F0F8"/>
theſe, by irritating the bowels, often increaſe their contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, by that means, fruſtrate their own intention, it will be neceſſary to join them with opiates; theſe, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the pain, and relaxing the ſpaſmodic contractions of the guts, greatly aſſiſt the operation of purgatives in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>WHAT often anſwers the purpoſe of purging very well, is a ſolution of the bitter purging ſalts. Two ounces of theſe may be diſſolved in an Engliſh pint of warm water, or thin gruel, and two or three table ſpoonfuls given every half hour till it operates. At the ſame time, fifteen, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or twenty-five drops of laudanum may be given in a glaſs of pepper mint, or ſimple cinnamon water, to appeaſe the irritation, and prevent the vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>ACIDS have often a very happy effect in ſtaying the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and appeaſing the other violent ſymptoms of this diſeaſe. It will, therefore, be of uſe to ſharpen the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's drink with cream of tartar, juice of lemon; or, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>en theſe cannot be obtained, a little vinegar may be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</p>
                        <p>BUT it often happens, that no liquid whatever will ſtay on the ſtomach. In this caſe the patient muſt take pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative pills. I have generally found the following anſwer very well. Take jalep in powder, and vitriolated tartar, each half a dram, opium, one grain, Caſtile ſoap, as much as will make the maſs fit for pills. Theſe muſt be taken at one doſe, and if they do not operate in ſix or ſeven hours, the doſe may be repeated.</p>
                        <p>IF a ſtool cannot be procured by any of the above means, it will be neceſſary to immerſe the patient in warm water up to the breaſt. I have often ſeen this ſucceed, when other means proved in vain. The patient muſt continue in the water as long as he can eaſily bear it without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and, if one emerſion does not ſucceed, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated after ſome time, when the patient's ſtrength and ſpirits are recruited. It is more ſafe for him to go fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into the bath, than continue too long at a time; and, it is often neceſſary, to repeat it ſeveral times before it has the deſired effect.</p>
                        <p>IT has ſometimes happened, after all other means of procuring a ſtool had been tried in vain, that this was brought about by immerſing the patient's lower extremities in cold water, making him walk upon a wet pavement, and daſhing his legs and thighs with the cold water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:012338_0210_0F88EA2B36CA0FE0"/>
method, when others fail, at leaſt merits a trial. It is, indeed, attended with ſome danger; but a doubtful reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is better than none.</p>
                        <p>IN deſperate caſes it is common to give quickſilver. This may be taken to the quantity of ſeveral ounces, or even a pound, but ſhould not exceed that. When there are evident marks of an inflammation, or any reaſon to ſuſpect a mortification of the guts, this medicine ought not to be tried. In that caſe, it will only haſten the patient's death. But when the obſtruction is occaſioned by any cauſe that can be removed by force, quickſilver is not only a proper medicine, but the beſt that can be applied, as it is the fitteſt body we know for making its way through the inteſtinal canal.</p>
                        <p>IF the diſeaſe proceeds from a rupture, the patient muſt be laid with his head very low, and the inteſtines returned by gentle preſſure with the hand. If this, with fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and clyſters, ſhould not ſucceed, recourſe muſt be had to a ſurgical operation, which may give the patient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as would avoid this excruciating and dangerous diſeaſe, muſt take care never to be too long without a ſtool. Some who have died of it, have had ſeveral pounds of hard, dry <hi>foeces</hi> taken out of their guts. They ſhould, likewiſe, beware of eating too freely of ſour or unripe fruits, or drinking ſtale windy liquors, pricked wines, or the like. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten known it brought on by living too much on baked fruits, which are ſeldom good. It likewiſe proceeds fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from cold caught by wet cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from wet feet.</p>

                        <head>OF THE COLIC.</head>
                        <p>THE colic has great affinity, both in its ſymptoms and method of cure, with the two preceding diſeaſes. It is generally attended with coſtiveneſs and acute pain of the bowels; and requires diluting diet, evacuations, fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>COLICS are variouſly denominated according to their cauſes, as the <hi>flatulent,</hi> the <hi>bilious,</hi> the <hi>hyſteric,</hi> the <hi>nervous, &amp;c.</hi> As each of theſe requires a particular treatment, we ſhall point out their moſt general ſymptoms, and the means to be uſed for their relief.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="207" facs="unknown:012338_0211_0F88EA2BB4D74C48"/>
THE <hi>flatulent,</hi> or wind colic, is generally occaſioned by an indiſcreet uſe of unripe fruits, meats of hard digeſtion, windy vegetables, fermented liquors, and ſuch like. It may likewiſe proceed from an obſtructed perſpiration, or catching cold. Delicate people, whoſe digeſtive powers are weak and debilitated, are moſt liable to this kind of colic.</p>
                        <p>THE flatulent colic may either affect the ſtomach or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. It is attended with a painful ſtretching of the ſtomach, or that part of the bowels where it is lodged. The patient feels a rumbling in his guts, and is generally relieved by a diſcharge of wind either upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The pain is ſeldom confined to any particular part, as the vapour wanders from one diviſion of the bowels to an other, till ſuch time as it finds a vent.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe proceeds from windy liquor, eating green fruit, ſour herbs, or the like, the beſt medicine is to take immediately a dram of brandy, gin, or any good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and to apply warm cloths to the ſtomach and bowels. The patient ſhould likewiſe ſit with his feet upon a warm hearth ſtone, or apply warm bricks to them; and he may drink camomile tea, or water gruel, with as much pepper in it as to render it moderately warm.</p>
                        <p>THIS is the only colic wherein ardent ſpirits, ſpiceries, or any thing of a hot nature, may be ventured upon. Nor, indeed, are they to be uſed here, unleſs at the beginning, before there be any ſymptoms of inflammation. We have reaſon to believe, that a colic occaſioned by wind or fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent food, might always be cured by ſpirits and warm li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, if they were taken immediately upon perceiving the firſt uneaſineſs; but when the pain has continued for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time, and there is reaſon to fear an inflammation of the bowels is already begun, all hot things are to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the patient is to be treated in the ſame manner as for the iliac paſſion.</p>
                        <p>SEVERAL kinds of food, as honey, eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> occaſion colics in ſome particular conſtitutions. I have generally found the beſt cure for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſe colics was to drink plentifully of ſmall diluting liquors, as water gruel, ſmall poſſet, toaſt and water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>COLICS which proceed from exceſs and indigeſtions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally cure themſelves, by occaſioning vomiting or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Theſe diſcharges are by no means to be ſtopped, but promoted, by drinking plenty of warm water, or weak
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:012338_0212_0F88EA2C6C4728C8"/>
poſſet. When their violence is over, the patient may take a doſe of rhubarb, or any other gentle purge, to carry off the dregs of his debauch.</p>
                        <p>COLICS which are occaſioned by wet feet, or catching cold, may generally be removed at the beginning, by bathing the feet and legs in warm water, and drinking ſuch warm diluting liquors as will promote the perſpiration, as weak wine whey, or water gruel, with a ſmall quantity of ſpirits in it.</p>
                        <p>THESE flatulent colics, which prevail ſo much in the country, might generally be prevented, if people were careful to change their cloaths when they get wet. They ought, likewiſe, to take a dram, or to drink ſome warm li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor after eating any kind of green traſh. We do not mean to recommend the practice of dram drinking, but, in this caſe, ardent liquors prove a real medicine, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the beſt that can be applied.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>bilious</hi> colic is attended with very acute pain about the region of the navel. The patient complains of great thirſt, and is generally coſtive. He vomits a hot, bitter, yellow coloured bile, which being diſcharged, ſeems to afford ſome relief, but is quickly followed by the ſame vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent pain as before. As the diſtemper advances, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to vomit increaſes, in ſo much, that ſometimes it becomes almoſt continual, and the proper motion of the inteſtines is ſo far perverted, that there are all the ſymptoms of an impending iliac paſſion.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be young and ſtrong, and the pulſe full and frequent, it will be proper to bleed, after which cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may be adminiſtered. Clear whey, or gruel, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with the juice of lemon, or cream of tartar, muſt be drank freely. Small chicken broth, with a little manna diſſolved in it, or a ſlight decoction of tamarinds, are, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, very proper, or any other thin, acid, opening li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                        <p>BESIDES bleeding, and plentiful dilution, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to foment the belly with cloths dipped in warm water, and if this ſhould not ſucceed, the patient muſt be ſet in a warm bath up to the middle.</p>
                        <p>MILD purgatives are here likewiſe neceſſary, as the leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive electuary, manna, cream of tartar, or, what will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer very well, the bitter purging ſalts. Theſe may be diſſolved in water, and given in the ſame manner as direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in page 205. If theſe medicines will not ſtay on the
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:012338_0213_0F88EA2D2BE3EA88"/>
ſtomach, it will be neceſſary to join an opiate with them.</p>
                        <p>SUCH as are liable to frequent returns of the bilious colic ſhould uſe fleſh ſparingly, and live chiefly upon a light ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable diet. They ſhould, likewiſe, take frequently a doſe of cream of tartar with tamarinds, or any other cool, acid purge.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>hyſteric</hi> colic bears a great reſemblance to the bilious. It is attended with acute pains about the region of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what the patient vomits in this caſe is commonly of a greeniſh colour. There is a great ſinking of the ſpirits, with dejection of mind, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing, which are the characteriſtic ſymptoms of this diſorder. Sometimes it is accompanied with the jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, but this generally goes off of its own accord in a few days.</p>
                        <p>IN this colic all evacuations, as bleeding, purging, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do hurt. Every thing that weakens the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or ſinks the ſpirits, is to be avoided. If, however, the vomiting ſhould prove violent, weak camomile tea, or ſmall poſſet, may be drank to cleanſe the ſtomach. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the patient may take fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five drops of liquid laudanum in a glaſs of cinnamon water. This may be repeated every ten or twelve hours till the ſymptoms abate.</p>
                        <p>THE patient may likewiſe take four or five of the foetid pills, three times a-day, and drink a cup of pennyroyal tea after them. If aſafoetida ſhould diſagree with the ſtomach, which is ſometimes the caſe, a tea ſpoonful of the tincture of caſtor in a cup of pennyroyal tea, or thirty or forty drops of the balſam of Peru dropped upon a bit of loaf ſugar, may be taken in its ſtead. The anti-hyſteric plaſter may alſo be applied to the region of the navel, which has often a good effect.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>nervous</hi> colic prevails moſt among miners, ſmelters of lead, plumbers, the makers of white lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is very difficult to cure, and often ends in a palſy.</p>
                        <p>No diſeaſe of the bowels is attended with more excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating pain than this. Nor is it ſoon at an end. I have known it continue eight or ten days with very little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, the belly all the while continuing bound in ſpite of medicine, yet at length yield, and the patient recover.</p>
                        <p>THE general treatment of this diſeaſe is ſo nearly the ſame with that of the iliac paſſion, or inflammation of the guts, that we ſhall not inſiſt upon it. The belly is to be
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:012338_0214_0F88EA2E221F7558"/>
opened by mild purgatives, given in ſmall doſes, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, and their operation muſt be aſſiſted by ſoft oily clyſters, fomentations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE Barbados tar is ſaid to be a proper medicine in this diſeaſe. It may be taken to the quantity of two drams threetimes a-day, or oftener if the ſtomach will bear it. This tar, mixed with an equal quantity of ſtrong rum, is likewiſe proper for rubbing the ſpine, in caſe any tingling, or other ſymptoms of a palſy are felt. When this tar cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the back may be rubbed with ſtrong ſpirits, or a little of the oil of nutmegs or roſemary.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient remains weak and languid after this diſeaſe, he muſt take exerciſe on horſeback, and uſe an infuſion of the Jeſuits bark in wine. When the diſeaſe ends in a palſy, the Bath waters are found to be extremely proper.</p>
                        <p>To avoid this colic, people muſt ſhun all ſour fruits, acid and auſtere liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe who work in lead ought never to go to their buſineſs faſting, and their food ſhould be oily or fat. They may take a glaſs of ſallad oil, with a little brandy or rum every morning, but ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take ſpirits alone. Liquid aliment is beſt for them; as fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>SUNDRY other kinds of this diſeaſe might be mentioned, but too many diſtinctions would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Theſe already mentioned are the moſt material, and ſhould indeed be attended to, as their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is very different. But even thoſe who are not in a condition to diſtinguiſh very accurately in theſe matters, may nevertheleſs be of great ſervice to patients in colics, by only obſerving the following general rules: Firſt, To bathe the patient's feet and legs in warm water; and next, To apply bladders filled with warm water, or cloths dipped in it, to his ſtomach and bowels. Afterwards, To make him drink freely of weak, diluting, warm liquors. And, laſtly, To give him an emollient clyſter every two or three hours.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.</head>
                        <p>CAUSES.—This diſeaſe may proceed from any of thoſe cauſes which produce an inflammatory fever. It is likewiſe occaſioned by wounds, or bruiſes of the kidneys, and by ſmall ſtones or gravel lodging within them. It may alſo proceed from ſtrong diuretic medicines; as ſpirits of
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:012338_0215_0F88EA2EAB15F7E0"/>
turpentine, tincture of cantharides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Violent motion, as hard riding or walking, eſpecially in hot weather, or whatever drives the blood forcibly into the kidneys, may occaſion this malady. It may likewiſe proceed from lying too ſoft, or too much on the back, or from involuntary contractions, or ſpaſms in the urinary veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—There is a ſharp pain about the region of the kidneys, with ſome degree of fever, and a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, or dull pain in the thigh of the affected ſide. The urine is at firſt clear, and afterwards of a rediſh colour; but in the worſt kind of the diſeaſe it generally continues pale, is paſſed with difficulty, and commonly ſmall quantities at a time. The patient feels great uneaſineſs when he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to walk or ſit upright. He lies with more eaſe on the affected ſide than on the ſound; and has generally a nauſea or vomiting, reſembling that which happens in the colic.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe, however, may be diſtinguiſhed from the colic by the pain being ſeated farther back, and by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of paſſing urine, which is a conſtant ſymptom of this diſeaſe, but does nor always happen in the other.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Every thing of a heating or ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating nature is to be avoided. The food muſt be thin and light; as water pap, ſmall broths, with mild vegetables, and the like. Emollient and ſoft liquors muſt be plentifully drank; as clear whey, or balm tea ſweetened with honey, decoctions of marſh mallow roots, with barley and liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The patient, notwithſtanding the vomiting, muſt conſtantly keep ſipping ſmall quantities of theſe or other diluting liquors. Nothing ſo ſafely and certainly abates the inflammation, and expels the obſtructing cauſe, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious dilution. The patient muſt be kept eaſy, quiet, and free from cold, ſo long as any ſymptoms of inflammation appear.</p>

                        <p>THE inflammation of the bladder proceeds, in a great meaſure, from the ſame cauſes as that of the kidneys. It is known by an acute pain towards the bottom of the belly,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:012338_0217_0F88EA3270B5BDE8"/>
and difficulty of paſſing urine, with ſome degree of fever, a conſtant inclination to go to ſtool, and a perpetual deſire to make water.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe muſt be treated on the ſame principles as the immediately preceding. The diet muſt be light and thin, and the drink cooling and diluting. Bleeding is very proper at the beginning, and in robuſt conſtitutions, it will often be neceſſary to repeat it. The bottom of the belly muſt be frequently fomented with warm water, or a decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mild vegetables; and emollient clyſters muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be adminiſtered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>THE patient ſhould abſtain from every thing that is of a hot, acrid, and ſtimulating nature; and ſhould live entirely upon ſmall broths, gruels, or mild vegetables.</p>

                        <head>INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.</head>
                        <p>THE liver is leſs ſubject to inflammation than any of the other viſcera, as, in it, the circulation is ſlower; but when an inflammation does happen, it is with difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and often ends in a ſuppuration, or ſchirrhous.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—Beſides the common cauſes of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, we may here reckon the following, <abbr>

wines or ſpiritous liquors, uſing hot ſpicy aliment, obſtinate hypochondriacal diſtempers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—This diſeaſe is known by a painful tention of the right ſide under the falſe ribs, attended with ſome degree of fever, a ſenſe of weight, or fulneſs of the part, difficulty of breathing, loathing of food, great thirſt, with a pale or yellowiſh colour of the ſkin and eyes.</p>
                        <p>THE <hi>ſymptoms</hi> here are various, according to the degree of inflammation, and likewiſe according to the particular part of the liver where the inflammation happens. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the pain is ſo inconſiderable, that an inflammation is not ſo much as ſuſpected; but when it happens in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or convex part of the liver, the pain is more acute, the pulſe quicker, and the patient is often troubled with a dry cough, a hiccup, and a pain extending to the ſhoulder, with difficulty of lying on the left ſide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may be diſtinguiſhed from the pleuriſy by the pain being leſs violent, ſeated under the falſe ribs, the pulſe not ſo hard, and by the difficulty of lying on the left ſide. It may be diſtinguiſhed from the hyſteric and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac diſorders by ſome degree of fever, with which it is always attended.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe, if properly treated, is ſeldom mortal. A conſtant hiccupping, violent fever, and exceſſive thirſt, are very bad ſymptoms. If it ends in a ſuppuration, and the matter cannot be brought to diſcharge itſelf outwardly, the danger is great. When a ſchirrhous of the liver enſues, the patient, if he obſerves a proper regimen, may live a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years tolerably <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aſy; but if he indulges in animal food and ſtrong liquors, or takes medicines of an acrid or irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating nature, the ſchirrhous will be converted into a cancer, which muſt infallibly prove fatal.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The ſame regimen is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this as in other inflammatory diſorders. All hot things are to be carefully avoided, and cool reſolving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, as whey, barley water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> drank freely. The food muſt be light and thin, and the body, as well as the mind, muſt be kept eaſy and quiet.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Bleeding is proper at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this diſeaſe, and it will often be neceſſary, even though the pulſe ſhould not feel hard, to repeat the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The belly muſt be kept gently open; but all violent purgatives are to be avoided. A decoction of tamarinds,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:012338_0219_0F88EA33EFA4F5E0"/>
with a little honey or manna, will anſwer this purpoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. The ſide affected muſt be frequently fomented with warm water, in the manner directed in the foregoing diſeaſes. Mild laxative clyſters ſhould be frequently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered; and, if the pain ſhould, notwithſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue violent, a bliſtering plaſter may be applied over the part affected.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINES which promote the ſecretion of urine, have a very good effect here. For this purpoſe, half a dram of purified nitre, or half a tea ſpoonful of the ſweet ſpirits of nitre, may be taken in a cup of the patient's drink, three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>WHEN there is an inclination to ſweat, it ought to be promoted, but not by warm ſudorifics. The only thing to be uſed for that purpoſe, is plenty of diluting liquor drank about the warmth of the human blood. Indeed, the patient, in this caſe, as well as in all other topical inflammations, ought to drink nothing that is colder than the blood.</p>
                        <p>IF the ſtools ſhould be looſe, and even ſtreaked with blood, nothing muſt be given to ſtop them, unleſs they be ſo frequent as to weaken the patient. Looſe ſtools often prove critical, and carry off the diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>IF the diſorder, in ſpite of all endeavours to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhould end in a ſchirrhous, the patient muſt be careful to regulate his diet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſuch a manner as not to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the diſeaſe. He muſt not indulge in fleſh, fiſh, ſtrong liquors, or any poignant or ſalted proviſions; but muſt, for the moſt part, live on mild vegetables, as fruits and roots, taking gentle exerciſe, and drinking wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The great rule, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all of them, is to avoid every thing that is ſtrong, or of a heating nature, to apply warm fomentations to the part affected, and to ſupply the patient with plenty of weak, warm, diluting drink.</p>

                        <p>THIS is a violent purging and vomiting, attended with gripes, and a conſtant deſire to go to ſtool. It comes on
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:012338_0220_0F88EA34B4400D88"/>
ſuddenly, and is moſt common in autumn. There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any diſeaſe that kills more quickly than this, when proper means are not uſed in due time for removing it.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—It is occaſioned by a redundency and putrid acrimony of the bile; by food that eaſily turns ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid or ſour on the ſtomach; as butter, fat pork, ſweet meats, cucumbers, melons, cherries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſometimes the effect of ſtrong acrid purges or vomits; or of poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubſtances taken into the ſtomach. It may likewiſe proceed from violent paſſions of the mind; as fear, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—It is generally preceded by a <hi>cardialgia,</hi> or heart burn, ſour belchings, and flatulences, with pain of the ſtomach and inteſtines. To theſe ſucceed exceſſive vomiting, and purging of green, yellow, or black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh coloured bile, with a diſtention of the ſtomach, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent griping pains. There is, likewiſe, a great thirſt, with a very quick unequal pulſe, and often a fixed acute pain about the region of the navel. As the diſeaſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the pulſe often ſinks ſo low as to become quite imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible, the extremities grow cold, or cramped, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with a clammy ſweat, the urine is obſtructed, and there is a palpitation of the heart. Violent hiccupping, fainting, and convulſions, are the ſigns of approaching death.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—At the beginning of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, the efforts of nature to expel the offending cauſe, muſt be aſſiſted, by promoting the purging and vomiting. For this purpoſe the patient muſt drink plenty of diluting liquors; as whey, butter milk, warm water, thin water gruel, ſmall poſſet, or, what is, perhaps, preferable to any of them, very weak chicken broth. This ſhould not only be drank freely, to promote the vomiting, but a clyſter of it given every hour, in order to promote the purging.</p>
                        <p>AFTER theſe evacuations have been continued for ſome time, a decoction of toaſted oat bread, may be drank to ſtop the vomiting. The bread ſhould be toaſted till it is of a brown colour, but not burned, and afterwards boiled in ſpring water. If oat bread cannot be had, wheat bread, or oat meal, well toaſted, may be uſed in its ſtead. If this does not put a ſtop to the vomiting, the ſaline mixture may be taken, as directed in page 175.</p>
                        <p>THE vomiting and purging, however, ought never to be ſtopped too ſoon. So long as theſe diſcharges do not
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:012338_0221_0F88EA356CE7E150"/>
weaken the patient they are ſalutary, and may be allowed to go on, or rather ought to be promoted. But when the patient is much exhauſted by the evacuations, or has a ſmall intermitting pulſe, coldneſs of the extremities, with other ſymptoms of weakneſs, recourſe muſt immediately be had to opiates, and generous cordial medicines. Ten or fifteen drops of liquid laudanum in half a glaſs of ſtrong cinnamon water, may be taken every four or five hours, till the violent ſymptoms be removed. Warm negas, or ſtrong wine whey, may likewiſe be taken to ſupport the patient's ſpirits, and promote the perſpiration. His legs may be rubbed with flannel cloths, or wrapped in warm blankets, and warm bricks applied to the ſoles of his feet.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the violence of the diſeaſe is over, to prevent a relapſe, it will be neceſſary, for ſome time, to continue the uſe of ſmall doſes of laudanum. Ten or twelve drops may be taken in a glaſs of wine, at leaſt twice a-day, for eight or ten days. The patient's food ought to be nouriſhing, but taken in ſmall quantities, and he ſhould uſe moderate exerciſe. As the ſtomach and inteſtines are generally much weakened, an infuſion of the bark, or other bitters, in ſmall wine may be drank for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH phyſicians are ſeldom called in due time in this diſeaſe, they ought not, however, to deſpair of relieving the patient, even in the moſt deſperate circumſtances. Of this I lately ſaw a very ſtriking inſtance in an old man and his ſon, who had been both ſeized with it about the middle of the night. I did not ſee them till next morning, when they had much more the appearance of dead than of living men. No pulſe could be felt; the extremities were quite cold and rigid; the countenance was ghaſtly, and the ſtrength quite exhauſted. Yet from this deplorable condition they were both recovered by the uſe of opiates and cordial medicines, with the regimen mentioned above.</p>

                        <p>A looſeneſs, in many caſes, is not to be conſidered as a diſeaſe, but rather as a ſalutary evacuation. It never ought to be ſtopped unleſs when it continues too long, or evidently weakens the patient. As this, however, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, we ſhall point out the moſt common cauſes of a looſeneſs, with the method of treatment proper in each caſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="218" facs="unknown:012338_0222_0F88EA362B46A4D0"/>
WHEN a looſeneſs is occaſioned by catching cold, or an obſtructed perſpiration, the patient ought to keep warm, to drink freely of weak diluting liquors, to bathe his feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water, to wear flannel next to his ſkin, and to take every other method to reſtore the perſpiration.</p>
                        <p>IN a looſeneſs which proceeds from exceſs or repletion, a vomit is the proper medicine. Vomits not only clean the ſtomach, but promote all the ſecretions, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>enders them of great importance in carrying off a debauch. Half a dram of ipecacuanha in powder will anſwer the purpoſe very well. A day or two after the vomit, the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of rhubarb may be taken, and repeated two or three times, if the looſeneſs continues. The patient ought to live upon light vegetable food, of eaſy digeſtion, and to drink whey, thin gruel, or ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>A looſeneſs occaſioned by the obſtruction of any cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary evacuation, as the bleeding piles in men, the monthly diſcharges in women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> generally requires bleeding. If that does not ſucceed, other evacuations, as iſſues, ſetons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſubſtituted in the room of thoſe which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. At the ſame time, every method is to be taken to reſtore the uſual diſcharges, as not only the cure of the diſeaſe, but the patient's life may depend on this.</p>
                        <p>A periodical looſeneſs ought never to be ſtopped. It is always an effort of nature to carry off ſome offending mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, if retained in the body, might produce fatal diſeaſes. Children are very liable to this kind of looſeneſs, eſpecially while teething. It is, however, ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurtful to them, that ſuch children generally get their teeth with leaſt trouble. If theſe looſe ſtools ſhould at any time prove ſour or griping, a tea ſpoonful of magneſia alba, with four or five grains of rhubarb, may be given to the child in a little pap or any other food. This, if repeated three or four times, will generally correct the acidity, and carry off the griping ſtools.</p>
                        <p>A diarrhoea, or looſeneſs which proceeds from violent paſſions or affections of the mind, muſt be treated with the greateſt caution. Vomits, in this caſe, are highly improper. Nor are purges ſafe, unleſs they be very mild, and given in ſmall quantities. Opiates, and other antiſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic medicines are moſt proper. Ten or twelve drops of liquid laudanum may be taken in a cup of valerian or pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyroyal tea, every eight or ten hours, till the ſymptoms
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:012338_0223_0F88EA3938CCBDB0"/>
abate. Eaſe, cheerfulneſs, and tranquillity of mind, are here of the greateſt importance.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a looſeneſs proceeds from acrid or poiſonous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances taken into the ſtomach, the patient muſt drink large quantities of diluting liquors, with oil or fat broths, to promote vomiting and purging. Afterwards, if the bowels are inflamed, bleeding will be neceſſary. Small do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of laudanum may likewiſe be taken to remove the ſpaſms and the irritation of the bowels.</p>
                        <p>WHEN gouty matter, repelled from the extremities, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions a looſeneſs, it is, by no means, to be ſtopped, but promoted by gentle doſes of rhubarb, or other mild purgatives. The gouty matter is likewiſe to be ſolicited to the extremities by warm fomentations, and cataplaſms. And the perſpiration ought to be promoted by warm diluting liquors; as wine whey, with ſpirits of hartſhorn, or a few drops of liquid laudanum in it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a looſeneſs proceeds from worms, ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ought to be uſed as kill or carry off theſe vermin; as powder of tin, with purges of rhubarb and calomel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The proper doſes of theſe medicines will be pointed out when we come to treat of diſeaſes occaſioned by worms.</p>
                        <p>A looſeneſs is often occaſioned by bad water. When this is the caſe, the diſeaſe generally proves epidemical. When there is reaſon to believe that this, or any other diſeaſe, proceeds from the uſe of unwholeſome water, it ought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be changed, or, if that cannot be done, it may be corrected by mixing with it quicklime, chalk, or the like.</p>
                        <p>IN people whoſe ſtomachs are weak, violent exerciſe immediately after meals, will occaſion a looſeneſs. Though the cure of this is obvious, yet it will be proper, beſides avoiding violent exerciſe, to uſe ſuch medicines as tend to brace and ſtrengthen the ſtomach; as infuſions of the bark, with other bitter and aſtringent medicines, in white wine. The perſon ought, likewiſe, to take frequently a glaſs or two of old red port, or good claret.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who, from a peculiar weakneſs, or too great an irritability of the bowels, are liable to frequent returns of this diſeaſe, ſhould live temperately, avoiding crude ſummer fruits, all unwholeſome food, and meats of hard digeſtion. They ought, likewiſe, to beware of cold, moiſture, or whatever may obſtruct the perſpiration, and ſhould wear flannel next their ſkin. All violent paſſions of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:012338_0224_0F88EA3ADD80D370"/>
the mind, as fear, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are likewiſe carefully to be avoided.</p>

                        <p>THIS diſeaſe prevails in the ſpring and autumn. It is very infectious, and often epidemical. Thoſe perſons are moſt liable to it who are much expoſed to the night air, or who live in places where the air is confined and unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Hence it often proves fatal in camps, on ſhipboard, in jails, hoſpitals, and ſuch like places.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—This diſeaſe may be occaſioned by any thing that obſtructs the perſpiration, or renders the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours putrid; as damp beds, wet cloaths, unwholeſome diet, air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is moſt frequently communicated by infection. This ought to make people extremely cautious in going near ſuch perſons as labour under the diſeaſe. Even the ſmell of the patient's excrements has been known to communicate the infection.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—It is known by a flux of the belly, attended with a violent pain of the bowels, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant inclination to go to ſtool, and generally leſs or more of blood in the ſtools. It begins, like other fevers, with chill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, loſs of ſtrength, a quick pulſe, great thirſt, and an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to vomit. The ſtools are at firſt greaſy or frothy, afterwards they are ſtreaked with blood, and, at laſt, have frequently the appearance of pure blood, mixed with ſmall filaments, or bits of ſkin, which is part of the internal coat of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines abraded by the acrimony of the foeces. Sometimes, however, there is no blood in the ſtools through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. When the patient goes to ſtool, he feels a bearing down, as if the whole bowels were falling out, and ſometimes a part of the inteſtine is actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded, which proves exceeding troubleſome, eſpecially in children.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may be diſtinguiſhed from the diarrhoea, or looſeneſs, by the acute pain of the bowels, and the blood which generally appears in the ſtools. It may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>cholera morbus,</hi> by its not being attended with ſuch violent and frequent fits of vomiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN the dyſentery attacks the old, the delicate, or ſuch as have been waſted by ſcorbutic, conſumptive, or other lingering diſeaſes, it generally proves fatal. Vomiting and hiccupping are bad ſigns, as they ſhew an inflammation
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012338_0225_0F88EA3B93BB0A68"/>
of the ſtomach. When the ſtools have an exceeding diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſmell, are green, black, or mixed with ſmall glandular ſubſtances, or bits of ſkin, the danger is great. It is an unfavourable ſymptom when clyſters are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned; but ſtill more ſo, when the paſſage is ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſhut, that they cannot be injected. A weak pulſe, coldneſs of the extremities, with difficulty of ſwallowing, and convulſions, are ſigns of approaching death.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Nothing is of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this diſeaſe than cleanlineſs. It contributes great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the recovery of the patient, and no leſs to the ſafety of ſuch as attend him. In all contagious diſeaſes, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is increaſed, and the infection ſpread, by the neglect of cleanlineſs; but in none more than in this. Every thing about the patient ſhould be frequently changed. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements ſhould never be ſuffered to continue in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but removed immediately, and buried under ground. A co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                        <p>THE patient muſt not be diſcouraged, but his ſpirits kept up in hopes of a cure. Nothing tends more to render any putrid diſeaſe mortal than the fears and apprehenſions of the ſick. All diſeaſes of this nature have a tendency to ſink and depreſs the ſpirits, and, when that is increaſed by fears and alarms, from thoſe whom the patient believes to be perſons of ſkill, it cannot fail to have the worſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                        <p>A flannel veſt worn next the ſkin has often a very good effect in a dyſentery. This promotes the perſpiration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greatly heating the body. Great caution, however, is neceſſary in leaving it off. I have often known a dyſentery brought on by imprudently throwing off a flannel veſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeaſon was ſufficiently hot. For, whatever pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this piece of dreſs be worn, it ſhould never be left off but in a warm ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>IN this diſeaſe the greateſt attention muſt be paid to the patient's diet. Fleſh, fiſh, and every thing that has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to turn putrid or rancid on the ſtomach, muſt be abſtained from. Apples boiled in milk, water pap, and plain light pudding, with broth made of the gelatinous parts of animals, may be eat. Jelly broth not only anſwers the purpoſe of food, but likewiſe of medicine. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                           </gap>y it, after pompous medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines had proved ineffectual<note n="*" place="bottom">THE manner of making this broth is, to take a ſheep's head and feet with the ſkin upon them, and to burn the wool off with a hot iron, in the manner they do in Scotland. Afterwards to boil them till the broth is quite a jelly. A little cinnamon or mace may be added, to give the broth an agreeable flavour, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may take a little of it warm, with toaſted bread, three or four times a-day. A clyſter of it may, likewiſe, be given twice a-day. Such as cannot uſe the broth made in this way, may have the head and feet ſkinned; but we have reaſon to believe, that this hurts the medicine. It is not our buſineſs here to reaſon upon the nature and qualities of medicines, otherwiſe this might be ſhewn to poſſeſs virtues every way ſuited to the cure of a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery which does not proceed from a putrid ſtate of the humours. One thing we know, which is preferable to all reaſoning, that whole families have often been cured by it, after they had uſed many other medicines in vain. It will, however, be proper that the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent take a vomit, and a doſe or two of rhubarb, before he begins to uſe the broth. It will, likewiſe, be neceſſary to continue the uſe of it for a conſiderable time, and to make it the principal food.</note>.</p>
                        <p>ANOTHER kind of food very proper in the dyſentery, which may be uſed by ſuch as cannot take the broth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, is made by boiling a few handfuls of fine flour, tied in a cloth, for ſix or ſeven hours, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as hard as ſtarch. Two or three table ſpoonfuls of this may be grated down, and boiled in ſuch a quantity of new milk and water as to be of the thickneſs of pap. This may be ſweetened to the patient's taſte, and taken for his ordinary food<note n="†" place="bottom">THE learned Dr. Rutherford, late profeſſor of medicine in the univerſity of Edinburgh, uſed to mention this medicine in his public lectures with great encomiums. He directed it to be made by tying three or four handfuls of the fineſt flour, as tight as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a linen rag, afterwards to dip it frequently in water, and to dridge the outſide with flour till a cake or cruſt be formed around it, which prevents the water from ſoaking into it while boiling. It is then to be boiled till it becomes a hard dry maſs, as directed above. This will not only anſwer the purpoſe of food, but may likewiſe be given in clyſters.</note>.</p>
                        <p>THE patient may likewiſe be allowed to eat freely of moſt kinds of good ripe fruit; as apples, grapes, currant ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſtrawberries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may either be eat raw or boiled, with or without milk, as the patient chooſes. The prejudice againſt fruit in this diſeaſe is ſo great, that many believe it to be the common cauſe of dyſenteries. This, however, is an egregious miſtake. Both reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhew, that good fruit is one of the beſt medicines,
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:012338_0227_0F88EA3CF38FA560"/>
both for the prevention and cure of the moſt dangerous kind of dyſentery. In a dyſentery ariſing from a putrid ſtate of humours, fruit is, in every reſpect, calculated to counteract that tendency to putrefaction, from whence all the danger proceeds. The patient, in ſuch a caſe, ought, therefore, to be allowed to eat as much fruit as he pleaſes, provided it be good<note n="*" place="bottom">I lately attended a young gentleman who had been ſeized with a dyſentery in North America. All means had been tried for his relief, but to no purpoſe. At length, tired out with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from medicine, and reduced to ſkin and bone, he came over to Britain, rather with a view to die among his relations than with any hopes of a cure. After trying ſundry medicines here, with no better ſucceſs than abroad, I adviſed him to leave off the uſe of drugs, and to truſt entirely to a diet of milk and fruits, with gentle exerciſe. Strawberries was the only fruit he could procure at that ſeaſon. Theſe he eat with milk twice, and, ſometimes, thrice a-day. The conſequence was, that, in a ſhort time, his ſtools were reduced from upwards of twenty in a day to three or four, and ſometimes not ſo many. He uſed the other fruits as they came in, and was, in a few weeks, ſo well as to leave the part of the country where I was, with a view to return to America.</note>.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper drink in this diſorder is whey. The dyſentery has often been cured by the uſe of clear whey alone. It may be taken both for drink, and in form of a clyſter. When whey cannot be had, barley water, ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with cream of tartar, may be drank, or a decoction of barley and tamarinds; two ounces of the former, and one of the latter, may be boiled in two Engliſh quarts of water to one. Warm water, water gruel, or water where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hot iron has been frequently quenched, are all very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and may be drank in turns. Camomile tea, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> the ſtomach will bear it, is an exceeding proper drink. It both ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and by its antiſeptic quality, tends to prevent a mortification of the bowels.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—At the beginning of this diſeaſe it is always neceſſary to cleanſe the firſt paſſages. For this purpoſe, a vomit of ipecacuanha muſt be given, and wrought off with weak camomile tea. Strong vomits are ſeldom neceſſary here. A ſcruple, or at moſt half a dram of ipecacuanha, is generally ſufficient for an adult, and, ſometimes, a very few grains will ſuffice. The day after the vomit, half a dram, or two ſcruples of rhubarb, muſt be taken. This doſe may be repeated every other day for two or three times. Afterwards ſmall doſes of ipecacuanha
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:012338_0228_0F88EA3E8DDC5318"/>
may be taken for ſome time. Two or three grains of the powder may be mixed in a table ſpoonful of the ſyrup of poppies, and taken three times a-day.</p>
                        <p>THESE evacuations, and the regimen preſcribed above, will ſeldom fail to perform the cure. Should it, however, happen otherwiſe, the following aſtringent medicines muſt be uſed.</p>
                        <p>A clyſter of ſtarch or fat mutton broth, with twenty or thirty drops of liquid laudanum in it, may be adminiſtered twice a-day. At the ſame time, an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of gum tragacanth, may be diſſolved in an Engliſh pint of barley water, over a ſlow fire, and a table ſpoonful of it taken every hour.</p>
                        <p>IF theſe have not the deſired effect, the patient may take four times a day, about the bulk of a nutmeg of the <hi>

                              </gap>aponic confection,</hi> drinking after it a tea cupful of the decoction of logwood; which may be thus made: Boil three or four ounces of the ſhavings of logwood in two Engliſh quarts of water to one; towards the end, add two drams of cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bark. This decoction gives the ſtools a reddiſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which is ſometimes miſtaken for blood. We menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this circumſtance to prevent the patient from being alarmed at their appearance.</p>
                        <p>SOME have treated dyſenteries very ſucceſsfully, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the patient white wax diſſolved in milk. Others extol the virtues of the <hi>Corneſſi</hi> root, the <hi>Simaruba</hi> bark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the cure of this diſeaſe. When other medicines fail, theſe ſtrong aſtringents may be tried; but we hope they will ſeldom be found neceſſary. At any rate, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, or binding medicines, never are to be uſed till proper evacuations have been premiſed, otherwiſe they will fix the diſeaſe inſtead of removing it.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who have been cured of this diſeaſe are very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a relapſe; to prevent which, great circumſpection with reſpect to diet is neceſſary. The patient muſt abſtain from all fermented liquors, except now and then a glaſs of good wine; but he muſt drink no kind of malt liquor. He muſt, likewiſe, abſtain from animal food, as fiſh and fleſh, and muſt live principally upon milk and vegetables.</p>
                        <p>GENTLE exerciſe, and wholeſome air, are likewiſe of importance. The patient ſhould go to the country as ſoon as his ſtrength will permit, and ſhould take exerciſe daily on horſeback, or in a machine. He may, likewiſe, uſe bitters infuſed in wine or brandy, and may drink twice
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:012338_0229_0F88EA3F2DE95F48"/>
a-day a gill of lime water, mixed with an equal quantity of new milk.</p>
                        <p>WHEN dyſenteries prevail, we would recommend a ſtrict attention to cleanlineſs, a ſpare uſe of animal food, and the free uſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ound ripe fruits, and other vegetables. The night air is to be carefully avoided, and all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the ſick. Bad ſmells are likewiſe to be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eſpecially thoſe which ariſe from putrid animal ſubſtances. The office houſes where the ſick go are very dangerous. Nothing is more apt to occaſion the diſeaſe than being greatly afraid of it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the firſt ſymptoms of the dyſentery appear, the patient ought immediately to take a vomit, to go to bed, and drink plentifully of weak, warm liquor, to promote a ſweat. This, with a doſe or two of rhubarb, would often carry off the diſeaſe at the beginning. In countries where dyſenteries prevail, we would adviſe ſuch as are liable to them, to take either a vomit or a doſe of phyſic every ſpring and autumn, as a preventive.</p>
                        <p>THERE are ſundry other fluxes of the belly, as the <hi>lien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> and <hi>coeliac paſſion,</hi> which, though leſs dangerous than the dyſentery, yet merit conſideration. Theſe diſeaſes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally proceed from a relaxed ſtate of the ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, which is ſometimes ſo great, that the food paſſes through them, without almoſt any ſenſible alteration; and the patient dies merely from the want of nouriſhment.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the lientary or coeliac paſſion ſucceed a dyſentery, they often prove fatal. They are always dangerous in old age, eſpecially when the conſtitution has been broken by exceſs, or acute diſeaſes. If the ſtools be very frequent, and quite crude, the thirſt great, with little urine, the mouth ulcerated, and the face marked with ſpots of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent colours, the danger is very great.</p>
                        <p>THE treatment of the patient is in general the ſame as in the dyſentery. In all obſtinate fluxes of the belly, from whatever cauſe, the cure muſt be attempted, by firſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtomach and bowels with gentle vomits and purges. Afterwards, ſuch a diet as has a tendency to brace and ſtrengthen the bowels, with opiates and aſtringent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, will generally perfect the cure.</p>
                        <p>THIS obſervation, likewiſe, holds with reſpect to a <hi>teneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or frequent deſire of going to ſtool. It reſembles the dyſentery ſo much, both in its ſymptoms and method of cure, that we think it needleſs to inſiſt upon it.</p>

                        <head>OF A DIABETES, OR EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE OF URINE.</head>
                        <p>THE diabetes may be called a flux of the kidneys. It is ſeldom to be met with among young people; but I have often known it happen to labourers in the decline of life, eſpecially thoſe who followed the more violent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and who had been hard drinkers in their youth.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—A diabetes is often the conſequence of acute diſeaſes, as fevers, fluxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the patient has ſuffered exceſſive evacuations; it may alſo be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by exceſſive fatigue, as riding long journies upon a hard trotting horſe, carrying heavy burdens, running, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may be brought on by the uſe of ſtrong ſtimulating diuretic medicines, as tincture of cantharides, ſpirits of turpentine, and ſuch like. It is often the effect of drinking large quantities of mineral waters. Many imagine that theſe will do them no ſervice unleſs they be drank in large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, by which miſtake it happens, that they often occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worſe diſeaſes than thoſe they were taken to cure. In a word, this diſeaſe may either proceed from too great a laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the organs which ſecrete the urine, from ſomething that ſtimulates the kidneys too much, or from a thin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved ſtate of the blood, which makes too great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it run off by the urinary paſſages.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—In a diabetes the urine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally exceeds in quantity all the liquid food and drink which the patient takes. It is thin and pale, of a ſweetiſh taſte, and an agreeable ſmell. The patient has a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thirſt, with ſome degree of fever; his mouth is dry, and he ſpits frequently a frothy ſpittle. The ſtrength fails, the appetite decays, and the fleſh waſtes away, till the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is reduced to ſkin and bone. There is a heat of the bowels; and frequently the loins, teſticles, and feet are ſwelled.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may be cured at the beginning; but, after it has continued long, the cure becomes very difficult. In drunkards, and very old people, a cure is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Every thing that ſtimulates the urinary paſſages, or tends to relax the habit, muſt be avoided. The patient ſhould live chiefly on ſolid food. His thirſt may be quenched with acids, or ſorrel, juice of lemon, or vinegar. The mucilaginous vegetables, as rice, ſago,

                        </p>
                        <p>THE drink may be Briſtol water. When that cannot be obtained, lime water with milk may be drank. This will be better if an ounce of gum Arabic be diſſolved in every pound of it. The white decoction, with iſinglaſs diſſolved in it, is likewiſe a very proper drink. It is made by boiling two ounces of calcined hartſhorn, and half an ounce of gum Arabic, in three Engliſh pints of water to two, and afterwards ſtraining it.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ought daily to take exerciſe, but it ſhould be ſo gentle as not to fatigue him. He ſhould lie upon a hard bed or matreſs. Nothing hurts the kidneys more than ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſoft. A warm dry air, the uſe of the fleſh bruſh, and every thing that promotes perſpiration, is of ſervice. For this reaſon, the patient ought to wear flannel next his ſkin. A large ſtrengthening plaſter may be applied to the back; or, what will anſwer the ſame end, a broad girdle may be worn about the loins.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Gentle purges, if the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent be not too much weakened by the diſeaſe, have a good effect. They tend to promote a flux of the humours towards the inteſtines, and, of courſe, to leſſen the diſcharge by the kidneys. They may conſiſt of rhubarb, with cardamum ſeeds, or any other ſpiceries, infuſed in wine, and may be taken in ſuch quantities as to keep the belly gently open.</p>
                        <p>THE patient muſt next have recourſe to aſtringents and corroborants. Half a dram of powder, made of equal parts of allum and the gum called <hi>dragon's blood,</hi> may be taken four times a-day, or oftener if the ſtomach will bear it. The allum muſt firſt be melted in a crucible; afterwards they may both be pounded together. Along with every doſe of this powder the patient may take a tea cupful of the tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of roſes. It is made by infuſing in a ſtone ware veſſel, for four hours, an ounce of the dried leaves of red roſes, with one dram of ſpirit of vitriol, in two Engliſh pints of boiling water. Afterwards the tincture may be filtered, and four or five ounces of white ſugar added to it.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient's ſtomach cannot bear the allum in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whey may be made of it, and taken in the doſe of three or four ounces three times a-day. The allum whey is prepared by boiling two Engliſh quarts of milk over a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

fire, with three drams of allum, till it be turned into whey.</p>
                        <p>OPIATES are of ſervice in this diſeaſe, even though the patient reſts well. They take off ſpaſms and irritation, and, at the ſame time, leſſen the force of the circulation. Ten or twelve drops of liquid laudanum may be taken in a cup of the patient's drink two or three times a-day.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt corroborants which we know, are the Jeſuits bark and wine. A dram of bark may be taken in a glaſs of red port or claret, three times a-day. The medicine will be more efficacious and leſs diſagreeable, if fifteen or twenty drops of the acid elixir of vitriol be added to every doſe. Such as cannot take the bark in ſubſtance, may uſe the decoction, mixed with an equal quantity of red wine, and ſharpened as above.</p>
                        <p>THERE is a diſeaſe pretty incident to labouring people in the decline of life, called an <hi>incontinency of urine.</hi> This differs intirely from a diabetes, as the water paſſes off invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily by drops, and does not exceed the uſual quantity. This diſeaſe is rather troubleſome than dangerous. It is owing to a relaxation of the ſpincter of the bladder, and is often the effect of a palſy. Sometimes it proceeds from hurts, or injuries occaſioned by blows, bruiſes, preternatural la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes it is the effect of a fever. It may, likewiſe, be occaſioned by a long uſe of ſtrong diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics, or of ſtimulating medicines, injected into the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may be mitigated by the uſe of aſtringent and corroborating medicines, ſuch as have been mentioned above; but we do not remember ever to have ſeen it cured.</p>

                        <p>IT has already been obſerved, that a ſuppreſſion of urine may proceed from various cauſes; as an inflammation of the kidneys, or bladder; ſmall ſtones or gravel lodged in the urinary paſſages, hard foeces lying in the <hi>rectum,</hi> a ſpaſm, or contraction of the neck of the bladder, clotted blood in the bladder, a ſwelling of the haemorrhoidal veins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SOME of theſe caſes require the cathater, both to remove the obſtructing matter, and to draw off the urine; but as this inſtrument can only be managed with ſafety by perſons ſkilled in ſurgery, we ſhall ſay nothing further of its uſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="229" facs="unknown:012338_0233_0F88EA43A36E1D38"/>
WE would chiefly recommend, in all obſtructions of urine, fomentations and evacuations. If the patient be young, of a full habit, and if his pulſe be hard, frequent bleeding will be neceſſary, eſpecially where there are ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a topical inflammation. Bleeding, in this caſe, not only abates the fever, by leſſening the force of the circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by relaxing the ſolids, takes off the ſpaſm, or ſtricture upon the veſſels, which occaſioned the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>AFTER bleeding, fomentations muſt be uſed. Theſe may either conſiſt of warm water alone, or decoctions of mild vegetables; as mallows, camomile flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cloths dipped in theſe may either be applied to the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or a large bladder, filled with the decoction, may be kept continually upon it. Some put the herbs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a flannel bag, and apply them to the part, which is far from being a bad method. Theſe continue longer warm than cloths dipped in the decoction, and, at the ſame time, keep the part equally moiſt.</p>
                        <p>IN all obſtructions of urine, the belly ought to be kept open. This is not, however, to be attempted by briſk purgatives, but by emollient clyſters, or gentle infuſions of ſenna and manna. Clyſters, in this caſe, not only open the belly, but anſwer the purpoſe of an internal fomentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and greatly aſſiſt in removing ſpaſms of the bladder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE food muſt be light, and taken in ſmall quantities. The drink may be weak broth, or decoctions and infuſions of mucilaginous vegetables, as marſh mallow roots, lime tree buds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A tea ſpoonful of the ſweet ſpirits of nitre, or a dram of Caſtile ſoap, may be frequently put into the patient's drink; and, if there be no inflammation, he may drink ſmall gin punch, without acid.</p>
                        <p>IN a ſuppreſſion of urine, nature often attempts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the patient by a ſweat, looſeneſs, ſpitting, gulping up of clear water from the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe diſcharges ought not to be ſuppreſſed, but encouraged, as the patient's life often depends upon them.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS ſubject to a ſuppreſſion of urine, ought to live very temperate. Their diet ſhould be light, and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor diluting.

                        <p>NO perſon can long enjoy good health, who does not go regularly to ſtool. There is, however, a very great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of perſons in this reſpect, ſome being able to bear coſtiveneſs much longer than others. We do not here mean to treat of thoſe aſtrictions of the bowels, which are the ſymptoms of diſeaſes, as in the colic, the iliac paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only to take notice of that infrequency of ſtools which ſometimes happens, and which, in ſome particular conſtitutions, may occaſion diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>COSTIVENESS may proceed from an exceſſive heat of the liver; drinking rough red wines, or other aſtringent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; too much exerciſe, eſpecially on horſeback: It may, likewiſe, proceed from a long uſe of cold inſipid food, which does not ſufficiently ſtimulate the inteſtines. Sometimes it is owing to the bile not deſcending to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, as in the jaundice; and, at other times, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from diſeaſes of the inteſtines themſelves, as a palſy, ſpaſms, tumours, a cold dry ſtate of the inteſtines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>WHEN coſtiveneſs is conſtitutional, it may be borne a long time without any bad effects; but when it proceeds from an inflammation or tumour in the inteſtines, it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

He, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, obſerves, that all watery ſubſtances are lenitive, and that even common water, whey, ſour milk, and butter milk, have that effect.—That new milk, eſpecially aſſes milk, ſtimulates ſtill more, when it ſours on the ſtomach; and that whey turned ſour, will purge ſtrongly.—That moſt garden fruits are likewiſe lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative; and, that ſome of them, as grapes, will throw ſuch, as take them immoderately, into a cholera morbus, or incurable diarrhoea.</p>
                           </note> THOSE who are troubled with coſtiveneſs ought, if poſſible, to remedy it by diet, as the conſtant uſe of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for that purpoſe, is attended with many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, and often with bad conſequences. I never knew any one get into a habit of taking medicine for keeping the belly open, who could leave it off. In time, the cuſtom becomes neceſſary, and, generally, ends in a total relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the bowels, indigeſtion, loſs of appetite, waſting of the ſtrength, and death.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the belly cannot be kept open without medicine, we would recommend gentle doſes of rhubarb to be taken twice or thrice a-week. This is not near ſo injurious to the ſtomach, as aloes, jalep, or the other draſtic purgatives ſo much in uſe. Infuſion of ſenna and manna may, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, be taken; or, half an ounce of ſoluble tartar, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in water gruel.

                        <p>SPONTANEOUS, or involuntary diſcharges of blood, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen from various parts of the body.

When ſuch diſcharges are critical, which is frequently the caſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> fevers, they ought not to be ſtopped. Nor, indeed, is it proper, at any time, to ſtop them, unleſs they be ſo great as to endanger the patient's life. Moſt people, afraid of the ſmalleſt appearance of blood from any part of the body, fly immediately to the uſe of ſtiptic and aſtringent medicines, by which means an inflammation of the brain, or ſome other fatal diſeaſe, is occaſioned, which, had the diſcharge been allowed to go on, might have been prevented.</p>
                        <p>PERIODICAL diſcharges of blood, from whatever part of the body they proceed, muſt not be ſtopped. Theſe are always the efforts of nature to relieve herſelf, and fatal diſeaſes have often been the conſequence of obſtructing them. It may, indeed, be ſometimes neceſſary to check the violence of ſuch diſcharges; but even this requires the greateſt caution. Inſtances may be given where the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a ſmall periodical flux of blood, from one of the fingers, has proved fatal to the perſon's health.</p>
                        <p>IN the early period of life, bleeding at the noſe is moſt common. Thoſe who are farther advanced in life, are more liable to a haemoptoe, or diſcharge of blood from the lungs. After the middle period of life, haemorrhoidal fluxes are moſt common, and in the decline of life, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of blood from the urinary paſſages.</p>
                        <p>INVOLUNTARY fluxes of blood may proceed from very different, and often from quite oppoſite cauſes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are hereditary, or owing to a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the body, as a ſanguine temperament, a lax or plethoric habit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes they proceed from a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the blood towards one particular part, as the head, the haemorrhoidal veins. They may likewiſe proceed from an inflammatory diſpoſition of the blood, in which caſe, there is generally ſome degree of fever; this, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, happens when the flux is occaſioned by an obſtructed perſpiration, or a ſtricture upon the ſkin, the bowels, or any particular part of the ſyſtem.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="233" facs="unknown:012338_0237_0F88EA476EB371C0"/>
BUT a diſſolved ſtate of the blood will, likewiſe, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion haemorrhages. Thus, in putrid fevers, the ſcurvy, the malignant ſmall-pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there are often very great diſcharges of blood from different parts of the body. They may, likewiſe, be brought on by the uſe of any medicines which tend to diſſolve the blood, as mercury, cantharides, and the volatile alcaline ſalts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Food of an acrid or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating quality, may, likewiſe, occaſion haemorrhages; as alſo ſtrong purges and vomits, or any thing that greatly ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulates the bowels.</p>
                        <p>VIOLENT paſſions, or agitations of the mind, will alſo occaſion haemorrhages. Theſe often cauſe bleeding at the noſe, and I have known them ſometimes occaſion an haemorrhage in the brain. Violent efforts of the body, by overſtraining or hurting the veſſels, may, likewiſe, bring on haemorrhages, eſpecially when the body is long kept in an unnatural poſture, as hanging the head very low, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE cure of an haemorrhage muſt be adapted to its cauſe. When it proceeds from too much blood, or a tendency to inflammation, bleeding, with gentle purges, and other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, will be neceſſary. It will, likewiſe, be proper for the patient, in that caſe, to live chiefly upon a vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diet, to avoid all ſtrong liquors, and food that is of an acrid, hot, or ſtimulating quality. The body ſhould be kept cool, and the mind eaſy.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an haemorrhage is owing to a putrid or diſſolved ſtate of the blood, the patient ought to live chiefly upon acid fruits with milk, and vegetables of a nouriſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſago, ſalop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His drink may be wine diluted with water, and ſharpened with the juice of lemon, vinegar, or ſpirits of vitriol. The beſt medicine, in this caſe, is the Jeſuits bark. It may be taken as directed in page 228.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a flux of blood is the effect of acrid food, or of ſtrong ſtimulating medicines, the cure is to be effected by ſuch ſoft and mucilaginous diet as is recommended in the dyſentery or bloody-flux. The patient may, likewiſe, take frequently about the bulk of a nutmeg of Locatelli's bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, or the ſame quantity of ſpermaceti.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an obſtructed perſpiration, or a ſtricture upon any part of the ſyſtem, is the cauſe of an haemorrhage, it may be removed by drinking warm diluting liquors, lying in bed, bathing the extremities in warm water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>A bleeding at the noſe is commonly preceded by ſome degree of quickneſs of the pulſe, a fluſhing of the face, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the temporal arteries, heavineſs in the head, dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſight, heat and itching of the noſtrils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>TO perſons who abound with blood, this diſcharge is very ſalutary. It often cures a vertigo, the headach, a phrenzy, and even an epilepſy. In fevers, where there is a great determination of blood towards the head, it is of the utmoſt ſervice. It is, likewiſe, beneficial in inflammations of the liver and ſpleen, and often in the gout and rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. In all diſeaſes where evacuations are neceſſary, a ſpontaneous diſcharge of blood from the noſe, is of much more ſervice than the ſame quantity let with a lancet.</p>
                        <p>IN a diſcharge of blood from the noſe, the great point is, to determine whether it ought to be ſtopped or not. It is a common practice to ſtop the bleeding without conſidering whether it be a diſeaſe, or the cure of a diſeaſe. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct proceeds from fear; but it has many bad, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even fatal conſequences.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a diſcharge of blood from the noſe happens in an inflammatory diſeaſe, there is always reaſon to believe, that it may prove ſalutary; and, therefore, it ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go on, at leaſt as long as the patient ſeems to bear it well.</p>
                        <p>WHEN it happens to perſons in perfect health, who are full of blood, it ought not to be ſtopped; eſpecially if the ſymptoms of a plethora, mentioned above, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded it. In this caſe, it cannot be ſtopped without riſking the patient's life.</p>
                        <p>IN fine, whenever bleeding at the noſe relieves any bad ſymptom, and does not proceed ſo far as to endanger the patient's life, it ought not to be ſtopped. But when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns frequently, or continues till the pulſe becomes very low, the extremities begin to grow cold, the lips pale, or the patient complains of being ſick, or like to faint, it muſt immediately be ſtopped.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould be ſet nearly upright, with his head inclining a little backwards, and his legs immerſed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about the warmth of new milk. His hands ought, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to be put in lukewarm water, and his garters may be tied a little tighter than uſual, about three inches above the knee. Ligatures may, likewiſe, be applied to the arms,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:012338_0239_0F88EA4B71BF90B0"/>
about the place where they are uſually made for bleeding, and with nearly the ſame degree of tightneſs. Theſe muſt be gradually ſlackened as the blood begins to ſtop, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved intirely as ſoon as it gives over.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES, dry lint put up the noſtrils will ſtop the bleeding. When this does not ſucceed, doſſils of lint dipped in ſtrong ſpirits of wine, may be put up the noſtrils, or, if that cannot be had, they may be dipped in brandy. Roman vitriol diſſolved in water may, likewiſe, be uſed for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or a tent dipped in the white of an egg well beat up, may be rolled in a powder made of equal parts of white ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, burnt allum, and white vitriol, and put up the noſtril from whence the blood iſſues.</p>
                        <p>INTERNAL medicines can hardly take place here, as they have ſeldom time to operate. It may not, however, be amiſs to give the patient half an ounce of Glauber's ſalt, and the ſame quantity of manna, diſſolved in four or five ounces of barley water. This may be taken at a draught, and repeated if it does not operate in a few hours. Ten or twelve grains of nitre may be taken in a glaſs of cold water and vinegar every hour, or oftener, if the ſtomach will bear it. If a ſtronger medicine be neceſſary, a tea cupful of the tincture of roſes, made as directed in page 227, with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty drops of the ſmall ſpirit of vitriol, may be taken every hour. When theſe things cannot be had, the patient may drink water, with a little common ſalt in it, or equal parts of water and vinegar.</p>
                        <p>IF the genitals be immerſed in cold water, it will gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſtop a bleeding at the noſe.—I have never known this fail.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES, when the blood is ſtopped outwardly, it continues to bleed inwardly. This is very dangerous, and requires particular attention, as the patient is apt to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated with the blood, eſpecially if he falls aſleep, which be is very ready to do after loſing a great quantity of blood.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the bleeding is ſtopped, the patient ought to be kept as eaſy and quiet as poſſible. He ought not to pick his noſe, nor to take away the tents or clotted blood, till they fall off of their own accord, and ſhould not lie with his head too low.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who are affected with frequent bleeding at the noſe, ought to bathe their feet often in warm water, and keep them warm and dry. They ought to wear nothing tight about their necks, to keep their body as much in an erect poſture as poſſible, and never to view any object
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:012338_0240_0F88EA4E97956E08"/>
obliquely. If they have too much blood, a vegetable diet, with now and then a doſe of phyſic, is the ſafeſt way to leſſen it.</p>
                        <p>BUT when the diſeaſe proceeds from a thin diſſolved ſtate of the blood, the diet ſhould be rich and nouriſhing; as ſtrong broths with bread, ſago gruel with wine and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Infuſions of the Jeſuits bark in wine, ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be taken, and perſiſted in for a conſiderable time.</p>

                        <p>A diſcharge of blood from the haemorrhoidal veſſels is called the <hi>bleeding piles.</hi> When the veſſels only ſwell, and diſcharge no blood, but are exceeding painful, the diſeaſe is called the <hi>blind piles.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>PERSONS of a looſe ſpungy texture, of a bulky ſize, who live high, and lead a ſedentary and inactive life, are moſt ſubject to this diſeaſe. It is often owing to a hereditary diſpoſition. Where this is the caſe, it attacks perſons more early in life than when it is accidental. Men are more liable to it than women, eſpecially thoſe of a ſanguine plethoric habit, or of a melancholy diſpoſition.</p>
                        <p>THE piles may be occaſioned by an exceſs of blood, by ſtrong aloetic purges, high ſeaſoned food, drinking great quantities of ſweet wines, the neglect of bleeding, or other cuſtomary evacuations, much riding, great coſtiveneſs, or any thing that occaſions hard or difficult ſtools. Anger, grief, and other violent paſſions, will likewiſe occaſion the piles. I have often known them brought on by cold, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the <hi>anus.</hi> A pair of thin breeches will occaſion the diſorder in a perſon who is ſubject to it, and ſometimes even in thoſe who never had it before. Pregnant women are often afflicted with the piles.</p>
                        <p>A flux of blood from the <hi>anus</hi> is not always to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diſeaſe. It is even more ſalutary than bleeding at the noſe, and often prevents or carries off diſeaſes. It is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly beneficial in the gout, rheumatiſm, aſthmas, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal complaints, and often proves critical in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, and inflammatory fevers.</p>
                        <p>IN the treatment of this diſeaſe, regard muſt be had to the patient's habit of body, his age, ſtrength, and manner of living. A diſcharge which might be exceſſive and prove hurtful to one, may be very moderate, and even ſalutary to another. That only is to be eſteemed dangerous which</p>

He may, likewiſe, apply a linen cloth dipped in warm ſpirits of wine to the part, or poultices made of bread and milk, or of leeks fried with butter. If theſe do not produce a diſcharge, and the piles appear large, leeches muſt be applied as near the piles as poſſible, or if they will fix upon the piles themſelves ſo much the better. When leeches will not fix, the piles may be opened with a lancet. The operation is very eaſy, and is attended with no danger.</p>
                        <p>VARIOUS ointments, and other external applications, are recommended in the piles; but I do not remember ever to have ſeen any effects from theſe worth mentioning. Their principal uſe is to keep the part ſoft, which may be done equally well by a ſoft poultice or an emollient cataplaſm.</p>

                        <head>SPITTING OF BLOOD.</head>
                        <p>WE only mean here to treat of that diſcharge of blood from the lungs, which commonly goes by the name of an <hi>haemoptoe,</hi> or <hi>ſpitting of blood.</hi> Perſons of a ſlender make, and a lax fibre, who have long necks and ſtrait breaſts, are moſt liable to this diſeaſe. It is moſt common in the ſpring, and generally attacks people before they arrive at the prime or middle period of life. It is a common obſervation, that thoſe who have been ſubject to bleeding at the noſe when young, are afterwards moſt liable to an haemoptoe.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—An haemoptoe may proceed from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of blood, from a peculiar weakneſs of the lungs, or a bad conformation of the breaſt. It is often occaſioned by exceſſive drinking, running, wreſtling, ſinging, or ſpeaking aloud. Such as have weak lungs ought to avoid all violent exertions of that organ, as they value life. They ſhould, likewiſe guard againſt violent paſſions, and every thing that occaſions a rapid circulation of the blood.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe may likewiſe proceed from wounds of the lungs. Theſe may either be received from without, or they may be occaſioned by hard bodies getting into the wind-pipe, and ſo falling down upon the lungs, and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tender veſſels. The obſtruction of any cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evacuation, may occaſion a ſpitting of blood; as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of bleeding or purging at the uſual ſeaſons, the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the bleeding, piles in men, or the menſes in women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe proceed from a polypus, ſchirrhous
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:012338_0243_0F88EA507A55EA08"/>
concretions, or any thing that obſtructs the circulation of the blood in the lungs. It is often the effect of a long and violent cough; in which caſe, it is generally the forerunner of a conſumption. A violent degree of cold, ſuddenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the external parts of the body, will occaſion an an haemoptoe. It may likewiſe be occaſioned by breathing in air which is too much rarified to be able properly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand the lungs. This is often the caſe with thoſe who work in hot places, as furnaces, glaſs houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe happen to ſuch as aſcend to the top of very high mountains, as the peak of Teneriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SPITTING of blood is not always to be conſidered as a primary diſeaſe. It is often only a ſymptom, and, in ſome caſes, not an unfavourable one. This is the caſe in pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, peripneumonies, and ſundry other fevers. In a dropſy, ſcurvy, or conſumption, it is a bad ſymptom, and ſhews that the lungs are ulcerated.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—Spitting of blood is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally preceded by a ſenſe of weight, and oppreſſion of the breaſt, a dry tickling cough, hoarſeneſs, and a difficulty of breathing. Sometimes it is uſhered in with ſhivering, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the extremities, coſtiveneſs, great laſſitude, flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, pains of the back and loins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As theſe ſhew a general ſtricture upon the veſſels, and a tendency of the blood to inflammation, they are commonly the forerunners of a very copious diſcharge. Theſe ſymptoms do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a diſcharge of blood from the gums or fauces, by which means they may always be diſtinguiſhed from an haemoptoe. Sometimes the blood that is ſpit up is thin, and of a florid red colour; and, at other times, it is thick, and of a dark or blackiſh colour; nothing, however, can be inferred from this circumſtance, but that the blood has lain a longer or ſhorter time in the breaſt before it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
                        <p>SPITTING of blood, in a ſtrong healthy perſon, of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ound conſtitution, is ſeldom dangerous; but when it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks the tender and delicate, or perſons of a weak lax fibre, it is not eaſily removed. When it proceeds from a ſchirrhous, or polypus of the lungs, it is bad. The danger is greater when the diſcharge proceeds from the rupture of a large veſſel than of a ſmall one. When the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated blood is not ſpit up, but lodges in the breaſt, it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts, and greatly increaſes the danger. When the blood
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:012338_0244_0F88EA5153253AD8"/>
proceeds from an ulcer in the lungs, it is generally fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The patient ought to be kept cool, and perfectly at reſt. Every thing that heats the blood, or quickens the circulation, increaſes the danger. The mind ought likewiſe to be ſoothed, and every occaſion of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the paſſion avoided. The diet ſhould be ſoft, cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſlender; as rice, boiled with milk, ſmall broths, barley gruels, panada, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The diet, in this caſe, can ſcarce be too low. Even water gruel is ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the patient for ſome days. All ſtrong liquors muſt be avoided. The patient may drink milk and water, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley water, whey, butter milk, and ſuch like. Every thing ſhould be drank cold, and in ſmall quantities at a time. The patient muſt obſerve the ſtricteſt ſilence, or, at leaſt, ſpeak with a very low voice.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—This, like the other invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſcharges of blood, ought not to be ſuddenly ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by aſtringent medicines. More miſchief is often done by theſe than if it were ſuffered to go on. It may, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, proceed ſo far as to weaken the patient, and even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his life, in which caſe, proper means muſt be uſed for reſtraining it.</p>
                        <p>THE belly ſhould be kept gently open by laxative diet; as roaſted apples, ſtewed prunes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If theſe ſhould not have the effect, a tea ſpoonful of the lenitive electuary may be taken twice or thrice a-day, as is found neceſſary. If the bleeding proves violent, ligatures may be applied to the extremities, as directed for the bleeding at the noſe.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be hot or feveriſh, bleeding, and ſmall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of nitre, will be of uſe; a ſcruple, or half a dram, may be taken in a cup of his ordinary drink, twice or thrice a-day. His drink may likewiſe be ſharpened with acids, as juice of lemons, or a few drops of the ſpirit of vitriol; or he may take frequently a cup of the tincture of roſes, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in page 227.</p>
                        <p>BATHING the feet and legs in lukewarm water, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off ſpaſms, has a very good effect in this diſeaſe. Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates too are ſometimes beneficial for that purpoſe; but theſe muſt be given with the greateſt caution. Ten or twelve drops of laudanum may be given in a cup of barley water twice a-day, and continued for ſome time, provided they be found beneficial.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="241" facs="unknown:012338_0245_0F88EA5209C85560"/>
THE conſerve of roſes is likewiſe a very good medicine in this caſe, provided it be taken in ſufficient quantity, and long enough perſiſted in. It may be taken to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of three or four ounces a-day; and, if the patient be troubled with a cough, it ſhould be made into an electuary with balſamic ſyrup, and a little of the ſyrup of poppies.</p>
                        <p>IF ſtronger aſtringents be found neceſſary, fifteen or twenty drops of the acid elixir of vitriol may be taken in a glaſs of water, three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who are ſubject to frequent returns of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſhould be careful to avoid all exceſs. Their diet ſhould be light and cool, conſiſting chiefly of milk and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables. Above all, let them beware of vigorous efforts of the body, and violent agitations of the mind.</p>

                        <head>VOMITING OF BLOOD.</head>
                        <p>THIS is not ſo common as the other diſcharges of blood which have already been mentioned; but it is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and requires the greateſt attention.</p>
                        <p>VOMITING of blood is generally preceded by pains in the ſtomach, ſickneſs and nauſea, and is accompanied with great anxiety, and frequent fainting fits.</p>
                        <p>VOMITING of blood is ſometimes periodical; in which caſe it is leſs dangerous. It often proceeds from an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the menſes in women; and ſometimes from the ſtopping of the haemorrhoidal flux in men. It may be occaſioned by any thing that greatly ſtimulates or wounds the ſtomach, as ſtrong vomits or purges, acrid poiſons, ſharp or hard ſubſtances taken into the ſtomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is often the effect of obſtructions in the liver, the ſpleen, or ſome of the other viſcera. It may likewiſe proceed from external violence, as blows or bruiſes, or from any of the cauſes which produce inflammation.</p>
                        <p>A great part of the danger in this diſeaſe ariſes from the extravaſated blood lodging in the bowels, and becoming putrid, by which means a dyſentery or putrid fever may be occaſioned. The beſt way of preventing this, is to keep the belly gently open, by frequently exhibiting emollient clyſters. Purges muſt not be given till the diſcharge is ſtopt, otherwiſe they will irritate the ſtomach, and increaſe the diſorder. All the food and drink muſt be of a mild cooling nature, and taken in ſmall quantities. Even
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:012338_0246_0F88EA52B3E873C0"/>
drinking cold water has ſometimes proved a remedy. When there are ſigns of an inflammation, bleeding may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but the patient's weakneſs will ſeldom permit it. Aſtringents can ſeldom be uſed, as they ſtimulate the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and of courſe increaſe the diſeaſe. Opiates may be of of uſe; but they muſt be given in very ſmall doſes, as four or five drops of liquid laudanum twice or thrice a-day. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſcharge is over, as the patient is generally troubled with gripes, occaſioned by the acrimony of the blood lodged in the inteſtines, gentle purges will be neceſſary.</p>

                        <p>THIS diſorder is commonly called <hi>piſſing of blood.</hi> It is a diſcharge of blood, with or without urine, from the veſſels of the kidneys or bladder, which may be either enlarged, broken, or eroded.

                        <p>IF it be attended with a plethora, and ſymptoms of an inflammation, bleeding will be neceſſary. The belly muſt likewiſe be kept open by emollient clyſters, or cooling pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative medicines; as cryſtals of tartar, rhubarb, manna, or ſmall doſes of lenitive electuary.</p>
                        <p>WHEN bloody urine proceeds from a diſſolved ſtate of the blood, it is commonly the ſymptom of ſome malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; as the ſmall-pox, a putrid fever, or the like. In this caſe, the patient's life depends on the liberal uſe of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits bark and acids, as has already been ſhewn.</p>
                        <p>WHEN there is reaſon to ſuſpect an ulcer in the kidneys or bladder, the patient's diet muſt be cool, and his drink of a ſoft, healing, balſamic quality, as decoctions of marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallow roots with liquorice, ſolutions of gum Arabic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Three ounces of marſhmallow roots, and half an ounce of liquorice, may be boiled in two Engliſh quarts of water to one; two ounces of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified nitre, may be diſſolved in the ſtrained liquor, and a tea cupful of it taken four or five times a-day.</p>
                        <p>THE early uſe of aſtringents, in this diſeaſe has often bad conſequences.

                        <head>OF VOMITING.</head>
                        <p>VOMITING may proceed from various cauſes; as exceſs in eating or drinking; a foul ſtomach; the acrimony of
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:012338_0248_0F88EA542A713C00"/>
the aliments; the tranſlation of the morbific matter of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the gout, the eryſipelas, and other diſeaſes, to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. It may likewiſe proceed from a looſeneſs, or flux of blood being too ſuddenly ſtopped, or from the ſtoppage of any cuſtomary evacuation, as the bleeding piles, the <hi>menſes, &amp;c.</hi> Vomiting may proceed from the weakneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, the colic, the iliac paſſion, a rupture, a fit of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, worms, or from any kind of poiſon taken into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. It is an uſual ſymptom of hurts of the brain; as contuſions, compreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is likewiſe a ſymptom of wounds, or inflammations of the diaphragm, inteſtines, ſpleen, liver, kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>VOMITING may be occaſioned by unuſual motions; as riding backwards in a cart or coach, ſailing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe be excited by violent paſſions, or by the idea of nauſeous objects, eſpecially of ſuch things as have formerly produced vomiting. Sometimes it proceeds from a regur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of the bile into the ſtomach; in this caſe, what the patient vomits is generally of a yellow or greeniſh colour, and has a bitter taſte. Perſons who are ſubject to nervous affections are often ſuddenly ſeized with violent fits of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. Laſtly, Vomiting is a common ſymptom of preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy. In this caſe, it generally comes on about two weeks after the ſtopping of the <hi>menſes,</hi> and continues during the firſt three or four months.</p>
                        <p>WHEN vomiting proceeds from a ſoul ſtomach or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, it is not to be conſidered as a diſeaſe, but as the cure of a diſeaſe. It ought, therefore, to be promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or thin gruel. If this does not put a ſtop to the vomiting, a doſe of ipecacuanha may be taken, and wrought off with weak camomile tea.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the retroceſſion of gouty matter, or the obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cuſtomary evacuations occaſion vomiting, all means muſt be uſed to reſtore theſe diſcharges; or, if that cannot be effected, their place muſt be ſupplied by others, as bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, purging, bathing the extremities in warm water, opening iſſues, ſetons, perpetual bliſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN vomiting proceeds from pregnancy, it may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be relieved by bleeding, and keeping, the belly gently open. The bleeding, however, ought to be in ſmall quantities at a time, and the purgatives ſhould be of the mildeſt kind, as figs, ſtewed prunes, manna or ſenna. Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women are moſt apt to vomit in the morning, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after getting out of bed, which is owing partly to

<pb n="245" facs="unknown:012338_0249_0F88EA582AF7BD98"/>
the change of poſture, but more to the emptineſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. It may generally be prevented by taking a diſh of tea, or ſome light breakfaſt in bed. Pregnant women, who are afflicted with vomiting, ought to be kept eaſy both in body and mind. They ſhould neither allow their ſtomachs to be quite empty, nor ſhould they eat much at once. Cold water is a very good drink in this caſe; if the ſtomach be weak, a little brandy may be added to it. If the ſpirits be low, and the perſon apt to faint, a ſpoonful of cinnamon water, with a little marmalade of quinces or oranges, may be taken.</p>
                        <p>IF vomiting proceeds from weakneſs of the ſtomach, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will be of ſervice, as the Gentian root, camomile and ſnakeroot, infuſed in brandy or wine. To theſe may be added as much rhubarb as will keep the belly gently open. The Jeſuits bark is likewiſe an excellent medicine for bracing and ſtrengthening the ſtomach. It may be drank in form of tea, or infuſed in wine or brandy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The elixir of vitriol is alſo a good medicine in this caſe. It may be taken in the doſe of fifteen or twenty drops, twice or thrice a-day, in a glaſs of wine or water.</p>
                        <p>A vomiting which proceeds from acidities in the ſtomach is relieved by alkaline purges. The beſt medicine of this kind is the magneſia alba, a tea ſpoonful of which may be taken in a diſh of tea or a little milk, twice or thrice a-day, or oftener, if neceſſary, to keep the belly open.</p>
                        <p>WHEN vomiting proceeds from violent paſſions, or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, all kind of evacuations muſt be avoided, eſpecially vomits. Theſe are exceeding dangerous. The patient, in this caſe, ought to be perfectly eaſy and quiet, to have the mind ſoothed, and to take ſome gentle cordial, as negas, or a little brandy and water. A few drops of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid laudanum may likewiſe be taken, to calm the ſpirits, and take off the irritation upon the nerves.</p>
                        <p>WHEN vomiting proceeds from ſpaſmodic affections of the ſtomach, muſk, caſtor, and other antiſpaſmodic medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are of uſe. Aromatic plaſters have likewiſe a good effect. The ſtomach plaſter of the London or Edinburgh diſpenſatory may be applied to the pit of the ſtomach, or rather a little towards the left ſide, ſo as to cover a part of the falſe ribs. Aromatic medicines may likewiſe be taken inwardly, as cinnamon tea, mint tea, wine with ſpiceries boiled in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The region of the ſtomach may be rubbed with aether, or, if that cannot be had, with ſtrong brandy,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:012338_0250_0F88EA59CA3A58E0"/>
or other ſpirits. The belly ſhould be fomented with warm water, or the patient immerſed up to the breaſt in a warm bath.</p>
                        <p>I have always found the ſaline draughts moſt effectual in ſtopping a vomiting, from whatever cauſe it proceeded. Theſe may be made by diſſolving a dram of the ſalt of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in an ounce and a half of freſh lemon juice, adding to it an ounce of peppermint water, and half an ounce of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous cinnamon water. This draught may be ſweetened with a little white ſugar, and taken in the act of efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence. It muſt be repeated every two hours, or every hour, if the vomiting be very violent. I do not remember to have ſeen this medicine, when duly perſiſted in, fail to ſtop a vomiting.</p>
                        <p>AS the leaſt motion will often bring on the vomiting again, even after it has been ſtopped, the patient muſt avoid all manner of action. His diet muſt be ſo regulated as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE headach is produced by various cauſes, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with different ſymptoms, according to its different degrees, and the part where it is ſituated. When it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>light, and affects a particular part of the head, it is called <hi>cephalaea;</hi> when the whole head is affected, <hi>cephalaea;</hi> and when one ſide only, <hi>hemicrania.</hi> A fixed pain in the forehead, which may be covered with the end of the thumb, is called <hi>clavis hyſtericus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THERE are alſo other diſtinctions. Sometimes the pain is internal; ſometimes external; ſometimes it is an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſeaſe, and at other times only ſymptomatic. When the headach proceeds from a hot bilious habit, the pain is very acute and throbbing, with a conſiderable heat of the part affected. When from a cold phlegmatic habit, the patient complains of a dull heavy pain, and has a ſenſe of coldneſs in the part. This kind of headach is ſometimes attended with a degree of ſtupidity or folly.</p>
                        <p>WHATEVER obſtructs the free circulation of the blood through the veſſels of the head, may occaſion a headach. In perſons of a full habit, who abound with blood, or
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012338_0251_0F88EA5A4AC3C0A8"/>
other humours, the headach often proceeds from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of cuſtomary evacuations; as bleeding at the noſe, ſweating of the feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It may likewiſe proceed from any cauſe that determines a greater flux of blood towards the head; as coldneſs of the extremities, hanging of the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whatever prevents the return of the blood from the head, will likewiſe occaſion a headach; as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long at any object obliquely, wearing any thing tight about the neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>WHEN a headach proceeds from the ſtoppage of a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the noſe, there is a heavy, obtuſe, preſſing pain in the forepart of the head, in which there ſeems to be ſuch a weight, that the patient can ſcarce hold it up. When it is occaſioned by the cauſtic matter of the venereal diſeaſe, it generally affects the ſkull, and often produces a <hi>caries</hi> of the bones.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the headach proceeds from the repulſion, or retroceſſion of the morbific matter of the gout, the ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelas, the ſmall-pox, meaſles, itch, or other eruptive diſeaſes. A <hi>hemicrania</hi> generally proceeds from crudities or indigeſtion.</p>
                        <p>THERE is likewiſe a moſt violent, fixed, conſtant, and almoſt intolerable headach, which occaſions great debility both of body and mind, prevents ſleep, diſturbs digeſtion, deſtroys the appetite, cauſes a <hi>vertigo,</hi> dimneſs of ſight, a noiſe in the years, convulſions, epileptic fits, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vomiting, coſtiveneſs, coldneſs of the extremities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE headach is often ſymptomatic in continual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fevers, eſpecially quartans. It is likewiſe a very common ſymptom of hyſteric and hypochondriac com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
                        <p>AN external pain of the head is ſeldom dangerous. When it attends an acute fever, with pale urine, it is an unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſymptom. In exceſſive headachs, coldneſs of the extremities is a bad ſign. When the diſeaſe continues long, and is very violent, it often terminates in blindneſs, an apoplexy, deafneſs, a <hi>vertigo,</hi> the palſy, epilepſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE cool regimen in general is to be obſerved in this diſeaſe. The diet ought to conſiſt of ſuch emollient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as will correct the acrimony of the humours, and keep the belly open; as apples boiled in milk, ſpinage, turnips, and ſuch like. The drink ought to be diluting; as barley water, infuſions of mild mucilaginous vegetables,
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:012338_0252_0F88EA5B05A39A80"/>
decoctions of the ſudorific woods<note n="*" place="bottom">THE decoction of woods is thus made: Take ſhavings of gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aiacum wood, three ounces; raiſins of the ſun, ſtoned, two oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſaſſafras wood, ſhaved, one ounce; liquorice, ſliced, half an ounce: Boil the guaiacum and raiſins in an Engliſh gallon of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, over a gentle fire, to the conſumption of one half; adding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end the ſaſſafras and liquorice. Strain the liquor, and having ſuffered it to ſettle for ſome time, pour off the clear liquor from the foeces. This may be taken at pleaſure for ordinary drink.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The feet and legs ought to be kept warm, and frequently bathed in luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm water; the head ſhould be ſhaved, and bathed with water and vinegar. The patient ought, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to keep an erect poſture, and not to lie with his head too low.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the headach is owing to exceſs of blood, and in hot bilious conſtitutions, bleeding is neceſſary. The pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent may be bled in the jugular vein, and the operation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated if there be occaſion. Cupping alſo, or the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of leeches to the temples, and behind the ears, may be of ſervice. Afterwards a bliſtering plaſter may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the neck, or behind the ears, or to any part of the head that is moſt affected. In ſome caſes it will be proper to bliſter the whole head. In perſons of a groſs habit, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, or perpetual bliſters, will be of ſervice. The belly ought likewiſe to be kept open by gentle laxatives.</p>
                        <p>BUT when the headach proceeds from a copious vitiated <hi>ſerum</hi> ſtagnating in the membranes, either within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſkull, with a dull, heavy, continual pain, which will neither yield to bleeding nor gentle laxatives, then more powerful purgatives are neceſſary, as pills made of aloes, reſin of jalap, or the like. It will alſo be neceſſary in this caſe to bliſter the whole head, and to keep the back part of the neck open for a conſiderable time by a perpetual bliſter.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the headach is occaſioned by a ſtoppage of the running of the noſe, the patient ſhould frequently ſmell to a bottle of vol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="5 letters">

                        </p>
                        <p>A <hi>hemicrania,</hi> eſpecially a periodical one, is generally owing to a foulneſs in the ſtomach, for which gentle vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits will be beneficial, as alſo purges of rhubarb. After the bowels have been ſufficiently cleared, chalybeate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſuch bitters as ſtrengthen the ſtomach, will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="249" facs="unknown:012338_0253_0F88EA5BB757C920"/>
WHEN the headach ariſes from a vitiated ſtate of the humours, as in the ſcurvy and venereal diſeaſe, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, after proper evacuations, muſt drink freely of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of woods, recommended above, or the decoction of ſarſaparilla with raiſins and liquorice<note n="*" place="bottom">THIS is made by boiling three ounces of freſh ſarſaparilla, an ounce of raiſins, and half an ounce of liquorice, in three Engliſh quarts of water to one. The liquor muſt be ſtrained, and an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh pint of it drank daily.</note>. Theſe promote perſpiration, ſweeten the humours, and, if duly perſiſted in, will produce very happy effects. When a collection of matter is felt under the ſkin, it muſt be diſcharged by an inciſion, otherwiſe it will render the bone carious.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the headach is ſo intolerable as to endanger the patient's life, or is attended with continual watching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> recourſe muſt be had to opiates. Theſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proper evacuation by clyſters, or mild purgatives, may be applied both externally and internally. The affected part may be rubbed with Bate's anodyne balſam, or a cloth dipped in it may be applied to the part. The patient may, at the ſame time, take twenty drops of laudanum, in a cup of valerian or pennyroyal tea, twice or thrice a-day. This is only to be done in caſe of extreme pain. Proper evacuations ought always to accompany and follow the uſe of opiates.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient cannot bear the loſs of blood, his feet ought frequently to be bathed in lukewarm water, and well rubbed with a coarſe cloth. Cataplaſms with muſtard or horſeradiſh ought likewiſe to be applied to them. This courſe is peculiarly neceſſary when the pain proceeds from a gouty humour affecting the head.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the headach is occaſioned by great heat, hard labour, or violent exerciſe of any kind, it may be allayed by cooling medicines; as the ſaline draughts with nitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <head>OF THE TOOTHACH.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe is ſo well known, that it needs no deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It has great affinity with the rheumatiſm, and often ſucceeds pains of the ſhoulders and other joints.</p>
                        <p>IT may proceed from various cauſes; as obſtructed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or catching cold; or from any of the common cauſes of inflammation. I have often known the toothach
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:012338_0254_0F88EA5D55905AF0"/>
occaſioned by neglecting ſome part of the uſual coverings of the head, by ſitting with the head bare near an open window, or its being any how expoſed to a draught of cold air. Food or drink taken either too hot or too cold, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hurtful to the teeth. Great quantities of ſugar, or other ſweet-meats, are likewiſe hurtful. Nothing is more deſtructive to the teeth than cracking nuts, or chewing any kind of hard ſubſtances. Picking the teeth with pins, needles, or with any thing that may hurt the enamel with which they are covered, does great miſchief; as the tooth is ſure to be ſpoilt whenever the air gets into it. Pregnant women are very ſubject to the toothach, eſpecially during the firſt three or four months of pregnancy. The tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach often proceeds from ſcorbutic humours affecting the gums. In this caſe, the teeth are ſometimes waſted, and fall out without any conſiderable degree of pain. The proximate or immediate cauſe of the toothach is a rotten or <hi>carious</hi> tooth.</p>
                        <p>IN order to relieve the toothach, we muſt endeavour to draw off or divert the humours from the part affected. This may be done by mild purgatives, bleeding and bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feet frequently in warm water. The perſpiration ought likewiſe to be promoted, by drinking freely of weak wine whey, or other diluting liquors, with ſmall doſes of nitre. Vomits too have often an exceeding good effect in the toothach. It is ſeldom ſafe to adminiſter opiates, or any kind of heating medicines, or even to draw a tooth till proper evacuations have been premiſed, and theſe alone will often effect the cure.</p>
                        <p>NEXT to evacuations we recommend fomenting the part with warm water, or decoctions of emollient vegetables. Bags filled with boiled camomile flowers, flowers of elder, or the like, may be applied to the part affected, with as great a degree of warmth as the patient can bear, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed as they grow cool. The patient may likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſteams of warm water into his mouth, through an inverted funnel, or by holding his head over the mouth of a porringer filled with warm water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>GARGLES are likewiſe of uſe to make a diſcharge from the part. Rob of elder diſſolved in ſmall beer makes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper gargle, or an infuſion of ſage or mulberry leaves.</p>
                        <p>SUCH things as promote the diſcharge of ſaliva, or cauſe the patient to ſpit, are always proper. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, bitter, hot, or pungent vegetables may be chewed;

as gentian, calamus aromaticus, or pellatory of Spain. Allen recommends the root of <hi>yellow water flower-de-luce</hi> in this caſe. This root may either be rubbed upon the tooth or chewed. Brookes ſays, he hardly ever knew it fail to eaſe the toothach.</p>
                        <p>MANY other herbs, roots, and ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for curing the toothach; as the leaves or roots of millefoil or yarrow chewed, tobacco ſmoaked or chewed, or the aſhes put into the hollow tooth, ſtaves acre, or the ſeeds of muſtard chewed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe bitter, hot, and pungent things, by occaſioning a great flow of <hi>ſaliva,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>OPIATES often relieve the toothach. For this purpoſe a little cotton wet with laudanum may be held between the teeth; or a piece of ſticking plaſter, about the bigneſs of a ſixpence, with a bit of opium in the middle of it, of a ſize not to prevent the ſticking of the other, may be laid on the temporal artery, where the pulſation is moſt ſenſible. <hi>De la Motte</hi> affirms, that there are few caſes wherein this will not give relief. If there be a hollow tooth, a ſmall pill made of equal quantities of camphire and opium, put into the hollow, is often beneficial. When this cannot be had, the hollow tooth may be filled with gum maſtich, wax, lead, or any ſubſtance that will ſtick in it, and keep the external air out.</p>
                        <p>FEW applications give more relief in the toothach than bliſtering plaſters. Theſe may be applied betwixt the ſhoulders, but they have the beſt effect when put behind the ears, and made ſo large as to cover a part of the lower jaw. Burning the nerve within the affected tooth with a hot iron, has frequently given eaſe; but this operation ought to be done with care. Applying a hot iron to the <hi>antetragus,</hi> or what is called <hi>the inner bar of the ear,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a noted cure for the toothach. Bliſtering, however, is more ſafe than either of theſe, and is not leſs efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
                        <p>HOFFMAN ſays, When every thing elſe failed, that he had often great ſucceſs from the following pills.</p>
                        <p>TAKE of aromatic pill one dram, ſtorax pill half a dram, extract of ſaffron ſix grains. Make them into nine pills; of which ſix or eight are to be taken at bed time for a doſe.</p>
                        <p>AFTER all, when a tooth is carious, it is often impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remove the pain, without drawing the tooth; and,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:012338_0256_0F88EA5EC09A01C8"/>
as a ſpoilt tooth never becomes ſound again, it is prudent to draw it ſoon, left it ſhould affect the reſt. Tooth drawing, like bleeding, is very much practiſed by mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics as well as perſons of the medical profeſſion. The operation however is not without danger, and ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be done with care.

                        <p>WHEN a ſound tooth has been drawn, if it be replaced immediately, it will grow in again. It is now a common practice to draw a rotten tooth, and put a ſound one, taken from the mouth of ſome other perſon, in its place. It is likewiſe an eaſy matter to fix artificial teeth ſo neatly, as to anſwer moſt of the purpoſes of the natural; but theſe are matters which do not properly fall under our conſideration.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the toothach returns periodically, and the pain chiefly affects the gums, it may be cured by the bark.</p>
                        <p>SOME pretend to have found great benefit in the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, from the application of an artificial magnet to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected tooth. We ſhall not attempt to account for its mode of operation; but, if it be found to anſwer, though only in particular caſes, it certainly deſerves a trial, as it is attended with no expence, and cannot do any harm.</p>

                        <head>OF THE EARACH.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſorder chiefly affects the membrane which lines the inner cavity of the ear, called the <hi>meatus auditorius.</hi> It is often ſo violent as to occaſion great reſtleſsneſs and anxiety, and even delirium. Sometimes epileptic fits, and other convulſive diſorders, have been brought on by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain in the ear.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="253" facs="unknown:012338_0257_0F88EA5F8306DF30"/>
THE earach may proceed from any of the cauſes which produce inflammation. It often proceeds from a ſudden ſuppreſſion of perſpiration, or from the head being expoſed to cold when covered with ſweat. It may alſo be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by worms, or other inſects getting into the ear, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred there; or from any hard body ſticking in the ear. Sometimes it proceeds from the tranſlation of morbific mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ear. This often happens in the decline of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fevers, and occaſions deafneſs, which is generally reckoned a favourable ſymptom.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the earach proceeds from inſects, or any hard body ſticking in the ear, every method muſt be taken to remove them as ſoon as poſſible. The membranes may be relaxed by dropping into the ear oil of almonds, or olive oil. Afterwards the patient ſhould be made to ſneeze, by taking ſnuff, or ſome ſtrong ſternutatory. If this ſhould not force out the body, it muſt be extracted by art. I have ſeen inſects which have got into the ear, come out of their own accord upon pouring in oil upon them, which is a thing they cannot bear.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the pain of the ear proceeds from inflammation, it muſt be treated like other topical inflammations, by a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regimen and opening medicines. Bleeding at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, either in the arm or jugular vein, or cupping in the neck, will be proper. The ear may likewiſe be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſteams of warm water, or flannel-bags filled with boiled mallows and camomile flowers may be applied to it warm; or bladders filled with warm milk and water. An exceeding good method of fomenting the ear is to apply it cloſe to the mouth of a jug filled with a ſtrong decoction of camomile flowers.</p>
                        <p>THE patient's feet ſhould be frequently bathed in luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm water, and he ought to take ſmall doſes of nitre and rhubarb, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> a ſcruple of the former, and ten grains of the latter three times a-day. His drink may be whey, or decoctions of barley and liquorice, with figs or raiſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The parts behind the ear ought frequently to be rubbed with camphorated oil, or the volatile liniment; and a few drops of the camphorated ſpirit of wine may be put into the ear with wool or cotton.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the inflammation cannot be reſolved, a poultice of bread and milk, or roaſted onions, may be applied to the ear, and frequently renewed, till it breaks, or the abſceſs can be opened. Afterwards the humours may be diverted
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:012338_0258_0F88EA6050AD5538"/>
from the part by gentle laxatives, bliſters, or iſſues; but the diſcharge muſt not be ſuddenly dried up by any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal application. I have often known the ſudden drying of a running of the ear produce fatal conſequences.</p>

                        <head>OF THE HEART-BURN.</head>
                        <p>WHAT is called the <hi>heart-burn,</hi> is not a diſeaſe of that organ, but an uneaſy ſenſation of heat or acrimony about the pit of the ſtomach, which is ſometimes attended with anxiety, nauſea, and vomiting.</p>
                        <p>IT may proceed from indigeſtion, from the acidity of the fluids, or contents of the ſtomach, or from bilious humours. Stale liquors, vinegar, greaſy aliment, wind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will cauſe the heart-burn. In ſome conſtitutions it is occaſioned by the uſe of acids, and in others by aromatics. Pregnant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are very ſubject to it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the heart-burn proceeds from indigeſtion, or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oul ſtomach, the patient ought to take a vomit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a purge. After the ſtomach has been cleanſed, he may drink twice or thrice a-day a cup of camomile tea, with fifteen or twenty drops of elixir of vitriol in it, in order to ſtrengthen the ſtomach and promote digeſtion.</p>
                        <p>WHEN acidity or ſourneſs of the ſtomach occaſions the heart-burn, abſorbents are the proper medicines. In this caſe, chalk and water, or what is called the chalk julep, often anſwers very well. It is made by mixing an ounce of powdered chalk, half an ounce of fine ſugar, and a quarter of an ounce of gum Arabic, in two Engliſh pints of water. A tea cupful of this may be taken at pleaſure. When the gum Arabic cannot be had, the chalk may be mixed with milk, or taken in water alone. The teſtacious powders are very proper here. A tea ſpoonful of prepared oyſter ſhells, or the powder called crab's eyes, may be taken in a glaſs of peppermint water, or ſimple cinnamon water, as often as there is occaſion.</p>
                        <p>BUT the ſafeſt abſorbent which we know, is the <hi>magneſia alba.</hi> This not only acts as an abſorbent, but by its purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality cleanſes the bowels; whereas the chalk, and other abſorbents of that ſort, are apt to lie in the inteſtines, and occaſion obſtructions. This powder is no way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, and may be taken in a cup of tea, a little milk, or a glaſs of peppermint water. A large tea ſpoonful is the uſual doſe, but there is no danger in taking a much greater
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:012338_0259_0F88EA60F7AD6330"/>
quantity, and it may be repeated as often as is found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the heart-burn proceeds from bilious humours, a tea ſpoonful of the ſweet ſpirits of nitre in a glaſs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or a cup of tea or coffee, will generally give eaſe. If it be cauſed by fat or greaſy aliments, a dram of brandy or rum may be taken.</p>
                        <p>IF wind be the cauſe of this complaint, the medicines called carminatives are proper; as aniſeeds, juniper berries, cardamum ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe may either be chewed, or a glaſs of their diſtilled waters taken at pleaſure. Theſe, and other warm aromatics, as ginger, canella alba, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> give eaſe, but they ought never to be uſed unleſs when neceſſary. They are only drams in a dry form, and very pernicious to the ſtomach. One of the ſafeſt medicines of this kind is the tincture made by infuſing an ounce of rhubarb, and a quarter of an ounce of the leſſer cardamums, in an Engliſh pint of brandy. This muſt digeſt for two days; afterwards it ſhould be ſtrained, and four ounces of white ſugar-candy in powder added to it. It muſt ſtand to digeſt again till the ſugar be diſſolved. A table ſpoonful may be taken for a doſe.</p>
                        <p>I have frequently known the heart-burn cured by the patient chewing green tea.</p>

                        <p>THIS may proceed from various cauſes; as indigeſtion, wind, the acrimony of the bile, or from ſharp, acrid, or poiſonous ſubſtances taken into the ſtomach. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proceed from worms; the ſtoppage of cuſtomary eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, or from a tranſlation of gouty matter to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <p>WOMEN, in the decline of life, are very liable to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, eſpecially ſuch as are afflicted with hyſteric complaints. It is likewiſe very common to hypochondriac men of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary and luxurious life.

                        <p>WHEN the pain of the ſtomach is moſt violent after eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is reaſon to ſuſpect that it proceeds from ſome fault either in the digeſtion or the food. In this caſe, the patient ought to change his diet, till he finds what kind of food agrees beſt with his ſtomach, and ſhould continue chiefly to uſe that. If a change of diet does not remove
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:012338_0260_0F88EA64124B5980"/>
the complaint, the patient may take a gentle vomit, and afterwards a doſe or two of rhubarb. He ought likewiſe to take an infuſion of camomile flowers, or ſome other ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machic bitter, either in wine or water. I have often known exerciſe remove this complaint, eſpecially ſailing, or a long journey on horſeback, or in a machine.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a pain of the ſtomach proceeds from flatulencies, the patient is conſtantly belching up wind, and feels an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy diſtenſion of the ſtomach after meals. This is a moſt deplorable diſeaſe, and is ſeldom cured. In general, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ought to avoid all windy diet, and every thing that ſours on the ſtomach, as greens, roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This rule, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, admits of ſome exceptions. I have known ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perſons very much troubled with wind, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great benefit from eating parched peas<note n="*" place="bottom">THESE are prepared by ſteeping or ſoaking peas in water, and afterwards drying them in a pot or kiln till they be quite hard.

This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint may likewiſe be greatly relieved by exerciſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally digging, walking, or riding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have found the elixir of vitriol anſwer very well in flatulencies. It may be taken as directed in page 254.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a pain of the ſtomach is occaſioned by the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of acrid or poiſonous ſubſtances, they muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by vomit; this may be excited by butter, oils, or other ſoft things, which ſheath and defend the ſtomach from the acrimony of its contents.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a pain of the ſtomach proceeds from a tranſlation of gouty matter, warm cordials are neceſſary. Some have drank a whole bottle of brandy or rum, in this caſe, in a few hours, without being in the leaſt intoxicated, or even feeling the ſtomach warmed by it. Generous wines, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are more ſafe, as genuine Madeira, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to aſcertain the quantities neceſſary upon theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This muſt be left to the feelings and diſcretion of the patient. It is, however, the ſafeſt way not to go too far. When there is an inclination to vomit, it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by drinking an infuſion of camomile flowers or <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus benedictus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>IF a pain of the ſtomach proceeds from the ſtoppage of cuſtomary evacuations, bleeding will, in ſome caſes, be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, eſpecially in ſanguine and very full habits. It will

                        <head>OF WORMS.</head>
                        <p>THESE are chiefly of three kinds, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> the <hi>taenia,</hi> or tape worm; the <hi>teres,</hi> or round and long worm, and the <hi>aſcarides,</hi> or round and ſhort worm. There are many other kinds of worms found in the human body; but as they proceed, in a great meaſure, from ſimilar cauſes, have nearly the ſame ſymptoms, and require almoſt the ſame method of cure, we ſhall not ſpend time in enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them.</p>
                        <p>THE tape worm is white, very long, and all over joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is generally bred either in the ſtomach or ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines. The round and long worm is likewiſe bred in the ſmall guts, and ſometimes in the ſtomach. The round and ſhort worms commonly lodge in the <hi>rectum,</hi> or what is called the end gut, and occaſion a diſagreeable itching about the <hi>anus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE long round worms occaſion ſqueamiſhneſs, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, an ill breath, gripes, looſeneſs, ſwelling of the belly, ſwoonings, loathing of food, and, at other times, a voracious appetite, a dry cough, convulſions, epileptic fits, and ſometimes a privation of ſpeech. Theſe worms have been known to perforate the inteſtines, and get into the cavity of the belly. The effects of the tape worm are nearly the ſame with thoſe of the long and round, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more violent.</p>
                        <p>ANDRY ſays, the following ſymptoms particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>folium,</hi> which is a ſpecies of the tape worm, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> ſwoonings, privation of ſpeech, and a voracious appetite. The round worms called <hi>aſcarides,</hi> beſides an itching of the <hi>anus,</hi> cauſe ſwoonings, and teneſmus, or an inclination to go to ſtool.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—Worms may proceed from various cauſes; but they are ſeldom found but in weak and relaxed ſtomachs, where the digeſtion is bad. Sedentary perſons
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:012338_0262_0F88EA656C538CA8"/>
are more liable to them than the active and laborious. Thoſe who eat great quantities of unripe fruit, or who live much on raw herbs and roots, are generally ſubject to worms. Worms are often a ſymptom of fevers, and other acute diſeaſes. There ſeems to be a hereditary diſpoſition in ſome perſons to this diſeaſe. I have often ſeen all the children of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſubject to worms of a particular kind. They ſeem likewiſe frequently to be owing to the nurſe. Children of the ſame family, nurſed by one woman, have often worms, when thoſe nurſed by another have none.</p>
                        <p>CHILDREN are more liable to this diſeaſe than adults, eſpecially after two years of age. Infants while on the breaſt, are ſeldom troubled with worms. To this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there are ſeveral exceptions. I lately ſaw an inſtance of a child who paſſed worms before it was three months old. They were indeed of a very particular kind, being real caterpillars. Some of them were above an inch long; they had red heads, and were ſo briſk as to jump about; they lived ſeveral days after the child had paſſed them. Another child ſuckled by the ſame woman, paſſed the ſame kind of worms when upon the breaſt, and both children ſuffered extremely before the worms came away.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The common ſymptoms of worms are, paleneſs of the countenance, and, at other times, an univerſal fluſhing of the face; itching of the noſe, this however is doubtful, as children pick their noſes in all diſeaſes; ſtarting, and grinding of the teeth in ſleep; the appetite ſometimes bad, at other times quite voracious; looſeneſs, a ſour or ſtinking breath, a hard ſwelled belly, great thirſt, the urine frothy, and ſometimes of a whitiſh colour, griping, or colic pains, an involuntary diſcharge of <hi>ſaliva,</hi> eſpecially when aſleep; frequent pains of the ſide, with a dry cough, and unequal pulſe; palpitations of the heart, ſwoonings, drowſineſs, cold ſweats, palſy, epileptic fits, with many other unaccountable nervous ſymptoms, which were formerly attributed to witchcraft, or the influence of evil ſpirits. Small bodies in the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reſembling melon or cucumber ſeeds, are ſymptoms of the tape worm.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH this is a very common diſeaſe, yet it is leſs ſo than is generally imagined. Nurſes impute moſt of the diſeaſes of children to worms, and often give medicine to kill theſe vermin where they do not exiſt. Even phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are often deceived with reſpect to worms. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:012338_0263_0F88EA665B2F88A0"/>
opened children who were thought to have been killed by them, and found none. In ſhort there is no certain proof of worms exiſting in the inteſtines, but their being paſſed; and that will ſometimes happen where no previous ſymptoms appeared.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Though numberleſs medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are extolled for killing and expelling worms<note n="*" place="bottom">A medical writer of the preſent age, has enumerated upwards of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                              </gap>ty Britiſh plants, all famous for killing and expelling worms out of the body.</note>, yet no diſeaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more frequently baffles the phyſician's ſkill. In general, the moſt proper medicines for their expulſion are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtrong purgatives; and to prevent their breeding, ſtoma-chic bitters, with now and then a glaſs of good wine.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt purge for an adult is jalap and calomel. Five and twenty or thirty grains of the former, with ſix or ſeven of the latter, mixed in ſyrup, may be taken for a doſe. This ſhould be taken early in the morning. It will be proper that the patient keep the houſe all day, and drink nothing cold. The doſe may be repeated once or twice a-week, for a fortnight or three weeks. On the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate days the patient may take a dram of the powder of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>THOSE who do not chooſe to take calomel, may make uſe of the bitter purgatives; as aloes, hiera picra, tincture of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>OILY medicines are likewiſe of uſe for expelling worms. An ounce of ſalad oil and a table ſpoonful of common ſalt, may be taken in a glaſs of red port wine thrice a-day, or oftener if the ſtomach will bear it. But the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon form of uſing oil is in clyſters. Oily clyſters ſweeten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſugar or honey, are very efficacious in bringing away the ſhort round worms called <hi>aſcarides.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE Harrowgate water is an excellent medicine for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling worms, eſpecially the <hi>aſcarides.</hi> As this water evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently abounds with ſulphur, we may hence infer, that ſulphur alone muſt be a good medicine in this caſe; this is found to be true in fact. Many practitioners give flour of ſulphur in very large doſes, and with great ſucceſs. It may be made into an electuary with honey or treacle, and taken in ſuch quantity as to purge the patient.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="260" facs="unknown:012338_0264_0F88EA66ED017430"/>
WHERE Harrowgate water cannot be obtained, ſea water may be uſed, which is far from being a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble medicine in this caſe. If ſea water cannot be had, common ſalt may be diſſolved in water and drank. I have often ſeen this uſed by country nurſes, when they ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their children were troubled with worms, with very good effect.</p>
                        <p>BUT worms, though expelled, will ſoon breed again, if the ſtomach remains weak and relaxed; to prevent this, we would recommend the Jeſuits bark. Half a dram of bark in powder may be taken in a glaſs of red Port wine, three or four times a-day, after the above medicines have been uſed. Lime water is likewiſe good for this purpoſe, or a table ſpoonful of the chalybeate wine<note n="*" place="bottom">THE chalybeate wine is made by digeſting three ounces of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of iron, and half a dram of cochineal, in two Engliſh pints of Rheniſh wine for three weeks, frequently ſhaking the veſſel. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the liquor muſt be filtered.</note>, taken twice or thrice a-day. Infuſions or decoctions of bitter herbs may likewiſe be drank; as the infuſion of tanſy, water trefoil, camomile flowers, tops of wormwood, the leſſer centaury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE above directions are calculated for adults; but for children the medicines muſt be more agreeable, and given in ſmaller doſes.</p>
                        <p>FOR a child of four or five years old, ten grains of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, five of jalap, and two of calomel, may be mixed in a ſpoonful of ſyrup or honey, and given in the morning. The child ſhould keep the houſe all day, and have nothing cold. This doſe may be repeated twice a-week for three or four weeks. On the intermediate days the child may take a ſcruple of powder of tin, and ten grains of aethiops mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in a ſpoonful of treacle twice a-day. Theſe doſes muſt be increaſed or diminiſhed according to the age of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
                        <p>I have frequently known thoſe big bellies, which in children are commonly reckoned a ſign of worms, quite removed by giving them white ſoap in their pottage, or other food. Tanſy, garlic, and rue, are all good againſt worms, and may be uſed various ways. We might here mention many plants, both for external and internal uſe, but think the powder of tin, with aethiops mineral, and the purges of rhubarb and calomel, are much more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. It will not, however, be amiſs to give a child

who is troubled with worms a glaſs of red wine now and then, as every thing that braces and ſtrengthens the ſtomach is good both for preventing and expelling theſe vermine.</p>
                        <p>PARENTS who would preſerve their children from worms, ought to allow them plenty of exerciſe in the open air, to ſee that their food be wholeſome and ſufficiently ſolid, and, as far as poſſible, to prevent their eating raw herbs, roots, or green traſhy fruits<note n="*" place="bottom">WE think it neceſſary here to warn people of their danger who buy worm cakes and powders at random from quacks, and give them to their children without proper care. The principal ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in moſt of theſe medicines is mercury, which is never to be trifled with. I lately ſaw a ſhocking inſtance of the danger of this conduct. A girl who had taken a doſe of worm-powder, bought of a travelling quack, went out, and I believe might be ſo imprudent as to drink cold water, during its operation. She immediately ſwelled, and died that very day, with all the ſymptoms of having been poiſoned.</note>.</p>

                        <head>OF THE JAUNDICE.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe is firſt obſervable in the white of the eye, which appears of a yellowiſh colour. Afterwards, the whole ſkin puts on a yellow, and ſometimes a blackiſh appearance. The urine too is of a ſaffron hue, and dyes a white cloth, if put into it, of the ſame colour.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The immediate cauſe of the jaundice is an obſtruction of the bile. The remote or occaſional cauſes are, the bites of poiſonous animals, as the viper, mad dog, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the bilious or hyſteric colic, violent paſſions, as grief, anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Strong purges or vomits will likewiſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the jaundice. Sometimes it proceeds from obſtinate agues, or from that diſeaſe being prematurely ſtopped by aſtringent medicines. In infants it is often occaſioned by the <hi>meconium</hi> not being ſufficiently purged off. Pregnant women are very ſubject to it. It is likewiſe a ſymptom in ſeveral kinds of fevers. Catching cold, or the ſtopping of cuſtomary evacuations, as the <hi>menſes,</hi> the bleeding piles, iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will occaſion the jaundice.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The patient at firſt complains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> exceſſive wearineſs, and has great averſion to any kind of motion. His ſkin is dry, and he generally feels a kind of itching or pricking pain over the whole body. The ſtools are of a whitiſh or clay colour, and the urine, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:012338_0266_0F88EA693126C380"/>
ſerved above, is yellow. The breathing is difficult, and the patient complains of an unuſual load or oppreſſion on his breaſt. There is a heat in the noſtrils, a bitter taſte in the mouth, loathing of food, ſickneſs at the ſtomach, vomiting, flatulency, and frequently all objects appear to the eye of a yellow colour.</p>
                        <p>IF the patient be young, and the diſeaſe complicated with no other malady, it is ſeldom dangerous; but in old people, where it continues long, returns frequently, or is complicated with the dropſy or hypochondriac ſymptoms, it generally proves fatal. The black jaundice is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than the yellow.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The diet ſhould be cool, light, and diluting, conſiſting chiefly of ripe fruits and mild ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables; as apples boiled or roaſted, ſtewed prunes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved plumbs, boiled ſpinage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Veal or chicken broth, with light bread, are likewiſe very proper. The drink ſhould be butter milk, whey, ſweetened with honey, or decoctions of cool opening vegetables; as marſhmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low roots, with liquorice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould take as much exerciſe as he can bear, either on horſeback or in a machine; walking, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and even jumping, are likewiſe proper, provided he can bear them without pain, and there be no ſymptoms of inflammation. Patients have been often cured of this diſeaſe by a long journey, after medicines had proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                        <p>AMUSEMENTS are likewiſe of great uſe in the jaundice. The diſeaſe is often occaſioned by a ſedentary life, joined to a dull melancholy diſpoſition. Whatever therefore tends to promote muſcular motion, and to cheer the ſpirits, muſt have a good effect; as dancing, laughing, ſinging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—If the patient be young, of a full ſanguine habit, and complains of pain in the right ſide about the region of the liver, bleeding will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. After this a vomit muſt be adminiſtered; and if the diſeaſe proves obſtinate, it may be repeated once or twice. No medicines are more beneficial in the jaundice than vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, eſpecially where it is not attended with inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Half a dram of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ecacuanha in powder will be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient doſe for an adult. It may be wrought off with weak camomile tea, or lukewarm water.</p>
                        <p>THE belly muſt likewiſe be kept open by mild purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Caſtile ſoap, if taken in ſufficient quantities, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:012338_0267_0F88EA6A2CC75930"/>
this purpoſe extremely well. It may be taken from half an ounce to an ounce daily, for a conſiderable time. As few people have reſolution to ſwallow ſuch large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſoap, I generally give pills made of ſoap, aloes, and rhubarb, which anſwer the ſame intention in a ſmaller doſe. They may be prepared in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
                        <p>TAKE ſocotrine aloes and Turkey rhubarb in powder, of each a dram, Caſtile ſoap an ounce. Beat them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with a little ſyrup, into a proper conſiſtence for pills. Let them be formed into pills of an ordinary ſize, and five or ſix of them taken three times a-day. They muſt be continued for ſome time, and the quantity regulated by the patient's ſtools, of which he ought at leaſt to have one or two every day.</p>
                        <p>FOMENTING the parts about the region of the ſtomach and liver, and rubbing them with a warm hand or fleſh-bruſh, are likewiſe beneficial; but it is ſtill more ſo for the patient to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it in a veſſel of warm water up to the breaſt. He ought to do this frequently, and ſhould continue in it as long as his ſtrength will permit.</p>
                        <p>MANY dirty things are recommended for the cure of the jaundice; as lice, the mill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>pedes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe do more harm than good, as people truſt to them, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect more valuable medicines; beſides, they are ſeldom taken in ſufficient quantity to produce any effects. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple always expect that theſe <hi>out of the way things</hi> ſhould act as charms, and conſequently ſeldom perſiſt in the uſe of them. Vomits, purges, fomentations, and exerciſe, will ſeldom fail to cure the jaundice when it is a ſimple diſeaſe; and when complicated with the dropſy, or other chronic complaints, it is hardly to be cured by any means.</p>
                        <p>NUMBERLESS Britiſh herbs are extolled for the cure of this diſeaſe. Dr. Short, in his <hi>Medicina Britannica,</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions near a hundred, all famous for curing the jaundice. The fact is, this diſeaſe often goes off of its own accord; in which caſe the laſt medicine is always ſaid to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the cure. I have however ſeen conſiderable benefit in a very obſtinate jaundice, from a decoction of hemp ſeed. Four ounces of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have known Harrowgate water cure a very obſtinate jaundice. I have known patients, after taking many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines without effect, go thither in the middle of winter, and in few weeks return quite well. They both drank the ſulphur water, and bathed.</p>

                        <head>OF THE DROPSY.</head>
                        <p>THE dropſy is a preternatural ſwelling of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or ſome part of it, occaſioned by a collection of watery humour. It is diſtinguiſhed by different names, according to the part affected, as the <hi>anaſarca,</hi> or a collection of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the ſkin; the <hi>aſcites,</hi> or a collection of water in the belly; the <hi>hydrops pectoris,</hi> or dropſy of the breaſt; the <hi>hydrocephalus,</hi> or dropſy of the brain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is likewiſe a ſpecies of dropſy called <hi>tympany,</hi> which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ified air pent up in the cavities or cells of the body.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—A very common cauſe of the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is a hereditary diſpoſition. It may likewiſe proceed from drinking ardent ſpirits, or other ſtrong liquors. It is true, almoſt to a proverb, that great drinkers die of a drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. The want of exerciſe is alſo a very common cauſe of the dropſy. Hence it is juſtly reckoned among the diſeaſes of the ſedentary. It often proceeds from exceſſive evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as frequent and copious bleedings, ſtrong purges of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, frequent ſalivations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſudden ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of cuſtomary or neceſſary evacuations, as the <hi>menſes,</hi> the haemorrhoids, or fluxes of the belly, may likewiſe cauſe a dropſy.</p>
                        <p>I have often known the dropſy occaſioned by drinking large quantities of cold, weak, watery liquor after violent exerciſe, while the body was hot. A low, damp, or marſhy ſituation is likewiſe a frequent cauſe of it. Hence it is a common diſeaſe in moiſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lat, fenny countries. It may alſo be brought on by a long courſe of poor watery diet, or the uſe of viſcous aliment, that is hard of digeſtion. It is often the effect of other diſeaſes, as the jaundice, a ſchirrhous of the liver, a violent ague, of long continuance, a diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoea, a dyſentery, an empyema, or a conſumption of the lungs. In ſhort, whatever obſtructs the circulation of the blood, or prevents its being duly prepared, may occaſion a dropſy.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="265" facs="unknown:012338_0269_0F88EA6DF542EB10"/>
SYMPTOMS.—This diſeaſe generally begins with a ſwelling of the feet and ancles towards night, which for ſome time diſappears in the morning. In the evening the parts, if preſſed with the finger, will pit. The ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually aſcends towards the belly, which at length grows big. When it is ſtruck with the hand, a fluctuation may be felt, and ſometimes heard. Afterwards the breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing becomes difficult, the urine is in ſmall quantity, and the thirſt great, the belly is bound, and the perſpiration is greatly obſtructed. To theſe ſucceed torpor, heavineſs, a ſlow waſting fever, and a troubleſome cough. This laſt is generally a fatal ſymptom, as it ſhews the lungs to be affected. In a tympany, the belly when ſtruck ſounds like a drum.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe comes ſuddenly on, and the patient is young and ſtrong, there is reaſon to hope for a cure, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if medicine be given early. But if the patient be old, has led an irregular or a ſedentary life, or if there be reaſon to ſuſpect that the liver, lungs, or any of the viſcera are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, there is great ground to fear that the conſequences will prove fatal.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The patient muſt abſtain, as much as poſſible, from all drink, eſpecially weak and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery liquors, and muſt quench his thirſt with acids, as juice of lemons, oranges, ſorrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His aliment ought to be dry, of a heating and diuretic quality, as toaſted bread, the fleſh of birds, or other wild animals, roaſted; pungent and aromatic vegetables, as garlic, muſtard, onions, creſſes, horſeradiſh, rocambole, ſhalot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They may alſo eat ſea biſcuit, dipt in wine or brandy. This is not only nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, but tends to quench thirſt. Some have been actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cured of a dropſy by a total abſtinence from all liquids, and living entirely upon ſuch things as are mentioned above. If the patient muſt have drink, the Spaw water, or Rheniſh wine, with diuretic medicines infuſed in it, are the beſt.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE is of the greateſt importance in a dropſy. If the patient be able to walk, run, dance, or jump about, he ought to continue theſe exerciſes as long as he can. If he be not able to walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he muſt ride on horſeback, or in a machine, and the more violent the motion ſo much the better, provided he can bear it. His bed ought to be hard, and the air of his apartments warm and dry. If he lives in a damp country, he ought to be removed into a dry one,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:012338_0270_0F88EA6E74DF2800"/>
and, if poſſible, into a warmer climate. In a word, every method muſt be taken to promote the perſpiration and to brace the ſolids. For this purpoſe, it will likewiſe be proper to rub the patient's body two or three times a-day, with a hard cloth or the fleſh bruſh, and he ought conſtantly to wear flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel next his ſkin.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—If the patient be young, his conſtitution good, and the diſeaſe has come on ſuddenly, it may generally be removed by ſtrong vomits, briſk purges, and ſuch medicines as promote a diſcharge of ſweat and urine. For an adult, half a dram of ipecacuanha in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and half an ounce of oxymel of ſquills, will be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vomit. This may be repeated three or four times, if neceſſary, three or four days intervening betwixt each doſe. The patient muſt not drink much after the vomit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he deſtroys its effect. A cup or two of camomile tea will be ſufficient to work it off.</p>
                        <p>BETWIXT each vomit, on one of the intermediate days, the patient may take the following purge. Take jalap in powder half a dram, cream of tartar two drams, calomel ſix grains. Theſe may be made into a bolus with a little ſyrup of pale roſes, and taken early in the morning. The leſs the patient drinks after it the better. If he be much griped, he may take now and then a cup of chicken broth.</p>
                        <p>THE patient may likewiſe take every night at bedtime the following bolus: Take four or five grains of camphire, one grain of opium, and as much ſyrup of orange peel as is ſufficient to make them into a bolus. This will generally promote a gentle ſweat, which ſhould be encouraged by drinking now and then a ſmall cup of wine whey, with a tea ſpoonful of the ſpirits of hartſhorn in it.</p>
                        <p>THE patient may take, three of four times a-day, a tea cupful of the following infuſion: Take juniper berries, muſtard ſeed, and horſe radiſh, of each half an ounce, aſhes of broom half a pound; infuſe them in a quart of Rheniſh wine or ſtrong ale for a few days, and afterwards ſtrain of the liquor. Such as cannot take this infuſion, may uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Seneca root, which is both diuretic and ſudorific. It may be prepared and taken as directed in page 119.</p>
                        <p>AS this diſeaſe is very apt to return; after the water has been drained off, to prevent its collecting again, the patient muſt continue to take exerciſe, to uſe a dry diet, and ſuch medicines as ſtrengthen and brace the ſolids, as wine with ſteel or bark infuſed in it; warm and aromatic bitters are
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:012338_0271_0F88EA6F2BD83A58"/>
likewiſe proper, as the Virginian ſnakeroot, <hi>canella alba,</hi> orange peel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> infuſed in wine or brandy: The patient muſt avoid all great evacuations, and ought, if he can, to make choice of a dry warm ſituation.</p>
                        <p>THE above courſe will often cure an incidental dropſy, if the conſtitution be good; but when the diſeaſe proceeds from a bad habit, or an unfound ſtate of the viſcera, ſtrong purges and vomits are not to be ventured upon. In this caſe, the ſafer courſe is to palliate the ſymptoms by the uſe of ſuch medicines as promote the ſecretions, and to ſupport the patient's ſtrength by warm and nouriſhing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials.</p>
                        <p>THE diſcharge of urine may be greatly promoted by ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. Brookes ſays, he knew a young woman who was cured of a dropſy by taking a dram of nitre every morning in a draught of ale, after ſhe had been given over as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The powder of ſquills is likewiſe a good diuretic. Six or eight grains of it, with a ſcruple of nitre, may be given twice a-day in a glaſs of ſtrong cinnamon water. Ball ſays, a large ſpoonful of unbruiſed muſtard ſeed taken every night and morning, and drinking half an Engliſh pint of the decoction of the tops of green broom after it, has produced a cure, after other powerful methods had proved ineffectual.</p>
                        <p>TO promote perſpiration, the patient may uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Seneca root, as directed above; or he may take two ſpoonfuls of<note n="*" place="bottom">THIS ſpirit is prepared by gradually pouring diſtilled vinegar upon any quantity of the volatile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſhew the advantages of temperance and exerciſe in a ſtronger light. Few who pay a proper regard to theſe are troubled with the gout, unleſs when it is hereditary. This points out the true ſource from whence that peſt originally ſprung, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> 
                           <hi>exceſs</hi> and <hi>idleneſs.</hi> Few perſons are affected with the gout till the decline of life, except thoſe who inherit it from their parents. Men are more liable to it than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, eſpecially thoſe of a full, groſs habit.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—One very common cauſe of the gout is a hereditary diſpoſition. Perſons who know themſelves to be tainted this way, ought therefore to guard againſt its attack, by ſteadily purſuing a courſe directly oppoſite to that which occaſions the diſeaſe. Full living, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally indulging in rich, pungent, or ſtimulating ſauces and generous wines, has a great tendency to bring on the gout. Intenſe thought, or application of the mind to abſtruſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, particularly night ſtudies, has likewiſe this effect. The plentiful uſe of acids, as ſour punch, prickt wines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are alſo hurtful; but nothing more certainly induces this diſeaſe than exceſs of venery, eſpecially in the early period of life.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the gout has been known to prove infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but this is rarely the caſe. It may proceed from an obſtruction or defect of any of the uſual diſcharges, as the perſpiration, ſweating of the feet, the menſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A ſudden chilling of the fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t after ſweat, or drying them at the fire after being wet and cold, are likewiſe bad. The modern cuſtom of eating a hot fleſh ſupper, drinking warm ſtrong liquors after it, and ſitting up the greater part of the night, is one very great cauſe of the gout, and indeed of many other diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—A fit of the gout is generally preceded by indigeſtion, drowſineſs, wind, a ſlight head-ach, ſickneſs, and ſometimes vomiting. The patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of wearineſs and dejection of ſpirits, and has often a pain in the limbs, with a ſenſation as if wind or cold water were paſſing down the thigh. The appetite is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably keen a day or two before the fit, and there is a ſlight pain in paſſing urine, and ſometimes an involuntary ſhedding of tears. Sometimes theſe ſymptoms are much more violent, eſpecially upon the near approach of the fit; and ſome obſerve, that as the fever which uſhers in the gout is, ſo will the fit be; if the fever be ſhort and ſharp, the fit will be ſo likewiſe; if it be feeble, long, and lingering,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:012338_0273_0F88EA70AB3DB3C0"/>
the fit will be ſuch alſo. But this obſervation can only hold with reſpect to very regular fits of the gout.</p>
                        <p>THE regular gout generally makes its attack in the ſpring, or beginning of winter, in the following manner: About two or three in the morning, the patient is ſeized with a pain in his great toe, ſometimes in the heel, and at other times in the ancle or calf of the leg. This pain is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſenſation, as if cold water were poured upon the part, which is ſucceeded by a ſhivering, with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of fever. Afterwards the pain increaſes, and fixing among the ſmall bones of the foot, the patient feels all the different kinds of torture, as if the part were ſtretched, burnt, ſqueezed, gnawed, or torn in pieces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The part at length becomes ſo exquiſitely ſenſible, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient cannot bear to have it touched, nor even ſuffer any perſon to walk acroſs the room.</p>
                        <p>THE patient is generally in exquiſite torture for twenty-four hours, from the time of the coming on of the fit: He then becomes eaſier, the part begins to ſwell, appears red, and is covered with a little moiſture. Towards morning he drops aſleep, and generally falls into a gentle breathing ſweat. This terminates the firſt paroxyſm, a number of which conſtitutes a fit of the gout; which is longer or ſhorter according to the patient's age, ſtrength, the ſeaſon of the year, and the diſpoſition of the body to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                        <p>THE patient is always worſe towards night, and eaſier in the morning. The paroxyſms however generally grow milder every day, till at length the matter is diſcharged by perſpiration, urine, and the other evacuations. In ſome patients this happens in a few days; in others it requires weeks, and in ſome months, to finiſh the fit. Thoſe whom age and frequent fits of the gout have greatly debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, ſeldom get free of it before the approach of ſummer, and ſometimes not till it be pretty far advanced.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—As there are no medicines, yet known, that will cure the gout, we ſhall confine our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations moſtly to regimen, both in and out of the fit.</p>
                        <p>IN THE FIT, if the patient be young and ſtrong, his diet ought to be thin and cooling, and his drink of a diluting nature; but where the conſtitution is weak, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has been accuſtomed to live high, this is not a proper time to retrench. In this caſe, he muſt keep nearly to his uſual diet, and ſhould take frequently a cup of ſtrong negas,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:012338_0274_0F88EA76C8127F70"/>
or a glaſs of generous wine. Wine whey is a very proper drink in this caſe, as it promotes the perſpiration without heating the patient. It will anſwer this purpoſe better, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> a tea ſpoonful of <hi>ſal volatile oleoſum,</hi> or ſpirits of hart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>horn, be put into a cup of it twice or thrice a-day. It will likewiſe be proper for the patient to take at bed time a tea ſpoonful of the volatile tincture of <hi>guaiacum</hi> in a large draught of warm wine whey. This will greatly promote perſpiration through the night.</p>
                        <p>AS we know no ſafe way of diſcharging the gouty matter but by perſpiration, this ought to be kept up by all means, eſpecially in the part affected. For this purpoſe, the leg and foot affected ſhould be wrapt in ſoft flannel, for or wool. The laſt is moſt readily obtained, and ſeems to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the purpoſe as well, if not better, than any thing elſe. The people of Lancaſhire look upon wool as a kind of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific in the gout. They wrap a great quantity of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>b<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the leg and foot affected, and cover it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                           </gap> of ſhamoy leather. This they ſuffer to continue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> eight or ten days, and ſometimes for a fortnight or three weeks, or longer if the pain does not ceaſe. I never knew any external application anſwer ſo well in the gout. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeen it applied when the ſwelling and inflammation were very great, with violent pain; and have found all theſe ſymptoms relieved by it in a few days. The wool which they uſe is generally greaſed, and carded or combed. They chooſe the ſofteſt which can be had, and ſeldom or never remove it till the fit be entirely gone off.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ought likewiſe to be kept quiet and eaſy during the fit. Every thing that affects the mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> the paroxyſm, and tends to throw the gout upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> parts. For the ſame reaſon, all external applications that repel the matter are to be avoided as death. They do not cure the diſeaſe, but remove it from a ſafe to a more dangerous part of the body, where it often proves fatal. A fit of the gout is rather to be conſidered as Nature's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of curing a diſeaſe than a diſeaſe itſelf, and all that we can do, with ſafety, is to promote her intentions, and to aſſiſt her in expelling the enemy in her own way. Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations by bleeding, ſtool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are likewiſe hurtful. They do not remove the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and by weakening the patient, they generally prolong the fit.</p>
                        <p>MANY things will indeed ſhorten a fit of the gout, and ſome will drive it off altogether; but nothing has yet been
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:012338_0275_0F88EA77704C6140"/>
found which will do this with ſafety to the patient. In pain we eagerly graſp at any thing that promiſes immediate eaſe, and even hazard life itſelf for a momentary relief. This is the true reaſon why ſo many infallible remedies have been propoſed for the gout, and why ſuch numbers have loſt their lives by them. It would be as prudent to ſtop the ſmall-pox from riſing, and to drive them into the blood, as to attempt to repel the gout. The latter is as much an effort of Nature to free herſelf from an offending cauſe as the former, and ought equally to be promoted. In fine, there is no diſeaſe which Nature makes a greater effort to cure than the gout; nor is it difficult to ſee which way her endeavours tend. She always attempts to throw the diſeaſe upon the extremities, and when that is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, her work is half done. It may ſafely lodge there till it be gradually expelled by the vital powers, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lodge ſafely any where elſe, nor be expelled in any other way.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the fit is over, the patient ought to take a doſe or two of the bitter tincture of rhubarb, or ſome other warm ſtomachic purge. He ſhould alſo drink a weak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſtomachic bitters, in ſmall wine or ale; as genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, with cinnamon, or Virginian ſnakeroot, and orange peel. The diet at this time ſhould be light, but nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gentle exerciſe ſhould be taken on horſeback, or in a machine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>OUT OF THE FIT, it is in the patient's power to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things towards preventing a return of the diſorder, or rendering the fit, if it ſhould return, leſs ſevere. This, however, is not to be attempted by medicine. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known the gout kept off for ſeveral years, by the Jeſuits bark, and other medicines; but in all the caſes where I had occaſion to ſee this tried, the perſons died ſuddenly, and, to all appearance, for want of a regular fit of the gout. One would be apt, from hence, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that a fit of the gout, to ſome conſtitutions, in the decline of life, is rather ſalutary than hurtful.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH it may be dangerous to ſtop a fit of the gout by medicine, yet if the conſtitution can be ſo changed by diet and exerciſe, as to leſſen or totally prevent its return, there certainly can be no danger in following ſuch a courſe. It is well known that the whole humours may be ſo altered by a proper courſe of diet, as quite to eradicate this diſeaſe;
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:012338_0276_0F88EA784DC84260"/>
and thoſe only who have reſolution enough to perſiſt in ſuch a courſe have reaſon to expect a cure.</p>
                        <p>THE courſe which we would recommend for preventing the gout, is as follows: In the firſt place, <hi>univerſal tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> In the next place, plenty of <hi>exerciſe.</hi> By this we do not mean ſauntering about in an indolent manner, but labour, ſweat, and toil. Theſe only can render the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours wholeſome, and keep them ſo. Going early to bed, and riſing by times, are of great importance. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proper to avoid night ſtudies, and all intenſe thought. The ſupper ſhould be light, and taken early. All ſtrong liquors, eſpecially generous wines and ſour punch, are to be avoided. Above all, we would recommend a milk diet. The uſe of milk is not to be gone into all at once, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed gradually, till it becomes the principal part of the diet.</p>
                        <p>WE would likewiſe recommend ſome doſes of <hi>magneſia alba</hi> and rhubarb to be taken every ſpring and autumn; and afterwards a courſe of ſtomachic bitters, as tanſy or water trefoil tea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an infuſion of gentian and camomile flowers, or a decoction of burdock root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Any of theſe, or an infuſion of any wholeſome bitter that is more agreeable to the patient, may be drank for two or three weeks twice a-day. An iſſue or perpetual bliſter has a great tendency to prevent the gout. If theſe were not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed, in the decline of life, they would not only often prevent the gout, but alſo many other mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Such as can afford to go to Bath will find great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from bathing and drinking the water. It both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes digeſtion and invigorates the habit.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the gout attacks the head or lungs, every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod muſt be taken to draw it towards the feet. They muſt be frequently bathed in warm water, and acrid cataplaſms applied to the ſoles. Bliſtering plaſters ought likewiſe to be applied to the ancles or calves of the legs. Bleeding in the feet or ancles is alſo neceſſary, and warm ſtomachic purges. The patient ought to keep in bed for the moſt part, if there be any ſigns of inflammation, and ſhould be very careful not to catch cold.</p>
                        <p>IF it attacks the ſtomach with a ſenſe of cold, the moſt warm cordials are neceſſary; as ſtrong wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cinnamon water, peppermint water, and even brandy or rum. The patient ſhould keep in bed, and endeavour to promote a ſweat by drinking warm liquors; and if he ſhould be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:012338_0277_0F88EA78EADD3C70"/>
with a nauſea, or inclination to vomit, he may drink camomile tea or ſmall poſſet.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the gout attacks the kidneys, and imitates gravel pains, the patient ought to drink freely of a decoction of marſhmallows, and to have the parts fomented with warm water. An emollient clyſter ought likewiſe to be given, and afterwards an opiate. If the pain be very violent, twenty or thirty drops of laudanum may be taken in a cup of the decoction.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who have had the gout ſhould be very attentive to any complaints that may happen to them about the time when they have reaſon to expect a return of the fit. The gout imitates many other diſorders, and by being miſtaken for them, and treated accordingly, is often diverted from its proper courſe, to the great danger of the patient's life.</p>
                        <p>THOSE who never had the gout, but who, from their conſtitution or manner of living, have reaſon to expect it, ought likewiſe to be very circumſpect with regard to its firſt approach. If the diſeaſe by wrong conduct or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper medicines, be diverted from its proper courſe, the miſerable patient has a chance to be ever after tormented with headachs, coughs, pains of the ſtomach and inteſtines; and generally falls, at laſt, a victim to its attack upon ſome of the more noble parts.</p>

                        <head>OF THE RHEUMATISM.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe has great affinity with the gout. It gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attacks the joints with exquiſite pain, and is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attended with inflammation and ſwelling. It is moſt common in the ſpring and towards the end of autumn. It is uſually diſtinguiſhed into acute and chronic; or the rheumatiſm attended with a fever, and that which is not.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The cauſes of a rheumatiſm are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſame as thoſe of an inflammatory fever, <abbr>
                              <hi>viz.</hi>
                           </abbr> an obſtructed perſpiration, the immoderate uſe of ſtrong liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sudden changes of the weather, and all quick tranſitions from heat to cold, are very apt to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rheumatiſm. The moſt extraordinary caſe of a rheumatiſm that I ever ſaw, where almoſt every joint of the body was diſtorted, was in a man who uſed to work one part of the day by the fire, and the other part of it in the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:012338_0278_0F88EA79F66B3E70"/>

water. Very obſtinate rheumatiſms have likewiſe been brought on by perſons, not accuſtomed to it, allowing their feet to continue long wet. The ſame effects are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produced by wet cloaths, damp beds, or lying upon the ground, eſpecially in the night.</p>
                        <p>THE rheumatiſm may either be occaſioned by exceſſive evacuations or the ſtoppage of uſual diſcharges. It is often the effect of chronic diſeaſes, which vitiate the humours; as the ſcurvy, the <hi>lues venerea,</hi> obſtinate autumnal agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE rheumatiſm prevails moſt in low, damp, marſhy countries. It is likewiſe very common amongſt the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of peaſants, who are ill clothed, live in low, cold houſes, and eat coarſe unwholeſome food, which contains but little nouriſhment, and is not eaſy aſſimilated.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—The <hi>acute</hi> rheumatiſm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly begins with wearineſs, ſhivering, a quick pulſe, reſtleſſneſs, thirſt, and other ſymptoms of fever. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the patient complains of flying pains, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the leaſt motion. Theſe at length fix in the joints, which are often affected with ſwelling and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. If blood be let in this diſeaſe, it has generally the ſame appearance as in the pleuriſy.</p>
                        <p>IN this kind of rheumatiſm the treatment of the patient is nearly the ſame as in an acute or inflammatory fever. If he be young and ſtrong, bleeding is neceſſary, which may be repeated according to the exigencies of the caſe.</p>
                        <p>THE belly ought likewiſe to be kept open by emollient clyſters, or cool opening liquors; as decoctions of tama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinds and liquorice, cream of tartar, whey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The diet ſhould be light, and in ſmall quantity, conſiſting chiefly of roaſted apples groat gruel, or very weak chicken broth. After the feveriſh ſymptoms have abated, if the pain ſtill continues, the patient muſt keep his bed, and take ſuch things as promote perſpiration; as wine whey with <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Mendereri,</hi> in the manner directed in page 267. The patient may likewiſe take, for a few nights, at bed time, in a cup of wine whey, a dram of cream of tartar, and half a dram of gum guaiacum in powder.</p>
                        <p>WARM bathing, after proper evacuations, has often an exceeding good effect. The patient may either be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bath of warm water, or have cloths wrung out of it applied to the parts affected. Great care muſt be taken that he do not catch cold after bathing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="275" facs="unknown:012338_0279_0F88EA7A6A979468"/>
THE <hi>chronic</hi> rheumatiſm is ſeldom attended with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree of fever, and is generally confined to ſome particular part of the body, as the ſhoulders, the back, or the loins. There is ſeldom any inflammation or ſwelling in this caſe. Perſons in the decline of life are moſt ſubject to the chronic rheumatiſm. In ſuch patients it often proves extremely obſtinate, and ſometimes incurable.</p>
                        <p>IN this kind of rheumatiſm the regimen ſhould be nearly the ſame as in the acute. Cool and diluting diet, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly of vegetable ſubſtances, as ſtewed prunes, cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled apples, currants or gooſeberries boiled in milk, is moſt proper. Arbuth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ot ſays, <q>If there be a ſpecific in aliment for the rheumatiſm, it is certainly whey;</q> and adds, <q>That he knew a perſon ſubject to this diſeaſe, who could never be cured by any other method but a diet of whey and bread.</q> He likewiſe ſays, <q>That cream of tartar in water gruel, taken for ſeveral days, will eaſe rheumatic pains conſiderably.</q> This I have often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, but found it always more efficacious when join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gum guaiacum, as directed above. In this caſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may take the doſe mentioned above twice a-day, and likewiſe a tea ſpoonful of the volatile tincture of gum gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aiacum at bed time in wine whey.</p>
                        <p>THIS courſe may be continued for a week, or longer, if the caſe proves obſtinate, and the patient's ſtrength will permit. It ought then to be omitted for a few days, and repeated again. At the ſame time, leeches or a bliſtering plaſter may be applied to the part affected. What I have generally found anſwer better than either of theſe, in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fixed rheumatic pains, is the <hi>warm plaſter.</hi> It is made by melting over a gentle fire, an ounce of gum plaſter, with two drams of bliſtering plaſter. This may be ſpread upon ſoft leather, and applied to the part affected. It ſhould be taken off and wiped every three or four days, and may be renewed once a fortnight. Cupping upon the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected is likewiſe often beneficial, and is greatly preferable to the application of leeches.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH this diſeaſe may not ſeem in the leaſt to yield to medicines for a long time, yet they ought ſtill to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in. Perſons who are ſubject to frequent returns of the rheumatiſm, will often find their account in uſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, whether they be immediately affected with it or not. The chronic rheumatiſm is ſimilar to the gout in
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:012338_0280_0F88EA7D68885F90"/>
this reſpect, that the moſt proper time for uſing medicines to extirpate it, is when the patient is moſt free from it.</p>
                        <p>TO thoſe who can afford to go thither, we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the warm baths of Buxton or Matlock in Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhire. Theſe have often cured very obſtinate rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, and are always ſafe either in or out of the fit. When the rheumatiſm is complicated with ſcorbutic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, which is not ſeldom the caſe, the Harrowgate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and thoſe of Moffat are proper. They ſhould both be drank and uſed as a warm bath.</p>
                        <p>THERE are ſeveral of our own domeſtic plants which may be uſed with advantage in the rheumatiſm. One of the beſt of them is the white muſtard ſeed. A table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this may be taken twice or thrice a-day, in a glaſs of water or ſmall wine. The water trefoil is likewiſe of great uſe in this complaint. It may be infuſed in wine or ale, or drank in form of tea. The ground-ivy, camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile, and ſeveral other bitters, are alſo beneficial, and may be uſed in the ſame manner. No benefit however is to be expected from theſe unleſs they be uſed for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time. Excellent medicines are often deſpiſed in this caſe, becauſe they do not perform a cure inſtantaneouſly; whereas nothing would be more certain than their effect, were they duly perſiſted in. The want of perſeverance in the uſe of medicines is one great cauſe why chronic diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſo ſeldom cured.</p>
                        <p>COLD bathing, eſpecially in ſalt water, often cures the rheumatiſm. We would alſo recommend riding on horſeback, and wearing flannel next the ſkin. A flannel ſhirt, in an obſtinate rheumatiſm, eſpecially if the patient be old, is one of the beſt medicines we know. Iſſues are likewiſe very proper; they have often been known to cure a chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic rheumatiſm. If the pain affects the ſhoulders, an iſſue may be made in the arm; but if it affects the loins, it ſhould be put in the leg or thigh. Rheumatic perſons ought to make choice of a dry warm air, to avoid wet cloaths as much as poſſible, and make frequent uſe of the fleſh-bruſh.</p>

                        <head>OF THE SCURVY.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe prevails chiefly in cold northern countries, eſpecially in low damp ſituations, near large marſhes, or
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:012338_0281_0F88EA7D802E0928"/>
great quantities of ſtagnating water. Sedentary people, of a dull melancholy diſpoſition are moſt ſubject to it. It proves often fatal to ſailors in long voyages, particularly in ſhips that are not properly ventilated, and have many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on board.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The ſcurvy is occaſioned by cold moiſt air, by the long uſe of ſalted or ſmoke-dried proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or of any kind of food that is hard of digeſtion, and affords little nouriſhment. It may alſo proceed from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive evacuations, or the ſuppreſſion of cuſtomary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges; as the <hi>menſes,</hi> haemorrhoidal flux, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is ſometimes owing to a hereditary taint, in which caſe a very ſmall cauſe will excite the latent diſorder. Grief, fear, and other depreſſing paſſions, have a great tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this diſeaſe. It may likewiſe proceed from neglect of cleanlineſs, bad cloathing, the want of proper exerciſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined air, exceſs in eating or drinking, or from any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which greatly weakens the body, or vitiates the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—This diſeaſe may be known by unuſual wearineſs, heavineſs of the body, and difficulty of breathing, eſpecially after bodily motion; rottenneſs of the gums, which are apt to bleed on the ſlighteſt touch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ſtinking breath, frequent bleeding of the noſe, difficulty of walking; ſometimes a ſwelling, and ſometimes a falling away of the legs, on which there are livid, yellow, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coloured ſpots; the face is generally of a pale or leaden colour. As the diſeaſe advances, other ſymptoms come on; as rottenneſs of the teeth, haemorrhages, or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of blood from various parts of the body, foul obſtinate ulcers, which no applications will cure; the patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of pains in various parts of the body, eſpecially about the breaſt, and his body is covered with dry ſcaly eruptions. At laſt a waſting or hectic fever comes on, and the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable patient is often carried off by a dyſentery, or diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoea, a dropſy, the palſy, fainting fits, or a mortification of ſome of the bowels.</p>
                        <p>CURE.—We know no method of curing this diſeaſe, but by purſuing a courſe directly oppoſite to that which brought it on. It proceeds from a vitiated ſtate of the humours, occaſioned by errors in diet, air, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; and this can be removed no other way than by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attention to theſe important articles.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="278" facs="unknown:012338_0282_0F88EA7E2FE0D9E8"/>
IF the patient has been obliged to breathe a cold, damp, or confined air, he ſhould be removed, as ſoon as poſſible, to a dry, open, and moderately warm one. If the diſeaſe proceeds from a ſedentary life, or depreſſing paſſions, as grief, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the patient muſt take daily as much exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the open air as he can bear, and his mind ſhould be diverted by cheerful company and other amuſements. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has a greater tendency either to prevent, or remove this diſeaſe, than conſtant cheerfulneſs and good humour. But this, alas, is ſeldom the lot of perſons afflicted with the ſcurvy; they are generally ſurly, peeviſh, ſour, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and dull.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the ſcurvy has been brought on by a long uſe of ſalted proviſions, the proper medicine is a diet conſiſting chiefly of freſh vegetables; as oranges, lemons, apples, tamarinds, water creſſes, ſcurvy graſs, brooklime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The uſe of theſe with milk, pot herbs, new bread, and freſh beer or cider, will ſeldom fail to remove a ſcurvy of this kind, if taken before it be too far advanced; but to have this effect they muſt be perſiſted in for a conſiderable time. When freſh vegetables cannot be had, pickled or preſerved ones may be uſed; and if theſe cannot be obtained, the chymical acids may be taken in their ſtead. All the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's food and drink muſt be ſharpened with cream of tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, elixir of vitriol, vinegar, or the ſpirit of ſea ſalt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THESE things, however, will more certainly prevent than cure the ſcurvy; for which reaſon ſeafaring people, eſpecially on long voyages, ought to lay in plenty of them. Cabbage, onions, gooſeberries, and many other vegetables, may be kept a long time by pickling, preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When theſe fail, the chymical acids, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, which will keep for any length of time, may be uſed. We have reaſon to believe, if ſhips were well venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, good ſtore of fruits, greens, and portable ſoup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> laid in, and a proper regard paid to cleanlineſs and warmth, that ſailors would be the moſt healthy people in the world, and would ſeldom ſuffer either from the ſcurvy or putrid fevers, which are ſo fatal to that uſeful ſet of men; but it is too much the temper of ſuch people to deſpiſe all precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they will not think of any calamity till they find it, when it is too late to ward off the blow.</p>
                        <p>IT muſt indeed be owned, that many of them have it not in their power to make the proviſion we are ſpeaking of; but in this caſe it is the buſineſs of their employers to
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:012338_0283_0F88EA7EEDC525D8"/>
make it for them; and no man ought to engage in a long voyage without having this article ſecured.</p>
                        <p>I have often ſeen very extraordinary effects in the ſcurvy from a milk diet. This preparation of nature is a mixture of animal and vegetable properties, which of all others is the moſt fit for reſtoring a decayed conſtitution, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that particular acrimony of the humours, which ſeems to conſtitute the very eſſence of the ſurvy, and many other diſeaſes. But men deſpiſe this wholeſome and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing food, becauſe it is cheap, and guzzle down fleſh, and fermented liquors, while milk is only deemed fit for their hogs.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper drink in the ſcurvy is whey or butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milk. When theſe cannot be had, ſound cider or perry may be uſed. Wort has been found to be a proper drink in the ſcurvy, and may be uſed at ſea, as malt will keep during the longeſt voyage. A decoction of the tops of the ſpruce fir is alſo good. It may be drank in the quantity of an Engliſh pint twice a-day. Tar water may likewiſe be uſed for this purpoſe, ordecoctions of any of the mild mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous vegetables; as ſarſaparilla, marſhmallow roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Infuſions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the leſſer cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, marſh trefoil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are likewiſe beneficial. I have ſeen the peaſants in ſome parts of Britain expreſs the juice of the laſt mentioned plant, and drink it with good effect in thoſe foul ſcorbutic eruptions with which they are often troubled in the ſpring ſeaſon.</p>
                        <p>THE Harrowgate water is certainly an excellent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in the ſcurvy. I have often ſeen patients in the moſt deplorable condition from that diſeaſe, greatly relieved by drinking the ſulphur water, and bathing in it. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeate water may alſo be uſed with advantage, eſpecially with a view to brace the ſtomach after drinking the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur water, which, though i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſharpens the appetite, never fails to weaken the power of digeſtion.</p>
                        <p>A ſlight degree of ſcurvy may be carried off by frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucking a little of the juice of a bitter orange, or lemon. When the diſeaſe affects the gums only, this practice, if continued for ſome time, will generally carry it off. We would, however, recommend the bitter orange as greatly preferable to lemon. It ſeems to be as good an acid, and is not near ſo hurtful to the ſtomach. Perhaps our own ſorrel may be little inferior to either of them. All kinds of ſalad are good in the ſcurvy, and ought to be eat in great
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:012338_0284_0F88EA7FD6665C18"/>
plenty; as ſpinage, lettuce, parſley, celery, endive, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, dandelion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is amazing to ſee how ſoon freſh vegetables in the ſpring cure the brute animals of any ſcab or foulneſs which is upon their ſkins. Is it not natural to ſuppoſe that their effects ſhould be as great upon the human ſpecies?</p>
                        <p>THE LEPROSY, which was ſo common in this country long ago, ſeems to have been near akin to the ſcurvy. Perhaps its appearing ſo ſeldom now, may be owing to the inhabitants of Britain eating more vegetable food than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, living more upon tea and other diluting diet, uſing far leſs ſalted meat, and being greatly more cleanly and better cloathed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—Where this diſeaſe happens, we would recommend the ſame courſe of diet and medicine as in the ſcurvy.</p>

                        <head>OF THE SCROPHULA, OR KING's EVIL.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe chiefly affects the glands, eſpecially thoſe of the neck. Children and young perſons of a ſedentary life are moſt ſubject to it. It is one of thoſe diſeaſes that may be removed by proper regimen, but ſeldom yields to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. The inhabitants of cold, damp, marſhy countries, are moſt liable to the ſcrophula.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—This diſeaſe may proceed from a hereditary taint, infection, a ſcrophulous nurſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Children who have the misfortune to be born of ſickly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whoſe conſtitutions have been worn out by the French-pox, or other chronic diſeaſes, are apt to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſcrophula. It may likewiſe proceed from ſuch diſeaſes as weaken the habit or vitiate the humours, as the ſmall-pox, meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> External injuries; as blows, bruiſes, compreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſometimes produce ſcrophulous ulcers; but there is reaſon to believe, when this happens, that it is owing either to a prediſpoſition in the habit to this diſeaſe, or to the confinement of the patient. In ſhort, whatever tends to vitiate the humours, or relax the ſolids, prediſpoſes to this diſeaſe; as the want of exerciſe, too much heat or cold, confined air, unwholeſome food, bad water, the uſe of poor, weak, watery aliments, the neglect of cleanlineſs, or ſuffering children to continue long wet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="281" facs="unknown:012338_0285_0F88EA825AEDE008"/>
SYMPTOMS.—At firſt ſmall knots appear under the chin or behind the ears, which gradually increaſe in number and ſize, till they form one large hard tumour. This often continues for a long time without breaking, and when it does break, it only diſcharges a thin <hi>ſanies</hi> or watery humour. Other parts of the body are likewiſe lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to its attack, as the arm-pits groins, feet, hands, eyes, breaſts, &amp;c. Nor are the internal parts exempt from it. It often affects the lungs, liver or ſpleen; and I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen the glands of the meſentery greatly enlarged by it.</p>
                        <p>THESE obſtinate ulcers which break out upon the feet and hands with ſwelling, and little or no redneſs, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called the <hi>ſpina ventoſa,</hi> are of the ſcrophulous kind. They ſeldom diſcharge good matter, and are exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to cure. The <hi>white ſwellings</hi> of the joints ſeem like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be of this kind. They can ſeldom be brought to a ſuppuration, and when opened they only diſcharge a thin ichor. There is not a more general ſymptom of the ſcrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la than a ſwelling of the upper lip and noſe. It likewiſe frequently begins in a ſingle toe or finger, which continues long ſwelled, with no great degree of pain, till at length the bone becomes carious.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—As this diſeaſe proceeds, in a great meaſure, from relaxation, the diet ought to be generous and nouriſhing, but at the ſame time light and of eaſy digeſtion, as good light bread, the fleſh and broth of young animals, with now and then a glaſs of generous wine, or good ale. The air ought to be open, dry, and not too cold, and the patient ſhould take as much exerciſe as he can bear. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is here of the utmoſt importance. Children will ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be troubled with the ſcrophula who have enough of exerciſe, and if they be, it alone has the greateſt chance to cure them.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—The vulgar are remarkably credulous with regard to the cure of the ſcrophula, many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in the virtue of the royal touch, that of the ſeventh ſon, &amp;c. The truth is, we know but little either of the nature or cure of this diſeaſe, and where reaſon or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines fail, ſuperſtition always comes in their place. Hence it is, that in diſeaſes which are the moſt difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we always hear of the greateſt number of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cures being performed. Here, however, the decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:012338_0286_0F88EA857B10AAA0"/>
on is eaſily accounted for. The ſcrophula at a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life, often cures of itſelf; and, if the patient hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be touched about this time, the cure is imputed to the touch, and not to nature, who is really the phyſician. In the ſame way the inſignificant noſtrums of quacks and old women often gain applauſe when they deſerve none.</p>
                        <p>THERE is nothing more pernicious, than the cuſtom of doſing children with ſtrong purgative medicines in the ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula. People imagine, that it proceeds from humours which muſt be purged off, without conſidering, that theſe purgatives increaſe the relaxation and aggravate the diſeaſe. It has indeed been found that keeping the belly gently open, eſpecially with ſea-water, has a good effect; but this ſhould only be given in ſuch quantity as to procure one, or at moſt two ſtools every day. Bathing in the ſalt water has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very good effect, eſpecially in the warm ſeaſon. I have often known a courſe of bathing in ſalt-water, and drinking it in ſuch quantities as to keep the belly gently open, cure a ſcrophula, after many medicines had been tried in vain. When ſalt-water cannot be had, the patient may be bathed in freſh-water, and his belly kept open by ſmall quantities of ſalt and water, or ſome other mild pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
                        <p>NEXT to cold bathing and drinking the ſalt-water, we would recommend the jeſuits bark. The cold bath may be uſed in ſummer, and the bark in winter. It may either be taken in ſubſtance mixed with wine, or if the patient cannot be brought to uſe it in that form, a decoction of it may be drank. An ounce of the jeſuits bark, and a dram of Winter's bark groſsly powdered, may be boiled in an Engliſh quart of water to a pint; towards the end, half an ounce of ſliced liquorice-root, and a handful of raiſins may be added, which will both render the medicine leſs diſagreeable and make it take up more of the bark. The liquor muſt be ſtrained, and two, three, or four ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, according to the age of the patient, taken three times a day. The patient ought at the ſame time to take, twice or thrice a day, a glaſs of good wine, with ten, twenty, or thirty drops of volatile tincture of guaiacum in it. I have often given the bark in obſtinate ſcrophulous caſes with very good effect. An adult may take at leaſt two drams of it daily, and muſt continue to uſe it for ſeveral months.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="283" facs="unknown:012338_0287_0F88EA8619DD0090"/>
THE Moffat and Harrowgate waters are likewiſe very proper medicines in the ſcrophula, eſpecially the latter. They ought not however to be drank in large quantities, but ſhould be taken ſo as to keep the belly gently open, and muſt be uſed for a conſiderable time.</p>
                        <p>AS to external applications, they are of little avail. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tumour breaks, nothing ought to be applied to it, unleſs a piece of flannel, or ſomething to keep it warm. After it breaks, the ſore may be dreſſed with ſome digeſtive ointment. What I have always found to anſwer beſt, was the yellow baſilicon mixed with about a ſixth or eighth part of its weight of red precipitate. The ſore may be dreſſed with this twice a day; and if it be very fungous, and does not digeſt well, a larger proportion of the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate may be added.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINES which mitigate this diſeaſe, tho' they do not cure it, are not to be deſpiſed. If the patient can be kept alive by any means till he arrives at the age of puberty, he he has a great chance to get well; but if he does not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at this time, in all probability he never will. Perſons afflicted with this diſeaſe ought not to marry. There is no malady which parents are ſo apt to communicate to their offſpring as the ſcrophula, and ſurely it is a cruel thing to entail miſery on poſterity.</p>
                        <p>FOR the means of preventing this diſeaſe, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the reader to the obſervations on nurſing, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the book.</p>

                        <head>OF THE RICKETS.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe generally attacks children betwixt the age of nine months and two years. It appeared firſt in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, about the time when manufactures began to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and ſtill prevails moſt in towns where the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants follow ſedentary employments, and by that means neglect either to take proper exerciſe themſelves, or to give it to their children. It has a great reſemblance to the foregoing diſeaſe both in its cauſes and method of cure.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—One cauſe of the rickets in children is diſeaſed parents. Mothers of a weak relaxed habit, who neglect exerciſe, and live upon weak watery diet, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be expected to bring forth ſtrong and healthy children, nor to be able to nurſe them, after they are brought forth.
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:012338_0288_0F88EA86D3044170"/>
Accordingly we find, that the children of ſuch women ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally die of the rickets, the ſcrophula, conſumptions, &amp;c. Children begotten by men in the decline of life, who are afflicted with the gout, the gravel, or other chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, or who have been often affected with the venereal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in their youth, are likewiſe liable to the rickets.</p>
                        <p>ANY diſorder that weakens the conſtitution, or relaxes the habit of children, as the ſmall-pox, meaſles, teething, the hooping-cough, &amp;c. prediſpoſes them to this diſeaſe. It may likewiſe be occaſioned by improper diet, as food that is either too weak and watery, or ſo viſcid that the ſtomach cannot digeſt it. Too great a quantity of rich and nouriſhing diet may likewiſe vitiate the humours and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the rickets. Bad nurſing is often the cauſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. When the nurſe is either diſeaſed, or has not enough of milk to nouriſh the child, it muſt ſuffer. But children ſuffer oftner by want of care in nurſes than want of food. Allowing an infant to continue long wet, or not keeping it thoroughly clean in its cloaths, &amp;c. has the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects. Wet ſhoes, ſtocking, and other cloaths, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax the bodies of children, and greatly obſtruct their growth. The want of free air, is likewiſe very hurtful to children in this reſpect. A nurſe who lives in a cloſe, ſmall houſe, where the air is damp and confined, and who is too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent to carry her child abroad into the open air, will hardly fail to give it the rickets. But want of exerciſe is the chief cauſe of this diſeaſe. A healthy child ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be in motion, unleſs when aſleep; but if it be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lie, or ſit, inſtead of being toſſed and dandled about, it can hardly eſcape this baneful malady.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—At the beginning of this diſeaſe the child's fleſh grows ſoft and flabby; its ſtrength is diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it loſes its wonted cheerfulneſs, looks more grave and compoſed than is natural for its age, and does not care to be moved. The head and belly become too large in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the other parts; the face appears full, and the complexion florid. Afterwards the bones begin to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſpecially in the more ſoft and ſpungy parts, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ends. Hence the wriſts and ancles become thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than uſual; the ſpine or back-bone puts on an unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſhape; the breaſt is likewiſe often deformed; and the bones of the arms and legs grow crooked. All thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms vary according to the violence of the diſeaſe. The
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:012338_0289_0F88EA872C7C0BD8"/>
pulſe is generally quick, but feeble; the appetite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, for the moſt part, bad; the teeth come ſlowly and with difficulty, and they often rot and fall out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Ricketty children generally have great acuteneſs of mind, and an underſtanding above their years. Whether this be owing to their being more in the company of adults than other children, or the enlargement of the brain, we ſhall not pretend to determine.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—As this diſeaſe is always attended with evident ſigns of weakneſs and relaxation, our chief aim in the cure muſt be to brace and ſtrengthen the ſolids, and to promote the digeſtion and due preparation of the fluids. Theſe important ends will be beſt promoted by wholeſome nouriſhing diet, ſuited to the age and ſtrength of the patient, and often repeated; by open dry air, and plenty of exerciſe. If the child has a bad nurſe, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglects her duty, or has not enough of milk, ſhe ſhould be changed. If the ſeaſon be cold, the child ought to be kept warm; and when the weather is hot it ought to be kept cool; as ſweating is very apt to weaken it; and too great a degree of cold has the ſame effect. The limbs ſhould be rubbed frequently with a warm hand, and the child ſhould be kept as cheerful as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>THE diet ought to be light and dry, as good bread, roaſted fleſh, &amp;c. Biſcuit is generally reckoned the beſt bread; and pigeons, pullets, veal, rabbets, or mutton roaſted or minced, are the moſt proper fleſh. If the child be too young for fleſh meats, he may have rice, millet, or pearl barley boiled with raiſins, to which may be added a little wine and ſpice. His drink may be good claret, of which he may take half a glaſs three or four times a day. Thoſe who cannot afford claret, may give the child now and then a wine glaſs of fine mild ale.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Medicines are here of little avail. The diſeaſe may often be cured by the nurſe, but ſeldom by the phyſician. In children of a groſs habit, gentle pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or vomits may ſometimes be of uſe; but they will never carry off the malady. That muſt depend upon bracing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: For which purpoſe, beſides the regimen mentioned above, we would recommend the cold bath, eſpecially in the warm ſeaſon. It muſt however be adminiſtred with prudence, as ſome ricketty children cannot bear it. The beſt time for uſing the cold bath is in the morning, and
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:012338_0290_0F88EA880D8BBA48"/>
the child ſhould be well rubbed with a dry cloth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after. If the child ſhould be weakened by the uſe of the cold bath, it muſt be diſcontinued.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES iſſues have been found beneficial both in this and the foregoing diſeaſe. They are peculiarly neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for children who abound with groſs humours. An infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the jeſuits-bark, in wine or ale, is likewiſe of uſe; but it is ſcarce poſſible to bring children to take it. We might here mention many other medicines which have been recommended for the rickets; but, as there is far more danger in truſting to theſe than in neglecting them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we chuſe rather to paſs them over, and to depend en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on regimen.</p>

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>OF THE ITCH.</head>
                        <p>THE ITCH is a diſeaſe of the ſkin, and is generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by infection. It ſeems originally to proceed from the want of cleanlineſs, bad air, or unwholeſome diet; as the inmates of jails, hoſpitals, and ſuch as live upon ſalted and ſmoke dried proviſions are ſeldom free from it.</p>
                        <p>IT generally appears in form of ſmall watery puſtules, firſt about the wriſts, or betwixt the fingers, and afterwards it affects the arms, legs, and thighs, &amp;c. Theſe puſtules are attended with an intolerable itching, eſpecially when the patient is warm in bed, or ſits near the fire. Sometimes the ſkin is covered with large blotches or ſcabs, and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times with a white ſcurf, or ſcaly eruption. This laſt is called the dry itch, and is the moſt difficult to cure.</p>
                        <p>THE itch is ſeldom a dangerous diſeaſe, unleſs when it is rendered ſo by neglect or improper treatment. If it be ſuffered to continue too long, it may vitiate the whole maſs of humours; and, if it be ſuddenly drove in, without proper evacuations, it may occaſion fevers, inflammations of the viſcera, or other internal diſorders.</p>
                        <p>THE ſafeſt medicine for the itch is ſulphur, which ought to be applied both externally and internally. The parts moſt affected may be rubbed with an ointment made of common ſulphur and flower of brimſtone, each an ounce; crude ſal ammonia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, finely powdered, two drams; hog's lard, or butter, four ounces. A ſcruple, or half a dram of of the eſſence of lemon may be added, to take away the diſagreeable ſmell. About the bulk of a nutmeg of this
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:012338_0291_0F88EA88AEE72FD8"/>
may be rubbed upon the extremities; at bed-time, twice or thrice a week. It is ſeldom neceſſary to rub any part but the extremities, and even theſe ought not all to be rubbed at the ſame time, but by turns, as it is dangerous to ſtop too many pores at once.</p>
                        <p>BEFORE the patient begins to uſe the ointment, he ought, if he be of a full habit, to bleed and take a purge or two. It will likewiſe be proper, during the uſe of it, to take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very night and morning as much of the flower of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, in a little treacle or new-milk, as will lie upon a ſhilling. He ſhould beware of catching cold, ſhould wear more cloaths than uſual, and take every thing warm. The ſame cloaths, the linen excepted, ought to be kept on all the time of uſing the ointment; and ſuch cloaths, as have been worn while the patient was under the diſeaſe, are not to be uſed again, unleſs they have been fumigated with brimſtone, and thoroughly cleaned, otherwiſe they will communicate the infection anew.</p>
                        <p>I never knew brimſtone, if uſed as directed above, fail to cure the itch; and I have reaſon to believe, that, if du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſted in, it never will fail: but if it be only uſed once or twice, and cleanlineſs be neglected, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the diſorder returns. The great ſecret both for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and curing the itch is CLEANLINESS. Where it prevails, the itch will ſeldom approach, and if it ſhould, it will ſoon be baniſhed. The quantity of ointment men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above will generally be ſufficient for the cure of one perſon; but, if any ſymptoms of the diſeaſe ſhould appear again, the medicine may be repeated. It is both more ſafe and efficacious when perſiſted in for a conſiderable time, than when a large quantity is applied at once. It will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be proper that the patient, while he is uſing the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould take a purge once a week.</p>
                        <p>PEOPLE ought to be extremely cautious not to miſtake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eruptions for the itch; as the ſtoppage of theſe may be attended with fatal conſequences. Many of the eruptive diſeaſes to which children are liable, have a near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the itch; and I have often known infants killed by being rubbed with greaſy ointments that made theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſtrike ſuddenly in, which nature had thrown out to preſerve the patient's life, or prevent ſome other diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>MUCH michief is likewiſe done by the uſe of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this diſeaſe. I have known ſome perſons mad enough
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:012338_0292_0F88EA896EABE428"/>
to waſh the parts affected with a ſtrong ſolution of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive ſublimate, which had almoſt proved fatal. Others uſe the mercurial ointment without taking the leaſt care either to avoid cold or obſerve a proper regimen. The conſequences of ſuch conduct may be eaſily gueſſed. I have known even the mercurial girdles produce tragical effects, and would adviſe every perſon, as he values his health, to beware how he uſes them. Mercury ought never to be uſed as a medicine without the greateſt care. Ignorant people look upon theſe girdles as a kind of charm, without conſidering that the mercury enters the blood.</p>
                        <p>AS ſulphur is both the moſt ſafe and efficacious medicine for the itch, we ſhall not recommend any other. Other medicines may be uſed by perſons of ſkill, but are not to be ventured upon by the ignorant. Thoſe who would avoid this deteſtable diſeaſe ought to beware of infected perſons, to uſe wholeſome food, and to ſtudy univerſal cleanlineſs.</p>

                        <head>OF THE ASTHMA.</head>
                        <p>THE aſthma is a diſeaſe of the lungs, which ſeldom admits of a cure. Perſons in the decline of life are moſt liable to this diſeaſe. It is divided into the moiſt and dry, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moural and nervous. The former is attended with expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration or ſpitting; but in the latter the patient ſeldom ſpits, unleſs ſometimes a little tough phlegm by the mere force of coughing.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—The aſthma is ſometimes hereditary. It may likewiſe proceed from a bad formation of the breaſt; the fumes of metals or minerals taken into the lungs<note n="*" place="bottom">I know a perſon whoſe lungs were ſet in a manner ſtock-ſtill, by the fumes of antimony. It happened in the night, after he had been preparing a great quantity of the regulus of antimony through the day. He was relieved by clyſters, fomentations and oily emulſions.</note>; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent exerciſe, eſpecially running; the obſtructions of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary evacuations, as the menſes, haemorrhoids,  the ſudden retroceſſion of the gout, or ſtriking in of eruptions, as the ſmall-pox, meaſles,  violent paſſions of the mind, as ſudden fear, or ſurpriſe. In a word, the diſeaſe may proceed from any cauſe that either impedes the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the blood through the lungs, or prevents their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duly expanded by the air.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="289" facs="unknown:012338_0293_0F88EA8A5129F390"/>
SYMPTOMS.—An aſthma is known by a quick laborious reſpiration, which is generally performed with a kind of wheezing noiſe. Sometimes the difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſo great that the patient is obliged to keep an erect poſture, otherwiſe he is in danger of being ſuffocated. A fit or paroxiſm of the aſthma is very apt to happen after a perſon has been expoſed to cold eaſterly winds, or has been abroad in thick foggy weather, or has got wet, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long in a damp place under ground, or the like.</p>
                        <p>A fit of the aſthma is generally uſhered in with great liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, want of ſleep, hoarſeneſs, cough, belching of wind, a ſenſe of heavineſs about the breaſt; and difficulty of breathing. To theſe ſucceed heat, fever, pain of the head, ſickneſs and nauſea, great oppreſſion of the breaſt, palpitation of the heart, a weak and ſometimes intermitting pulſe, an involuntary flow of tears, bilious vomitings, &amp;c. All the ſymptoms grow worſe towards night; the patient is eaſier when up than in bed, and is very deſirous of cool air.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—The food ought to be light, and of eaſy digeſtion. Boiled meats are generally preferred to roaſted, and the fleſh of young animals to that of old. All windy food, and whatever is apt to ſwell upon the ſtomach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be avoided. Light puddings, white broths, and ripe fruits baked, boiled or roaſted, are proper. Strong liquor of all kinds, eſpecially malt-liquor, is hurtful. The pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhould eat a very light ſupper, or rather none at all. His cloathing ſhould be warm, eſpecially in the winter-ſeaſon. A flannel ſhirt or waiſtcoat, and thick ſhoes, are of great ſervice; as all diſorders of the breaſt are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by keeping the feet warm, and promoting the perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p>BUT nothing is of ſo great importance in the aſthma as pure and moderately warm air. Aſthmatic people can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom bear either the cloſe heavy air of a large town, or the ſharp, keen atmoſphere of a bleak hilly country; a medium between theſe is therefore to be choſen. The air near a large town is often better than at a diſtance, provided the patient be removed ſo far as not to be affected by the ſmoke. Some aſthmatic patients indeed breathe eaſier in town than in the country; but this is ſeldom the caſe, eſpecially in towns where much coal is burnt. Aſthmatic perſons who are obliged to be in town all day, ought, at leaſt, to ſleep out of it. Even this will often prove of great ſervice. Thoſe
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:012338_0294_0F88EA8C4AF9D468"/>
who can afford it ought to travel into a warmer climate. Many aſthmatic perſons who cannot live in Britain enjoy very good health in the ſouth of France, or in Spain or Italy.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE is likewiſe of very great importance in the aſthma, as it promotes the digeſtion, and greatly aſſiſts in the preparation of the blood. The blood of aſthmatic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is ſeldom duly prepared, owing to the proper action of the lungs being impeded. For this reaſon ſuch people ought daily to take as much exerciſe, either on foot, horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, or in a machine, as they can bear.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—Almoſt all that can be done by medicine in this diſeaſe, is to relieve the patient when ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a violent fit. This indeed requires the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, as the diſeaſe often proves ſuddenly fatal. In the paroxiſm or fit, the body is generally bound, a clyſter ought therefore to be adminiſtred, and if there be occaſion, it may be repeated two or three times. The patient's feet ought to be put into warm water, and afterwards rubbed with a warm hand, or dry cloth. If there be a violent ſpaſm about the breaſt or ſtomach, warm fomentations, or bladders filled with warm milk and water, may be applied to the part affected, and warm cataplaſms to the ſoles of the feet. The patient muſt drink freely of diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and may take a tea-ſpoonful of the tincture of caſtor and ſaffron, mixed together in a cup of valerian-tea, twice or thrice a-day. Sometimes a vomit has a very good effect, and ſnatches the patient, as it were, from the jaws of death. This will be more ſafe after other evacuations have been premiſed.</p>
                        <p>OUT OF THE FIT. In the moiſt aſthma, ſuch things as promote expectoration or ſpitting, ought to be uſed; as the ſyrup of ſquills, gum-ammoniac, and ſuch like. A common ſpoonful of the ſyrup or oxomell of ſquills, mixed with an equal quantity of cinnamon-water, may be taken three or four times a-day. Any quantity of gum-ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, with an equal quantity of aſafoetida, may be made into pills, and four or five of them taken every night at bed-time.</p>
                        <p>IN the convulſive or nervous aſthma, antiſpaſmodics and bracers are the moſt proper medicines. The patient may take a tea-ſpoonful of the paregoric elixir twice a-day. The jeſuits bark is likewiſe proper in this caſe. It may be taken in ſubſtance, or infuſed in wine. In ſhort, every thing
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:012338_0295_0F88EA8DDFD2F518"/>
that braces the nerves, or takes off ſpaſm, may be of uſe in a nervous aſthma. It is often relieved by the uſe of aſſes milk; I have likewiſe known cows milk drank warm of a morning, have a very good effect in this caſe.</p>
                        <p>IN every ſpecies of aſthma iſſues have a good effect; they may either be made in the back or ſide, and ſhould never be allowed to dry up. We ſhall here, once for all, obſerve, that in moſt chronic diſeaſes, iſſues are extremely proper. They are both a ſafe and efficacious remedy; and and tho' they do not always cure the diſeaſe, yet they will often prolong the patient's life.</p>

                        <head>OF THE APOPLEXY.</head>
                        <p>THE apoplexy is a ſudden loſs of ſenſe and motion, wherein the patient is to all appearance dead, only the heart and lungs ſtill continue to move. This diſeaſe, by a little care, might often be prevented, but can ſeldom be cured. It chiefly attacks ſedentary perſons of a groſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, who uſe a rich and plentiful diet, and indulge in ſtrong liquors.

                        <p>IN the ſanguine apoplexy, if the patient does not die ſuddenly, the countenance appears florid, the face is ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or puffed up, and the blood-veſſels, eſpecially about the neck and temples, are turged; the pulſe beats ſtrong; the eyes are prominent and fixed, and the breathing is difficult, and performed with a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>orting noiſe. The excrements and urine are often voided ſpontaneouſly, and the patient is ſometimes ſeized with a vomiting.</p>
                        <p>IN this caſe every method muſt be taken to leſſen the force of the blood towards the head. The patient ſhould be kept perfectly eaſy and cool. His head ſhould be raiſed pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty high, and his feet ſuffered to hang down. His cloaths ought to be looſened, eſpecially about the neck, and freſh air admitted into his chamber. His garters ſhould be tied pretty tight, by which means the motion of the blood from the lower extremities will be retarded. As ſoon as the patient is placed in a proper poſture, he ſhould be bled pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty freely in the neck or arm, and, if there be occaſion, the operation may be repeated in two or three hours. A laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive clyſter with plenty of ſweet oil, or freſh butter and a large ſpoonful of common ſalt in it, may be adminiſtred eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two hours; and bliſtering plaſters applied betwixt the ſhoulders, and to the calves of the legs.</p>
                        <p>AS ſoon as the ſymptoms are a little abated, and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is able to ſwallow, he ought to drink freely of ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting opening liquor, as a decoction of tamarinds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice, cream-tartar-whey, or common whey with cream of tartar diſſolved in it. Or he may take any cooling purge, as Glauber's ſalts, or manna diſſolved in an infuſion of ſenna, or the like. All ſpirits and other ſtrong liquors are to be
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:012338_0297_0F88EA8EACBBBC88"/>
avoided. Even volatile ſalts held to the noſe do miſchief. Vomits, for the ſame reaſon, ought not be given, nor any thing that may increaſe the motion of the blood towards the head.</p>
                        <p>IN the ſerous apoplexy, the ſymptoms are nearly ſimilar, only the pulſe is not ſo ſtrong, the countenance is leſs flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and the breathing leſs difficult. Bleeding is not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary here, as in the former caſe. It may however ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally be performed once with ſafety and advantage; but ſhould not be repeated. The patient ſhould be placed in the ſame poſture as directed above, and ſhould have bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plaſters applied, and receive opening clyſters in the ſame manner. Purges are here likewiſe neceſſary, and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent may drink ſtrong balm tea. If he be inclined to ſweat, it ought to be promoted by drinking ſmall wine whey, or an infuſion of carduus benedictus. A plentiful ſweat kept up for a conſiderable time, has often carried off a ſerous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy.</p>
                        <p>WHEN apoplectic ſymptoms proceed from opium, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther narcotic ſubſtances taken into the ſtomach, vomits are neceſſary. The patient is generally relieved, as ſoon as he has diſcharged the poiſon in this way.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS of an apoplectic make, or thoſe who have been attacked by it, ought to uſe a very ſpare and ſlender diet, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all ſtrong liquors, ſpiceries, and high ſeaſoned food. They ought likewiſe to guard againſt all violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to avoid the extremes of heat and cold. The head ſhould be ſhaved, and daily waſhed with cold water. The feet ought to be kept warm, and never ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long wet. The belly muſt, by all means, be kept open, either by food or medicine, and blood ought to be let every ſpring and fall. Moderate exerciſe ſhould likewiſe be taken; but it ought never to be continued too long. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has a greater effect in preventing an apoplexy than iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues or perpetual bliſters; but great care muſt be taken ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſuffer them to dry up, without opening others in their ſtead. Apoplectic perſons ought never to go to ſleep with a full ſtomach, nor to lie with their heads too low, or wear any thing tight about their necks.</p>

                        <head>OF THE PALSY.</head>
                        <p>THE palſy is a loſs or diminution of ſenſe, or motion, or of both, in one or more parts of the body. It is more or leſs dangerous, according to the importance of the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. A palſy of the heart, lungs, or any part neceſſary for life, is mortal. When it affects the ſtomach, the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or the bladder, it is highly dangerous. If the face be affected, the caſe is bad, as this ſhews, that the diſeaſe proceeds from the brain. If the part affected feels cold, is inſenſible, or waſtes away, there is ſmall hopes of a cure, eſpecially, if the judgement and memory begin to fail.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—THE immediate cauſe of the palſy is whatever prevents the regular exertion of the nervous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon any particular muſcle or part of the body. The occaſional and prediſpoſing cauſes are various, as drunkenneſs; wounds of the brain, or ſpinal marrow; preſſure upon the brain or nerves; very cold or damp air; the ſuppreſſion of cuſtomary evacuations; ſudden fear; want of exerciſe; or or whatever greatly relaxes the ſyſtem, as drinking much tea,<note n="*" place="bottom">Many people imagine, that tea has no tendency to hurt the nerves, and that drinking the ſame quantity of warm water would be equally pernicious. This however ſeems to be a miſtake. I know many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who daily drink three or four cups of warm milk and water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling any bad conſequences; yet the ſame quantity of tea will make their hands ſhake for twenty-four hours.</note> or coffee, &amp;c. Wounds of the nerves themſelves, or any thing that obſtructs the regular action of that vital pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er contained in them, will occaſion a palſy. It may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe proceed from the poiſonous fumes of metals or minerals, as mercury, lead, arſenick, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>IN young perſons of a full habit, where there are ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of inflammation, the palſy muſt be treated in the ſame manner as the ſanguine apoplexy. The patient muſt be bled, bliſtered, and have his belly kept open by ſharp cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or pugative medicines. But, in old age, or when the diſeaſe proceeds from relaxation or debility, which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the caſe, a quite contrary courſe muſt be purſued. The diet mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> be warm and attenuating, conſiſting chiefly of ſpicy and aromatic vegetables, as muſtard, horſe-radiſh, &amp;c. The drink may be generous wine, muſtard-whey, or brandy and water. Friction with the fleſh bruſh, or a warm hand, is extremely proper, eſpecially on the parts
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:012338_0299_0F88EDC6ED648F48"/>
affected. Bliſtering-plaſters may likewiſe be applied to the affected parts with advantage. When this cannot be done, they may be rubbed with the volatile liniment, or the nerve-ointment of the Edinburgh diſpenſatory. But the beſt external application is electricity. The ſhocks ſhould be received on the part affected; and they ought daily to be repeated for ſeveral weeks. This is not only proper for curing, but alſo for preventing a palſy.</p>
                        <p>VOMITS are very beneficial in this kind of palſy, and ought to be frequently adminiſtred. Caephalic ſnuff, or any thing that makes the patient ſneeze, is likewiſe uſeful. Some pretend to have found great benefit from rubbing the parts affected with nettles; but this does not ſeem to be any ways preferable to bliſtering. If the tongue be affected, the patient may gargle his mouth frequently with brandy and muſtard; or he may hold a bit of ſugar in his mouth wet with the palſy-drops or compound ſpirits of lavender. The wild valerian root is a very proper medicine in this caſe. It may either be taken in an infuſion with ſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, or half a dram of it in powder may be given in a glaſs of wine three times a day. If the patient cannot uſe the valerian, he may take of <hi>ſal volatile oleoſum,</hi> compound ſpirits of lavender, and tincture of caſtor, each half an ounce; mix theſe together, and take forty or fifty drops in a glaſs of wine, three or four times a day. A table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of muſtard-ſeed taken frequently is a very good medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. The patient ought likewiſe to chew cinnamon bark, ginger, or other warm ſpiceries.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE is of the utmoſt importance in the palſy; but the patient muſt beware of cold, damp, and moiſt air. He ought to wear flannel next his ſkin; and, if poſſible, ſhould remove into a warmer climate.</p>

                        <head>OF THE EPILEPSY, OR FALLING SICKNESS.</head>
                        <p>THE epilepſy is a ſudden deprivation of all the ſenſes, wherein the patient falls ſuddenly down, and is affected with violent convulſive motions. Children, eſpecially thoſe that are delicately brought up, are moſt ſubject to it. It more frequently attacks men than women, and is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to cure. When the epilepſy attacks children, there is reaſon to hope it may go off about the time of puberty.
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:012338_0300_0F88EDC7CF9B6068"/>
When it attacks any perſon after twenty years of age, the cure is difficult; but when after forty, a cure is hardly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. If the fit continues only for a ſhort ſpace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns ſeldom, there is reaſon to hope; but if it continues long and returns frequently, the proſpect is bad. It is a very unfavourable ſymptom, when the patient is ſeized with the fits in his ſleep.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—Sometimes the epilepſy is a hereditary diſeaſe. It may likewiſe proceed from a ſudden fright of the mother when with child of the patient; from blows, bruiſes, or wounds on the head; a collection of water, blood, or ſerous humours in the brain; a polypus; tumours or concretions within the ſkull; exceſſive drinking; intenſe ſtudy; exceſs of venery; worms; teething; ſuppreſſion of cuſtomary evacuations; too great emptineſs or repletion; violent paſſions or affections of the mind, as fear, joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hyſteric affections; contagion received into the body, as the infection of the ſmall-pox, meaſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—An epileptic fit is generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by an unuſual wearineſs; pain of the head; dulneſs; giddineſs; noiſe in the ears; dimneſs of ſight; palpitation of the heart; diſturbed ſleep; difficult breathing; the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are inflated with wind; the urine is in great quantity, but thin; the complexion is pale; the extremities are cold, and the patient feels as it were a ſtream of cold air aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards his head.</p>
                        <p>IN the fit, the patient generally makes an unuſual noiſe; his thumbs are drawn in towards the palms of the hands; his eyes are diſtorted; he ſtarts, and foams at the mouth; his extremities are bent or twiſted various ways; he often diſcharges his ſeed, urine, and foeces involuntarily; and is quite deſtitute of all ſenſe and reaſon. After the fit is over, his ſenſes gradually return, and he complains of a kind of ſtupor, wearineſs, and pain of his head; but has no remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what happened to him during the fit.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the fits return at ſtated periods, as at the full or change of the moon: at other times they are excited by violent affections of the mind, a debauch of liquor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat, cold, or the like.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe, from the difficulty of inveſtigating its cauſes, and its ſtrange ſymptoms, was formerly attributed to the wrath of the gods, or the agency of evil ſpirits. In modern times it has often, by the vulgar, been imputed to
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:012338_0301_0F88EDC971359860"/>
witchcraft or faſcination. It depends however as much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on natural cauſes as any other malady; and its cure can only be effected by perſiſting in the uſe of proper means.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Epileptic patients ought, if poſſible, to breathe a pure and free air. Their diet ſhould be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of eaſy digeſtion. They ought to drink nothing ſtrong, to avoid ſwines fleſh, water-fowl, and likewiſe all windy and oily vegetables, as cabbage, nuts, &amp;c. They ought to keep themſelves cheerful, carefully avoiding all occaſions of violent paſſions, as anger, fear, &amp;c<note n="*" place="bottom">It has already been obſerved that epileptic ſits are often the effect of fear, and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> by that idle cuſtom among young people of frightening one another. Though this be generally done out of mere frolic, it has many dreadful conſequences, and ought by all means to be diſcouraged. It is finely a ſmaller crime to take away a perſon's life, than to render him at once miſerable in himſelf, and a burden to ſociety.</note>.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE is likewiſe of great uſe; but the patient muſt be careful to avoid all extremes either of heat or cold, all dangerous ſituations, as ſtanding upon precipices, riding deep waters, &amp;c. Any thing that makes him giddy, is apt to occaſion a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>it, as turning round, looking into a deep pit, or the like; all theſe ought therefore to be avoided with the utmoſt care.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—The intentions of cure muſt vary according to the cauſe of the diſeaſe. If the patient be of a ſanguine temperament, and there be reaſon to fear an inflammation in the brain, bleeding and other evacuations will be neceſſary. When the diſeaſe is occaſioned by the ſtoppage of cuſtomary evacuations, theſe, if poſſible, muſt be reſtored; if this cannot be done, others may be ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in their place. Iſſues or ſetons, in this caſe, have often a very good effect. When there is reaſon to believe that the diſeaſe proceeds from worms, proper medicines muſt be uſed to kill or carry off theſe vermin. When the diſeaſe proceeds from teething, the belly ſhould be kept open by emollient clyſters, the feet frequently bathed in warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, if the fits prove obſtinate, a bliſtering plaſter may be put betwixt the ſhoulders. The ſame method is to be followed, when epileptic fits precede the eruption of the ſmall-pox, or meaſles, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe is hereditary, or proceeds from a wrong formation of the brain a cure is not to be expected. When it is owing to ſome fault in the nervous ſyſtem ſuch
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:012338_0302_0F88EDCA0334DCA0"/>
medicines as tend to brace and ſtrengthen the nerves may be uſed, as the Jeſuits bark, Valerian root, miſletoe of the oak, ſnake-root, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>FULLER recommends the following electuary as a moſt excellent <hi>anti-epileptic.</hi> Take Jeſuits bark in powder three ounces, Virginian ſnake-root powdered one ounce, as much ſyrup of paeony or cloves as is ſufficient to form it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſoft electuary. The doſe to an adult is a dram, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſize of a nutmeg, morning and evening. It muſt be continued for three or four months, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repeated, three or four days before the new and full moon, for ſome time.</p>
                        <p>MEAD recommends an electuary againſt the epilepſy much of the ſame nature, only he uſes Valerian-root in place of the ſnake-root. It muſt be taken in the ſame manner as the above. The patient ought always to be bled, and to take a purge or two before he begins to uſe theſe medicines. They will likewiſe have a better effect if the patient drinks a tea-cupful of the decoction of <hi>guaiacum</hi> after each doſe. It may be made by boiling two ounces of guaiacum ſhavings, and one ounce of raiſins of the ſun ſtoned, in two Engliſh quarts of water to one. Strain the liquor, and afterwards let it ſtand to ſettle, then pour off the clear from the feces.</p>
                        <p>COLEBATCH ſays, that the miſletoe cures an epilepſy as certainly as the Jeſuits bark does an intermittent fever. The doſe to an adult is half a dram of the powder, four times a-day, drinking after it a draught of a ſtrong infuſion of the ſame plant. Though this medicine has not been found to anſwer the high encomiums which have been paſſed upon it, yet in obſtinate epileptic caſes it deſerves a trial. It muſt be uſed for a conſiderable time, in order to produce any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary effects.</p>
                        <p>MUSK has ſometimes been found to anſwer very well in the epilepſy. Ten or twelve grains of it, with the ſame quantity of factitious cinnabar, may be made up into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and taken every night and morning.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES the epilepſy has been cured by electricity.</p>
                        <p>CONVULSION FITS proceed from the ſame cauſes, and muſt be treated in the ſame manner as the epilepſy.</p>
                        <p>THERE is one particular ſpecies of convulſions, which commonly goes by the name of St. Vitus's dance, wherein the patient is agitated with ſtrange motions and geſticulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which by the common people are generally believed
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:012338_0303_0F88EDCF0E495D28"/>
to be the effects of witchcraft. This diſeaſe may be cured by repeated bleedings and purges; and afterwards uſing the medicines preſcribed above for the epilepſy, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the jeſuits-bark, and ſnake-root, &amp;c. Chalybeate waters, are found to be beneficial in this caſe. The cold bath is likewiſe of ſingular ſervice, and ought never to be neglected when the patient can bear it.</p>

                        <head>OF NERVOUS, HYSTERIC, AND HYPOCHONDRIAC DISORDERS.</head>
                        <p>OF ALL diſeaſes incident to mankind, thoſe of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous kind are the moſt complicated and difficult to cure. A volume would not be ſufficient to point out the various ſymptoms. They imitate almoſt every diſeaſe; and are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alike in two different perſons, or even in the ſame perſon at different times. Like Proteus, they are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changing ſhape; and upon every freſh attack, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thinks he feels ſymptoms which he never experienced before. Nor do they only effect the body, the mind like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuffers, and is often thereby rendered extremely weak and peeviſh. The low ſpirits, timorouſneſs, melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fickleneſs of temper which generally attend ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous diſorders, induce many people to believe, that they are entirely diſeaſes of the mind; but this change of temper is rather a conſequence, than the cauſe of nervous diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>CAUSES.—Every thing that tends to relax or weaken the body, prediſpoſes it to nervous diſeaſes, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, exceſſive venery, drinking great quantities of tea, or other weak watery liquors, frequent bleeding, purging, vomiting, &amp;c. Whatever hurts the digeſtion, or prevents the proper aſſimilation of the aliment, has likewiſe this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as long faſting, exceſs in eating or drinking, the uſe of windy, crude, or unwholeſome aliments, a bending poſture of the body, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>NERVOUS diſorders often proceed from affections of the mind, as grief, diſappointments, anxiety, intenſe ſtudy, &amp;c. Few ſtudious perſons are free from nervous diſeaſes. Nor is this at all to be wondered at; intenſe thinking not only preys upon the ſpirits, but prevents the perſon from taking proper exerciſe, by which means the digeſtion i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

likewiſe produce the ſame effects.

                           </gap>he body, or depreſſes the ſpirits, may occaſion nervous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, as unwholeſome air, want of ſleep, great fatigue, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—We ſhall only mention ſome of the moſt general ſymptoms of theſe diſorders, as it would be both an uſeleſs and impracticable taſk to point out the whole. They generally begin with windy inflations or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenſions of the ſtomach and inteſtines, eſpecially under the falſe ribs of the left ſide, where a hard tumour may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be perceived. The appetite and digeſtion are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bad; yet ſometimes there is an uncommon craving for food, and a quick digeſtion. The food often turns ſour on the ſtomach; and the patient is troubled with vomiting of clear water, tough phlegm, or a blackiſh coloured liquor reſembling the grounds of coffee. Excruciating pains are often felt about the navel, attended with a rumbling or murmuring noiſe in the bowels. The belly is ſometimes looſe, but more commonly bound, which occaſions a reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wind and great uneaſineſs.</p>
                        <p>THE urine is ſometimes in ſmall quantity, at other times very copious and quite clear. There is a great ſtraitneſs of the breaſt with difficulty of breathing; violent palpitations of the heart; ſudden fluſhings of heat in various parts of the body; at other times a ſenſe of cold, as if water were pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them; flying pains in the arms and limbs; pains in the back and belly, reſembling thoſe occaſioned by gravel; the pulſe very variable, ſometimes uncommonly ſlow, and at other times very quick; yawning, the hiccup, frequent ſighings and a ſenſe of ſuffocation, as if from a ball or lump in the throat; alternate fits of crying and convulſive laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the ſleep is unſound, and ſeldom refreſhing; and the patient is often troubled with the night-mare.</p>
                        <p>AS the diſeaſe increaſes, the patient is moleſted with headachs, cramps, and fixt pains in various parts of the body; the eyes are clouded, and often affected with pain and dryneſs; there is a noiſe in the ears, and often a dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of hearing; in ſhort, the whole animal functions are impaired. The mind is diſturbed on the moſt trivial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:012338_0305_0F88EDD0C22CC340"/>
and is hurried into the moſt perverſe commotions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes, terror, ſadneſs, anger, diffidence, &amp;c. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is apt to entertain wild imaginations, and extravagant fancies; the memory becomes weak, and the reaſon fails. Nothing is more characteriſtic of this diſeaſe than a conſtant dread of death. This renders the patients peeviſh, fickle, impatient, and apt to run from one phyſician to another; which is one reaſon why they ſeldom reap any benefit from medicine, as they have not ſufficient reſolution to perſiſt in any one courſe till it has time to produce its proper effects. They are likewiſe apt to imagine that they labour under diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes from which they are quite free, and are very angry if any one attempts to laugh them out of their ridiculous no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Hyſteric and hypochondriac per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought never to faſt long. Their food ſhould be ſolid and nouriſhing, but of eaſy digeſtion. Fat meats, and heavy ſauces, are hurtful. All exceſs ſhould be carefully avoided. They ought never to eat more at a time than they can eaſily digeſt. Heavy ſuppers are to be avoided. If the patient feels himſelf weak and faint between meals, he ought to eat a bit of bread, and drink a glaſs of wine. Tho' wine in exceſs enfeebles the body, and impairs the faculties of the mind, yet taken in moderation, it ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and promotes digeſtion. Wine and water is a very proper drink at meals. If wine ſours on the ſtomach, or the patient is much troubled with wind, brandy and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will anſwer better. Every thing that is windy, or hard of digeſtion, muſt be avoided. All weak and warm liquors are hurtful, as tea, coffee, punch, &amp;c. People may find a temporary relief from theſe, but they always increaſe the malady, as they weaken the ſtomach, and hurt digeſtion. Above all things, drams are to be avoided. Whatever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate eaſe the patient may feel from the uſe of ardent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, they are ſure to aggravate the malady, and prove cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poiſons at laſt. Theſe cautions are the more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here, as all hyſteric and hypochondriac perſons are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly fond of tea and ardent ſpirits; to the uſe of which many of them fall a victim.</p>
                        <p>EXERCISE is of ſuch importance in nervous diſorders, that it is worth all other medicines. Riding on horſeback is generally eſteemed the beſt, as it gives motion to the whole body, without fatiguing it. I have known ſome patients,


<pb n="302" facs="unknown:012338_0306_0F88EDD183B979D8"/>
however, with whom walking agreed better, and others who were moſt benefited by riding in a machine. Every one ought to uſe that which he finds moſt beneficial. Long ſea-voyages have an excellent effect; and to thoſe who can afford to take them, and have ſufficient reſolution, we would by all means recommend this courſe. Even change of place, and the ſight of new objects, by diverting the mind, have a great tendency to remove theſe complaints. For this reaſon a long journey, or a voyage, is of much more advantage than riding ſhort journeys near home.</p>
                        <p>A cool and dry air is the beſt, as it braces and imparts vigour to the whole body. Nothing tends more to relax and enervate than hot air, eſpecially that which is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo by great fires, or ſtoves in ſmall apartments. But when the ſtomach or bowels are weak, the body ought to be well guarded againſt cold, eſpecially in winter, by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thin flannel waiſtcoat next the ſkin. This will keep up an equal perſpiration, and defend the alimentary canal from many impreſſions, to which it would otherwiſe be ſubject, upon every ſudden change from warm to cold wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Rubbing the body frequently with a fleſh-bruſh, or a coarſe linen cloth, is likewiſe beneficial, as it promotes the circulation, perſpiration, &amp;c. Perſons who have weak nerves ought to riſe early, and take exerciſe before break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, as lying too long a-bed cannot fail to relax the ſolids. They ought likewiſe to be diverted, and to be kept as eaſy and cheerful as poſſible. Nothing hurts the nervous ſyſtem, or weakens the digeſtive powers more than fear, grief, or anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINES.—Tho' nervous diſeaſes are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom radically cured, yet their ſymptoms may ſometimes be alleviated, and the patient's life rendered, at leaſt, more comfortable, by proper medicines.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient is coſtive, he ought to take a little rhubarb, or ſome other mild purgative, and ſhould never ſuffer his belly to be long bound. All ſtrong and violent purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are however to be avoided, as aloes, jalap, &amp;c. I have generally ſeen an infuſion of ſenna and rhubarb in brandy anſwer very well. This may be made of any ſtrength, and taken in ſuch quantity as the patient finds neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the digeſtion is bad, and the ſtomach relaxed and weak, bitters will be of ſervice. The beſt of theſe are the jeſuits bark and gentian root, which may be prepared and
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:012338_0307_0F88EDD22F2E04A8"/>
uſed in the following manner. Take jeſuits bark in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, an ounce and a half, gentian-root and orange peel bruiſed, of each half an ounce. Infuſe theſe ingredients in a bottle of brandy or whiſky, for five or ſix days, then ſtrain the liquor, and take a table ſpoonful in half a glaſs of water an hour before breakfaſt, dinner, and ſupper.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING tends more to ſtrengthen the nervous ſyſtem than cold bathing. This practice, if duly perſiſted in, will produce very extraordinary effects; but when the liver or other <hi>viſcera</hi> are obſtructed, or otherwiſe unſound, the cold bath is improper. The moſt proper ſeaſons for it are ſummer and autumn. It will be ſufficient, eſpecially for perſons of a ſpare habit, to go into the cold bath three or four times a week. If the patient be weakened by it, or feels chilly for a long time after coming out, it is improper.</p>
                        <p>IN patients afflicted with wind, I have always obſerved the greateſt benefit from the acid elixir of vitriol. It may be taken in the quantity of fifteen, twenty, or thirty drops, twice or thrice a-day, in a glaſs of water. This both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels wind, ſtrengthens the ſtomach, and promotes digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>OPIATES are greatly extolled in theſe maladies; but as they only palliate the ſymptoms, and generally afterwards increaſe the diſeaſe, we would adviſe people to be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cautious in the uſe of them, leſt habit render them at laſt abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IT would be an eaſy matter to enumerate many medicines which have been extolled for relieving nervous diſorders; but whoever wiſhes for a thorough cure muſt expect it from regimen alone; we ſhall therefore omit mentioning more medicines, and again recommend the ſtricteſt attention to DIET, AIR, EXERCISE, and AMUSEMENTS.</p>

                        <p>MELANCHOLY and madneſs are nearly allied. They both proceed from the ſame origin, and may be conſidered as only different degrees of the ſame diſeaſe. <hi>A delirium without a fever</hi> is the common definition of madneſs: Indeed it is not a very accurate one; but there is no great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be ſolicitous about the definition of a diſeaſe which every body knows. It is of far greater importance to know how it is occaſioned, and by what means it may be cured.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="304" facs="unknown:012338_0308_0F88EDD2F594FEC8"/>
CAUSES.—It may proceed from a hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; intenſe thinking, eſpecially where the mind is long occupied about one object; violent paſſions or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, as love, fear, joy, grief, over-weening pride, and ſuch like. It may alſo be occaſioned by exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive venery; narcotic or ſtupifactive poiſons; a ſedentary life; ſolitude; the ſuppreſſion of cuſtomary evacuations; accute fevers, or other diſeaſes. Violent anger will change melancholy into madneſs; and exceſſive cold, eſpecially of the lower extremities, will force the blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brain, and produce all the ſymptoms of madneſs. It may likewiſe proceed from the uſe of aliment that is hard of digeſtion, or which cannot be eaſily aſſimilated; from a callous ſtate of the integuments of the brain, or a dryneſs of the brain itſelf. To all which we may add gloomy or miſtaken notions of religion<note n="*" place="bottom">THE mind by dwelling too long upon the dark ſide of religion, is often, at length, overwhelmed with the deepeſt melancholy, which ends in madneſs. What a pity that <hi>religion,</hi> which was intended to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviate the calamities of life, to keep the mind cheerful, and to raiſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                              </gap> above diſappointment, ſhould ever be perverted into the means of producing theſe very evils it was deſigned to cure?</note>.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—When perſons begin to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, they are dull; dejected; timorous; watchful; fond of ſolitude; fretful; fickle; captious and inquiſitive; ſolicitous about trifles; ſometimes niggardly, and at other times prodigal. The belly is generally bound; the urine thin, and in ſmall quantity; the ſtomach and bowels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated with wind; the complexion pale; the pulſe ſlow and weak. The functions of the mind are alſo greatly pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſo much that the patient often imagines himſelf dead, or changed into ſome other animal. Some have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, their bodies were made of glaſs, or other brittle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and were afraid to move leſt they ſhould be broken in pieces. The unhappy patient, in this caſe, unleſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully watched, is apt to put an end to his own miſerable life.</p>
                        <p>THE ſigns of approaching madneſs are: Redneſs of the eyes, with a tremulous and conſtant vibration of the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; a change of diſpoſition and behaviour; ſupercilious looks; a haughty carriage; grinding of the teeth; unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable malice to particular perſons; exceſſive watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, violent headachs; quickneſs of hearing; noiſe in the ears, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="305" facs="unknown:012338_0309_0F88EDD3B4948688"/>
PERSONS actually mad are in an exceſſive rage when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to anger. Some wander about, others make a hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noiſe. Some ſhun the ſight of men; others, if permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would tear themſelves, or thoſe whom they meet, to pieces. Some in the higheſt degree of the diſorder ſee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges before their eyes, and fancy themſelves ſtruck with lightening. To theſe we may add incredible ſtrength, and great inſenſibility to hunger and cold.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the diſeaſe is owing to an obſtruction of cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary evacuations, or any bodily diſorder, it is eaſier cured than when it proceeds from the mind. Madneſs attended with mirth is not ſo dangerous as that which is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſadneſs. A diſcharge of blood from the noſe, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent looſeneſs, ſcabby eruptions, the bleeding piles, or the <hi>menſes,</hi> ſometimes carry off this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>DISEASES of the mind often intermit for ſeveral years, and return again. In ſome they return annually at the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <p>REGIMEN.—The diet ought to conſiſt chiefly of vegetables of a cooling and opening quality. Animal food, eſpecially ſalted or ſmoke-dried fiſh or fleſh, ought to be avoided. All kinds of ſhell-fiſh are bad. Aliments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with onions, garlic, or any thing that generates thick blood, are likewiſe improper. All kinds of fruits that are wholeſome may be eat with advantage. Boerhaave gives an inſtance of a patient who by a long uſe of whey, water, and garden-fruits, evacuated a great quantity of black matter, and recovered his ſenſes. This ſeems to have been the method of cure practiced at the Aſſyrian court; where we find the monarch himſelf, when ſeized with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was turned out to graze.</p>
                        <p>STRONG liquors of every kind ought to be avoided as poiſon. The moſt proper drink is water, whey, or very ſmall beer. Tea and coffee are improper. If honey agrees with the patient, it may be eat freely, or his drink ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with it. Infuſions of balm-leaves, penny-royal, the roots of wild valerian, or the flowers of the lime-tree, may be drank freely, either by themſelves, or ſweetened with honey, as the patient ſhall chuſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="306" facs="unknown:012338_0310_0F88EDD4F1C9CDC8"/>
THE patient ought to take as much exerciſe in the open air as he can bear. This helps to diſſolve the viſcid humours, it removes obſtructions, promotes the perſpiration, and all the other ſecretions. Every kind of madneſs is attended with a diminiſhed perſpiration; all means ought therefore to be uſed to promote that neceſſary and ſalutary diſcharge. Nothing can have a more direct tendency to increaſe the diſeaſe than the common method of confining the patient to a cloſe apartment. Were a proper ſpace allotted for him to run about in, where he could neither hurt himſelf nor others, it would contribute much to promote a cure. It would have ſtill a better effect, if he were obliged to labour a piece of ground. By <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, hoeing, planting, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. both the body and mind would be exerciſed.</p>
                        <p>A PLAN of this kind, with a ſtrict vegetable diet, would be a more rational method of cure than confining the patient in Bedlam, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> ſending him to a private mad-houſe. Theſe inſtitutions, as they are generally managed, are far more likely to make a wiſe man mad than to reſtore a madman to his ſenſes. Even running about at large, tho' it may be attended with ſome bad conſequences, is more likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the patient than confining him in a mad-houſe. I have known ſeveral inſtances of perſons cured by exerciſe, amuſements, and a vegetable diet, who, in all probability, had they been confined, would have continued lunatic for life. A long journey, or a voyage, eſpecially into a warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er climate, with agreeable companions, has often very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—IN the cure of madneſs, great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard muſt be paid to the mind. When the patient is in a low melancholy ſtate, his mind ought to be ſoothed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted with variety of amuſements, as entertaining ſtories, paſtimes, muſic, &amp;c. This ſeems to have been the method of curing melancholy among the Jews, as we learn from the ſtory of King Saul; and indeed it is a very rational one. Nothing can remove diſeaſes of the mind ſo effectually as applications to the mind itſelf, the moſt efficacious of which is muſic. The patient's company ought likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of ſuch perſons as are agreeable to him. People in this ſtate are apt to conceive unaccountable averſions againſt particular perſons; and the very ſight of ſuch perſons is ſufficient to diſtract their minds, and throw them into the
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:012338_0311_0F88EDD692826B28"/>
utmoſt perturbation. In all kinds of madneſs, it is better to ſooth and calm the mind than to ruffle it by contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the patient is high, evacuations are neceſſary. In this caſe he muſt be bled, and have his belly kept open by purging medicines, as manna, rhubarb, cream of tartar, or the ſolube tartar. I have ſeen the laſt have very good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. It may be taken in the doſe of half an ounce, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, in water gruel every day, for ſundry weeks, or even for months, if neceſſary. More or leſs may be given according as it operates. Vomits have likewiſe a good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but they muſt be pretty ſtrong, otherwiſe they will not operate.</p>
                        <p>MADNESS has ſometimes been cured by camphire. Ten or twelve grains of it may be rubbed in a mortar with half a dram of nitre, and taken twice a day, or oftner if the ſtomach will bear it. If it will not ſit upon the ſtomach in this form, it may be made into pills with gum aſafaetida and Ruſſian caſtor, and taken in the quantity above direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Muſk has likewiſe been found efficacious in this caſe; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap> to have any effect, it muſt be given in large doſes. A ſcruple or twenty five grains may be made into a bolus with a little honey or ſyrup, and taken twice or thrice a day. The antimonial wine is by ſome extolled for the cure of madneſs. It may be taken in the doſe of forty or fifty drops, twice or thrice a day, in a cup of tea. The tincture of hellebore h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s likewiſe been in great eſteem; but I never ſaw any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable effects from it. Each of the above medicines may be of ſervice in ſome particular caſe, provided it be duly perſiſted in, and where one fails, it may not be amiſs to try another.</p>
                        <p>AS it is very difficult to induce patients in this diſeaſe to take medicines, we ſhall mention ſome outward appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which ſometimes do good; the principal of theſe are iſſues, ſetons, and cold bathing. Iſſues may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The diſcharge from theſe may be greatly promoted by dreſſing them with the mild bliſtering ointment, and keeping what are commonly called the orrice peas in them. The ſalt water is moſt proper for bathing in; but when that cannot be obtained, the patient may be daily immerſed in freſh water. Some
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:012338_0312_0F88EDD6AB270EE0"/>
recommend bathing the body in warm water, and at the ſame time pouring cold water upon the head.</p>
                        <p>THAT kind of madneſs or delirium which proceeds from mere weakneſs, requires a quite different method of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is often the effect of fevers injudiciouſly treated, wherein the patient's ſtrength has been exhauſted by frequent bleedings and purgings. This muſt be removed by nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diet, exerciſe proportioned to the patient's ſtrength, and cordial medicines. All evacuations are here carefully to be avoided. The patient may take frequently a glaſs of good wine, in which a little jeſuits bark has been infuſed.</p>

                        <p>THE vulgar notion that every poiſon is cured by ſome counter poiſon, as a ſpecific, has done much hurt. People believe they can do nothing for the patient, unleſs they know the particular antidote to that kind of poiſon which he has taken. Whereas the cure of all poiſons taken into the ſtomach, without exception, depends on diſcharging them as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>THERE is no caſe wherein nature points out the method of cure more clearly than in this. Poiſon is ſeldom long in the ſtomach before it occaſions ſickneſs with an inclination to vomit. This ſhews plainly what ought to be done. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed common ſenſe dictates to every man, that, if any thing has been taken into the ſtomach which endangers life, it ought immediately to be diſcharged. Were this duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, moſt of the miſchief occaſioned by poiſon might be prevented. The method of cure is obvious, and the means of performing it are in the hands of every man.</p>
                        <p>POISONS, either belong to the animal, vegetable, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral kingdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="309" facs="unknown:012338_0313_0F88EDDAC91B5C20"/>
MINERAL poiſons are commonly of an acrid or corroſive quality, as arſenic, the corroſive ſublimate of mercury, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>THOSE of the vegetable kind are generally of a narcotic or ſtupifactive quality, as poppy, hemlock, henbane, ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the deadly night-ſhade, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>POISONOUS animals communicate their infection, either by the bite or ſting. This poiſon is very different from the former, both in its ſymptoms and cure.</p>
                        <p>MINERAL POISONS.—Arſenic is the moſt common of this claſs; and, as the whole of them are pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſimilar both in their effects and method of cure, what is ſaid with reſpect to it will be applicable to every other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of corroſive poiſon.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a perſon has taken arſenic, he ſoon percieves a burning heat, and violent pricking pain in his ſtomach and bowels, with vomiting and intolerable thirſt. The tongue and throat feel rough and dry; and, if proper help be not ſoon adminiſtred, the patient is ſeized with great anxiety, hiccupping, faintings, and coldneſs of the extremeties. To theſe ſucceed black vomits, foetid ſtools, with a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtomach and inteſtines, which are the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate forerunners of death.</p>
                        <p>ON the firſt appearance of theſe ſymptoms, the patient ſhould drink large quantities of new milk and ſalad oil till he vomits; or he may drink warm water mixed with oil. Fat broths are alſo proper, provided they can be got ready in time. Where no oil is to be had, freſh butter may be melted and mixed with the milk or water. Theſe things are to be drank as long as the inclination to vomit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Some have drank eight or ten Engliſh quarts before the vomiting ceaſed; and it is never ſafe to leave off drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while one particle of the poiſon remains in the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>THESE oily or fat ſubſtances not only provoke vomiting, but likewiſe blunt the acrimony of the poiſon, and prevent its wounding the bowels; but if they ſhould not make the perſon vomit, half a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting may likewiſe be excited by tickling the inſide of the throat with a feather.</p>
                        <p>IF the tormenting pains are felt in the lower belly, and there is reaſon to fear, that the inteſtines are attacked, clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of milk and oil muſt be very frequently thrown up;
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:012338_0314_0F88EDDC62066F18"/>
and the patient muſt drink emollient decoctions of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, oatmeal, marſhmallows, and ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the poiſon has been evacuated, the patient ought, for ſome time, to live upon ſuch things as are of a healing and cooling quality. To abſtain from fleſh and all ſtrong liquors, and to live upon milk, broth, gruel, light pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and other ſpoon mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>VEGETABLE POISONS, beſides heat and pain of the ſtomach, commonly occaſion ſome degree of giddineſs, and often a kind of ſtupidity or folly. Perſons who have taken theſe muſt be treated in the ſame manner as for the mineral or corroſive.</p>
                        <p>THOUGH the vegetable poiſons, when allowed to remain in the ſtomach, often prove fatal; yet the danger is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally over as ſoon as they are diſcharged. Not being of ſuch a cauſtic or corroſive nature, they are leſs apt to wound and inflame the bowels than mineral ſubſtances, no time however ought to be loſt in having them expelled the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                        <p>OPIUM, being frequently taken by miſtake, merits par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. It is uſed as a medicine both in a ſolid and liquid form, which latter commonly goes by the name of laudanum. It is indeed a valuable medicine when taken in proper quantity; but as an over-doſe proves a ſtrong poiſon, we ſhall point out its common effects, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the method of cure.</p>
                        <p>TOO great a quantity of opium generally occaſions great drowſineſs, with ſtupor and other apoplectic ſymptoms. Sometimes the perſon has ſo great an inclination to ſleep, that it is almoſt impoſſible to keep him awake. Every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod muſt however be tried for this purpoſe. He ſhould be toſſed, ſhaked, and moved about. Sharp bliſtering plaſters ſhould be applied to his legs or arms, and ſtimulating me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as ſalts of hartſhorn, &amp;c. held under his noſe. It will alſo be proper to let blood. At the ſame time every method muſt be taken to make him diſcharge the poiſon. This may be done in the manner directed above, <abbr>

                        <p>MEAD, beſides vomits, in this caſe, recommends acid medicines with lixivial ſalts. He ſays, that he has often

given ſalt of wormwood mixed with juice of lemon in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated doſes with great ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>IF the body ſhould remain weak and languid after the poiſon has been diſcharged, nouriſhing diet and cordials will be neceſſary; but when there is reaſon to fear that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach or bowels are inflamed, the greateſt circumſpection is neceſſary both with regard to food and medicine.</p>
                        <p>ANIMAL POISONS.—We ſhall begin with the bite of a mad dog, as it is both the moſt common and dangerous animal poiſon in this country.</p>
                        <p>THE creatures naturally liable to contract the hydropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia are, ſo far as we yet know, all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THE ſymptoms of madneſs in a dog are as follow. At firſt he looks dull, ſhews an averſion to food and company: He does not bark as uſual, but ſeems to murmur, is peeviſh, and apt to bite ſtrangers: His <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ars and tail droop more than uſual, and he appears drowſy. Afterwards he begins to loll out his tongue, and froth at the mouth, his eyes ſeeming heavy and watery. He now, if not confined, takes off, runs panting along with a kind of dejected air, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to bite every one he meets. Other dogs are ſaid to fly from him. Some think this a certain ſign of madneſs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they know him by the ſmell; but it is not to be depended on. If he eſcapes being killed, he ſeldom runs above two or three days, till he dies exhauſted with heat, hunger, and fatigue.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe is moſt frequent after long dry hot ſeaſons; and ſuch dogs as live upon putrid ſtinking carrion, without having enough of freſh water, are moſt liable to it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN any perſon is bit by a dog, the ſtricteſt enquiry ought to be made, whether the animal be really mad. Many diſagreeable conſequences ariſe from neglecting to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain this point. Some people have lived in continual anxiety for many years, becauſe they had been bit by a dog which they believed to be mad; but, as he had been killed on the ſpot, it was impoſſible to aſcertain the fact. This ſhould induce us, inſtead of killing a dog the moment he
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:012338_0316_0F88EDDEAC726B00"/>
has bit any perſon, to do all in our power to keep him alive, at leaſt till we can be certain whether he be mad or not.</p>
                        <p>MANY circumſtances may contribute to make people imagine a dog mad. He loſes his maſter, runs about in queſt of him, is ſet upon by other dogs, and perhaps by men. The creature thus frightened, beat, and abuſed, looks wild, and lolls out his tongue as he runs along. Immediately a crowd is after him; while he, finding himſelf cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and taking every one he meets for an enemy, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attempts to bite in ſelf-defence. He ſoon gets knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the head, and paſſes currently for a mad dog, as it is then impoſſible to prove the contrary.</p>
                        <p>THIS being the true hiſtory of, by far, the greater part of thoſe dogs which paſs for mad, is it any wonder that numberleſs whimſical medicines have been extolled for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the effects of their bite? This readily accounts for the great variety of infallable remedies for the bite of a mad dog, which are to be met with in almoſt every family. Though not one in a thouſand has any claim to merit, yet they are all ſupported by numberleſs vouchers. No wonder that imaginary diſeaſes ſhould be cured by imaginary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In this way credulous people firſt impoſe upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then deceive others. The ſame medicine that was ſuppoſed to prevent the effects of the bite, when the dog was not mad, is recommended to a perſon who has had the misfortune to be bit by a dog that was really mad. He takes it, truſts to it, and is undone.</p>
                        <p>TO theſe miſtakes we muſt impute the frequent ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog. It is not owing ſo much to a defect in medicine, as to wrong applications. I am perſuaded if proper medicines were taken immediately after the bite is received, and continued for a ſufficient length of time, we ſhould not loſe one in a thouſand of thoſe who have the miſfortune to be bit by a mad dog.</p>
                        <p>THIS poiſon is generally communicated by a wound, which, nevertheleſs, heals as ſoon as a common wound: But afterwards it begins to feel painful, and as the pain ſpreads towards the neighbouring parts, the perſon becomes heavy and liſtleſs. His ſleep is unquiet with frightful dreams; he ſighs, looks dull, and loves ſolitude. Theſe are the forerunners, or rather the firſt ſymptoms, of that dreadful diſeaſe occaſioned by the bite of a mad dog. But
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:012338_0317_0F88EDDFC01A2F20"/>
as we do not propoſe to treat the diſeaſe itſelf, but to point out the method of preventing it, we ſhall not take up time in ſhewing its progreſs from the firſt invaſion to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fatal end.</p>
                        <p>THE common notion, that this poiſon may lie in the body for many years, and afterwards prove fatal, ſeems not to be well founded. It muſt render ſuch perſons as have had the misfortune to be bit very unhappy, and can have no good effects. If the perſon takes proper medicines for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days after being bit, and feels no ſymptoms of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, there is reaſon to believe him out of danger. Some indeed have gone mad twelve months after being bit; but I never knew it happen later; and of this I only remember to have ſeen one inſtance.</p>
                        <p>THE medicines recommended for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog, are chiefly ſuch as promote urine and perſpiration; to which may be added antiſpaſmodics.</p>
                        <p>DR MEAD recommends a preventive medicine, which he ſays he never knew fail, though in the ſpace of thirty years he had uſed it a thouſand times.</p>
                        <p>THE medicine is as follows:</p>
                        <p>"TAKE aſh-coloured ground liver-wort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an ounce; of black pepper powdered, a quarter of an ounce. Mix theſe well together, and divide the powder into four doſes; one of which muſt be taken every morning faſting, for four mornings ſucceſſively, in half an Engliſh pint of cows milk warm.</p>
                        <p>AFTER theſe four doſes are taken, the patient muſt go into the cold bath, or a cold ſpring or river, every morning faſting, for a month; he muſt be dipped all over, but not ſtay in (with his head above water) longer than half a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, if the water be very cold. After this he muſt go in three times a-week for a fortnight longer.</p>
                        <p>THE perſon muſt be bled before he begins to uſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine<note n="*" place="bottom">I was, ſome time ago, favoured with the following preſcription for the bite of a mad dog, which had been long kept a ſecret in a gentleman's family in the north of England, and is ſaid never to have failed, when given as a preventive either to man or beaſt.—"Take ſix ounces of Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Leſs may be given to a young perſon, or one of a weak conſtitution. Some of the ingredients may be bound upon the wound, if it can be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done." This is ordered to be given within nine days after the bite.

WE ſhall next mention the famous Eaſt India ſpecific, as it is called. This medicine is compoſed of cinnabar and muſk. It is eſteemed a great antiſpaſmodic, and by many, thought to be an infallible remedy for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog.</p>
                        <p>"TAKE native and factitious cinnabar, of each twenty-four grains, muſk ſixteen grains. Let theſe be made into a fine powder, and taken in a glaſs of arrack or brandy."</p>
                        <p>THIS ſingle doſe is ſaid to ſecure the perſon for thirty days, at the end of which it muſt be repeated; but if he has any ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, it muſt be repeated in three hours.</p>
                        <p>THE following is likewiſe a good antiſpaſmodic medicine.</p>
                        <p>TAKE of Virginian ſnake-root in powder, half a dram, gum aſafoetida twelve grains, gum Camphire ſeven grains; make theſe into a bolus with a little ſyrup of ſaffron.</p>
                        <p>CAMPHIRE may alſo be given in the following manner:</p>
                        <p>TAKE purified nitre half an ounce, Virginian ſnake-root in powder two drams, camphire one dram; rub them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a mortar, and divide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>MERCURY is another medicine of great efficacy, both in the prevention and cure of this kind of madneſs. When uſed as a preventive, it will be ſufficient to rub daily a dram of the ointment into the parts about the wound.</p>
                        <p>VINEGAR is likewiſe of conſiderable ſervice, and ſhould be taken freely, either in the patient's food or drink.</p>
                        <p>THESE are the principal medicines recommended for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog. We would not however adviſe people to truſt to any one of them; but from a proper combination of their different powers, there is the greateſt reaſon to hope for ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>THE great error in the uſe of theſe medicines lies in not taking them for a ſufficient length of time. They are uſed more like charms than medicines intended to produce any change in the body. To this, and not to the inſufficiency
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:012338_0319_0F88EDE20BE08ED0"/>
of the medicines, muſt we impute their frequent want of ſucceſs.</p>
                        <p>DR MEAD ſays, that the virtue of his medicine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in promoting urine. But how a poiſon ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by urine, with only three or four doſes of any medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, however powerful, is not eaſy to conceive. More time is certainly neceſſary; and here the defect of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's preſcription ſeems to lie.</p>
                        <p>THE Eaſt-India ſpecific is ſtill more exceptionable on this account.</p>
                        <p>AS theſe and moſt other medicines, taken ſingly, have frequently been found to fail, we ſhall recommend the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing courſe.</p>
                        <p>IF a perſon be bit in a fleſhly part, where there is no hazard of hurting any large blood-veſſel, the parts adjacent to the wound may be cut away. But if this be not done ſoon after receiving the bite, it will be better to omit it.</p>
                        <p>THE wound may be waſhed with ſalt and water, or a pickle made of vinegar and ſalt, and afterwards dreſſed twice a-day with yellow baſilicon mixed with ſome red pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould begin to uſe either Dr Mead's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, or ſome of the others mentioned above. If he takes Mead's medicine he may uſe it as the Doctor directs for four days ſucceſſively. Let him then omit it for two or three days, and again repeat the ſame number of doſes as before.</p>
                        <p>DURING this courſe, he muſt rub into the parts about the wound, daily, one dram of the mercurial or blue oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is called. This may be done for ten or twelve days at leaſt.</p>
                        <p>WHEN this courſe is over, he may take a purge or two, and then begin to uſe the cold bath. This muſt be uſed every morning for five or ſix weeks; but if the patient ſhould feel cold and chilly for a long time after coming out of the cold bath, it will be better to uſe a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>IN the mean time, we would adviſe him not to leave off all internal medicines, but to take either one of the boluſes of ſnake-root, aſafoetida and camphire; or one of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of nitre, camphire, and ſnake-root, twice a-day. Theſe may be continued for a fortnight or three weeks longer.</p>

IF the perſon has gone through the above courſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and no ſymptoms of madneſs appear, he may be reckoned out of danger. It will nevertheleſs be adviſeable, for the greater ſafety, to take a doſe or two of Dr Mead's medicine, at every full or change of the moon, for the three or four ſucceeding months.</p>
                        <p>DURING the uſe of the mercurial ointment, the patient muſt keep within doors, and take nothing cold.</p>
                        <p>A PROPER regimen muſt be obſerved during the whole courſe. The patient ſhould abſtain from fleſh, and all ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and high-ſeaſoned proviſions. He muſt avoid ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and live moſtly upon a light and rather ſpare diet. His mind ſhould be kept as eaſy and cheerful as poſſible, and all exceſſive heat and violent paſſions avoided with the utmoſt care.</p>
                        <p>I HAVE never ſeen this courſe of medicine, with proper regimen, fail to prevent the hydrophobia, and cannot help again obſerving, that the want of ſucceſs muſt generally be owing either to the application of improper medicines, or not uſing proper ones for a ſufficient length of time.</p>
                        <p>MANKIND are extremely fond of every thing that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a ſudden or miraculous cure. By truſting to theſe they often loſe their lives, when a regular courſe of medicine would have rendered them abſolutely ſafe. This holds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably in the preſent caſe: Numbers of people, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, believe if they or their cattle be once dipped in the ſea, it is ſufficient: as if the ſalt water were a charm againſt the effects of the bite. This and ſuch like whims have proved fatal to many.</p>
                        <p>SOME people believe, if a perſon be bit by a dog that is not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is too ridiculous to deſerve a ſerious confutation<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſurpriſing that no proper inquiry has ever been made into the truth of the common opinion, that a dog which has been wormed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bite after he goes mad. This circumſtance not only merits the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of phyſicians, but of the legiſlature. If the fact could be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and the practice rendered general, it would ſave both the lives and properties of many.</note>.</p>
                        <p>THE next poiſonous animal that we ſhall mention is the VIPER. The greaſe of this animal rubbed into the wound is generally reckoned a cure for the bite. Though this is all that the viper-catchers commonly do when they are
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:012338_0321_0F88EDE38AD8B7D8"/>
bit, I ſhould hardly think it ſufficient for the bite of an <hi>enraged</hi> viper. It would ſurely be more ſafe to have the wound well ſucked,<note n="†" place="bottom">The practice of ſucking out poiſons is very ancient; and indeed nothing can be more rational. It is the moſt likely method of extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poiſon where the bite cannot be cut out. There is no danger in performing this office; as the poiſon does no harm unleſs it be taken into the body by a wound. The perſon who ſucks the wound ought however to waſh his mouth frequently with ſalad-oil, which will ſecure him from even the leaſt inconveniency. The ancient Pſylli in Africa, and the Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A poultice of bread and milk, with plenty of ſalad oil in it, ſhould likewiſe be applied to the wound, and the patient ought to drink freely of wine whey with ſome ſpirits of hartſhhorn; or, if that be not at hand, of water gruel with vinegar in it, to make him ſweat. If the patient be ſick, he may take a vomit. This courſe will be ſufficient for the bite of any of the poiſonous animals of this country.</p>
                        <p>WITH regard to poiſonous inſects, as the bee, waſp, hornet, &amp;c. their ſtings are ſeldom attended with great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unleſs where a perſon happens to be ſtung by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them at once. In this caſe ſomething ſhould be done to abate the pain and inflammation. Some, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, apply honey, others lay pounded parſley to the part. Some recommend a mixture of vinegar and Venice-treacle; but I have always found rubbing the part with warm ſalad-oil ſucceed very well. Indeed, if the ſtings be ſo numerous as to endanger the patient's life, which is ſometimes the caſe, he muſt not only have oily poultices applied to the part, but muſt likewiſe be bled and take ſome cooling me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as nitre, cream of tartar, &amp;c. with plenty of dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting liquors.</p>
                        <p>IT is the happineſs of this iſland to have very few poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous animals, and even theſe are not of the moſt virulent kind. Nine tenths of the effects uſually attributed to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or venom are really other diſeaſes, and depend upon quite different cauſes.</p>
                        <p>WE cannot however make the ſame obſervation with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to poiſonous vegetables.

It may likewiſe proceed from an hereditary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Perſons in the decline of life, and thoſe who have been much afflicted with the gout or rheumatiſm are moſt ſubject to it.</p>
                        <p>SYMPTOMS.—SMALL ſtones or gravel in the kidneys occaſion pain in the loins; ſickneſs; vomiting; and ſometimes bloody urine. When the ſtone deſcends into the <hi>ureter,</hi> and is too large to paſs along with eaſe, all the above ſymptoms are increaſed; the pain extends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bladder; the thigh and leg of the affected ſide feel benumbed; the teſticles are drawn upwards, and the urine is obſtructed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="319" facs="unknown:012338_0323_0F88EDE4EC101EF0"/>
A STONE in the bladder is known from a pain at the time, as well as before and after making water; from the urine coming away by drops, or ſtopping ſuddenly when in a full ſtream; by a violent pain in the neck of the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon motion, eſpecially on horſeback or in a coach on rough road; from a white, thick, copious, ſtinking, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous ſediment in the urine; from an itching in the top of the <hi>penis;</hi> from an inclination to go to ſtool while the urine is diſcharged; from the patient's paſſing his urine more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily when lying than in an erect poſture; and from a kind of convulſive motion occaſioned by the ſharp pain in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the laſt drops of the urine.</p>
                        <p>REGIMEN.—Perſons afflicted with the gravel or ſtone ſhould, avoid aliments of a windy or heating nature, as ſalt-meats, ſour fruits, &amp;c. Their diet ought chiefly to conſiſt of ſuch things as tend to promote the ſecretion of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and to keep the belly open.

The moſt proper drink is whey, butter-milk, milk and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, barley-water; decoctions of the roots of marſhmallows, parſley, liquorice; or of other mild mucilaginous vegetables, as linſeed, &amp;c. If the patient has been accuſtomed to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous liquors, he may drink ſmall gin-punch without acid.

Where there is a hereditary tendency to this diſeaſe, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentary life ought never to be indulged. Were people care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, upon the firſt ſymptoms of gravel, to obſerve a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per regimen of diet, and to take ſufficient exerciſe, it might often be carried off, or, at leaſt, prevented from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; but if the ſame courſe which occaſioned the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be perſiſted in, it cannot fail to become worſe.</p>
                        <p>MEDICINE.—In what is called a fit of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, which is commonly occaſioned by a ſtone ſticking in the <hi>ureter</hi> or ſome part of the urinary paſſages, the patient muſt
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:012338_0324_0F88EDE5AC4EED10"/>
be bled, warm fomentations applied to the parts, emolient clyſters adminiſtered, and diluting mucilaginous liquors drank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The treatment of this caſe has been fully pointed out under the articles, <hi>inflammation of the kidneys and bladder,</hi> to which we refer the reader.</p>
                        <p>DR WHYTT adviſes patients who are ſubject to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fits of gravel in the kidneys, but have no ſtone in the bladder, to drink every morning, two or three hours before breakfaſt, an Engliſh pint of oyſter or cockle-ſhell lime-water. The Doctor very juſtly obſerves, that though this quantity might be too ſmall to have any ſenſible effect in diſſolving a ſtone in the bladder; yet it may very probably prevent its growth.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a ſtone is formed in the bladder, the Doctor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends Alicant ſoap, and oyſter or cockle-ſhell lime-water<note n="*" place="bottom">Oyſter-ſhell lime-water is prepared by pouring an Engliſh gallon and a half of boiling water upon a pound of oyſter-ſhells reduced to quick-lime by being burnt. Where oyſter or cockle-ſhells cannot be had, common quick lime may be uſed in their ſtead. After the clear liquor has been poured off, the ſame quantity of time will make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third quantity of water of nearly the ſame ſtrength as the firſt.</note> to be taken in the following manner. The patient muſt ſwallow every day, in any form that is leaſt diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, an ounce of the internal part of Alicant ſoap, and drink three or four Engliſh pints of oyſter or cockle-ſhell lime-water. The ſoap is to be divided into three doſes; the largeſt to be taken faſting in the morning early; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond at noon; and the third at ſeven in the evening, drinking above each doſe a large draught of the lime-water; the remainder of which he may take any time betwixt din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and ſupper, inſtead of other liquors.</p>
                        <p>THE patient ſhould begin with a ſmaller quantity of the lime-water and ſoap than what is mentioned above; at firſt an Engliſh pint of the former and three drams of the latter, taken daily, may be enough. This quantity, however, he may increaſe by degrees, and ought to perſevere in the uſe of theſe medicines, eſpecially if he finds any abatement of his complaints, for ſeveral months; nay, if the ſtone be very large, for years. It may likewiſe be proper for the patient, if he be ſeverely pained, not only to begin with the ſoap and lime-water in ſmall quantities, but to take the ſecond or third lime-water inſtead of the firſt. However, after he has been for ſome time accuſtomed to theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:012338_0325_0F88EDE66A3B37E0"/>
he may not only take the firſt water, but, if he finds he can eaſily bear it, heighten its diſſolving power ſtill more by pouring it a ſecond time on freſh calcined ſhells.</p>
                        <p>THE only other medicine which we ſhall mention is the <hi>uva urſi.</hi> It has been greatly extolled of late years both for the gravel and ſtone. It ſeems, however, to be, in all reſpects, inferior to the ſoap and lime-water; but as it is leſs diſagreeable, and has frequently, to my knowledge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved gravelly complaints, it deſerves a trial. It is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken in powder from half a dram to a whole dram, two or three times a-day. It may be mixed in a cup of tea or gruel, or taken in any way that is moſt agreeable to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>

                        <p>THE hiccup is a ſpaſmodic or convulſive affection of the ſtomach and midriff, ariſing from any cauſe that irritates their nervous fibres.</p>
                        <p>IT may proceed from exceſs in eating or drinking; from a hurt of the ſtomach; poiſons; inflammations of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, inteſtines, bladder, midriff, or the reſt of the <hi>viſcera.</hi> In gangrenes, acute and malignant fevers, a hiccup is often the forerunner of death. I have known an obſtinate hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup proceed from a ſchirrous tumour of the <hi>pylorus,</hi> or right orifice of the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the hiccup proceeds from exceſs, eſpecially from aliment that is flatulent, or hard of digeſtion, a draught of generous wine, or a dram of any ſpiritous liquor, will ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally remove it. If poiſon be the cauſe, plenty of milk and oil muſt be drank, as has been formerly recommended. When it proceeds from an inflammation of the ſtomach, &amp;c. it is very dangerous. In this caſe the cooling regimen muſt be obſerved. The patient muſt be bled, and take frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few drops of the ſweet ſpirits of nitre in a cup of wine-whey. His ſtomach muſt likewiſe be fomented with cloths dipped in warm water; or bladders filled with warm milk and water applied to it.</p>
                        <p>A HICCUP proceeding from a gangrene, or mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is generally incurable. In this caſe the Peruvian bark, with other antiſeptic medicines, are moſt likely to ſucceed. If the hiccup be a primary diſeaſe, and proceeds from a foul ſtomach, loaded either with a pituitous or a bilious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:012338_0326_0F88EDE72B4A0BE8"/>
a gentle vomit and purge, if the patient be able to bear them, will be of ſervice. If it ariſes from flatulencies, the carminatives directed for the heart-burn, page 255. muſt be uſed.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the hiccup proves very obſtinate, recourſe muſt be had to the moſt powerful aromatic and antiſpaſmodic medicines. The principal of theſe is muſk; fifteen or twenty grains of which may be made into a bolus, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated occaſionally. Opiates are likewiſe of ſervice; but they muſt be uſed with caution. A bit of ſugar dipped in compound ſpirits of lavender, or the volatile aromatic tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may be taken frequently. The Peruvian bark is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of uſe. External applications are ſometimes alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial; as the ſtomach plaſter, or a cataplaſm of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice treacle of the Edinburgh or London diſpenſatory, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſtomach.</p>
                        <p>I LATELY attended a patient who had almoſt a conſtant hiccup for above nine weeks. It was frequently ſtopped by the uſe of muſk, opium, wine, and other cordial and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſmodic medicines, but always returned. Nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed gave the patient ſo much eaſe as briſk ſmall beer. By drinking freely of this, the hiccup was often kept off for ſeveral days, which was more than could be done by the moſt powerful medicines. He was at length ſeized with a vomiting of blood, which ſoon put an end to his life. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on opening his body, a large ſchirrous tumour was found near the pylorus or right orifice of the ſtomach.</p>

                        <p>IF the patient has any inclination to vomit, he ought to take ſome draughts of warm water, or weak camomile tea, to clean his ſtomach. After this, if he has been coſtive, a laxative clyſter muſt be given. He ought then to take ſome doſes of laudanum. The beſt way of adminiſtering it is in a clyſter. Sixty or ſeventy drops of liquid laudanum may be given in a clyſter of warm water. This is much more certain than laudanum given by the mouth, which is often

                        <p>IN very violent and laſting pains of the ſtomach, ſome blood ought to be let, unleſs the weakneſs of the patient makes it improper.

                        <p>DEAFNESS is ſometimes owing to an original fault, or wrong formation of the car itſelf. It may likewiſe be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by wounds, ulcers, or any thing that deſtroys the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of the ear. It is often the effect of old age; of violent cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the head; of fevers; of exceſſive noiſe; of hard wax in the ear; of too great moiſture or dryneſs of the ear, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who are born deaf are ſeldom cured. When deafneſs is the effect of wounds or ulcers in the ear, or of old age, it is not eaſily removed. If it proceeds from cold of the head, the patient muſt be careful to keep his head warm, eſpecially in the night; he ſhould likewiſe take a purge or two, and ſhould keep his feet warm, and bathe them frequently in warm water. When deafneſs is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

of fevers, it generally ceaſes of itſelf, after the patient recovers ſtrength. If it proceeds from dry wax ſticking in the ears, it muſt be ſoftened by dropping oil into them for a few nights, at bedtime; afterwards they muſt be ſyringed with warm milk and water, or milk and oil.</p>

I have often known this have good effects. When the ears abound with moiſture, it may be drained off by an iſſue or ſeton, which muſt be made as near the parts affected as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>MANY medicines are recommended for the cure of deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome of which, in obſtinate caſes, at leaſt, deſerve a trial. Some recommend the gall of an eel mixed with ſpirit of wine, to be dropped into the ear; others equal parts of Hungary water and ſpirits of lavender. Etmuler recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends amber and muſk; and Brookes ſays he has often known hardneſs of hearing cured by putting a grain or two of muſk into the ear with cotton-wool. But theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther application muſt be varied according to the cauſe. We cannot conclude this article without recommending the greateſt attention to <hi>warmth.</hi> From whatever cauſe deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeds, the patient ought to keep his head warm. I have known more benefit from this alone, in the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate caſes of deafneſs, than from all the medicines I ever ſaw uſed.</p>

                        <p>IN this diſeaſe the patient, in time of ſleep, imagines he feels an uncommon oppreſſion or weight about his breaſt or ſtomach, which he can by no means ſhake off. He groans, and ſometimes cries out, tho' oftener he attempts to ſpeak in vain. Sometimes he imagines himſelf engaged with an enemy, and, in danger of being killed, attempts to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but finds he cannot. Sometimes he fancies himſelf in a houſe that is on fire, or that he is in danger of being drowned in a river.

THIS diſorder has been ſuppoſed to proceed from too much blood; from a ſtagnation of blood in the brain, lungs, &amp;c. But its general cauſe is indigeſtion. Perſons of weak nerves, who lead a ſedentary life, and live full, are moſt commonly afflicted with the night-mare. Nothing tends more to produce it than heavy ſuppers, eſpecially if eat late, or the patient goes to bed ſoon after. Wind is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a very frequent cauſe of this diſeaſe; for which reaſon thoſe who are afflicted with it ought to avoid all flatulent food. Deep thought, anxiety, or any thing that oppreſſes the mind, ought alſo to be avoided.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS afflicted with the night-mare ought to eat very light ſuppers. They ſhould never go to bed immediately after eating, nor lie upon their back with the head low. As they generally moan, or make ſome noiſe in the fit, they ſhould be waked, or ſpoken to by ſuch as hear them, as the uneaſineſs generally goes off as ſoon as the patient is awake. Dr Whytt ſays he generally found a dram of brandy, taken at bed-time, prevent this diſeaſe. That, however, is a bad cuſtom, and, in time, loſes its effect. We would rather have the patient depend upon cheerfulneſs, and exerciſe through the day, a light ſupper taken early, and the uſe of food of eaſy digeſtion, &amp;c. than to accuſtom himſelf to drams. A draught of cold water will often promote digeſtion as much as a glaſs of brandy, and is much ſafer. After a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of weak digeſtion however has eat flatulent food, a dram may be neceſſary; in this caſe we would recommend it as the moſt proper medicine.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who are young, and full of blood, if troubled with the night-mare, ought to purge, bleed, and uſe a ſpare diet.</p>

                        <p>THE principal cauſes of ſwooning are, ſudden tranſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from cold to heat; breathing air that is deprived of its proper ſpring or elaſticity; great fatigue; exceſſive weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; loſs of blood; long faſting; fear, grief, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent paſſions or affections of the mind.</p>
                        <p>IT is well known, that perſons who have been long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to cold, often faint or fall into a ſwoon, upon coming into the houſe, eſpecially if they drink hot liquor, or ſit near a large fire. This might eaſily be prevented by peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:012338_0331_0F88EDF06C3B9BC0"/>
taking care not to go into a warm room immediately after having been expoſed to the cold air, to approach the fire gradually, and not to eat or drink any thing hot, till the body has been gradually brought into a warm tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>WHEN any one, in conſequence of neglecting theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, falls into ſwoon, he ought immediately to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to a cooler apartment, to have ligatures applied above his knees and elbows, and to have his hands and face ſprinkled with vinegar. He ſhould likewiſe be made to ſmell to vinegar, and ſhould have a ſpoonful or two of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if he can ſwallow, with about a third part of vinegar mixed with it, poured into his mouth. If the fainting fits prove obſtinate, it will be neceſſary to bleed the patient, and afterwards to give him a clyſter,</p>
                        <p>As air that is breathed over and over loſes its elaſticity or ſpring, it is no wonder if perſons who reſpire in it often fall into ſwooning or fainting fits. They are, in this caſe, deprived of the very principle of life. Hence it is that fainting fits are ſo frequent in all crowded aſſemblies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in hot ſeaſons. Such fits however muſt be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a kind of temporary death; and, to the weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, they ſometimes prove fatal in reality. They ought therefore to be avoided with the utmoſt care. The method of doing this is obvious. Let aſſembly rooms, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of public reſort, be well ventilated; and let the weak and delicate avoid ſuch places, particularly in warm ſeaſons.</p>
                        <p>A PERSON who faints, in ſuch a ſituation, ought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be carried into the open air; his temples ſhould be rubbed with ſtrong vinegar or brandy, and volatile ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or ſalts held to his noſe. He ſhould be laid upon his back with his head low, and have a little wine, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cordial, poured into his mouth, as ſoon as he is able to ſwallow it. If the perſon has been ſubject to hyſteric fits, caſtor or aſafoetida ſhould be applied to the noſe, or burnt feathers, horn, or leather, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>WHEN fainting fits proceed from mere weakneſs or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtion, which is often the caſe after great fatigue, long faſting, loſs of blood, or the like, the patient muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with generous cordials, as jellies, wines, ſpirituous liquors, &amp;c. Theſe however muſt be given at firſt in very ſmall quantities, and increaſed gradually as the patient is

able to bear them. He ought to be allowed to lie quite ſtill and eaſy upon his back, with his head low, and ſhould have freſh air admitted into his chamber. His food ſhould conſiſt of nouriſhing broths, ſago-gruel with wine, new milk, and other things of a light and cordial nature. Theſe things are to be given out of the fit.

                        <head>DISEASES OF WOMEN.</head>
                        <p>THE diſeaſes peculiar to women ariſe chiefly from their monthly evacuations, pregnancy, and child-birth. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males generally begin to menſtruate about the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, and leave it off about fifty, which renders theſe two periods the moſt critical of their lives. About the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this diſcharge the conſtitution undergoes a very conſiderable change, generally indeed for the better, but ſometimes for the worſe. The greateſt care is now neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as the future health and happineſs of the female depends, in a great meaſure, upon her conduct at this period. If a girl about this time of life be confined to the houſe, kept conſtantly ſitting, and neither allowed to romp about, nor employed in ſome active buſineſs, which gives exerciſe to the whole body, ſhe becomes weak, relaxed and puny; her blood not being duly prepared, ſhe looks pale and wan; her health, ſpirits, and vigor decline, and ſhe ſinks into a valetudinary for life. Such is the fate of numbers of thoſe unhappy females who either from the indulgence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or their own narrow circumſtances, are, at this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical period of life, denied the benefit of exerciſe and free air.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="329" facs="unknown:012338_0333_0F88EDF1C0D11370"/>
A LAZY indolent diſpoſition proves very hurtful to girls at this period. One ſeldom meets with complaints from obſtructions amongſt the more active and laborious part of the ſex; whereas the indolent and lazy are ſeldom free from them. Theſe are, in a manner, eat up by the <hi>chloroſis,</hi> or green ſickneſs, and other diſeaſes of this nature. We would therefore recommend it to all who wiſh to eſcape theſe calamities, to avoid indolence and inactivity, as their greateſt enemies, and to take as much exerciſe, eſpecially in the open air, as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>ANOTHER thing that proves very hurtful to girls about this period of life, is unwholeſome food. Fond of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of traſh, they often eat every out-of-the-way thing they can get, till their blood and humours are quite vitiated. Hence enſue indigeſtions, want of appetite, and a whole train of evils. If the fluids be not duly prepared, it is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly impoſſible that the ſecretions ſhould be properly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; Accordingly we find that ſuch girls as lead an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent life, and eat great quantities of traſh, are not only ſubject to obſtructions of the <hi>menſes,</hi> but likewiſe to glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular obſtructions; as the ſcrophula or King's evil, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>A DULL diſpoſition is likewiſe very hurtful to girls at this period. It is a rare thing to ſee a ſprightly girl who does not enjoy good health, while the grave, moping, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy creature proves the very prey of vapours and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtericks. Youth is the ſeaſon for mirth and cheerfulneſs. Let it therefore be indulged. It is an abſolute duty. To lay in a ſtock of health in time of youth is as neceſſary a piece of prudence as to make proviſion againſt the decays of old age. While therefore wiſe Nature prompts the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py youth to join in ſprightly amuſements, let not the ſevere dictates of hoary age forbid the uſeful impulſe, nor damp with ſerious gloom the ſeaſons deſtined to mirth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of life is ſtrait cloaths. They are fond of a fine ſhape, and fooliſhly imagine, that this can be acquired by ſtrait cloaths. Hence by ſqueezing their ſtomach and bowels they hurt the digeſtion, and occaſion many incurable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies. This error is not indeed ſo common as it has been; but, as faſhions change, it may come in again, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it not improper to mention it. I know many fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males who, to this day, feel the direful effects of that
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:012338_0334_0F88EDF277F253A0"/>
wretched cuſtom which prevailed ſome time ago, of ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every girl into as ſmall a ſize in the middle as poſſible. Human invention could not poſſibly have deviſed a practice more deſtructive to health.</p>
                        <p>AFTER a female has arrived at that period of life when the <hi>menſes</hi> uſually begin to flow, and they do not appear, but, on the contrary, her health and ſpirits begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, we would adviſe, inſtead of ſhutting the poor girl up in the houſe, and doſing her with ſteel, aſafoetida, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nauſeous drugs, to place her in a ſituation where ſhe can enjoy the benefit of free air and agreeable company. There let her eat wholeſome food, take plenty of exerciſe and amuſements, and we have little reaſon to fear but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus aſſiſted, will do her proper work. She ſeldom fails unleſs where the fault is on our ſide.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the <hi>menſes</hi> have once begun to flow, the greateſt care ſhould be taken to avoid every thing that may tend to obſtruct them. Females ought to be exceeding careful of what they eat or drink at the time they are out of order. Every thing that is cold, or apt to ſour on the ſtomach, ought to be avoided; as fruit, butter milk, and ſuch like. Fiſh, and all kinds of food that are hard of digeſtion, are alſo to be avoided. As it is impoſſible to mention every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> that may diſagree with individuals at this time, we would recommend it to every female to be very attentive to what diſagrees with her own ſtomach, and carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it.</p>
                        <p>COLD is extremely hurtful to females at this particular period. More of the ſex date their diſorders from colds, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> while they were out of order, than from all other cauſes. This ought ſurely to put them upon their guard, and to make them very circumſpect in their conduct at ſuch times. A degree of cold that will not in the leaſt hurt them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>THE greateſt attention ought at this time to be paid to the mind, which ſhould be kept as eaſy and cheerful as poſſible. Every part of the animal oeconomy is influenced by the paſſions, but none more ſo than this. Anger, fear, grief, and other affections of the mind, often occaſion ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the menſtrual flux, which prove abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable.</p>

FROM whatever cauſe this flux is obſtructed, unleſs the female be pregnant, proper means ſhould be uſed to reſtore it. For this purpoſe we would rcommend plenty of exerciſe, in a dry, open, and rather cool air; wholeſome diet, and, if the body be weak and languid, generous liquors; alſo cheerful company, and all manner of amuſements. If theſe fail, the following medicines may be tried.</p>
                        <p>IF the obſtructions proceed from a weak relaxed ſtate of the ſolids, ſuch medicines as tend to promote digeſtion, to brace the ſolids, and aſſiſt the body in preparing good blood, ought to be uſed. The principal of theſe are iron, the je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits bark, and other bitter and a ſtringent medicines. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of iron may be infuſed in wine or ale, two ounces to an Engliſh quart, and after it has ſtood in a warm place twenty four hours, it may be ſtrained, and a ſmall cupful drank three or four times a-day; or they may be reduced to a fine powder, and taken in the doſe of half a dram, mixed with a little honey or treacle, three or four times a-day. The bark and other bitters may either be taken in ſubſtance or infuſion as is moſt agreeable to the patient.</p>
                        <p>WHEN obſtructions proceed from a viſcid ſtate of the blood, and the patient is of a groſs full habit, evacuations, and ſuch medicines as attenuate the humours, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The patient, in this caſe ought to be bled, to bathe her feet frequently in warm water, to take now and then a doſe of cooling phyſic, and to live upon a ſpare thin diet. Her drink ſhould be whey, water, or ſmall beer, and ſhe ought to take plenty of exerciſe.</p>
                        <p>WHEN obſtructions proceed from affections of the mind, every method ſhould be taken to amuſe and divert the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. And that ſhe may the more readily forget the cauſe of her affliction, ſhe ought, if poſſible, to be removed from the place where it happened. A change of place, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the mind with a variety of new objects, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> often a very happy influence in relieving it from the deepeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. A ſoothing, kind, and affable behaviour to perſons in this ſituation is alſo of the laſt importance. This would often prevent, the fatal conſequences which proceed from a <hi>harſh</hi> treatment of females, who are ſo unfortunate as to be croſſed in their inclinations; or who meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in love, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>THO' many diſeaſes proceed from obſtruction, it is not always to be conſidered as the cauſe, but often as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:012338_0336_0F88EDF426960D40"/>
of other maladies. When that is the caſe, inſtead of giving medicines to force down the <hi>menſes,</hi> which might be dangerous, we ought, by all means, to endeavour to reſtore the patient's health and ſtrength. When that is effected the other will return of courſe.</p>
                        <p>BUT the menſtrual flux may be too great as well as too ſmall. When that is the caſe, the patient becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite and digeſtion are bad, and oedematous ſwellings of the feet, dropſies and conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons often enſue. This frequently happens to women about the age of forty five or fifty, and is very difficult to cure. It may proceed from a ſedentary life; a full diet, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly of ſalted, high-ſeaſoned, or acrid food; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of ſpiritous liquors; too much exerciſe; violent paſſions of the mind, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>TO reſtrain this flux, the patient ought to be kept quiet and eaſy both in body and mind. If it be very violent, ſhe ought to lie in bed with her head low; to live upon a cool and ſlender diet, as veal or chicken-broths with bread; and to drink decoctions of nettle-roots, or the greater con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>rey. If theſe be not ſufficient to ſtop the flux, ſtronger aſtringents may be uſed, as allum, dragons blood, &amp;c. As much powdered allum as will lie upon a ſixpence may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> taken in a glaſs of red wine twice or thrice a-day, or oftener if the patient's ſtomach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> bear it. Such as cannot take allum in ſubſtance may uſe the allum-whey. Females who have frequent returns of this complaint, ought to uſe the jeſuits bark for a conſiderable time. Half a dram of bark may be mixed in a glaſs of red wine three or four times a-day, or it may be taken in common water, and ſharpened with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of vitriol.</p>
                        <p>BUT the <hi>uterine flux</hi> may offend in quality as well as in quantity. What is uſually called the <hi>fluor albus</hi> or whites, is a very common diſeaſe, and proves extremely hurtful to delicate women. This diſcharge is not always white, but ſometimes pale, yellow, green, or of a blackiſh colour; ſometimes it is ſharp and corroſive; ſometimes foul and foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tid, &amp;c. It is attended with a pale complexion, pain in the ſpine of the back, loſs of appetite, ſwelling of the feet, &amp;c. It generally proceeds from a relaxed and debilitated ſtate of the body, ariſing from indolence, the exceſſive uſe of tea, coffee, or other weak and watery diet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="333" facs="unknown:012338_0337_0F88EDF4AD199BC8"/>
TO remove this diſeaſe, the patient muſt take as much exerciſe as ſhe can bear without fatigue. Her food muſt be ſolid and nouriſhing, but of eaſy digeſtion; and her drink pretty generous, as red port or claret wine. Theſe may be drank pure or mixed with water, as the patient inclines. Tea and coffee are to be avoided. I have often known ſtrong broths have an exceeding good effect in this caſe. The patient ought not to lie too long a bed. When medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is wanted, we know none preferable to the jeſuits bark, which, in this caſe, ought always to be taken in ſubstance.</p>
                        <p>THAT period of life at which the <hi>menſes</hi> ceaſe to flow is likewiſe very critical to the ſex. The ſtoppage of any cuſtomary evacuation, however ſmall, is ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the whole frame, and often to deſtroy life itself. Hence it comes to paſs that ſo many women either fall into chronic diſorders, or die about this time: Such of them however as ſurvive it, without contracting any chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, often become more healthy and hardy than they were before, and enjoy ſtrength and vigour to a very great age.</p>
                        <p>IF the <hi>menſes</hi> ceaſe all of a ſudden, in women of a full ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, they ought to abate ſomewhat of their uſual quantity of food, eſpecially of the more nouriſhing kind, as fleſh, eggs, &amp;c. They ought likewiſe to take plenty of exerciſe, and to keep the belly open. This may be done by taking, once or twice a-week, a little rhubarb, or an infuſion of hiera picra in wine or brandy.</p>
                        <p>IT often happens that women of a groſs habit, at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life, have ulcerous ſores break out about their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or in other parts of the body. Such ulcers ought to be conſidered as critical, and ſhould either be ſuffered to continue open, or artificial drains ſhould be opened in their ſtead. Women who will needs have ſuch ſores dried up, are often ſoon after ſeized with acute or chronic diſeaſes, of which they die.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS of either ſex ought to be very cautious in drying up ſores which break out towards the decline of life. We would lay it down as a rule, where ever ſuch ſores appear, that before any attempts be made to heal them, an iſſue or ſeton ſhould be ſet in ſome part of the body. Few things bid fairer for preſerving health, or prolonging life, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in perſons who live full, than an iſſue, or ſome other drain conſtantly kept open in the decline of life.

                        <p>PREGNANCY is not a diſeaſe, but as it ſubjects women to ſeveral ailments, it may not be improper to point out the methods of preventing or relieving them.</p>
                        <p>PREGNANT women are often afflicted with the heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn. The method of treating this complaint has already been pointed out in page 254. and the one following. They are likewiſe, in the more early periods of pregnancy, often harraſſed with ſickneſs and vomiting, eſpecially in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Theſe complaints may generally be relieved by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerving the directions contained in pages 244. and 245. The head-ach and tooth-ach are alſo very troubleſome ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of pregnancy. The former may generally be removed by keeping the belly gently open, by the uſe of prunes, figs, roaſted apples, and ſuch like. When the pain is very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, bleeding may be neceſſary. For the treatment of the latter, we muſt refer the reader to that article page 249.</p>
                        <p>EVERY pregnant woman is more or leſs in danger of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion. This ſhould be guarded againſt with greateſt care, as it not only weakens the conſtitution, but renders the woman liable to the ſame misfortune afterwards. Abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may happen at any period of pregnancy, but it is moſt common in the ſecond or third month. Sometimes howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it happens in the fourth or fifth. If it happens within the firſt month, it is uſually called a falſe conception; if after the ſeventh month, the child may often be kept alive by proper care.</p>
                        <p>THE common cauſes of abortion are, the death of the child; weakneſs or relaxation of the mother; great evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations; violent motion; rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ing great weights; reaching too high; vomiting; coughing; convulſion-fits; ſtrokes on the belly; falls; fevers; diſagreeable ſmells; exceſs of blood; indolence; high living; or the contrary; violent paſſions or affections of the mind, as fear, grief, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>THE ſigns of approaching abortion are, a pain in the joins, or about the bottom of the belly; a dull heavy pain in the inſide of the thighs; a flight degree of coldneſs or ſhivering; ſickneſs; palpitation of the heart; the breaſts
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:012338_0339_0F88EDF670827500"/>
become flat and ſoft; the belly falls; and there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of blood or watery humours from the womb.</p>
                        <p>TO prevent abortion, we would adviſe women of a weak or relaxed habit to uſe ſolid food, avoiding great quantities of tea, and other weak and watery liquors; to riſe early, and go ſoon to bed; to ſhun damp houſes; to take frequent exerciſe in the open air, but to avoid fatigue; and never to go abroad in damp foggy weather, if they can ſhun it. Women of a full habit ought to uſe a ſpare diet, avoiding ſtrong liquors, and every thing that may tend to heat the body, or increaſe the quantity of blood. Their diet ſhould be of an opening nature, conſiſting principally of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubſtances. Every woman with child ought to be kept cheerful and eaſy in her mind. All violent paſſions hurt the <hi>foetus,</hi> and endanger an abortion.</p>
                        <p>WHEN any ſigns of abortion appear, the woman ought to be laid in bed on a mattreſs, with her head low. She ſhould be kept quiet, and her mind ſoothed and comforted. She ought not to be kept too warm, nor to take any thing of a heating nature. Her food ſhould conſiſt of broths, rice and milk, jellies, or gruels with a very little wine in them.</p>
                        <p>IF ſhe be able to bear it, ſhe ſhould loſe, at leaſt, half a pound of blood from the arm. Her drink ought to be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-water ſharpened with cream of tartar; or ſhe may take half a dram of powdered nitre in a cup of water-gruel, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry five or ſix hours. If the woman be ſeized with a violent looſeneſs, ſhe ought to drink the decoction of calcined hartſhorn prepared. If ſhe be affected with vomiting, let her take frequently one of the ſaline draughts recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed page 143.</p>
                        <p>SANGUINE robuſt women, who are liable to miſcarry at a certain time of pregnancy, ought always to be bled a few days before that period arrives. By this means, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the regimen above preſcribed, they may often eſcape that misfortune.</p>
                        <p>THO' we recommend due care for preventing abortion, we would not be underſtood as reſtraining pregnant women from their uſual exerciſes. This would operate the quite contrary way. Want of exerciſe not only relaxes the body, but induces a plethora, or too great a fulneſs of the veſſels, which are the two principal cauſes of abortion.</p>

                        <head>OF CHILDBIRTH.</head>
                        <p>MANY diſeaſes proceed from the want of due care in child-bed. The more hardy part of the ſex are apt to deſpiſe the neceſſary precautions after delivery. They think, when the labour-pains are ended, the danger is over; but in truth it may only then be ſaid to be begun. Nature if left to herſelf, will ſeldom fail to expel the <hi>foetus;</hi> but proper care and management are certainly neceſſary for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the mother. No doubt, miſchief may be done by too much as well as by too little care. Hence it is that females who have the greateſt number of attendants in child-bed, generally recover worſt. But this is not peculiar to the ſtate of child-bed. Exceſſive care always defeats its own intention, and is generally more dangerous than none at all.</p>
                        <p>DURING actual labour, nothing of a heating nature muſt be given. The woman may, now and then, take a little panada, and her drink ought to be toaſt and water, or thin groat-gruel. Spirits, wines, cordial-waters, and other things, which are given with a view to ſtrengthen the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and promote the birth, for the moſt part tend only to increaſe the fever, inflame the womb, and retard the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Beſides, they endanger the woman afterwards, as they often occaſion violent and mortal haemorrhages, or prediſpoſe her to eruptive and other fevers.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the labour proves tedious and difficult, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent inflammations, it will be proper to bleed. An emoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent clyſter ought likewiſe frequently to be adminiſtered; and the patient ſhould ſit over the ſteams of warm water. The paſſage ought to be gently rubbed with a little ſoft <hi>pomatum</hi> or freſh butter, and cloths wrung out of warm water ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied over the belly. If Nature ſeems to ſink, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be greatly exhauſted with fatigue, a draught of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wine, or ſome other cordial, may be given, but not otherwiſe. Theſe directions are ſufficient in natural la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and in all preternatural caſes, a ſkillful ſurgeon, or man-midwife, ought to be called as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>WE cannot help taking notice of that ridiculous cuſtom which ſtill prevails in ſome country-places, of collecting a number of women together upon ſuch occaſions. Theſe, inſtead of being uſeful, ſerve only to crowd the houſe, and obſtruct the neceſſary attendants. Beſides, they hurt the

                        <p>AFTER delivery, the woman ought to be kept as quiet and eaſy as poſſible. Her food ſhould be light and thin; as gruel, panada, &amp;c. and her drink weak and diluting. To this rule however there are ſome exceptions. I have known ſeveral hyſteric women, whoſe ſpirits could not be ſupported in child-bed without ſolid food and generous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; to ſuch a glaſs of wine and a bit of chicken muſt be allowed.</p>
                        <p>SOMETIMES an exceſſive haemorrhage or flooding hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after delivery. In this caſe, the patient ſhould be laid with her head low, have ligatures applied above her knees and elbows, and be in all reſpects treated as for an exceſſive flux of the <hi>menſes.</hi> If the flooding proves violent, linen cloths, which have been wrung out of a mixture of equal parts of vinegar and water, ſhould be applied to the belly, the loins, and the thighs: Theſe muſt be changed as they grow dry; and may be diſcontinued as ſoon as the flooding abates.</p>
                        <p>IF there be violent pains after delivery, the patient ought to drink plentifully of warm diluting liquors, as tea with a little ſaffron; or an infuſion of camomile flowers; and to take ſmall broths, with carroway ſeeds or a bit of orange-peel in them; an ounce of the oil of ſweet almonds may likewiſe be frequently taken in a cup of any of the above li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; and if the patient be reſtleſs, a ſpoonful of the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of poppies may now and then be mixed with a cup of her drink. If ſhe be hot or feveriſh, one of the following powders may be taken in a cup of her uſual drink, every five or ſix hours. Take of crabs claws prepared half an ounce, purified nitre two drams, ſaffron powdered half a dram; rub them together in a mortar, and divide the whole into eight or nine doſes. When the patient is low ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or troubled with hyſterical complaints, ſhe ought to take frequently twelve or fifteen drops of the tincture of aſafoetida in a cup of penny-royal tea.</p>
                        <p>AN inflammation of the womb is a dangerous and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent diſeaſe after delivery. It is known by pains in the lower part of the belly, which are greatly increaſed upon touching; by the tenſion or tightneſs of the parts; great weakneſs; change of countenance; a conſtant fever, with a weak and hard pulſe; a ſlight <hi>delirium</hi> or raving; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:012338_0342_0F88EDFB97A3C5E8"/>
inceſſant vomiting; a hiccup; a diſcharge of rediſh ſtinking ſharp water from the womb; an inclination to go to ſtool; a heat, and ſometimes total ſuppreſſion of urine.</p>
                        <p>THIS muſt be treated like other inflammatory diſorders, by bleeding and plentiful dilution. The drink may be thin gruel or barley water; in a cup of which half a dram of nitre may be diſſolved, and taken three or four times a day. Clyſters of warm water muſt be frequently adminiſtred; and the belly ſhould be fomented by cloths wrung out of warm water, or by applying bladders filled with warm milk and water to it.</p>
                        <p>A SUPPRESSION of the <hi>lochia,</hi> or uſual diſcharges after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, and the milk-fever, muſt be treated nearly in the ſame manner as an inflammation of the womb. In all theſe caſes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>afest courſe is plentiful dilution, gentle evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fomentations of the parts affected. In the milk-fever, the breaſts may be embrocated with a little warm lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed oil, or the leaves of red cabbage may be applied to them. The child ſhould be often put to the breaſt, or it ſhould be drawn by ſome other perſon.</p>
                        <p>NOTHING would tend more to prevent the milk-fever than putting the child early to the breaſt. The cuſtom of not allowing children to ſuck for the firſt two or three days, is contrary to Nature and common ſenſe, and is very hurtful both to the mother and child. Every mother who has milk in her breaſts, ought either to ſuckle her own child, or to have her breaſts frequently drawn, at leaſt for the firſt month. This would prevent many of the diſeaſes which prove fatal to women in child-bed.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an inflammation happens in the breaſt, attended with redneſs, hardneſs, and other ſymptoms of ſuppuration, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>afeſt application is a poultice of bread and milk, ſoftened with oil or freſh butter. This may be renewed twice a day till the tumour be either diſcuſſed or brought to ſuppuration. Afterwards it may be dreſſed with yellow baſilicon, or any other digeſtive ointment. The uſe of repellants, in this caſe, is very dangerous; they often occaſion fevers, and ſometimes cancers: Whereas a ſuppuration is ſeldom attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any danger, and has often the moſt ſalutary effects.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the nipples are fretted or chapt, they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with a mixture of oil and bees-wax, or a little gum arabic may be ſprinkled on them. I have ſeen Hungary-water applied to the nipples have a very good effect. Should

the complaint prove obſtinate, the nurſe ought to be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which generally removes it.</p>
                        <p>THE miliary fever is a diſeaſe very incident to women in child-bed. But as it has been treated of already, we ſhall take no farther notice of it here than only, with the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hoffman, to obſerve, that this fever of child-bed women might generally be prevented, if they, during their preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, were regular in their diet, uſed moderate exerciſe, took now and then a gentle laxative of manna, rhubarb, or cream of tartar; not forgetting to bleed in the firſt months, and avoid all ſharp air. When the labour is coming on, it is not to be haſtened with forcing medicines, which inflame the blood and humours, or put them into unnatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. Care ſhould be taken, after the birth, that the natural excretions proceed regularly; and if the pulſe be quick, a little nitrous powder ſhould be given, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>WE ſhall conclude our obſervations on child-bed women by recommending it to them, above all things, to beware of cold. Poor women, whoſe circumſtances oblige them to quit their bed too ſoon, often contract diſeaſes from cold, of which they never recover. It is pity the poor are not better taken care of in this ſituation. But the better ſort of women run the greateſt hazard from being kept too hot. They are generally kept in a ſort of bagnio for the firſt eight or ten days, and then dreſſed out to ſee company. The danger of this conduct muſt be obvious to every one. The ſuperſtitious cuſtom of obliging women to keep the houſe till they go to church, is likewiſe a very common cauſe of catching cold. All churches are damp, and moſt of them cold; conſequently they are the very worſt places to which a woman can go to make her firſt viſit, after being confined in a warm room for a month. We make this obſervation from experience, having often had occaſion to attend wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whoſe diſorders were the effect of cold caught in this way.</p>

                        <p>BARRENNESS may be very properly reckoned among the diſeaſes of females, as few married women who have not children enjoy a good ſtate of health. It may proceed from various cauſes; but we ſhall only take notice of two, <abbr>viz.</abbr> high living and relaxation. It is very certain that high
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:012338_0344_0F88EDFCEA3F1FE0"/>
living vitiates the humours, and prevents fecundity. We ſeldom find a barren woman among the labouring poor, while nothing is more common amongſt the rich and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. The inhabitants of every country are prolific in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their poverty, and it would be an eaſy matter to adduce many inſtances of women who, by being reduced to live entirely upon a milk and vegetable diet, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and brought forth children, though they never had any before. Would the rich uſe the ſame ſort of food and exerciſe as the better ſort of peaſants, they would ſeldom have cauſe to envy their poor vaſſals and dependents the bleſſing of a numerous and healthy offspring, while they pine in ſorrow for the want of even a ſingle heir to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive dominions.</p>
                        <p>AFFLUENCE begets indolence, which not only vitiates the humours, but induces a general relaxation of the ſolids; a ſtate highly unfavourable to procreation. As we have the greateſt reaſon to believe, that relaxation is one of the moſt common cauſes of barrenneſs, we would recommend the following courſe for removing it. Firſt, plenty of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe in the open air; ſecondly, the uſe of the cold bath; and laſtly, aſtringent medicines. It is well known, that many women who had been long barren, have, by the uſe of the cold bath not only become mothers, but have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards enjoyed a much better ſtate of health. This ſhould induce all barren women not only to try the cold bath, but to perſiſt in the uſe of it for a long time, otherwiſe it cannot be expected to produce any conſiderable effects.</p>
                        <p>THO' a vegetable diet, plenty of exerciſe, and the cold bath, are the medicines moſt to be relied upon, we ſhall mention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, which has ſometimes proved effectual, <abbr>viz.</abbr> common <hi>allum.</hi> About the third or fourth day of the menſtrual flux the woman muſt take as much powdered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum at bed-time, in a cup of wine or negas, as will lie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſixpence. This muſt be repeated for three or four nights running. If it has not the deſired effect, it may be taken in the ſame manner next time the <hi>menſes</hi> return. I have known ſeveral women who always conceived after taking this medicine, and never without it.</p>
                        <p>THE above obſervations on diet, air, and exerciſe, are applicable to men as well as to women. Dr Chyne avers, that want of children is oftener the fault of the male than of the female, and ſtrongly recommends a milk and veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

diet to the former as well as the latter; adding, that his friend Dr Taylor, whom he calls the milk Doctor of Croyden, had brought ſundry opulent families in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who had continued ſome years after marriage without progeny, to have ſeveral fine children, by keeping both parents, for a conſiderable time, to a milk and veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diet.</p>

                        <head>RETENTION OF THE MECONIUM.</head>
                        <p>THE ſtomach and bowels of a new-born infant are filled with a blackiſh coloured matter of the conſiſtence of ſyrup, commonly called the <hi>meconium.</hi> This is generally paſſed ſoon after the birth by the mere effort of nature, in which caſe it is not neceſſary to give the infant any kind of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. But if it ſhould be retained, or not ſufficiently carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off, it may occaſion wind, gripes, jaundice, reſtleſſneſs, convulſions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper medicine for expelling the <hi>meconium</hi> is the mother's milk, which is always, at firſt, of a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality. But, if the the mother does not gives ſuck, or, if her milk happens not to be ſufficiently purgative, a little of the ſyrup of pale roſes may be given, or a ſmall quantity of the ſyrup of rhubarb diluted with water, and ſweetened with honey or coarſe ſugar. If theſe are not at hand, a common ſpoonful of whey ſweetened with a teaſpoonful of honey may be given.</p>
                        <p>ALL kind of oils are to be avoided; they are quite indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtible by infants, and tend only to load their ſtomachs and makes them ſick.</p>

                        <head>THE APHTHAE OR THRUSH.</head>
                        <p>THE aphthae are little whitiſh ulcers affecting the whole inſide of the mouth, tongue, throat, and ſtomach of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Sometimes they reach through the whole inteſtinal
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:012338_0346_0F88EDFE69F33260"/>
canal; in which caſe they are very dangerous, and often put<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an end to the infant's life.</p>
                        <p>IF the aphthae are of a pale colour, pellucid, few in number, ſoft, ſuperficial, and fall eaſily off, they are not dangerous; but if opake, yellow, brown, black, thick, or running together, they are bad.</p>
                        <p>IT is generally thought that the aphthae owe their origin to acid humours; but we have reaſon to believe that theſe, and ſeveral other eruptive diſeaſes of infants, are, in a great meaſure, owing to too hot a regimen both of the mother and child. It is a rare thing to find a child who is not doſed with wine, punch, cinnamon waters, or ſome other hot and inflaming liquors, almoſt as ſoon as it is born. It is well known that theſe will occaſion inflammatory diſorders even in adults; is it any wonder then that they ſhould heat and inflame the tender bodies of infants, and ſet, as it were, the whole conſtitution on a blaze?</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper medicines for the aphthae are thoſe of a cooling and gentle opening nature. Five grains of rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb and a dram of <hi>magneſia alba</hi> may be rubbed together, and divided into ſix doſes, one of which may be given to the child every five or ſix hours. Theſe powders may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be given in the child's food or a little of the ſyrup of pale roſes, and may be repeated as often as is found neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to keep the belly open.</p>
                        <p>MANY things have been recommended for gargling the mouth and throat in this diſeaſe; but it is not eaſy to apply theſe in very young infants; we would therefore recommend it to the nurſe to rub the child's mouth frequently with a little borax and honey; or with the following mixture. Take fine honey an ounce, borax a dram, burnt allum half a dram, roſe-water two drams; mix them together. Theſe may be applied with the finger, or by means of a bit of ſoft rag tied to the end of a probe.</p>

                        <head>OF ACIDITIES.</head>
                        <p>THE food of children being, for the moſt part, of an aceſcent nature, it readily turns four upon the ſtomach, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the body be any how diſordered. Hence it comes to paſs, that moſt diſeaſes of children are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with evident ſigns of acidity, as green ſtools, gripes, &amp;c. Theſe appearances have induced many to believe,
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:012338_0347_0F88EDFF52C26228"/>
that all the diſeaſes of children were owing to an acid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the ſtomach and bowels; but whoever conſiders the matter attentively, will find, that theſe ſymptoms of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity are oftener the effect than the cauſe of diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>NATURE evidently intended, that the food of children ſhould be aceſcent; and until the body be diſordered, or the digeſtion hurt, from ſome other cauſe, we will venture to ſay, that the aceſcent quality of their food is ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to them. Acidity however is often a ſymptom of infantile diſorders, and, as it is a very troubleſome one, we ſhall point out the method of relieving it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN green ſtools, gripes, purgings, &amp;c. ſhew, that the bowels abound with an acid, the child ſhould have a little ſmall broth inſtead of milk, with light white bread in it; and ſhould have plenty of exerciſe in order to promote the digeſtion. It has been cuſtomary in this caſe to give the pearl-julep, chalk, crabs eyes, and other teſtaceous pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Theſe indeed, by their abſorbent quality, may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the acidity; but they are attended with this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, that they are apt to lodge in the bowels, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a coſtiveneſs, which may prove very hurtful to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant. For this reaſon they ſhould never be given unleſs mixed with purgative medicines; as rhubarb, manna, or ſuch like.</p>
                        <p>THE beſt medicine which we know, in all caſes of aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, is that fine inſipid powder called <hi>magneſia alba.</hi> It purges, and, at the ſame time, corrects the acidity; by which means it not only removes the diſeaſe, but carries off its cauſe. It may be given in any kind of food, from ten grains to a teaſpoonful, according to the age of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. I have often known it have good effects when given in the following manner. Take of <hi>magneſia alba</hi> two drams, fine rhubarb in powder half a dram, pepper-mint water and common water, of each two ounces, as much ſyrup of ſugar as will make it agreeable. Shake the bottle, and give the child a table-ſpoonful three or four times a-day.</p>
                        <p>WHEN an infant is troubled with gripes, it ought not to be doſed with brandy, ſpiceries, and other hot things, but ſhould have its belly opened with an emolient clyſter, or the medicine mentioned above; and at the ſame time a little brandy may be rubbed on its belly with a warm hand before the fire. I have ſeldom ſeen this fail to eaſe the
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:012338_0348_0F88EE00F01BDB60"/>
gripes of infants. It is often more effectual, and always more ſafe than brandy taken inwardly.</p>

                        <p>THESE are very troubleſome to children. They happen chiefly about the groin and wrinkles of the neck, under the arms, behind the ears, and in other parts that are moiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſweat or urine.</p>
                        <p>AS theſe complaints are, in a great meaſure, owing to want of cleanlineſs, the moſt effectual means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them are, to waſh the parts frequently with water, to change the linen often, and in a word, to keep the child, in all reſpects, thoroughly clean. When this is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the excoriated parts may be ſprinkled with abſorbent or drying powders; ſuch as burnt hartſhorn, tutty, chalk, crabs claws prepared, &amp;c. Any of theſe may be tied in a rag, and the powder ſhook out on the diſordered places.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the parts affected are very ſore, and tend to a real ulceration, it will be proper to add a little ſugar of lead to the powders; or to anoint the place with a little cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorated ointment.

                        <head>OF ERUPTIONS.</head>
                        <p>CHILDREN, while on the breaſt, are ſeldom free from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of one kind or other. Theſe however are not often dangerous, and ought never to be ſtopped but with the greateſt caution. They tend to free the bodies of infants from hot and acrid humours, which, if retained, might produce fatal diſorders.</p>
                        <p>THE eruptions of children are chiefly owing to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing cauſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> improper food, and neglect of cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If a child be ſtuffed at all hours with food that his ſtomach is not able to digeſt, ſuch food, not being proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſimilated, inſtead of nouriſhing the body, fills it with groſs humours. Theſe muſt either break out in form of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions upon the ſkin, or remain in the body, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fevers and other internal diſorders. That neglect of cleanlineſs is a very general cauſe of eruptive diſorders, muſt be obvious to every one. The children of the poor, and of all who deſpiſe cleanlineſs, are almoſt conſtantly found to ſwarm with vermin, and are generally covered over with the ſcab, itch, and other eruptions.</p>
                        <p>WHEN eruptions are the effect of improper food, or want of cleanlineſs, a proper attention to theſe alone will generally be ſufficient to remove them. If this ſhould not be the caſe, ſome drying medicines will be neceſſary; but they ſhould never be applied without the greateſt caution. If drying medicines are applied, the belly ought at the ſame time to be kept open, and cold is carefully to be avoided. We know no medicine that is more ſafe for dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up cutaneous eruptions than ſulphur, provided it be ſparingly uſed. A little of the flowers of ſulphur may be mixed with the white ointment or hog's lard, and the parts affected frequently touched with it.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt obſtinate of all the eruptions incident to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are, the <hi>tinea capitis,</hi> or ſcabbed head, and chilblains. The ſcabbed head is often exceeding difficult to cure, and ſometimes indeed the cure proves worſe than the diſeaſe. I have frequently known children ſeized with internal diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of which they died ſoon after their ſcabbed heads had been healed by the application of drying medicines<note n="*" place="bottom">
                              <p>I SOME time ago ſaw a very ſtriking inſtance of the danger of ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting drying medicines in the place of cleanlineſs and wholſome food.</p>
                              <p>BEING conſulted for the children of a certain Hoſpital in England, who were grievouſly afflicted with ſcabbed heads, and other cutaneous diſorders. I found, upon inquiry, that the children were fed upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes, and other crude vegetables, thro' the whole year, and that cleanlineſs was totally neglected. My advice was to give them more wholeſome food, and to keep them thoroughly clean. This advice however was not followed. It was too troubleſome to the ſervants, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents, &amp;c. The buſineſs was to be done by medicine; which was accordingly attempted, but had like to have proved fatal to the whole houſe. Fevers and other internal diſorders immediately appeared, and, at length, a putrid dyſentery broke out which carried off a great many of the children.</p>
                           </note>. The
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:012338_0350_0F88EE025CA0BC40"/>
cure ought always firſt to be attempted by keeping the head very clean, cutting off the hair, combing and bruſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſcabs, &amp;c. If this be not ſufficient, let the head be ſhaved once a-week, and waſhed daily with ſoap and warm water, or with lime-water. Should theſe fail, a plaſter of black pitch may be applied, in order to pull out the hair by the roots. And if there be proud fleſh, it ſhould be touched with a bit of blue vitriol, or ſprinkled with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle burnt allum. While theſe things are doing, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt be kept to a regular light diet, his belly ſhould be kept gently open; and cold, as far as poſſible, ought to be avoided. To prevent any bad conſequences from ſtopping this diſcharge, it will be proper, eſpecially in children of a delicate habit, to make an iſſue in the neck or arm, which may be kept open till the patient becomes more ſtrong, and the conſtitution be ſomewhat confirmed.</p>
                        <p>CHILBLAINS commonly attack children in cold weather. They are generally occaſioned by the feet or hands being kept long wet or cold, and afterwards ſuddenly heated. When children are cold, inſtead of taking exerciſe to warm themſelves gradually, they run to the fire. This occaſions a ſudden rarefaction of the humours, and an infarction of the veſſels; which being often repeated, the veſſels are, at laſt, over-diſtended, and forced to give way.</p>
                        <p>To prevent it, violent cold and ſudden heat muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually avoided. When the parts begin to look red and ſwell, the patient ought to be purged, and to have the affected parts frequently rubbed with muſtard and brandy, or ſomething of a warm nature. They ought likewiſe to be covered with flannel, and kept warm and dry. Some apply warm aſhes betwixt cloths to the ſwelled parts, which frequently help to reduce them. When there is a ſore, it
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:012338_0351_0F88EE02EBE5C330"/>
muſt be dreſſed with Turner's cerate, or ſome other drying ointment; as the ointment of tutty, the plaſter of ceruſs, &amp;c. Theſe ſores are indeed troubleſome, but ſeldom dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. They generally heal as ſoon as the warm weather ſets in.</p>

                        <p>CHILDREN are often ſeized very ſuddenly with a great difficulty of breathing, which, if not quickly relieved, proves mortal. This diſeaſe is known by various names in different parts of the country. In the Eaſt coaſt of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land it is called the <hi>croup.</hi> On the Weſt they call it the <hi>chock</hi> or <hi>ſtuffing.</hi> In ſome parts of England, where I have met with it, the good women call it the riſing of the lights. It ſeems to be a ſpecies of <hi>aſthma,</hi> attended with very acute and violent ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe generally prevails in cold and wet ſeaſons. It is moſt common upon the ſea-coaſt, and in low marſhy countries. Children of a groſs and lax habit are moſt lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. I have ſometimes known it hereditary. It gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally attacks children in the night, after having been much expoſed to damp cold eaſterly winds through the day. Damp houſes, wet feet, thin ſhoes, wet cloaths, or any thing that obſtructs the perſpiration, may occaſion this diſeaſe.</p>
                        <p>IT is attended with a frequent pulſe, quick and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous breathing, which is performed with a peculiar kind of croaking noiſe that may be heard at a conſiderable diſtance. The voice is ſharp and ſhrill, and the face is generally much fluſhed, tho' ſometimes it is of a livid colour.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a child is ſeized with the above ſymptoms, his feet ſhould be put into warm water. He ought likewiſe to be bled, and to have a laxative clyſter adminiſtered as ſoon as poſſible. He ſhould be made to breathe over the ſteams of warm water, or an emolient decoction, and emolient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſms or fomentations may be applied round his neck. If the ſymptoms do not abate, a bliſtering plaſter muſt be applied round the neck, or betwixt the ſhoulders, and the child may take frequently a table-ſpoonful of the following julep. Take penny-royal water three ounces, ſyrup of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea and balſamic ſyrup, each one ounce, mix them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

SOME, in this caſe, recommend aſafoetida. It may both be given in form of clyſter, and taken by the mouth. Two drams of aſafoetida may be diſſolved in one ounce of Minde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerus's ſpirit, and three ounces of penny-royal water. A table-ſpoonful of this mixture may be given every hour, or oftener if the patient's ſtomach be able to bear it. If the patient cannot be brought to take this medicine, two drams of the aſafoetida may be diſſolved in a common clyſter, and adminiſtered every ſix or eight hours, till the violence of the diſeaſe abates.</p>
                        <p>To prevent a return of this diſeaſe, all thoſe things which occaſion it muſt be carefully avoided; as wet feet, cold, damp eaſterly winds, &amp;c. Children who have had frequent returns of this diſeaſe, or whoſe conſtitution ſeems to prediſpoſe them to it, ought to have their diet properly regulated; all food that is viſcid or hard of digeſtion, and all crude, raw, traſhy fruits, are to be avoided. They ought likewiſe to have a drain conſtantly kept open in ſome part of their body, by means of a ſeton or iſſue. I have ſometimes known a Burgundy pitch plaſter, worn continually betwixt the ſhoulders for ſeveral years, have a very happy effect in preventing the return of this dreadful diſorder.</p>

                        <head>OF TEETHING.</head>
                        <p>DR Arbuthnot obſerves, that above a tenth part of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants die in teething, by ſymptoms proceeding from the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritation of the tender nervous parts of the jaws, occaſioning inflammations, fevers, convulſions, gangrenes, &amp;c. Theſe ſymptoms are, in a great meaſure, owing to the great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and exquiſite ſenſibility of the nervous ſyſtem at this time of life. But this natural ſenſibility of the nerves in infancy is too often increaſed by an effeminate education. Hence it comes to paſs, that children who are delicately brought up always ſuffer moſt in teething, and often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>all by convulſive diſorders.</p>
                        <p>ABOUT the ſixth or ſeventh month the teeth generally begin to make their appearance; firſt the <hi>inciſores,</hi> or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth; next the <hi>canini,</hi> or dog-teeth; and laſtly, the <hi>mola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> or grinders. About the ſeventh year there comes a new ſet; and about the twentieth the two inner grinders, called <hi>dentes ſapientiae,</hi> the teeth of wiſdom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="349" facs="unknown:012338_0353_0F88EE0554CED010"/>
CHILDREN, about the time of cutting their teeth, ſlaver much, and have generally a looſeneſs, which is no bad ſign; but when the teething is difficult, eſpecially when the dog-teeth begin to make their way through the gums, the child has ſtartings in his ſleep, tumours of the gums, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, watchings, gripes, green ſtools, the thruſh, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, difficult breathing, convulſions, and epilepſies, which often end in death.</p>
                        <p>DIFFICULT teething is; in all reſpects, to be treated as an inflammatory diſeaſe. If the belly be bound, it muſt be opened either by emollient clyſters or gentle purgatives; as manna, <hi>magneſia alba,</hi> rhubarb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>enna, &amp;c. The food ſhould be light, and in ſmall quantity; the drink plentiful, but weak and diluting, as infuſions of balm, or of the lime-tree flowers; to which about a third or fourth part of milk may be added.</p>
                        <p>IF the fever be very high, bleeding will be neceſſary; but this, in very young children, ought always to be ſparingly performed. It is an evacuation which they bear the worſt of any. Purging, vomiting, or ſweating, agree much better with them, and are generally more beneficial. Harris however obſerves, that, when an inflammation appears, the phyſician will labour in vain, if the <hi>cure</hi> be not begun with applying a leech under each ear. If the child be ſeized with convulſion fits, a bliſtering plaſter may be applied betwixt the ſhoulders, or one behind each ear.</p>
                        <p>DR Sydenham ſays, that in fevers occaſioned by teeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he never could find any remedy ſo effectual as two, three, or four drops of ſpirits of hartſhorn in a ſpoonful of ſimple water, or other convenient vehicle, given every four hours. The number of doſes may be four, five, or ſix. I have often preſcribed this medicine with ſucceſs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ound a larger doſe neceſſary. It may be given from five drops to fifteen or twenty, according to the age of the child.</p>
                        <p>IN Scotland, it is very common, when children are cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their teeth, to put a ſmall Burgundy pitch plaſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſhoulders. This generally eaſes the tickling cough which attends teething, and is by no means an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs application. When the teeth are bred with difficulty, it ought to be kept on during the whole time of teething.
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:012338_0354_0F88EE05E830A2A0"/>
It may be enlarged as occaſion requires, and ought to be renewed, at leaſt, once a month.</p>
                        <p>SEVERAL things have been recommended for rubbing the gums, as oils, mucilages, &amp;c.; but from theſe much is not to be expected. What we would recommend for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is virgin-honey. A little of this may be rubbed on with the finger three or four times a-day. Children are generally at this time diſpoſed to chew whatever they get into their hands. For this reaſon they ought never to be without ſomewhat that will yield a little to the preſſure of their gums, as a cruſt of bread, a wax-candle, a bit of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorice-root, or ſuch like. Theſe are far more proper than corral, ivory, ſilver, or any other impenetrable ſubſtance.</p>
                        <p>WITH regard to cutting the gums, we have ſeldom known it of any real advantage. In obſtinate caſes it ought however to be tried; but as it is generally performed by a ſurgeon, we ſhall not ſpend time in deſcribing the operation.</p>
                        <p>IN order to render the teething leſs difficult, parents ought to take care that their childrens food be light and wholeſome, and that their nerves be braced by plenty of exerciſe without doors, and the uſe of the cold bath, &amp;c. Were theſe things duly regarded, few children would die of teething.</p>
                        <p>AS the limits of this performance will not permit us to treat the diſeaſes of infants at more length, we ſhall only obſerve, that, if properly nurſed, their diſeaſes would be very few, and would ſeldom prove fatal. The nurſe may, for the moſt part, do the buſineſs of the phyſician; but the phyſician can never do that of the nurſe.</p>
                        <p>THE diſeaſes of children are far leſs complicated than thoſe of adults, and conſequently much eaſier under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; the method of curing them is likewiſe very ſimple, and cannot readily be miſtaken. In all the acute diſeaſes of children, cool air, diluting liquors, and gentle evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are almoſt the only things needful; and in their chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes, reſtorative diet, free air, and proper exerciſe, are what the cure muſt chiefly depend upon.</p>

                        <head>OF WOUNDS.</head>
                        <p>NO part of medicine has been more miſtaken than the treatment and cure of wounds. Mankind in general believe, that certain herbs, ointments, and ſalves are poſſeſſed of
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:012338_0355_0F88EE0AAF8B3FD8"/>
wonderful healing virtues, and imagine that no wound can be cured without the application of them. It is however a fact, that no external application whatever contributes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cure of a wound, any other way than by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parts ſoft, and defending them from the external air, which may be as effectually done by ſoft lint as by the moſt pompous applications, while it is exempt from many of the bad conſequences attending them.</p>
                        <p>THE ſame obſervation holds with reſpect to internal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications. Theſe only promote the cure of wounds in ſo far as they tend to prevent a fever, or to remove any cauſe that might obſtruct or impede the operations of Nature. It is Nature alone that cures wounds; all that art can do is to remove obſtacles, and to put the parts in ſuch a condition as is the moſt favourable to Nature's efforts.</p>
                        <p>WITH this ſimple view, we ſhall conſider the treatment of wounds, and endeavour to point out ſuch ſteps as ought to be taken to facilitate their cure.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt thing to be done when any perſon has received a wound is to examine whether any foreign body be lodged in it, as wood, ſtone, iron, lead, glaſs, dirt, bits of cloth, &amp;c. Theſe, if it can be eaſily done, ought to be extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the wound cleaned, before any dreſſings be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When that cannot be effected with ſafety, on account of the patient's weakneſs, or loſs of blood, &amp;c. they muſt be ſuffered to remain in the wound, and be afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted when the patient is more able to bear it.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a wound penetrates into any of the cavities of the body, as the breaſt, the bowels, &amp;c. or where any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable blood-veſſel is cut, a ſkillful ſurgeon ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be called, otherwiſe the patient may loſe his life. But ſometimes the diſcharge of blood is ſo great, that if it be not ſtopt, the patient may die even before a ſurgeon, tho' at no great diſtance, can arrive. In this caſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing muſt be done by thoſe who are preſent. If the wound be in any of the limbs, the bleeding may generally be ſtopt by applying a tight ligature or bandage round the member a little above the wound. The beſt method of doing this is to put a ſtrong broad garter round the part, but ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>lack as eaſily to admit a ſmall piece of ſtick to be put under it, which muſt be twiſted, in the ſame manner as a country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does a cart-rope to ſecure his loading, till the bleeding ſtops. Whenever this is the caſe, he muſt take care to
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:012338_0356_0F88EE0C57A28980"/>
twiſt it no longer, as ſtraining too tight might occaſion an inflammation of the parts and endanger a gangrene.</p>
                        <p>IN parts where this bandage cannot be applied, various other methods may be tried to ſtop the bleeding, as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſtyptics, aſtringents, &amp;c. Cloths dipped in a ſolution of blue vitriol in water, or the <hi>ſtyptic water</hi> of the Diſpenſatories, may be applied to the wound. When theſe cannot be obtained, ſtrong ſpirits of wine may be uſed. Some recommend the <hi>Agaric</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr Tiſſot, in his <hi>Advice to the people,</hi> gives the following directions for gathering, preparing, and applying the agaric.—"Gather in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, while the fine weather laſts, the agaric of the oak, which is a kind of fungus or excreſcence iſſuing from the wood of that tree. It conſiſts at firſt of four parts, which preſent themſelves ſucceſſively: 1. The outward rind or ſkin, which may be thrown away. 2. The part immediately under this rind, which is the beſt of all. This is to be beat well with a hammer, till it becomes ſoft and very pliable. This is the only preparation it requires, and a ſlice of it of a proper ſize is to be applied directly over the burſting open blood veſſels. It conſtringes and brings them cloſe together, ſtops the bleeding, and generally falls off at the end of two days. 3. The third part adhering to the ſecond may ſerve to ſtop the bleeding from the ſmaller veſſels: and the fourth and laſt part may be reduced to powder as conducing to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.—That agaric which ſprings from thoſe parts of the tree from whence large boughs have been lopped, is generally reckoned the beſt."</note> of the oak as preferable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other ſtyptics; and indeed it deſerves conſiderable encomiums. It is eaſily obtained, and ought to be kept in every family, in caſe of accidents. A piece of it muſt be laid upon the wound and covered with a good deal of lint, above which a bandage muſt be applied ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight as to keep it firmly on.</p>
                        <p>THO' ſpirits, tincture, and hot balſams may be uſed, in order to ſtop the bleeding when it is exceſſive, they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper at other times. They do not promote but retard the cure, and often change a ſimple wound into an ulcer. People imagine, becauſe hot balſams congeal the blood, and ſeem, as it were, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>older up the wound, that they therefore heal it; but this is only a deception. They may indeed ſtop the flowing blood, by ſearing the mouths of the veſſels; but, by rendering the parts callous, they obſtruct the cure.</p>
                        <p>IN ſlight wounds which do not penetrate much deeper than the ſkin, the beſt application is a bit of the common black ſticking plaſter. This keeps the ſides of the wound
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:012338_0357_0F88EE0DB92CFA68"/>
together, and prevents the air from getting into it, which is all that is neceſſary. When a wound penetrates deep, it is not ſafe to keep its lips quite cloſe; this keeps in the matter, and is apt to make the wound feſter. In this caſe the beſt way is to fill the wound with ſoft lint commonly called <hi>caddis.</hi> This however muſt not be ſtuffed in too hard otherwiſe it will do hurt. It may be covered over with a cloth dipped in oil, or ſpread with the common wax<note n="*" place="bottom">THE wax plaſter is made by melting together over a ſlow fire, a pound of yellow wax; white reſin, and mutton ſuet, of each half a pound. This not only ſupplies the place of melilot plaſter, formerly ſo much in vogue, but makes a very proper application to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>WE ſhall not ſpend time in deſcribing the different ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages that may be proper for wounds in different parts of the body; common ſenſe will generally ſuggeſt the moſt commodious method of applying a bandage; beſides deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this kind are not eaſily remembered.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt dreſſing ought to continue on for at leaſt two days; after which it may be removed, and freſh lint appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as before. If any part of the firſt dreſſing ſticks ſo cloſe that it cannot be removed with eaſe or ſafety to the patient, it may be allowed to continue, and freſh lint dipped in ſweet oil laid above it. This will ſoften it ſo as to make it come off eaſily at next dreſſing. Afterwards the wound may be dreſſed every day in the ſame manner till it be quite heal. Thoſe who are fond of ſalves or ointments, may, after the wound is become very ſuperficial, dreſs it, twice a-day, with the yellow <hi>baſilicon</hi> ointment<note n="†" place="bottom">THE yellow baſilicon ointment is prepared in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Take of olive oil an Engliſh pint, yellow wax, yellow reſin, and Burgundy pitch, of each one pound; common turpentine three ounces. Melt the wax, reſin, and pitch, along with the oil over a ſlow fire; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking them from the fire add the turpentine, and, whilſt the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remains hot, ſtrain it.</note>; and if fungous, or what is called <hi>proud fleſh,</hi> ſhould riſe in the wound, it may be checked, by mixing with the ointment, a little burnt allum or red precipitate.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a wound is greatly inflamed, the moſt proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is a poultice of bread and milk, ſoftened with a little ſweet oil or freſh butter. This muſt be applied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the plaſter, and ſhould be changed two or three times a-day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="354" facs="unknown:012338_0358_0F88EE0E395F2DF8"/>
IF the wound be large, and there is reaſon to fear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, the patient muſt be kept on a very low diet. He muſt abſtain from fleſh, ſtrong liquors, and every thing that is of a heating nature. If he be of a full habit, and has loſt but little blood from the wound, he muſt be bled; and, if the ſymptoms be urgent, the operation may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. But when the patient has been greatly weakened by loſs of blood from the wound, it will be dangerous to bleed him, even tho' a fever ſhould enſue. Nature ſhould never be too far exhauſted. It is always more ſafe to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her to ſtruggle with the diſeaſe in her own way, than to ſink the patients ſtrength by exceſſive evacuations.</p>
                        <p>WOUNDED perſons ought to be kept very quiet and eaſy. Every thing that ruffles the mind, or moves the paſſions, as love, anger, fear, exceſſive joy, &amp;c. are very hurtful. They ought, above all things, to abſtain from venery. The belly ſhould be kept gently open either by laxative clyſters, or by cool vegetable diet, as roaſted apples, ſtewed prunes, boiled ſpinnage, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>IN ſome parts of the country the peaſants apply to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bruiſe a poultice of freſh cow's dung, with very happy effects.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a bruiſe is very violent, the patient ought imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be bled, and put upon a proper regimen. His food ſhould be light and cool, and his drink weak, and of an opening nature; as whey ſweetened with honey, decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of tamarinds, barley, cream-tartar-whey, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The bruiſed part muſt be bathed with vinegar and water, as directed above; and a poultice made by boiling crumbs of bread, elder flowers, and camomile flowers, in equal quantities of vinegar and water, applied to it. This poultice is peculiarly proper when a wound is joined to the bruiſe. It may be renewed two or three times a-day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="356" facs="unknown:012338_0360_0F88EE0FACC61110"/>
As the ſtructure of the veſſels is totally deſtroyed by a violent bruiſe, there often enſues a great loſs of ſubſtance, which produces an ulcerous ſore very difficult to cure. If the bone be affected, the ſore will not heal before an exfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation takes place, that is, before the diſeaſed part of the bone ſeparates, and comes out through the wound. This is often a very ſlow operation, and may even require ſeveral years to be compleated. Hence it happens, that theſe ſores are frequently miſtaken for the King's evil, and treated as ſuch, though, in fact, they proceed ſolely from the injury which the ſolid parts received from the blow.</p>
                        <p>PATIENTS in this ſituation are peſtered with different ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Every perſon who ſees them propoſes a new remedy, till the ſore is in a manner, poiſoned with various and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite applications, and, is often at length rendered abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incurable. The beſt method of managing ſuch ſores is, to take care that the patient's conſtitution does not ſuffer by confinement, or improper medicine, and to apply nothing to them but ſome ſimple ointment ſpread upon ſoft lint, over which a poultice of bread and milk, with boiled camomile flowers, or the like, may be put to nouriſh the part, and keep it ſoft and warm. Nature, thus aſſiſted, will generally in time operate a cure, by throwing off the diſeaſed parts of the bone, after which the ſore ſoon heals.</p>

                        <p>DISLOCATIONS are generally occaſioned by falls, blows, or the like. They are always dangerous, and ſometimes, unleſs immediately reduced, they prove fatal. A perſon who has the misfortune, by a fall from his horſe, or the like, to diſlocate his neck, is often left to periſh, while it is in the power of every perſon preſent to do all that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for his recovery. But people are ſeized with a kind of panic upon theſe occaſions, and are often ſo much afraid of doing wrong, that they do nothing at all. This is, in fact, allowing a perſon to die for fear of hurting him.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the neck is diſlocated, or put out of joint, the patient is immediately deprived of all ſenſe and motion; his countenance ſoon turns bloated and blackiſh; his neck ſwells; and his face is generally turned toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="357" facs="unknown:012338_0361_0F88EE106D1C4B48"/>
ſuch a manner, as to be able to lay hold of his head with both his hands, while he makes a reſiſtance by placing his knees againſt the patient's ſhoulders. In this poſition, with one hand under the chin, and the other under the hinder part of the head, he muſt pull with conſiderable force, gently twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at the ſame time, if the face be turned to one ſide, till he perceives that the joint is replaced. This is eaſily known from the noiſe which bones generally makes upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the very act of reduction, from the patient's beginning ſoon after to breathe, and from the head continuing in its proper poſition, &amp;c. This operation, like many others, is eaſier performed than deſcribed, and requires only common prudence and ſufficient reſolution in the operator. I have known inſtances of its being happily performed even by women, and frequently by men of no medical education.</p>
                        <p>THO' diſlocations of the limbs are leſs dangerous, they ought nevertheleſs to be reduced as ſoon as poſſible. When the operation is long delayed it becomes very difficult, and ſometimes even impractible. Beſides, when a bone has been diſlocated for a conſiderable time, it can ſeldom be kept in its place after it has been reduced. A mechanical genius, with a very ſlight notion of the ſtructure of the human body, will enable any perſon to reduce a diſlocated bone. All that is neceſſary is to make a proper exſtenſion and at the ſame time, to puſh the head of the bone towards the ſocket<note n="*" place="bottom">We intended here to have treated of the various kinds of diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to have ſhewn the method of reducing them; but this the limits of our performance will not permit.</note>.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the bone has been reduced, a roller wet with equal parts of vinegar and water may be applied round the joint. The member ought to be placed in the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eaſy poſture, and kept ſo for ſome time, till the parts recover their wonted ſtrength and tone.</p>

                        <p>THERE are in moſt country villages ſome perſon who pretends to the art of reducing fractures. Tho' in general ſuch perſons are very ignorant, yet ſome of them are very ſucceſsful; which evidently proves, that a ſmall degree of learning, with a ſufficient ſhare of common ſenſe, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:012338_0362_0F88EE1136B8F110"/>
a man to be uſeful in this way. We would however adviſe people never to truſt ſuch operators when an expert and ſkilful ſurgeon can be had; but when that is imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, they muſt be employed; we ſhall therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the following hints to their conſideration.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a large bone is broken, the patient's diet ought, in all reſpects to be the ſame as that of a perſon in a fever. He ſhould likewiſe be kept quiet and cool, and his belly ſhould be kept gently open either by emollient clyſters, or, if theſe cannot be conveniently adminiſtered, by food that is of an opening quality; as ſtewed prunes, apples boiled in milk, boiled ſpinnage, &amp;c. It ought however to be here remarked, that perſons who have been accuſtomed to live high, are not all of a ſudden to be reduced to a very low diet. This might have fatal conſequences. There is often a neceſſity of indulging bad habits, in ſome meaſure, even where the nature of the diſeaſe might require a different treatment.</p>
                        <p>IT will generally be neceſſary to bleed the patient after a fracture, eſpecially if he be young, of a full habit, or has, at the ſame time, received any bruiſe or contuſion. This operation ſhould be performed as ſoon after the accident happens as poſſible, and if the patient be very feveriſh, it may be repeated next day. When ſeveral of the ribs are broken, bleeding is peculiarly neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>IF any of the large bones which ſupport the weight of the body be broken, the patient muſt keep his bed for ſeveral weeks. It is by no means however neceſſary that he ſhould lie all this while, as is cuſtomary, upon his back. This ſituation ſinks the ſpirits, galls and frets the patients ſkin, and renders him very uneaſy. After the ſecond week he may be gently raiſed up, and may ſit ſeveral hours, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a bed chair, or the like, which will greatly relieve him. Great care however muſt be taken in raiſing him up, and laying him down, that he exert no ſtrength of his own, otherwiſe the action of the muſcles may pull the bone out of its place.</p>
                        <p>IT is of great importance to keep the patient dry and clean while in this ſituation. By neglecting this he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo galled and excoriated, that he is forced to keep ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places for eaſe. I have ſometimes known a fractured thigh bone, after it had lain ſtrait for above a fortnight, miſplaced by this means, and continue bent for life, in ſpite of all that could be done.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="359" facs="unknown:012338_0363_0F88EE11E8C4B0F8"/>
BONE-SETTERS ought carefully to examine whether the bone be not ſhattered, or broken into a great many pieces. In this caſe it will generally be neceſſary to have the limb taken off, otherwiſe a gangrene or mortification may enſue. The horror which attends the very idea of an amputation often occaſions its being delayed in ſuch caſes till too late. I, ſome time ago, ſaw a ſhocking inſtance of this in a maſon, who had the misfortune to fall from the third ſtory of a houſe. In one of his legs, which had ſtruck a beam, the bones were ſo ſhattered and ſplit near the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ncle, that they felt almoſt like a bag of ſmall ſtones. Some of their ſharp points had likewiſe penetrated the ſkin. It was adviſed that the leg ſhould immediately be taken off; but to this the patient's friends would not conſent. After tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three or four days to conſider of it, the operation was at laſt determined upon, and was accordingly performed; but alas, it was in vain! The mortification had already proceeded too far to be ſtopped, and the miſerable patient died in two days.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a fracture is accompanied with a wound, it muſt be dreſſed in all reſpects as a common wound.</p>
                        <p>All that art can do towards the cure of a broken bone, is to lay it perfectly ſtraight, and to keep it quite eaſy. All tight bandages do hurt. They had much better be wanting altogether. A great many of the bad conſequences which proceed from fractured bones are owing to tight bandages. This is one of the ways in which the exceſs of art, or rather the abuſe of art, does more miſchief than would be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the want of it. Some of the moſt ſudden cure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Some method however muſt be taken to keep the member ſteady; but this may be done many ways without bracing it with a tight bandage. We are not however againſt the uſe of bandages altogether.

                        <p>IN fractures of the ribs, where a bandage cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly uſed, an adheſive plaſter may be applied over the part. The patient in this caſe ought to keep himſelf quite eaſy, avoiding every thing that may occaſion ſneezing, laughing, coughing or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

conſtantly diſtended, by taking frequently ſome light food, and drinking freely of weak watery liquors.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper external application for a fracture is <hi>oxycrate,</hi> or a mixture of vinegar and water. The banda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould be wet with this at every dreſſing before they be applied, and the part may be frequently ſprinkled with it.</p>

                        <head>OF STRAINS.</head>
                        <p>STRAINS are often attended with worſe conſequences than broken bones. The reaſon is obvious; they are generally neglected. When a bone is broken, the patient is under a neceſſity of keeping it eaſy, becauſe he cannot make uſe of it; but when a joint is only ſtrained, the perſon finding he can ſtill make a ſhift to move it, is ſorry to loſe his time for ſo trifling an ailment. In this way he deceives himſelf, and converts into an incurable malady what might have been removed by only keeping the part eaſy for a few days.</p>
                        <p>COUNTRY people generally immerſe a ſtrained limb in cold water. This is very proper, provided it be done im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and not kept in too long. But the cuſtom of keeping the part immerſed in cold water for many hours together, is certainly dangerous. This relaxes inſtead of bracing the part, and is more likely to produce a diſeaſe than remove one.</p>
                        <p>WRAPPING a garter, or ſome other bandage, pretty tight about the ſtrained part, is likewiſe of uſe. It helps to reſtore the proper tone of the veſſels, and prevents the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts from encreaſing the diſeaſe. It ſhould not however be applied too tight. I have frequently known bleeding near the affected part, in violent ſtrains, have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good effect.</p>
                        <p>BUT what we would recommend above all things for a ſtrain is <hi>eaſe.</hi> It is more to be depended upon than any medicine, and ſeldom fails to remove the complaint.</p>

                        <p>ULCERS may be the conſequence of wounds, bruiſes, or tumours, improperly treated; but they generally proceed from an ill ſtate of the humours, or what may be called a bad habit of body.</p>

WHEN this is the caſe they ought not to be haſtily dried up, otherwiſe it may prove fatal to the patient. Ulcers happen moſt commonly in the decline of life; and perſons who neglect exerciſe and live full, are moſt liable to them. They might often be prevented by retrenching ſome part of the ſolid food, or by opening artificial drains, as iſſues, ſetons, or the like.</p>
                        <p>AN ulcer may be known from a wound by its diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thin watery humour, which is often ſo acrid as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and corrode the ſkin; by the hardneſs and perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular ſituation of its ſides or edges, and by the time of its duration, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>IT requires conſiderable ſkill to be able to judge when an ulcer ought to be healed, and when not. In general, all ulcers which proceed from a bad habit of body ſhould be ſuffered to continue open at leaſt till the conſtitution be ſo far changed by proper regimen, or the uſe of medicine; that they ſeem diſpoſed to heal of their own accord. Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which are the effect of malignant fevers, or acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, may generally be healed with ſafety after the health has been reſtored for ſome time. The cure ought not however to be attempted too ſoon, nor at any time without the uſe of purging medicines and a proper regimen. When wounds or bruiſes have by wrong treatment, degenerated into ulcers, if the conſtitution be good, they may generally be healed with ſafety. Whenulcers either accompany chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diſeaſes, or come in their ſtead, they muſt be cautiouſly healed. If an ulcer conduces to the patient's health, it ought never to be healed; but if, on the contrary, it waſtes the ſtrength, and conſumes the patient by a ſlow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ever, it ſhould be healed as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                        <p>WE would earneſtly recommend a ſtrict attention to theſe particulars, to all who have the misfortune to labour under this diſorder, as we have frequently known people throw away their lives by the want of it, while they were extolling and generouſly rewarding thoſe whom they ought to have looked upon as their murderers.</p>
                        <p>THE moſt proper regimen for promoting the cure of ulcers, is to avoid all ſpices, all ſalted and high ſeaſoned food, all ſtrong liquors, and to leſſen the uſual quantity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="362" facs="unknown:012338_0366_0F88EE1780C2A038"/>
ſhould take as much exerciſe as he can eaſily bear.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the bottom and ſides of an ulcer ſeem hard and callous, they may be ſprinkled twice a day with a little red precipitate of mercury, and afterwards dreſſed with the yellow <hi>baſilicon</hi> ointment. Some chuſe to have the edges of the ulcer ſcarified with a lancet; but this operation ought to be performed by a ſurgeon.</p>
                        <p>LIME-WATER has frequently been known to have very happy effects in the cure of obſtinate ulcers. It may be uſed in the ſame manner as directed for the ſtone and gravel.</p>
                        <p>MY late learned and ingenious friend, Dr Whytt, ſtrongly recommends the uſe of a ſolution of the corroſive ſublimate of mercury in brandy, for the cure of obſtinate ill conditioned ulcers. I have frequently found this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, when given according to the Doctor's directions, prove very ſucceſsful; but it ſhould never be adminiſtred without the greateſt care. It is made by diſſolving four grains of the corroſive ſublimate of mercury in eight ounces of the beſt French brandy. The doſe is a table-ſpoonful night and morning; at the ſame time waſhing the ſore twice or thrice a-day with it. In a letter which I had from the Doctor a little before his death, he informs me, "That he obſerved waſhing the ſore thrice a-day with a ſolution of trible ſtrength was very uſeful." This me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ought always to be prepared with the greateſt care, and ought never to be adminiſtred but under the eye of ſome perſon of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        <p>BOILS are generally the efforts of Nature to expel noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours out of the body. Their ſuppuration ought therefore by all means to be promoted. I do not remember ever to have ſeen one inſtance of the conſtitution being hurt by them, but have often known it greatly mended, eſpecially when care was taken to promote a full and free ſuppuration.</p>
                        <p>IMPOSTHUMES may proceed from the uſe of traſhy fruits, or any other unwholeſome food, from hunger, exceſſive labour, or the like. They are attended with acute pain, hardneſs, redneſs of the part, and all the ſymptoms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation.</p>
                        <p>BLEEDING and purging will ſometimes diſcuſs theſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours at the beginning; but as ſoon as it is evident that
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:012338_0367_0F88EE1928344068"/>
matter is collecting, it will be proper to apply a poultice of bread and milk, with a little oil or freſh butter. This may be renewed twice a-day; and if the ſuppuration goes ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, a raw onion may be cut into ſmall pieces, or bruiſed in a mortar, and ſpread upon the top of the poultice. This will promote the ſuppuration more in one day than a ſimple poultice will do in three or four.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the boil turns ſoft, appears of a white or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh colour, and is quite full of matter, if it does not break of itſelf, it ſhould be opened with a lancet. This operation is no ways dangerous, and is very little painful, as the ſkin is very thin and greatly diſtended. If no other inſtrument be at hand, it may be opened with a large needle; but it is always better to make uſe of a lancet or ſome inſtrument that will make a pretty large wound, in order that the matter may be diſcharged freely.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the impoſthume has broke, or been opened, it may be dreſſed twice a-day with yellow <hi>baſilicon</hi> ointment, ſpread upon lint, or a bit of ſoft rag. It will ſtill however be proper to keep the poultice applied to it, till ſuch time as the matter be entirely diſcharged. After the matter has been diſcharged, the patient ought to be purged.</p>
                        <p>WHEN boils return frequently, it ſhews a bad ſtate of the humours, and merits particular attention. The patient ought to be peculiarly attentive to his diet, and, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe proceeds from any error in it, it ſhould be changed as ſoon as poſſible. Repeated purges are generally neceſſary in the caſe; and infuſions of the bitter plants, as water-trefoil, camomile-flowers, &amp;c. ought to be drank freely. Thoſe who are able to afford it, ſhould take a courſe of the purging mineral waters.</p>

                        <head>OF WHITLOWS.</head>
                        <p>A <hi>whitlow</hi> is a painful tumour appearing near the end of a finger, the humour of which is often ſo ſharp as to corrode the tendons and nerves, and ſometimes even the bone itſelf.</p>
                        <p>THESE tumours ſometimes proceed from the puncture of a ſharp body, as a thorn, a pin, a ſplinter, or the like. But their moſt general cauſes, as was formerly obſerved, are ſudden changes from cold to heat, or the contrary. Hence the diſeaſe is very common among milk-maids, eſpecially at that ſeaſon of the year when they go a milking in a cold
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:012338_0368_0F88EE1A2AB89988"/>
nipping froſty morning, and, as ſoon as they get home, plunge their hands into warm water, or hold them near the fire.</p>
                        <p>THE pain of a whitlow is commonly ſo great, as to render the patient exceeding reſtleſs. It is attended with an inflammation and often with an evident pulſation. When the humour lies deep, the inflammation ſpreads over the whole hand, and ſometimes it extends up the arm even to the ſhoulder. The pain, inflammation, and fever have ſometimes been ſo violent, in this caſe, as to prove mortal.</p>
                        <p>MANY things are recommended for diſcuſſing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation; as bleeding, bliſtering, the patient, the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> vinegar, dipping it frequently in ſcalding-hot water, and ſuch like. Theſe may ſometimes ſucceed at the beginning, but they do no good afterwards. The ſafeſt courſe is to promote the ſuppuration, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cataplaſms, or poultices of bread and milk, with boiled camomile flowers. Or, if a more active and ripening poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be neceſſary, the white lilly-root, or a little honey may be added; but theſe ſhould not be applied till there be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſigns of a ſuppuration.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the inflamation and fever run very high, it will be neceſſary to bleed the patient, and to keep him upon a low diet, allowing him to drink freely of diluting liquors.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the matter is lodged deep, it is not ſafe to wait till the tumour breaks and diſcharges itſelf. In this caſe the matter muſt be let out by making a deep inciſion, otherwiſe it will corrode and deſtroy the bone. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration ſhould always be performed by a ſurgeon if one can be had. I have frequently ſeen one bone of the finger loſt by the matter remaining too long in contact with it. Indeed whenever the inflammation beings very deep, it is hardly poſſible to ſave the bone.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the tumor has burſt, or been laid open, it may be dreſſed with the yellow <hi>baſilicon</hi> ointment, or ſome other digeſtive, and a poultice applied over it. If proud fleſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, it may be kept down by ſprinkling a little burnt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum over it.</p>
                        <p>IF any ſymptoms of a gangrene or mortification appear, as a black, pale or lived colour of the parts, &amp;c. the patient muſt have immediate recourſe to the bark, a dram of which muſt be taken every two or three hours. The part muſt alſo be ſcarified, and fomented with a ſtrong decoction of the bark, or camomile flowers; to which ſome ſpirit of ſea-ſalt or ſtrong vinegar, may be added.</p>
                        <p>

As whitlows and mortifications of the extremities are often the effects of violent cold, we would adviſe people who have been expoſed to an exceſſive degree of it, if their hands or feet are greatly benumbed, to waſh them in cold water, or rub them, for ſome time with ſnow, and to keep at a diſtance from the fire. This would not only prevent whitlows, but is the only method of reſtoring frozen limbs, and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a mortification from extreme cold.</p>

                        <head>OF RUPTURES.</head>
                        <p>THIS diſeaſe happens moſt frequently to children and old people. Men are greatly more liable to it than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, eſpecially thoſe who are naturally of a weak and relaxed habit. In infants it is generally occaſioned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive crying, violent coughing, repeated efforts to vomit, &amp;c. In adults it is commonly the effect of blows, violent exertions of the ſtrength, as leaping, carrying great weights, &amp;c. An oily or very moiſt diet, by inducing a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the ſolids, is commonly thought to prediſpoſe the body to ruptures.</p>
                        <p>ON the firſt appearance of a rupture in an infant it ought to be laid upon its back, with its head very low. While in this poſture, if the gut does not return of itſelf, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be put up by gentle preſſure. After it is returned, a piece of ſticking plaſter may be applied over the part, and a proper truſs or bandage muſt be conſtantly worn for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. The method of making and applying theſe rupture-bandages for children is pretty well known. The child muſt, as far as poſſible, be kept from crying, and from all violent motion, till the rupture is quite healed.</p>
                        <p>IN adults, when the gut has been forced down with great violence, or happens, from any cauſe, to be inflamed, it is often very difficult to return it, and ſometimes quite impracticable without an operation which it is not our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to deſcribe. As I have been fortunate enough how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever always to ſucceed in my attempts to return the gut, without having recourſe to any other means than what are in the power of every man, I ſhall very briefly mention the method which I generally purſue. After the patient has been bled, he muſt be laid upon his back, with his head very low, and his breech raiſed high with pillows. In this ſituation flannel-cloths wrung out of a decoction of mallows and camomile-flowers, or, if theſe are not at hand,
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:012338_0370_0F88EE1BAD6F60D0"/>
of warm water, muſt be applied for a conſiderable time. A clyſter made of this decoction, with a large ſpoonful of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a little ſalt, may be afterwards thrown up. If theſe ſhould not prove ſucceſsful, recourſe muſt be had to preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. If the tumour be very hard, conſiderable force will be neceſſary; but it is not force alone which ſucceeds here. The operator, at the ſame time that he makes a preſſure with the palms of his hand, muſt with his fingers conduct the gut in by the ſame aperture thro' which it came out. The manner of doing this can be much eaſier conceived than deſcribed. Should all theſe endeavours prove ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, clyſters of the ſmoke of tobacco muſt be tried. Theſe have been often known to ſucceed where every other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ailed.</p>
                        <p>AN adult, after the gut has been returned, muſt wear a ſteel-bandage. It is needleſs to deſcribe theſe, as they are only to be had from the artiſts who make them. They are generally uneaſy to the wearer for ſome time, but by cuſtom they become quite eaſy. No perſon who has had a rupture after he arrived at man's eſtate, ſhould ever be without one of theſe bandages.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who have a rupture ought carefully to avoid all violent exerciſe, carrying great weights, leaping, running, and the like. They ſhould likewiſe avoid windy aliment and ſtrong liquors; and ſhould carefully guard againſt catching cold.</p>

                        <head>OF CASUALTIES.</head>
                        <p>AS it is often impracticable to obtain even the ſmalleſt degree of medical aſſiſtance in many of thoſe accidents which endanger life, we ſhall conclude with a few obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon ſome of the moſt common and hazardous of them.</p>
                        <p>THE firſt we ſhall name is <hi>the ſtoppage of ſubſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mouth and the ſtomach.</hi> Though accidents of this kind are unavoidable, yet, generally ſpeaking, they are the effect of careleſſneſs. Children have a ſtrong inclination to put every thing in their mouths which they get hold of. This ought to make nurſes careful in keeping every thing from them that they can ſwallow, which would be hurtful. Even adults are far leſs careful in this reſpect than they ought to be. Nothing ſhould ever be held in the mouth which it would be dangerous to ſwallow, as a fit of cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:012338_0371_0F88EE1CA7FA2568"/>
or ſome other accident, may force it over. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the numberleſs accidents which are daily occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by holding pins in the mouth, many women have their mouths, for the moſt part, full of them through the day; and ſome of them even ſleep with them there all night.</p>
                        <p>WHEN a pin, or any other ſharp body is ſwallowed, it will generally deſcend into the ſtomach, if its head, or blunt end goes foremoſt; but if the point goes foremoſt, it is apt to ſtop, and when that happens, every effort to force it down will only ſerve to fix it faſter in. In this caſe the beſt way is to make the patient vomit, either by tickling his throat with a feather, or giving him a vomit. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known pins which had ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>uck in the gullet for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, brought up by ſwallowing a bit of tough meat ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſtrong thread, and drawing it quickly up again.</p>
                        <p>ALL hard or ſharp ſubſtances, which might hurt or wound the bowels, ought, if poſſible, to be diſcharged upwards. Subſtances that will diſſolve in the ſtomach, if they cannot be brought up, may be puſhed down. When a mouthful of ſolid food ſtops in the gullet, it may often be forced up by giving the perſon a blow on the back betwixt the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If this ſhould not ſucceed, the throat may be tickled with the finger or a feather. I lately ſaw a halfpenny, which had ſtuck faſt in the gullet of a boy about eight years old, thrown up by only thruſting a finger down his throat.</p>
                        <p>PERSONS who have the misfortune to fall into the water are often given up for dead, when it is certain they might, by proper care, be recovered. The great intention which ſhould be kept in view is to reſtore the natural <hi>warmth</hi> and renew the <hi>circulation</hi> and <hi>breathing.</hi> Tho' cold is by no means the cauſe of the perſon's death, yet it will prove an effectual obſtacle to his recovery. For this reaſon, after ſtripping him of his wet cloaths, if he had any on when the accident happened, his body muſt be ſtrongly rubbed for a conſiderable time with coarſe linen cloths as warm as they can be made. As ſoon as a bed can be got ready, and well heated, he may be laid in it, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The moſt proper part for this operation is in the jugular vein, both becauſe it is moſt likely to bleed, and affords the moſt ſudden relief to the head.</p>

IN order to renew the breathing, a ſtrong perſon may blow his own breath into the patient's mouth with all the force he can; or, what will ſucceed better, the ſmoke of tobacco may be blown into the lungs, by means of a pipe or funnel. I have known a pig drowned and reſtored to life, two or three different times ſucceſſively, by blowing air into its mouth with a pair of bellows. It will likewiſe be proper to throw up the ſmoke of tobacco into the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, in form of a clyſter, by means of a proper pipe. Strong volatile ſalts ought alſo to be applied to the noſe, or ſpirits of hartſhorn, burnt feathers, &amp;c. The noſe ought likewiſe to be tickled with a feather dipped in volatile ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and warm ſpirits of wine ſhould be rubbed upon the temples, pit of the ſtomach, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>IF theſe do not ſucceed, the perſon may be put into a warm bath, or laid among warm aſhes. Dr T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>TO enjoy good health is better than to command the world, ſays a celebrated practical philoſopher<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Evremond.</note>, who underſtood the uſe and value of life and health better than moſt men; for in exile, with a ſmall income, and no very good conſtitution, he cultivated an uncommon length of days into a rational ſeries of pleaſures; and what is much more, an uninterrupted courſe of happineſs. But, as far as I can find, he was almoſt the only man that did ſo. The generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of men ſeem to me not to beſtow a thought upon either, till it be too late to reap the benefit of their conviction; ſo that health, like time, becomes valuable only when it is loſt; and we can no longer think of it but with retroſpect and regret.</p>
                  <p>THAT men in good health, the young and gay in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, ſhould be negligent of it, or abuſe it, refuſing to ſtop and liſten to, or take warning from others, is no great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but it is very ſuprizing that mankind in general ſhould be miſtaken and miſled forever in the ſame perpetual round of fruitleſs attempts to repair and eſtabliſh it; not the ignorant vulgar only, but the ſenſible, the judicious, men of parts and knowledge in other things, in this caſe equally blind, ſhould purſue, with the ſame vain hope, after repeated diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the thouſand and ten thouſand idle arts and tricks of medication and quackery.</p>
                  <p>IT has been of great diſſervice, as well as diſcredit to the art of Phyſic, and every fair practiſer of it, that men's expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have been raiſed by the ignorant and preſuming, or the diſhoneſt and artful, to hope for too much from it, more than it ever did, or can do. Reſpite and relief may be had in moſt chronic caſes; remedy, I fear, but in very few, if it be expected from art alone. But a ſkilful and honeſt phyſician (unleſs he be ſent for too late and diſmiſſed too ſoon, which is generally the caſe) will employ thoſe intervals of relief to introduce the powers of life and nature to act for themſelves,

and inſenſibly withdrawing, all his medicines, and watching carefully over his patient's whole conduct, leave him confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from conviction of their neceſſity, in ſuch good and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary habits as cannot fail to eſtabliſh his health for life.</p>
                  <p>POSSIBLY, if men were better informed of the real cauſes of their diſeaſes, they might be leſs unreaſonable in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and learn to be contented with preſent relief, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with patience to that plan of life which alone can lead them to, and preſerve them in, permanent health. With this view of engaging men's attention to their own happineſs, and undeceiving them in their vain and groundleſs hopes of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and diverting them from the deluſions of art to the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, I have ventured to publiſh the following Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which I muſt beg the Reader to conſider as, what it really is, a haſty extract of a much larger work, intended to take in the whole circle of Chronic Diſeaſes, here comprehended only in their repreſentative the Gout. If what I have ſaid may ſeem to want farther illuſtration, or more demonſtrative proof, he will look upon it only as a ſketch to furniſh hints for his own thoughts and reflections, either to improve mine or reject them entirely, as may ſeem good unto him. If he thinks, from what I have ſaid here, or in the <hi>brochure</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that I mean to impeach the practice of phyſic in general; I ſay that it is not my intention. I would decry all quacks, from AEſculapius to the preſent, either as ignorant fools, or ſelf-convicted impoſtors, advertiſing daily lies, whether mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſtages, or riding in chariots. But the art of phyſic fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and honeſtly practiſed I honour as the firſt of profeſſions, comprehending the moſt uſeful, the moſt extenſive and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal knowledge of nature. I think a real Phyſician the moſt liberal of characters upon earth; by which I do not mean every Doctor that goes about taking guineas, but him who will neither flatter the great nor deceive the ignorant, and who would prefer the ſatisfaction of making one invalid a healthy man, to the wealth of <hi>Radcliff</hi> or the vogue of <hi>Ward.</hi> But there is an evil ſpirit of quackery gone forth, that has poſſeſſed all orders of men among us. I would lay it, if I could, together with every demon of ſuperſtition and error, and reſtore the world to truth and nature.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE long had it in my mind to write upon chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in general, in the hope of giving mankind, what moſt aſſuredly they have never yet had, a few rational ideas about them; thinking that, if the true original cauſes of them were fully and fairly ſet forth, men could not be ſo capitally miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to impute them, as they do, to the falſe and imaginary, and therefore apply falſe and imaginary remedies; nor think that the general health of mankind were to be overſet by every trifle, and the recovery of it lay hid in a few drops or powders of any kind. Did they better underſtand the nature of chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes in general, and whence they proceed, they could not be ſo unreaſonable to think they might live as they liſt with impunity, expecting repeated remedy from art; or, did they know any thing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hat there is no ſuch thing? How can it be, when different degrees of the very ſame diſeaſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire various means and methods, and the ſame thing that in one degree would relieve, or perhaps cure, in another might kill? It is by plan, by regimen, and ſucceſſive intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that diſeaſes muſt be cured, when they are curable; or relieved and palliated when they are not. The ſkilful in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and learned in nature, know well that health is not to be eſtabliſhed by medicine; for its effects are but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and the frequent repetition of it deſtructive to the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt frames; that if it is to be reſtored, it muſt be by gently calling forth the powers of the body to act for themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing gradually a little more and more activity, choſen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and, above all, peace of mind, changing intirely that courſe of life which firſt brought on the diſeaſe: medicine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating a little. That this is the truth, all who know any thing of nature or art muſt know: and I may ſafely take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſay, that, though I firmly believe health may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in moſt caſes that are not abſolutely mortal, I am very ſure that no invalid was ever made a healthy man by the mere
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012338_0378_0F88EE2508B42640"/>
power of medicine. If this be the caſe, how muſt the initiated, according as their humanity is touched, either laugh at or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the poor fooliſh world, ſurrendering at diſcretion to the moſt ignorant of quacks, pretending to infalliable remedies which are not in nature. But what is ſtill more ridiculous, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's themſelves are often ſo aſhamed to own they have been deluded, that they favour the cheat, by pretending to relief which they never felt.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE collected a few materials for this work which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to put in order, as ſoon as I can find time and induſtry enough to ſet about it in earneſt; and, if I can finiſh it to my own ſatisfaction, perhaps I may ſome time or other trouble the world with it. At preſent I think myſelf particularly called upon to ſay ſomething of the gout, as that diſeaſe was to make a conſiderable part of my plan; and, as I ſee now ſo many, and hear of more, who are throwing away, not only their money very fooliſhly, but, as I verily believe, the future health of their lives alſo, in hopes of a medical cure for it, to ſhew that ſuch hopes are chymerical, and contradictory to every idea of true philoſophy and common ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>I SHALL therefore take a few extracts from this general plan, ſufficient to ſhew the real original cauſes of all chronic diſeaſes; which, though they have been multiplied without end, and numberleſs cauſes been aſſigned them, are certainly not many, and their firſt cauſes very few. I think they may very fairly be reduced to theſe three: Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation.</p>
                  <p>FROM one or more of theſe three cauſes, I have undertaken to prove that all or moſt chronic diſeaſes are produced; for different diſeaſes may have the ſame original cauſe, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence proceeding from the various degrees of ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor in bodies; ſo that what would be gout in one, in another might be rheumatiſm, ſtone, colic, jaundice, palſy, &amp;c. The gout is manifeſtly, and I think confeſſedly, a diſeaſe of the beſt conſtitution, and may therefore fairly ſtand as a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of all the reſt: as ſuch I ſhall conſider it for the preſent, and ſpeak of theſe cauſes in their order: but it may be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſay a word or two of the gout itſelf before we enquire into its cauſes.</p>
                  <p>THE gout is ſo common a diſeaſe, that there is ſcarcely a man in the world, whether he has had it or not, but thinks he knows perfectly what it is. So does a cook-maid think ſhe knows what fire is as well as Sir Iſaac Newton. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeem needleſs at preſent to trouble ourſelves about a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to ſay what it is: but I will venture to ſay what I am
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012338_0379_0F88EE25ADEF4AE8"/>
perſuaded it is not, though contrary to the general opinion. It is not hereditary, it is not periodical, and it is not incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>IF it were hereditary, it would be neceſſarily tranſmitted from father to ſon, and no man whoſe father had it could poſſibly be free from it: but this is not the caſe, there are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to the contrary: it is therefore not neceſſarily ſo; but the father's having it inclines or diſpoſes the Son to it.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, to produce it; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, as this operates more or leſs, ſo will the gout be. Our parents undoubtedly give us conſtitutions ſimilar to their own, and, if we live in the ſame manner they did, we ſhall very probably be troubled with the ſame diſeaſes; but this by no means proves them to be hereditary: it is what we do our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that will either bring them on, or keep us free.</p>
                  <p>IF it were hereditary, it would appear in infancy and in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which in general it does not. I may be told of ſome women who have had it. I believe never very young, nor till they had contributed to it themſelves; for women, as well as men, may abuſe a good conſtitution. I have heard likewiſe of a boy or two out of a million that had it, or ſomething like it; but theſe boys have been ſuffered to ſip wine very early, and been fed and indulged every way moſt unwholeſomely.</p>
                  <p>No diſeaſes are hereditary but thoſe of taint or infection, and maleformation; the gout is none of theſe, and therefore is not hereditary.</p>
                  <p>IF the gout be a diſeaſe of indigeſtion, and therefore of our own acquiring, we muſt reaſon very ill, or rather not reaſon at all, when we ſay it is hereditary; for ſurely no man will ſay that indigeſtion is hereditary, any more than intemperance. There are whole nations of active people knowing no luxury, who for ages have been free from it, but have it now ſince the Europeans have brought them wine and ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>IF the gout be thought hereditary becauſe it is incurable by medicine, the ſame may be ſaid of every other chronic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, none of which ever are cured by it, I mean, ſo as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again. When was there a man who, having had one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it of rheumatiſm, ſtone, colic, &amp;c. however happily relieved by art for a time, had it not again and again, or ſomething worſe in the place of it; till he became a confirmed invalid, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long before his time; unleſs ſome very remarkable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took place in the courſe of his life to confirm his health?
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012338_0380_0F88EE27500EFA28"/>
So it is in the gout: a man gets a fit of it, and by abſtinence, patience, time and nature, the crude acrimony producing it is ſubdued and exhauſted, and he is relieved for that time; (he might be ſo much ſooner, and very ſafely too, by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of art, judiciouſly employed) he recovers however, and in a few months is taken again. Why? Not from any thing inherent in his conſtitution, but becauſe he returned to his former habit of life that produced it at firſt, and will forever produce it, while the ſtrength of his body laſts.</p>
                  <p>THE truth is, we breed it at firſt, we renew it again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and bring it on ourſelves by our own miſtakes or faults, which we would fain excuſe by throwing them back upon our parents, that our complaints may be more juſtly founded. And as bankrupts, undone by idleneſs and extravagance, for ever plead loſſes and misfortunes; ſo do we inheritance to excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>IT is natural enough for thoſe who believe the gout here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary to think it alſo periodical, as if ſomething innate and inherent in our conſtitutions produced it at certain times: but this is a great miſtake; for, if it were periodical, it muſt be regularly ſo. The only periodical diſeaſe I know is the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent fever, which, till it be diſturbed by the bark or any other febrifuge, is as regular as a good clock. The returns of the gout are always very uncertain, according to the quantity or quality of accumulated indigeſtion within, and the ſtrength of our bodies.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſhew that the gout is not incurable. If by the cure of the gout be meant the adminiſtering a pill or a powder or medicine of any kind to do it, I fear the gout is and ever will be incurable. It has been long and often attempted in vain, from the origin of phyſic to this day, from the firſt quack to the preſent. Indeed there is a moſt glaring abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at firſt ſight, that muſt ſtop any man of common ſenſe, who has the leaſt inſight into nature, or knowledge of the human frame: for if the gout be the neceſſary effect of intemperance, as I hope to ſhew very evidently that it is, a medicine to cure it muſt be ſomething that will enable a man to bear the daily intemperance of his future life unhurt by the gout or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſe; that is, ſomething given now that will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the effect of a future cauſe. As well might a medicine be given now to prevent a man's breaking his leg or his neck ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years hence. One would think the utmoſt that any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal man could expect from medicine was, that it ſhould have power to relieve and quite remove preſent diſorders, leaving the body free, without pretending to inſure it from further inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012338_0381_0F88EE27AB320B60"/>
Here lies the error: men think the gout to be ſomething latent in the body now, which, once well eradicated would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return; not ſuſpecting it to be no more than each days indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion accumulated to a certain pitch; that, as long as the vigor of life laſts, always brings on every fit, which once well over, the man has no more gout nor ſeeds of gout in him than he who never had it; and, if he did not breed it again, moſt certainly would never have it again. A proof of this is, that the gout has often been cured by a milk diet, which, as long as it laſted, has generally kept the patient free. But this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of cure I cannot approve, becauſe it relaxes and enervates the man, and does not ſufficiently ſupport the health and vigor of his body.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH I think the gout incurable by medicine, it is ſo far from being incurable in its nature, that I am firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it may be more eaſily and more perfectly cured than almoſt any other chronic diſeaſe; and this is another ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that proves it not hereditary. My reaſon is, that it is confeſſedly a diſeaſe of the ſtrongeſt and beſt conſtitution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving itſelf by throwing off harſh and bad humours from the vitals and out of the blood upon the extremities, where they do leaſt harm to the powers and principles of life and health; and as theſe humours can be nothing more than the daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulations of indigeſtion, if a man can live without breeding-conſtantly this indigeſted acrimony, he may moſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live free not only from the gout, but every other chronic diſeaſe alſo. And that he may live ſo, not in a perpetual ſtate of mortification and ſelf-denial, but with great eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to himſelf, in the trueſt, moſt philoſophic luxury, I ſhall endeavour to prove, I hope to the ſatisfaction of all thinking reaſonable men.</p>
                  <p>I have ſaid that Indolence. Intemperance, and Vexation, are the original cauſes of all or moſt of our chronic diſeaſes: perhaps a few accidents muſt be excepted, to which the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and healthieſt are moſt liable, and the effects of fevers not happily ended; and which I except, to obviate all cavil and diſpute with the men of art. I believe, to every conſiderate man, whoſe eyes have been opened ſo as to give him the leaſt inſight into nature, the truth of this propoſition will be ſo ſelf-evident, that he muſt inſtantly perceived it; and every invalid that will be candid enough to do it, may fairly trace all his complaints up to one or other of theſe cauſes. But it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite ſome explanation to the generality of men, who are ſo ſhort-ſighted as never to look back or forward far beyond the ken of their noſe, and therefore never ſee either diſtant cauſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012338_0382_0F88EE2898360B38"/>
or effects: and when they are ſick ſeldom enquire more than for ſome cold or ſurfeit of yeſterday, and to ſome ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling cauſe impute diſeaſes that laſt for life. An accidental cold or even debauch that happens but ſeldom can have no ſuch effect; and men otherwiſe healthy, living in good habits, ſoon get rid of both. It is the conſtant courſe of life we lead, what we do, or neglect to do, habitually every day, that if right eſtabliſhes our health, if wrong, makes us invalids for life.</p>
                  <p>MEN ignorant of the ways of nature in the production and ſupport of animals, not knowing what ſhe requires to preſerve them in health and vigour to their utmoſt period, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very ſtrange and moſt aſſuredly very falſe ideas of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in general, and ſeem to think every diſeaſe a diſtinct kind of being or thing, and that there are medicines oppoſed to each that will certainly remove and cure it. This makes them ſo ſollicitous to know the name of their complaint, which once aſcertained, they think the remedy not far off. Poor men! Is not the gout ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed? But where is the remedy? Certainly not in the precarious ſkill of preſcribing doctors, or the ſecret of ignorant and enterprizing quacks. They fancy too that there is great variety of conſtitutions, with diſeaſes unavoidably peculiar to each: that certain times of life muſt produce many, and that it is impoſſible to grow old without ſickneſs of ſome kind or other. There is certainly no foundation in nature for any of theſe opinions, nor is there any real eſſential difference of conſtitution, but of ſtrong or weak, and this is produced more by habit than nature. The ſtrong by bad habits will become weaker, and by good the weak ſtronger. But the moſt delicate frames may be as healthy as the ſtrongeſt, for the ſame reaſon that a ſparrow may be as healthy as an elephant. There is no diſeaſe neceſſarily peculiar to any time of life, however the changes into the different ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it may effect the valetudinary. And it is poſſible for men to live to great age without any diſeaſe at all, for many have lived to upwards of an hundred with uninterrupted health.</p>
                  <p>NOT from the natural defects of our conſtitutions therefore, but the abuſe of them, proceed all our chronic diſeaſes. That is, from Indolence, Intemperance, or Vexation.</p>
                  <p>LET us now proceed to enquire what muſt be the neceſſary effects of one or more of theſe cauſes acting daily upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; whether in the ſtrongeſt and moſt vigorous frames it muſt not be the gout; in weaker, rheumatiſm, colic, ſtone, palſy, &amp;c. or any or all of the nervous and hyſterical claſs.</p>

                     <p>IT ſeems to have been the deſign of Providence, that all men ſhould labour, every one for himſelf: that ſome are rich enough to purchaſe the labour of others is a mere accident with regard to individuals, in which the care of Providence appears to be no otherwiſe concerned, than having unequally diſtributed thoſe powers and abilities by which active and fiery ſpirits riſe uppermoſt to preſerve the harmony of ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which ſociety could never exiſt. The rich and great have ſo far forgot this firſt principle of nature, that they renounce all bodily labour as unworthy their condition, and thus ſacrificing health to indulgence and dignity, they do not enjoy thoſe advantages their ſuperior ſtations and fortunes give them; but in happineſs fall often below the labouring hind. I remember to have ſeen a very ingenious little book upon the origin of evil, in which labour is conſidered as a great evil. The agreeable author muſt ſurely mean when it is exceſſive, and urged on to the wearing and waſting the body. In general labour is the firſt principle of good to mankind; I mean the laborious themſelves. Does he mean that it would be better for us all, did the earth ſpontaneouſly bring forth her fruits in ſuch abundance that we ſhould no more labour or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for them than we do for the air, and have nothing to do but baſk in eaſe, and riot in enjoyment? If ſo, I can by no means agree with him; for ſoon, very ſoon, in ſuch a ſtate of things, there would not be one healthy man upon the earth, and the whole race muſt quickly periſh. Indeed, I am afraid, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all our unreaſonable and unphiloſophical complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the utmoſt wit of man can not remove the leaſt evil out of nature, without taking with it all the good. But begging pardon for this little digreſſion, and to come back to my own purpoſe, I think he had been nearer the truth, had he put In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence in its ſtead, which is a ſource of great evil. Nothing undermines the foundation of all our happineſs, the health and vigour of the body, like it, or lays ſuch a train of diſeaſes to come. But I muſt endeavour to ſhew in what manner.</p>
                     <p>IT is upon the minuteſt and almoſt inviſible parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, our beſt health, ſtrength, and ſpirits depend: theſe fine parts, commonly called capillaries, are little pipes or tubes,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012338_0384_0F88EE29F1751260"/>
the extended continuations of the larger blood-veſſels, through which the fineſt parts of the blood muſt conſtantly paſs, not only to keep theſe very ſmall channels always free and open, but alſo that the particles of the blood may in their paſſage be attenuated, broken, and rubbed into globules perfectly ſmooth and round, and eaſily diviſible into ſtill leſs and leſs, till they eſcape the ſight aſſiſted even by the microſcope; which gives ocular demonſtration of this moſt amazingly minute circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have obſerved myſelf, and any curious patient man may ſee with a good microſcope, in the pellucid membrane of any living animal, this ſurprizing minuteneſs. He may ſelect and obſerve one ſingle veſſel, the ſmalleſt of thoſe that convey red blood, many of which would not equal the ſmalleſt hair in ſize, through which the blood may be ſeen paſſing, not like a fluid, but a number of little red ſolid balls puſhing one another on till they come to the extremity or ramification of the veſſel where it divides into two ſtill leſs. There the firſt globule ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a little, and recoiling, is puſh'd on again till it divides into two, and loſing its red colour, paſſes on in the ſmaller pipes fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to receive the circulation of ſerum, lymph, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſtill finer fluids; which being thus prepared, eſcape into a minuteneſs beyond all poſſible obſervation. Now the ſtrength of the heart and arteries alone, in a ſedentary courſe of life, is by no means ſufficient to keep up and perpetuate this motion thro' theſe capillaries, but requires the aſſiſtance and joint force of all the muſcles of the body to act by intervals, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the veins, propel and accelerate the circulation of the whole maſs of blood, in order to force and clear theſe pipes, and to triturate, cribate, and purify the fluid paſſing through, forming every particle of it into a perfect globule, which is the form all the atoms of matter muſt take from much agitation. Without this extraordinary occaſional aid, the little veſſels would, by their natural elaſticity, cloſe up into fibres, or be obſtructed by rough angular particles ſticking in them, and ſtopping all paſſage. Numberleſs evils of the chronic kind, eſpecially all nervous diſeaſes, owe their origin to this cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Accordingly we ſee moſt of thoſe who have liv'd for any time in a ſtate of indolence, grow emaciated and pale by the drying up of theſe fine veſſels; or if they happen to be of a lax habit, having a good appetite, and nothing to vex them, they may be loaded with fat; but they grow pale with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, many of thoſe fine pipes being nevertheleſs cloſed up; ſo that they appear bloated, and their fat unwholeſome, having much leſs blood in their veins than thinner people. Hence we may learn why theſe languid pale perſons upon the leaſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012338_0385_0F88EE2AABFF0408"/>
become ſaint and breathleſs, the blood hurrying through the larger veſſels yet free, and like a croud obſtructing its own paſſage cauſing a dangerous ſuffocation. Or if they have not been long in this ſtate, nor the capillaries yet quite cloſed, they glow, eſpecially young women, with a momentary red, the fine veſſels being for that time expanded. Thus inactivity firſt forms obſtructions in theſe exquiſitely fine parts, upon which the health and vigor both of body and mind depend entirely, and lays the foundation of many diſeaſes to come; which other concomitant circumſtances, ſuch as a violent cold, exceſs of any kind, infection from without, or a particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NOW I would aſk any reaſonable perſon, capable of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this operation of nature with the leaſt glimmering of philoſophy, or even the attention of common ſenſe, and moſt aſſuredly it concerns every man to conſider it well, whether he can conceive it poſſible to ſubſtitute any medicine to be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that ſhall act upon the blood and veſſels like the joint force of all the muſcles of the body, acting and reacting occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally in a regular courſe of moderate daily labor or exerciſe. Unleſs this can be done, I will venture to pronounce that there is no ſuch thing as a laſting cure either for the gout or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chronic diſeaſe. yes, Sir, ſays a common practitioner, cordials, volatiles, bracers, ſtrengtheners, will do this, will keep up an increaſed circulation. Poſſibly they may for a few hours, by doing miſchief for many days: but their action ſoon ſubſides, and the ſtimulus ceaſes; they muſt therefore be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and repeated for life. Woe be to him that takes them, and to him that leaves them off, unleſs it be done with great judgment. While they act, they coagulate the juices and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the whole maſs of blood; and when omitted, the patient muſt feel all the languors and horrors of a crapulary fever after repeated debauch; and muſt have recourſe to them again and again, like a dram-drinker, who cannot bear his exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence but in a ſtate of intoxication. No, art can ever come up to nature in this moſt ſalutary of all her operations.</p>
                     <p>BUT theſe obſtructions from crude particles of the blood, and this inanition of the capillaries, are not all the evils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by indolence. That ſprightly vigor and alacrity of health which we feel and enjoy in an active courſe of life, that zeſt in appetite, and refreſhment after eating, which ſated luxury ſeeks in vain from art, is owing wholly to new blood made every day from freſh food prepared and diſtributed by the joint action of all the parts of the body. No man can have theſe

lightful ſenſations who lives two days with the ſame blood, but muſt be languid and ſpiritleſs. To introduce new juices the old muſt be firſt thrown off, or there will be no room, there will be too great a plethora or fulneſs; the firſt cauſe of diſeaſes in many caſes. In a ſtate of inactivity the old hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours paſs off ſo ſlowly, the inſenſible perſpiration is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, that there is no void to be filled, conſequently by degrees the appetite, which is the laſt thing that decays, that is, the deſire of ſupply, muſt daily diminiſh, and at laſt be totally loſt. Here art can do wonders; it can procure eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations; we can bleed, purge and vomit; but then, to do any good by theſe, the caſe muſt be recent, before the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are vitiated by too long a ſtay in the body, which will be the caſe very ſoon, for they are all in a periſhable ſtate, which makes their daily renewal ſo eſſentially neceſſary to health: but then theſe artificial evacuations diſcharge all alike; the new, the middle, and the old juices; that is, the chyle, the blood, the ſerum, and lymph; and by this indiſcriminate action make ſtrange confuſion in thoſe that remain: whereas in nature's courſe there is a conſtant regular tranſmutation and ſucceſſion, from one ſtate to another; that is, from chyle into blood, and blood into ſerum, and ſo on, till they are all in their turn, like wave impelling wave, having done their office in various ſhapes, elaborated and ground to ſuch a minute ſubtlety and fineneſs, that they paſs off in the vapour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible perſpiration. In a ſtate of indolence they do not paſs off either ſo ſoon or ſo regularly as they ought, becauſe there is not motion, nor conſequently heat enough to thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

This ſhews the virulent acrimony of theſe confined and ſtagnating humours: hence the breath and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, what there is of it occaſionally, of indolent people is never ſweet; and hence in jails, where thoſe noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors are collected and condenſed from crouded wretches lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing in indolence, very malignant and peſtilential fevers ariſe.</p>
                     <p>PERPETUAL bliſters have been often thought, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found, to be ſerviceable in draining off ſome of theſe ſuperfluous juices before they are much corrupted, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a faint reſemblance of nature's action, a little more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

By a vomit or purge the diſcharge is a hundred fold more, but the good obtained not always ſo great, becauſe by theſe the humours are indiſcriminately thrown off, and much more of the new than the old. Many have uſed frequent bleeding to renew their blood, and I have known it anſwer very well to ſome, eſpecially old people who had been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, whom it preſerved to great age; but then it muſt be begun in time, before the whole maſs of humours be vitiated, and continued for life. Is it not ſtrange that men ſhould ſeek and prefer theſe violent artificial methods to the ſimple, eaſy, pleaſant and conſtant action of nature, and chuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THUS indolence muſt inevitably lay the foundation of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſeaſe, and according to the conſtitution and a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant circumſtances will be the kind of the diſeaſe: in the very beſt it may be gout or rheumatiſm; in weaker habits co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, jaundice, palſy, &amp;c. with all of the hyſterical and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal claſs.

But yet even they do not find it anſwer, and for the reaſons which I have juſt given, that we cannot live two days in health and ſpirits with the ſame blood: there muſt be a new daily ſupply of that ethereal part of our food called up to the brain to ſupport its own, as well as the labor of the whole body. By this I mean the moſt elaborated refined part of all our juices which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repairs and nouriſhes the ſmalleſt veſſels and fibres. Whenever this aether fails we muſt neceſſarily feel languor and laſſitude both of body and mind. With this difference, that in wearineſs of the limbs from much action the lees and coarſer parts are thrown off alſo, and the firſt meal and firſt ſleep ſoon ſupplies the defect. In mental labor the feculence remains to obſtruct all appetite; there is no room, and therefore no call for ſupply; the whole man ſuffers and ſinks.</p>

                     <head>Of INTEMPERANCE.</head>
                     <p>I COME now to ſpeak of Intemperance, for Indolence, blunting all our ſenſations, naturally leads us to Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: we want the whip and ſpur of luxury to excite our jaded appetites. There is no enduring the perpetual moping languor of indolence: we fly to the ſtimulating ſenſualities of the table and the bottle, friend provokes friend to exceed and accumulate one evil upon another; a joyous momentary relief is obtained, to be paid for ſeverely ſoon after: the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our horrors increaſe, and in this courſe there is no remedy but repetition. Thus whoever is indolent is intemperate alſo, and partly from neceſſity; and the evils neceſſarily following both theſe cauſes often make the rich and great more wretched than the poor, and the balance of happineſs is held more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually between them; for however other things may be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, happineſs like water always finds its level among men. I wiſh this obſervation might cure theſe of their envy, and teach the others how to enjoy their wealth.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE I return to my ſubject, I fear I muſt make an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for what I am going to ſay, and hope no one will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when I venture to ſay that nine in ten of all the chronic diſeaſes in the world, particularly the gout, owe their firſt riſe to intemperance. Many a good man, who piques himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being the moſt ſober regular creature alive, and never eats but of one or two plain diſhes, as he calls them, nor exceeds his pint of wine at any meal; keeps good hours, and never ſleeps above eight or nine, may be ſurpriſed, if not affronted, to have his diſeaſes imputed to intemperance; which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders as a great crime. And yet he is often ill, ſick in his ſtomach, troubled with indigeſtion, and crippled by the gout. The caſe is, we judge of temperance and intemperance from our own habits, without any juſt idea of either. What we are uſed to do, and ſee others do, we think right, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver go up to nature for our knowledge. The beſt way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what I mean by intemperance, may be to enquire what is nature's law of temperance, and to deviate from that muſt be conſidered as intemperance. And here I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that temperance is a thing of which no Engliſhman has or can have the leaſt idea, if he judges from his own or his neighbours habits. To form ſome notion of it he muſt have ſeen other countries, particularly Spain, Portugal or
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012338_0389_0F88EE2DD91EC558"/>
Italy, and obſerved how men live there. What they call temperance or even tolerable living, with us would be thought downright ſtarving. In this view temperance is local and comparative; but what I mean is natural temperance not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon place or cuſtom (for I do not mean faſting or abſtinence, which can never be ſalutary but after repletion) and we muſt not judge of it from countries where a piece of bad bread and an onion with a draught of water is thought a tolerable meal; nor from our own, where beggars live better than the nobles of ſome countries, and where we riot in the choice of plenty native and exotic every day.</p>
                     <p>To come then to my idea of it, I think there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, determined temperance, to be meaſured by every man's natural unprovoked appetite, digeſtion and conſumption, while he continues in a good ſtate of health, and right habit of life. As long as a man eats and drinks no more than his ſtomach calls for and will bear without the leaſt pain, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, eructation or uneaſineſs of any kind; nor than his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſumes and throws off to the laſt grain; he may be ſaid to live in a very prudent well-regulated ſtate of temperance, that will probably preſerve him in health and ſpirits to great old age.</p>
                     <p>THIS is nature's law: and the reverſe of it, or indeed any great deviation from it, muſt be intemperance. When we eat without appetite, or urge beyond moderate ſatiety, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by incentives of any kind: when we drink without thirſt for the ſake of the liquor; indeed I cannot allow him to be ſtrictly temperate who drinks any wine or ſtrong liquor at all, unleſs it be medicinally, or now and then for the ſake of ſociety and good humor, but by no means every day.</p>
                     <p>Now let us compare this ſimple idea of temperance with the common courſe of moſt men's lives, and obſerve their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs from health to ſickneſs. For I fear we ſhall find but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few who have any pretenſions to real temperance. In ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth we are inſenſibly led into intemperance by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and miſtaken fondneſs of parents and friends wiſhing to make us happy by anticipation. Having thus exhauſted the firſt degrees of luxury before we come to the dominion of ourſelves, we ſhould find no pleaſure in our liberty did we not advance in new ſenſations, nor feel ourſelves free but as we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it. Thus we go on till ſome friendly pain or diſeaſe bids, or rather forces us to ſtop. But in youth all the parts of our bodies are ſtrong and flexible, and bear the firſt loads of exceſs with leſs hurt, and throw them off ſoon by their own natural vigor and action, or with very little aſſiſtance from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial

The man however goes on taking daily more than he wants or can poſſibly get rid of, he feels himſelf replete and oppreſs'd, and his appetite failing his ſpirits ſink for want of freſh ſupply. He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to dainties, ſauces, pickles, provocatives of all ſorts. Theſe ſoon loſe their power; and though he waſhes down each mouthful with a glaſs of wine, he can reliſh nothing. What is to be done? Send for a phyſician. Doctor, I have loſt my ſtomach; pray give me, ſays he, with great innocence and ignorance, ſomething to give me an appetite; as if want of appetite was a diſeaſe to be cured by art. In vain would the phyſician, moved by particular friendſhip to the man, or that integrity he owes to all men, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He would be thought a man void of all knowledge and ſkill in his profeſſion, if he did not immediately, or after a few evacuations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſtomachics, bitter ſpicy infuſions in wine or brandy, vitriolic elixirs, bark, ſteel, &amp;c. By the uſe of theſe things the ſtomach, rouſed to a little extraordinary action, frees it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by diſcharging its crude, auſtere, coagulated contents into the bowels, to be thence forwarded into the blood. The man is freed for a time, finds he can eat again, and thinks all well. But this is a ſhort-liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If he is robuſt, the acrimony floating in the blood will be thrown out, and a fit of gout ſucceeds; if leſs ſo, rheumatiſm or colic, &amp;c. as I have already ſaid. But let us ſuppoſe it to be the gout, which if he bears patiently, and lives moderately, drinking no madei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra or brandy to keep it out of his ſtomach, nature will relieve him in a certain time, and the gouty acrimony concocted and exhauſted by the ſymptomatic fev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I BELIEVE I muſt here explain a little more fully what I mean by provoking the appetite; which I take to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral mode of intemperance among men, for cuſtom has made all kinds of incentives to exceſs ſo common, that thoſe of daily uſe, far from being conſidered in the claſs of intemperance, are by moſt people thought to be not only ſalutary but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and they never ſuſpect the leaſt evil from the common decoraments of the table, ſalt, pepper, muſtard, vinegar; and yet, however extraordinary it may ſeem, I will venture to pronounce that exceſs in any of theſe muſt be doubly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to health; hurtful in themſelves by their acrimony, they provoke the appetite beyond natural ſatiety to receive an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive load, which the ſtomach itſelf would ſoon feel, were it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THESE men may tell me, perhaps, that I have made a mighty fine declamation againſt luxury and intemperance; but what is this to the purpoſe? they deſire not to be told of their faults, not to hear diſagreeable truths which they know already. Have I no art or ſkill to reconcile health and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no remedy, no rare ſecret to repair and reſtore ſenſation and vigor worn to rags? no Medea's kettle to boil anew? If not, do not deſcribe to us a life of moderation, temperance and exerciſe: it is not worth having upon theſe terms. I am aware of the unreaſonable expectations of many, that their demands would riſe high, ſome of them to the impoſſible. At preſent I am only ſetting forth the cauſes; when I come to talk of remedy, I will endeavour to convince them that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial helps they expect are not in nature, but that there are in nature ways and means by which many gouty, broken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, that have been deſpaired of, might be repaired and reſtored to a very deſirable degree of health and enjoyment. But I muſt firſt ſay a word or two to the intemperate or miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the middle claſs of life.</p>

IN England all degrees of men are furniſh'd with the means of intemperance, and therefore it is no wonder that moſt men are intemperate. If they are leſs ſo in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, it is not that they have more virtue, but they want the means: their oppreſſive governments, the precarious ſtate of property, and their ſuperſtitious religion, keep them ſo poor that luxury is not in their power. They have however this advantage from it, that they are much leſs afflicted with chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes than we are. I verily believe there are more gouts in England, than in all the reſt of Europe: a proof that good living is more univerſal. But not to the advocates for this good living do I wiſh to addreſs myſelf; I fear they will be as incorrigible as their ſuperiors in higher and more refined luxury. But there are ſome not intemperate from choice, but example, habit, cuſtom, miſtake, not knowing their daily diet to be unwholeſome and productive of their diſeaſes. To theſe it may be of ſome uſe to have the unwholeſome pointed out, and their choice directed to better things. Men of laborious occupations, who work in the open air, can and do bear great exceſſes and much unwholeſome diet, without much hurt: I never knew a ſick or gouty gardener that was not a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſot. But men of ſedentary trades and buſineſs, ſhopkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all kinds, feel much ſooner and more heavily the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of intemperance or miſtaken choice in their meat and drink. Their firſt care therefore ought to be not to add the diſeaſes of intemperance to thoſe of inactivity, but proportion what they take as well in quantity as in quality to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. But let us ſee how well they do this. They all ſay they live upon plain things, and never indulge in made diſhes; but they will eat heartily of a gooſe or duck, with a large quantity of ſage, onion, pepper and ſalt, a pig with ſimilar preparation, and a hare with higher and more compounded ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. Do they ever eat veal without ſtuffing, or even a leg of mutton without caper-ſauce? If ever they eat a ſteak or a chop, if it is ſometimes without pepper, I believe it is never without pickles, the worſt of all poiſons. They are ſurprized that ſuch meals ſhould riſe on their ſtomachs with flatulence, ſour and bitter hiccups and eructations, which if they did not keep them down with a ſufficient quantity of wine or ſometimes a dram, they would be troubled with all the time of digeſtion. If this method ſucceeds ſo far as to quiet their ſtomachs for the preſent, they go on with it, regardleſs or ignorant of future and diſtant conſequences. Thus are theſe ſharp, harſh, hot and inflammatory things forced out of the ſtomach into the blood, before it has had time to dilute and ſubdue, or reject
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012338_0394_0F88EE35F50136C0"/>
them, and the ſuperfluous load they bring along with them. And thus is laid the foundation of every diſeaſe, that appears when theſe acrid and fiery particles are accumulated in the blood to a certain degree.</p>
                     <p>THERE are others whoſe pretenſions to plain diet may ſeem better founded, but who nevertheleſs eat and are very fond of things unwholeſome, and very unfit for men of ſedentary lives, ſuch as ſalted and ſmoked fleſh and fiſh of all kinds, hams, tongues, heavy flour puddings, toaſted cheeſe, &amp;c. all which are of ſuch hard and indiſſoluble texture, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſſolve well in the ſtomach of a plowman: the ſame ſalt, ſeaſoning, and ſmoke, which harden and preſerve them from putrefaction before they are eaten, keep them from diſſolution afterwards, ſo that they never are digeſted at all; nor is it poſſible any good nouriſhment ſhould ever come from them: the ſalts they contain are indeed melted in the inteſtinal juices, and get into the blood, producing, in the beſt conſtitutions, thoſe tettery, itchy, or ſcaly eruptions, commonly but very erroneouſly called the ſcurvy, which is quite another kind of diſeaſe. To this kind of food is owing the bad health of country people, and their children's rickety heads and limbs, and big and hard bellies.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER capital miſtake many people fall into, who in other reſpects are very moderate in their diet, is, that the fleſh-meat they eat is always over-done; if boiled too much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the juices are loſt; if over roaſted, fried, or broiled, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fire, continued too long, changes the mild animal fleſh into ſomething of another quality; the fat is made bitter and rancid, which fire will always do by the ſweeteſt oil; and the ſcorched outſide of the lean, dry and acrimonious: the leſs therefore all fleſh meat undergoes the power of fire, the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wholeſomer it is. I do not mean by this to recommend the cuſtoms of Cannibals or beaſts of prey, that devour ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals alive: but it may be obſerved, that the firſt are free from our diſeaſes, and the other amazingly ſtrong and vigorous. We may learn this from them at leaſt, that our meat cannot be the wholeſomer for being, as ſome call it, thoroughly done; and that we ſhould learn to like it with ſome of its red juices unſpoiled by the fire. Upon this principle the Engliſh cookery is to be preferred to the French, who ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ew and roaſt to rags; and of Engliſh cookery broiling muſt be the beſt.</p>
                     <p>THIS leads me to another obſervation, which perhaps none but phyſicians, or thoſe who have ſtudied well the nature of man and his aliments, are able to make. It is this: that man being born to devour moſt of the fruits and animals of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012338_0395_0F88EE36AC668420"/>
earth and water, there ought to be a certain proportion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal and vegetable ſubſtances in his food; the animal tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpontaneouſly to putrefaction, the vegetable correcting that tendency from going too far: thus from the due mixture of both qualities reſults that neutral property, equally diſtant from acid as alcali, that is eſſentially neceſſary to produce good blood. This is ſo manifeſt, that whoever will obſerve attentively may ſee, whenever either of theſe prevails in the body, there is ſo ſtrong a deſire and longing for things of the other ſort, as well as pleaſing ſenſation in the palate and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach when they are taken, as plainly indicates the natural want. Let a man have lived long upon fleſh-meat wholly, he will have a more eager appetite for fruit and vegetables; and if kept too long without them, as is the caſe with thoſe who have lived ſome time at ſea, will grow ſick of the real ſcurvy: but if before they are too far gone they reach the land, they will eat the firſt common graſs they can come at with more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidity than a horſe or ox, and be perfectly cured by it. In like manner they who have lived long upon vegetables (which regimen is often preſcribed to invalids, eſpecially in the gout) will have great craving for fleſh meat. We ought to learn from all this to attend diligently to the calls of nature, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the mixture with due proportion, not only that our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals may have the leſs labour in preparing and making our jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fit for nouriſhment, but to prevent the diſeaſes that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the predominancy of either. And here I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the error of moſt men's diet in every claſs of life is, that the acid, crude and auſtere almoſt always abound; not that they do not eat fleſh-meat enough, but they ſpoil it in the preparation and cookery, changing its animal nature into ſomething worſe than vegetable, taking off entirely all its tendency to diſſolution and putrefaction by ſalting, ſmoking, pickling, potting, and preſerving things that in their own ſimple nature would ſoon corrupt and diſſolve; but by theſe preparations are hardened and embalmed to keep for years like mummies. The ſame may be ſaid of every kind of made diſhes; the ſalts, ſpices, hot herbs, and acids with which they are ſeaſoned and compounded, preſerve and harden them to keep for ever: the ſauces and gravies they ſwim in have the ſame effect as ſo much pickle. The things we feed upon ought all to be in a periſhable ſtate, or they will never furniſh the materials of good blood; and whatever is harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſeaſoned ſo as to keep long before it be eaten, ought not to be eaten at all, for it will never diſſolve in the ſtomach.</p>

THE nature of moſt chronic diſeaſes, and their firſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom heartburn, as it is commonly called, plainly ſhew the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal cauſes to be the acid crudity prevailing in the juices; producing coagulations, concretions and obſtructions of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds; all which are very manifeſt in the gout, rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſtone, and moſt nervous caſes: the remedies alſo that ſometimes relieve and palliate, confirm this; ſuch as the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile alcalies, hartſhorn, ſalt ammoniac, teſtaceous powders, ſope, &amp;c. Many may be ſurprized at this, and ſay it cannot be; for, though they have theſe diſeaſes, they take little or no acids: but there are many things they take that are aceſcent, that is, liable to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It may here be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enumerate ſome of thoſe things called aceſcent. Theſe are ſweets of every kind, puddings, cakes, paſtry, creams, confections, &amp;c.

whoever they are that take it conſtantly, is wine: wine alone produces more diſeaſes than all the other cauſes put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. All men allow that wine taken to exceſs is hurtful: they ſee the immediate evils that follow; but diſtant effects, that require more attentive and deducive obſervation, very few ſee or believe; and, judging from preſent and agreeable ſeelings, they ſay that a little wine is wholeſome, and good for every one, and accordingly take it every day, give it their children, and teach them to like it by debauching their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural taſte in the earlieſt infancy: thus they come to reliſh it by habit, and to be uneaſy without it like ſnuff-takers without their tobacco: the want is equally habitual and unnatural in both caſes; for the ſtomach wants wine no more than the noſe does ſnuff: the immediate ſenſation of both, after a little uſe, is pleaſant; but the remote effect of the wine taken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly infinitely more pernicious than of the ſnuff. This hurts the noſe only; the other accumulating a little indigeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every day, corrupts all the juices of the body moſt eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And though it be often taken with a view to promote digeſtion and aſſiſt the operations of the ſtomach, it manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does harm to both. Inſtead of digeſting and diſſolving, it hardens, and prevents diſſolution, and curdles and corrupts the milky chyle and firſt juices produced from our food. It warms indeed and ſtimulates the ſtomach to greater exertion than is natural or neceſſary, and thereby enables it to diſcharge its contents the ſooner; whence that agreeable feel of warmth and comfort from its immediate action. But by this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary action it forces our food out of the ſtomach too ſoon, before it is ſoftened, diſſolved, and properly prepared, and ſends it into the bowels crude, hard, and auſtere, in that caſe to be carried into the blood, there to produce every kind of diſeaſe. Whatever therefore the advocates for a little wine every day may think, or argue in favour of it, they are moſt undoubtedly in a very great error, and it were certainly much better and ſafer to drink a bottle and get a little merry once a week, drinking water only or ſmall beer at all other times: in which interval nature might totally ſubdue it and recover intirely. Water is the only liquor nature knows of or has provided for all animals; and whatever nature gives us, we may depend upon it, is beſt and ſafeſt for us. Accordingly we ſee that when we have committed any exceſſes or miſtakes of any kind, and ſuffer from them, it is water that relieves. Hence the chief good of Bath, Spa, and many other medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal waters, eſpecially to hard drinkers. It is the element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indigeſtions, &amp;c. the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012338_0398_0F88EE38ED1E6270"/>
mineral virtues they contain may make them tolerable to the the ſtomach in their paſſage, but do, as I believe, little more in the body: it is the water that cures. Wine, if it be not one of our own inventions, was given us as a cordial in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wearineſs, ſorrow, and old age, and a moſt ſalutary charm it would be for moſt of theſe evils, did we not exhauſt its power by daily uſe, and inſtead of taking it as ſuch, drink it up as common draught in youth and health to make us mad. I know this is a very tender topic to touch upon, and too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite a pleaſure to argue againſt with any reaſonable hope of convincing; moſt men having ſo indulged themſelves in this bewitching habit, that they think they cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a little wine every day, and their very exiſtence depends upon it; their ſtomachs require it, nature calls for it, St. Paul adviſes it, it muſt be good. Thus men catch at every ſhadow of an argument that favours their inclinations. St. Paul adviſes it as a medicine ſometimes, but certainly not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. There is no medicine I know of, that taken eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, will not either ceaſe to act entirely, or by acting too much do harm. It will be ſaid, that many drink wine every day without gout, ſtone, or any diſeaſe at all in conſequence of it. I believe not many, or I ſhould know ſome of them. If any are ſo ſtrong as to bear it to old age unhurt, they muſt be very active as well as ſtrong to ſubdue it. But I have nothing to ſay to theſe; my buſineſs is with invalids who complain, and certainly ought not to meaſure conſtitutions with thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their match. The ſame arguments will hold equally in favour of every other bad habit. Your noſe will want its ſnuff, your palate its ſpices; and when the faſhion was for women to be ſmall waſted, their galled ſides grown callous by the long impreſſion of the ſtays wanted their ſupport. Nature, like a true female, cries out at the firſt violence, but ſubmits in time, is reconciled, and grows fond of the raviſher. But it is the buſineſs of philoſophers to diſtinguiſh carefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the real wants of nature and the artificial calls of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit; and when we find th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, it cannot well be otherwiſe; for there is nothing ſo repugnant to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral digeſtion as the uſe of theſe ſtrong liquors, which inſtead of diſſolving harden every thing; and thus for ever, when the firſt warmth is gone off, leave a crapulary, crude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I flatter myſelf they will find it well worth their pains, to reaſon a little more than they do with and for themſelves; and it will be a great point gained for them, if it turns their miſled opinions from all that imaginary power of reſtoring health in any of that multitude of ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and moſt truly contemptible medicines, that are daily obtruded upon the public, with endleſs lies to recommend them, by a ſet of the pooreſt, moſt ignorant and paultry rogues in the nation; and engage their attention to their true remedy, a right inſtitution of life.

Inſtantly his appetite is gone, and he can neither eat nor ſwallow a morſel. Let the ſame thing happen after he has made a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty chearful meal, as ſuddenly the action of his ſtomach, the whole power of digeſtion is cut off totally, as if it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come paralytic; and what he has eaten lies a moſt oppreſſive load. Perhaps as the exceſs of weakneſs is often convulſion, it may be rejected with a violent vomit, or do greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. For which reaſon ſuch ſtrokes of diſtreſs are leſs hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful received upon an empty than a full ſtomach. But why is this? what connexion is there between a piece of bad news and a man's ſtomach full or empty? whatever the cauſe be, the effect is certain and invariably. It is becauſe the animal ſpirits, or the action of the nerves, whatever be the ſecret cauſe of their power, is called off to ſupply and ſupport the tumultuous agitation of the brain, and the ſtomach, with all its appendages and their ſecretions, is left powerleſs and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytic, and muſt therefore either act convulſively or not at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>BESIDES this pernicious effect of preventing the natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtomach and inteſtines, the whole circulation of the blood is diſturbed. The contraction and dilatation of the heart, that is, the alternate action by which it opens to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the blood from the veins, and cloſes again to force it out through the arteries; which operation ought to be as true and certain as the vibrations of a pendulum, are broken and uneven: the heart flutters, palpitates; now is overloaded with blood and in danger of ſuffocation, now recieve none at all: conſequently all the ſecretions muſt be as irregular, ſome of the glands receiving too abundant a

ſupply that either hurries through, or oppreſſes and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers them, others none at all. Hence that haſty guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pale limpid urine in amazing quantities, thoſe ſudden burſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of unmeaning tears: ſometimes great dryneſs and choaking thirſt, ſometimes the overflowing of the mouth with water inſtead of ſaliva, and many other nervous and hyſterical affections, fits, ſyncope, epilepſy, &amp;c. All which indicate the greateſt tumults and perturbations in the inmoſt receſſes of the nervous and vital frame. Many kinds of diſeaſes have ſprung from this fountain, of ſuch unaccountable horrid and terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearances, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>IN ſlower, more ſilent, but longer continued grief, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are ſimilar, but not ſo violent. Many little ſtrokes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated will do the ſame thing in time that a great blow does at once. The function of the ſtomach will be more gently diſturbed and preverted, its juices vitiated, and all its contents will for ever turn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The patient muſt languiſh with cahec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic inanition, univerſal bad habit of body, or pine and waſte with atrophy, the want of nouriſhing ſupply; whence ariſe complications of various diſeaſes ſucceeding each other always from bad to worſe: and unleſs he can ſubdue his anxiety, and reſtore peace of mind, he muſt in time ſink under it, and die, as it is ſaid, of a broken heart.</p>
                     <p>WHOEVER vexes long, muſt certainly want nouriſhment; for, beſides the diſturbed ſtate of the ſtomach, it's broken ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and bad digeſtion, from whence what ſupply there is muſt come not only ill-prepared, but vitiated into the blood; there can be no ſleep in this ſtate of mind: the perturbed ſpirit cannot reſt: and it is in ſleep that all nouriſhment is performed, and the finer parts of the body, chaſed and worn with the fatigue of the day, are repaired and reſtored to their natural vigour. While we are awake this cannot ſo well be done; becauſe the inceſſant action of the body or mind being always partial and irregular, prevents that equal diſtribution of the blood to all parts alike, from which each fibre and fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receives that ſhare or portion that ſuits it beſt. In ſleep, when it is quiet and natural, all the muſcles of the body, that is, all its active powers that are ſubject to our will, are lulled to reſt, compoſed and relaxed into a genial temporary kind of palſy, that leaves not the leaſt obſtruction or hindrance

It is no wonder therefore it ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring on a fit of the gout, which, as I have ſaid is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly a diſeaſe of crudity and indigeſtion; and often the gout in the ſtomach and bowels.

Schirrous concretions will alſo be formed in the ſpleen, liver, glands of the meſentery, and throughout the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of the belly. Many of theſe indurated tumors will appear outwardly, ſo as to be felt by the hand; theſe in time will degenerate into cancers and cancerous ulcerations, and many fatal evils, not the leaſt of which, in my opinion, is, that the patient will ſuffer a long time before he dies.</p>
                     <p>ALL the paſſions when they are inordinate may have inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects upon the vital frame: exceſſive joy has ſometimes given a fatal blow, and ſudden burſts of laughter done great miſchiefs, eſpecially to delicate or weakly people, who have often been thrown into ſpaſms, cramps, convulſions, hyſteric fits and haemorrhages by them. But as I think the word Vexation comprehends the chief of thoſe paſſions that hurt us moſt, and mean not to make a metaphyſical enquiry about them, it is needleſs to be particular upon each. It may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to have ſhewn the immediate and remote influence of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon the human body.</p>
                     <p>WHATEVER men may think of their diſeaſes, their ſtrange ſymptoms and appearances, and their unaccountable cauſes, theſe are the three original great ſources of moſt of the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes of mankind; which I have endeavoured to ſet forth and explain in ſo familiar a manner, that I hope I have been perfectly intelligible to every one who will venture to think and judge for himſelf. To ſuch rational people only I addreſs myſelf; and to enable them to do this the better, I have furniſhed theſe hints and obſervations, which may be extended, improved and applied to particular caſes. I want not, nor wiſh to obtrude my ideas upon any man, however warranted I may think myſelf from the obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012338_0403_0F88EE3FB1B5B158"/>
of my whole life: my principal aim has been only to make men ſtop a little in their career, and conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether it may not be poſſible for them to be miſtaken, even in that courſe of diet and thoſe habits of life which they never ſuſpected. If they are ill, and for any time, there muſt be a more ſubſtantial cauſe for it, than they are in general willing to allow. It is not always catching cold, for we do not catch cold ſo often as we think we do; and when a heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy robuſt, perſon takes cold, which can happen but rarely, if this be the whole of the diſeaſe, it cannot laſt long. But the truth is, when the crudity, ſuperfluity and acrimony of an indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, intemperate life have accumulated to ſuch a degree as to make us ſick, then we ſay we have taken cold, or complain of a bad conſtitution, when we have ſpoiled perhaps a very good one; or with Sydenham, that the epedemic conſtitution of the air has infected us, or that this or that trifle has diſagreed. I am fully and firmly perſuaded, that whoever will reflect with ſome degree of intelligence and ſanity, be juſt to himſelf, and candid with his phyſician, will in general be able to trace his complaints and diſeaſes up to one or other of theſe three cauſes. And whoever does this, muſt infallibly ſee how vain and idle all his hopes and expectations of laſting remedy and eſtabliſhed health muſt be from any kind of quack medicines, or indeed the common and too general practice of phyſic, when the whole is reſted upon ſomething given to ſwallow; how ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate the means are to the end propoſed and hoped for; how ill vomiting and purging can ſupply the place of temperance; bleeding bliſtering and all artificial evacuation, of activity; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials and opium, of peace of mind. Is not this to fill the body with harſh and unwholeſome juices, and then tear it to pieces to get them out again? To make artificial holes and ſores in the ſkin to renew the blood and diſcharge ſuperfluities, inſtead of employing muſcular motion to rub off and grind down all the acrimony of angular aculeated particles, and make them ſmooth and round, and eaſily diviſible; and to employ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication and ſtupefaction to take off the ſenſe of pain, and leave the cauſe where it was, or fix it faſter? Can any reſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſon hope for health or long life by any of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural methods, when theſe only are employed? Let him look round among his neighbours and acquaintance; and tell me whether, not only all the gouty, but rheumatic, colicky, jaundiced, paralytic, dropſical people he has ever ſeen, are not either always ſo, or by fits ſo; and whether thoſe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paroxyſms or fits of theſe diſorders do not always grow

worſe and worſe, in ſpite of all their medications and quackery, till a complication or apoplexy comes on, that at laſt, though long before their time, puts an end to their miſerable lives. Theſe evils are conſidered as the inheritance of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unavoidable and incurable, and ſubmitted to in abſolute deſpair; though there has not one rational attempt, that I know of, ever yet been made to remedy them in earneſt. All the methods hitherto employed have only been to relieve, and thoſe often ſo perniciouſly, that the future health has been ſacrificed to obtain preſent relief or eaſe. This muſt for ever be the caſe when in chronic caſes it is obtained by art, and nature has no ſhare; or where the phyſician does all, and the patient nothing for himſelf.</p>

                     <p>HAVING ſet forth the real cauſes of the gout, and all it's congenial diſeaſes. I come now to the moſt eſſential part, to adminiſter all poſſible comfort to thoſe whom great pain and long ſuffering may have made attentive and docile, and willing to take health upon the terms it is poſſible to have it. To the young and voluptuous, who are yet in their career, and declare for a ſhort life and a merry one, I have nothing to ſay but this, that a ſhort life is very ſeldom a merry one; on the contrary, it is generally made up of a few years of riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſure without happineſs, to be ſeverely paid for by as many more of pain and ſickneſs, regret and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>HAVING ſhewn that the gout is not hereditary, not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our conſtitutions, but produced by the daily accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of indigeſted, unſubdued acrimony and ſuperfluity, which, when they abound to a certain degree, muſt end either in a fit of the gout, or ſome other diſeaſe, according to the conſtitution, as long as any vigour is left in the body: for nature will for ever free or endeavour to free itſelf, and purge the blood of its impurities by gout, by fever, by pain of one kind or other, that takes off the appetite, and for a time gives reſpite, and prevents the pouring in of more and more enemies to diſturb it's operation, and make it ineffectual. Thus young people, after a fit of the gout is happily and well gone off, are as free from it, as if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had it; and if they would take warning and be careful not to breed it again, moſt certainly would for ever remain

free. How abſurd therefore, how ridicouſly ignorant muſt be every attempt to cure the gout <hi>in futuro</hi> by medicine, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Can ſuch a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine give ſupernatural ſtrength, and enable an old man living in indolence to digeſt and conſume, or diſcharge the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of his daily intemperance? that is, to give him more vigorous powers than nature gave him at one-and-twenty, or when the gout came firſt upon him. The Duke of Portland's powder promiſed to do ſomething like this, and moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept off the gout for two or three years. But what was it? And what did it really do? It was a ſtrong ſpicy bitter taken in ſubſtance, in a large quantity, for a long time; it's effect was to keep up a conſtant fever as long as it was taken; this kept the gouty matter always afloat, and prevented it's fixing any where. But there was no living long with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fever; accordingly many of thoſe who took it died very ſoon. I myſelf obſerved between fifty and ſixty of it's advocates, ſome my patients, ſome my acquaintance or neighbours, who were apparently cured by it; but in leſs than ſix years time, <hi>omnes ad internecionem caeſi,</hi> they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> died to a man.</p>
                     <p>MANY ſimilar attempts have been made with other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to cure not only the gout, but moſt other chronic diſeaſes, and with the ſame fatal effects. Antimony and Mercury ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated into poiſons by chemiſtry have been adminiſtred, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulary the ſolution of ſublimate has torn many a ſtomach to rags, ſo that it could never bear common food afterwards. The deadly night-ſhade, and hemlock, and many ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful poiſons, have been given as alteratives to reſtore health. The intention here ſeems to be, to kill or cure, to raiſe a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitation or fever in the body, in hopes it may prove ſtrong enough to throw off the diſeaſe and medicine together. The effect has ever been, notwithſtanding a little apparent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful relief may have been perceived from the firſt efforts, that it has ſunk under both loads, and exhauſted by repeated ſtraining, much ſooner than by the diſeaſe alone.</p>
                     <p>CAN any one in his ſenſes ſuppoſe that diſeaſes a man has been his whole life contracting, and to which he is adding every day by perſeverance in unwholeſome diet, and bad ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, are to be thus removed by a <hi>coup de main on de baguette?</hi> or that they will not return, be they cured or conjured away ever ſo often, whilſt he continues the ſame mode of life that brought them on at firſt?</p>
                     <p>WHAT then is to be done? how and in what manner are chronic diſeaſes and cachexies to be cured, and health reſtored and eſtabliſhed? I have already ſhewn that the cauſes of theſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012338_0406_0F88EE41F17B86B8"/>
evils are Indolence, Intemperance, and Vexation; and if there be any truth or weight in what I have ſaid, the remedies are obvious. Activity, Temperance and Peace of Mind. It will be ſaid, the remedies are obvious, but impractible. Would you bid the feeble cripple, who cannot ſtand, take up his bed and walk? the man who has loſt all appetite, abſtain? and the ſleepleſs wretch rack'd with pain enjoy peace of mind? No certainly; I am not ſo abſurd. Theſe muſt be aſſiſted by medicine; and if they have not exhauſted all its power already, a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, a favourable interval may be obtained, that with other artificial aids co-operating, may be greatly improved to their advantage, and if rightly employed they may get on from ſtrength to ſtrength, till they recover into perfect health. But it it is not my deſign at preſent to expatiate upon that particular kind of medical relief which every chronic caſe may require; it would lead me into too wide a field, and too far from my preſent purpoſe, which is to ſhew that the gout, in moſt of its ſtages and degrees, may be cured, a preſent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm or fit relieved, its return for ever ſafely prevented, and the patient eſtabliſhed in perfect health.</p>
                     <p>LET us ſuppoſe the caſe of a man from forty to fifty years of age, who has had at leaſt twenty fits of gout; by which moſt of his joints have been ſo clogg'd and obſtructed, as to make walking or any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ind of motion very uneaſy to him: let him have had it ſometimes in his ſtomach, a little in his head, and often all over him, ſo as to make him univerſally ſick and low-ſpirited, eſpecially before a regular fit has come to relieve him. This I apprehend to be as bad a caſe as we need propoſe, and that it will not be expected that every old cripple whoſe joints are burnt to chalk, and his bones grown together and united by anchiloſis, who muſt be carried from his bed to his table and back again, ſhould be propoſed as an object of medication and cure: and yet even he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps receive ſome relief and palliation in pain, if he has any great degree of it, which is not very common in this caſe. Let us therefore ſuppoſe the firſt example.</p>
                     <p>IF the point be to aſſuage the violent raging of a preſent paroxyſm; this may be ſafely done by giving ſome ſoft and ſlowly-operating laxative, neither hot nor cold, but warm, either in ſmall doſes repeated ſo as to move the patient once on twice in twenty-four hours, or by a larger doſe oftner in leſs time, according to the ſtrength and exigency. This may be followed by a few lenient abſorbent correctors of acrimony or even gentle anodynes: proper cataplaſms may alſo be ſafely applied to the raging part, which often aſſuage pain
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012338_0407_0F88EE42AA98A1F0"/>
ſurprizingly; with as much mild and ſpontaneouſly-diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhment as may keep the ſpirits from ſinking too low: but I would wiſh them to ſink a little, and exhort the patient to bear that lowneſs with patience and reſignation, till nature, aſſiſted by ſoft and ſucculent food, can have time to relieve him. This eaſy method of treating a fit of the gout would anſwer in any age; and if the patient was young and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the pain violent, there could be no danger in taking away a little blood. Thus in two or three days time I have often ſeen a ſevere fit mitigated and made tolerable; and this is a better way of treating it with regard to future conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than bearing it with patience and ſuffering it to take its courſe: for the ſooner the joints are relieved from diſtenſion and pain, the leſs danger there is of their being calcined and utterly deſtroyed. But inſtead of this, the general practice is quite the reverſe. Oh! keep up your ſpirits, they cry; keep it out of your ſtomach at all events; where, whenever it rages in a diſtant part, it is not at all inclined to come. As you cannot eat, you muſt drink the more freely. So they take cordials, ſtrong wines, and rich ſpoon-meats. By urging in this manner, a great fever is raiſed, the pain enraged and prolonged; and a fit, that would have ended ſpontaneouſly in leſs than a week, protracted to a month or ſix weeks and when it goes off at laſt, leaves ſuch obſtruction and weakneſs in the parts, as cripple the man ever after. All this I hope will be fairly and candidly underſtood; for there are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a great variety of gouty caſes, but no caſe that will not admit of medical aſſiſtance judiciouſly adminiſtered.</p>
                     <p>BUT the moſt capital point of all, and what is moſtly deſired by all, is to prevent its return, or changing into any other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and to eſtabliſh health. Moſt men would be very well pleaſed and happy could this be done by any medical trick or noſtrum, with full liberty of living as they liſt, and indulging every appetite and paſſion without controul. Some poor filly creatures, ignorant of all philoſophy and the nature of cauſes and effects, have been led into experiments of this kind by a few artful rogues, very much to the prejudice of their future health, and danger of their lives alſo; expecting from medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine what it never did or can perform alone, the cure of chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>I THINK it needleſs here to take any pains to ſhew the ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of all the common modes of practice, vomiting, purging, bleeding, bliſtering, iſſues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They have been found inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual not only in the gout, but all other chronic caſes. All ſenſible practitioners muſt know their effects to be but temporary,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012338_0408_0F88EE4368306FD8"/>
and that they are meant and uſed only as means of preſent relief. Let us ſee therefore by what practicable plan or regimen the perſon here deſcribed, when a fit of the gout is happily ended, may for ever prevent it's return, and ſo confirm his general health that it ſhall not again be overſet by every ſlight cold or trifling accident.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE already ſhewn that a certain degree of activity or bodily motion is neceſſary at intervals every day, to raiſe the circulation to that pitch, that will keep the fine veſſels open and the old blood pure, and alſo make new from the freſh juices. If the patient cannot be brought to this, he has no chance of recovering to perfect health. If therefore he can neither walk nor ride at all, he muſt by degrees be brought to do both by the aſſiſtance of others, which may be given him in the following manner; Let a handy active ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant or two be employed to rub him all over as he lies in bed with flannels, or flannel gloves, fumigated with gums and ſpices, which will contribute greatly to brace and ſtrengthen his nerves and fibres, and move his blood without any fatigue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">This may ſeem but a trifling preſcription to thoſe who have never tried it ſufficiently, but is of the utmoſt conſequence, and its effects are amazing; eſpecially to all thoſe who are too weak to uſe any muſcular motion themſelves. A little friction may have little or no effect, but long continued, and repeated often, with fumigated flannels, it will do more to recover health, and ſupport it afterwards, than moſt other things or methods. It promote; circulation and perſpiration, opens the pores, forces the fine veſſels, ſtrains and purifies the blood, and this without the aſſiſtance of any internal ſtimulation. It is this that keeps horſes in tolerable health with very little exerciſe.</note>. This may take up from five to ten minutes at firſt, but muſt be repeated five or ſix times a day, ſuppoſing him totally unable to help himſelf. But if he can walk a hundred yards only, it will forward him greatly to walk thoſe hundred yards every two hours, and if he can bear a carriage, let him go out in it every day till he begins to be tired. The firſt day or two all this may diſturb or fatigue him a little; but if he has patience to perſevere to the fourth, I dare promiſe him ſome amendment and increaſe of ſtrength; which he muſt employ, as young merchants do a little money, to get more. Thus he muſt go on rubbing, walking, and riding a little more and more every day, ſtopping always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt ſenſation of wearineſs to reſt a little, till he be able to walk two or three miles at a ſtretch, or ride ten without any wearineſs at all.

Thoſe who are rich among them employ people called Champers to rub, chafe and pat them all over at leaſt twice a day, to move their blood and keep their veſſels free without any labor or exertion of their own powers. This daily practice in hot countries, where they live in the moſt ſlothful indolence, is not only neceſſary to them, but a great luxury. The Greeks and Romans too, when they became luxurious, fell into habits of this kind, and were ſtrigill'd and curried, and bathed and oiled, almoſt every day.</note>.</p>

ſeaſons. But becauſe<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>I have made what enquiries I could upon this capital article from living witneſſes; for I do not always pin my faith upon books, knowing it to be no uncommon thing for authors, inſtead of framing their ſyſtem from obſervation and experience, to wreſt and explain both to ſupport their opinions. I have been aſſured by a phyſician who practiſed above thirty years in Turkey, that from the Danube to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates he never had ſeen a gouty Turk. I have alſo been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſome of our miniſters who had reſided many years in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, that the gout, and other diſeaſes of the ſame claſs, were not uncommon at court; but the courtiers, it ſeems, were not as good Mahometans as thoſe who lived in the country; for they drink wine, drams, liquers of all ſorts, without reſtraint.</p>
                           <p>I have alſo been very credibly informed, that the Gentoos or Marra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, a people of India living in the moſt temperate ſimplicity, chiefly upon rice, have no ſuch thing as the gout or indeed any other chronic diſeaſe among them.</p>
                        </note> wine undoubtedly produces nine in ten of all the gouts in the world, wine muſt be avoided, or taken very ſparingly, and but ſeldom. How is this to be done? Can a man uſed to it every day, who thinks he cannot live without it, and that his exiſtence depends upon it, leave it off ſafely? If he thinks he muſt die of the experiment doing it all at once, he may do it by degrees, and drink but half the quantity of yeſterday till he has brought it to nothing. But the danger of attempting it in this manner is, that it will never be done; and like a procraſtinating ſinner he will forever put off his penitential reſolution till to-morrow. If he did it all once, I would be hanged if he died of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; he would be uneaſy for three or four days, that's all. He may change his liquor, and drink a little good porter, and by degrees come to ſmall beer, the wholſomeſt and beſt of all liquors except good ſoft water. But I do not mean that this rigorous abſtinence from wine is to laſt for life, but only during the conflict with the diſeaſe. As ſoon as he has recovered health and ſtrength to uſe exerciſe enough to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, he may ſafely indulge once a week, or perhaps twice, with a pint of wine for the ſake of good humour and good company, if they cannot be enjoyed without it; for I would not be ſuch a churl as to forbid, or even damp, one of the greateſt joys of human life.</p>
                     <p>If any man ſhould ſay it is better to have a little gout than take all theſe pains, and ſubmit to this diſcipline; this is not the alternative: perhaps it may be more eligible to live at large, and have but a little gout now and then, that goes off well, and leaves no trace behind; but this is very ſeldom the caſe.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012338_0411_0F88EE469D663308"/>
The misfortune is, that a little gout moſt commonly comes again and again more ſeverely, till it becomes a great gout, till it cripples the man, and ſhortens his life at leaſt twenty years, embittering all the latter part of it. If any one thinks this deſcription of it, which is the real ſtate of the caſe nine times in ten, preferable to that gradual exertion of his own powers and ſtrictneſs of regimen, or rather attention to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with very moderate abſtinence or ſelf-denial for a year or two, as here recommended; I have no reply to make him, but muſt give him up to his own choice.</p>
                     <p>The ſeverity of theſe efforts and this abſtemious care need be continued no longer than the diſeaſe or the effects of it remain. When by perſeverance in the practice of them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the medical aids here recommended, the patient ſhall have recovered his ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gth and locomotive powers, he may preſerve and perpetuate them, and his title to longevity, upon the following plan.</p>
                     <p>HE muſt never loſe ſight of the three great principles of health and long life, Activity, Temperance, and Peace of Mind. With theſe ever in view, he may eat and drink of every thing the earth produces, but his diet muſt be plain, ſimple, ſolid and tender, or in proportion to his conſumption; he muſt eat but of one thing or two at moſt at a meal, and this will ſoon bring him to be ſatisfied with about half his uſual quantity: for all men eat about twice as much as they ought to do, provoked by variety: he muſt drink but little of any liquor, and never till he has done eating: the drier every man's diet is, the better. No wine oftener than once or twice a week at moſt; and this muſt be conſidered as a luxurious indulgence. If he be ſometimes led unawares into a debauch, it muſt be expiated by abſtinence and double exerciſe the next day, and he may take a little of my magneſia and rhubarb as a good antidote: or if he cannot ſleep with his unuſual load, he may drink water, and with his finger in his throat throw it up. I have known ſome old ſoldiers by this trick alone, never taking their doſe to bed with them, live to kill their acquaintance two or three times over. One moderate meal a day is abundantly ſufficient; therefore it is better to omit ſupper, becauſe dinner is not ſo eaſily avoided. Inſtead of ſupper, any good ripe fruit of the ſeaſon would be very ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, preventing coſtiveneſs, and keeping the bowels free and open, and cooling, correcting, and carrying off the heats and crudities of his indigeſtion.</p>

HIS activity need be no more than to perſevere in the habit of rubbing all over night and morning for eight or ten mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and walking three or four miles every day, or riding ten, or uſing any bodily labor or exerciſe equivalent to it. In bad weather I can ſee no great evil in throwing a cloak round his ſhoulders and walking even in the rain; the only difficulty is to ſummon reſolution enough to venture out; and a little uſe would take off all danger of catching cold, by hardening and ſecuring him againſt the poſſibility of it upon that and all other occaſions. If he dares not riſque this, ſome ſuccedaneum muſt be uſed within doors; more eſpecially when bad weather continues any time. I recommend it to all men to waſh their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHOEVER thinks there cannot be luxury enough in this courſe of life, I am perſuaded will not find more in any other: for good health, with all its natural appetites and ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in perfect order, is the only true foundation of luxury. And whoever cultivates it upon the falſe principles of culina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or medical art, urging to exceſs by ſtimulating provocatives of any kind, inſtead of pleaſure and enjoyment will meet with pain and diſguſt.</p>
                     <p>Some perhaps may be reaſonable enough to obſerve and ſay, This plan of yours is very ſimple; there is nothing marvellous in it; no wonderful diſcovery of any of the latent powers of medicine: but will a regimen ſo eaſy to be complied with as this, cure the gout, ſtone, dropſy, &amp;c? Will it repair broken conſtitutions and reſtore old invalids to health?

At firſt it did wonders, ſcoured and carried off all his crapulary indigeſtions, and kept him ſome time in health and ſpirits; but truſting to it too long, and repeating it too often, it no only loſt all it's power of doing good, but hurt him greatly, and he died I think at ſix-and-thirty, nothwithſtanding his Elixer.</note> he will do you ſome temporary, apparent ſervice: but when it begins to wear out, his remedies will laſt no longer; you muſt try better methods; you muſt not repeat the cauſe ſo often; for the cannot for ever build up as faſt as you can pull down. In ſhort, you muſt reform your life, and change all your bad habits for good ones; and if you have patience to wait the ſlow operations of nature properly aſſiſted, you will have no reaſon to regret your former luxuries.</p>
                     <p>WE are all ſo much the creatures of habit, which forms and faſhions us to good or ill almoſt as much as nature itſelf, that we ought to be very attentive and careful that our daily habits may ever tend to the confirmation not the deſtruction of health. It is not what we do now and then that can injure us greatly, but what we do every day muſt either do us great good or harm; either eſtabliſhing our health, or fixing our diſeaſes, for life.</p>
                     <p>IF, after all, any man ſhould ſay, theſe reſtraints, this care in chooſing what is wholſome, this conſtant watching over all we do, would make life ſo grievous, that health were not worth having upon theſe terms; I wiſh him to ſtop a little, and conſider them well before he rejects them intirely; and whether there be any better for him. It can do him no great harm to try a month or two; if he does, I flatter myſelf he will find that cuſtom will take off the greateſt part of the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and perſeverence make them not only tolerable but pleaſant. If he thinks health may be enjoyed upon eaſier terms, I fear he will be miſerably deceived; for health, like beauty, may be won by our own attention, efforts and aſſiduities, but cannot be had by purchaſe. Whoever thinks to buy either, will have the misfortune to find it not long his own, though he has paid for it.</p>

I ſay this to invalids in general: for thus may be cured not only the gout, but very bad rheumatiſms, iſchiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, rickets, ſtone, jaundice, dropſy, aſthma, cachexies, and complications of many kinds. Whatever chronic diſeaſes will not give way to this ſyſtem of medication, will be found, I greatly fear, too hard for any other.
