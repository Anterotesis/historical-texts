            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A FEW POLITICAL REFLECTIONS SUBMITTED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BRITISH COLONIES.</head>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <p>SO loud and important is the preſent cry for liberty, that it cannot but rouſe every man who has the welfare of his country at heart; and it becomes every man's duty to exert himſelf on the occaſion. We have, my Brethren, a dangerous ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery path to tread: Let us then carefully pick our way, and attentively inſpect every road that is point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our view.—Let us patiently hear and conſider every opinion that is offered with candor. Let us not reject, with contempt, whatever diſagrees with our own private ſentiments. In the multitude of counſel there is wiſdom.</p>
               <p>THE diſpute between Great-Britain and her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies is now reduced to a ſingle point.—<hi>Whether the Parliament ſhall give laws to America</hi>; a point ſo unjuſt, ſo unnatural and abſurd, that not only every American, but many of the inhabitants of Britain, muſt unite in oppoſing it. In what manner this oppoſition is to be made, becomes a queſtion of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013760_0004_0F91A9BFABAAF098"/>
the moſt ſerious nature.—The <hi>ultima ratio</hi>—to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe force to force, is what the heart of every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican muſt revolt at; for with whom ſhould we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage?—Our friends—our countrymen—our kindred — No! let not the baſe profligacy of a Miniſtry, abandoned to every principle of virtue, and raging for deſpotiſm, tempt ſuch near and dear connexions to ſheath the ſword in each others bowels.—There are ſurer, ſafer means to end the controverſy.—It is with great deference I hazard my opinion with my countrymen; I know I muſt ſtand or fall with you, and am, in the higheſt degree, earneſt to have us act with ſpirit and prudence.</p>
               <p>THE firſt emotions of anger cannot be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed always to dictate the beſt adapted ſchemes; for at that time a degree of revenge will ever attend the remedy. Let us be calm, my Brethren; let us confer freely and cloſely together, and let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, like men of ſenſe, to bear difference in ſentiments with becoming coolneſs. We all mean the ſame thing, we all deſire to be extricated from the common danger; and is it to be wondered at, if we view the matter in different points of light.</p>
               <p>THE firſt reſolves from our afflicted Brethren in Boſton intimate a deſign of ſuſpending all trade with the Weſt-Indies: Far be it from me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for ſuch a ſtep, at a time when under the agonizing influence of arbitrary ſubjection, with their properties and liberties wreſted from them; but cooler thoughts <hi>muſt</hi> convince men, who have ſo clear a view of the rights of mankind as <hi>they</hi> have, that puniſhments ſhould only be inflicted where Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice directs. Our Brethren in the Iſlands are ſo unfortunately ſurrounded with natural domeſtic ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that ſelf-preſervation, the ſtrongeſt principle
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013760_0005_0F91A9C1ECA1A8C0"/>
nature, prompts them to a kind of acquieſcence with acts of Parliament; and their want of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means of independent ſupport muſt ever render it prudent for them to oppoſe their Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with caution. Their dependance on us for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is ſo great, that ſhould it be ſuddenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, a general famine in the Iſlands muſt inevitably enſue; for it would be a conſiderable time before the Engliſh Merchants would throw their trade into that channel: The high price of proviſions in England would deter them from venturing; as alſo probably ſome doubts might ariſe in their minds of our ſtrictly adhering to our reſolutions. Thus ſhould we inflict the ſevereſt of puniſhments upon an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people, that, by <hi>their</hi> ſufferings, <hi>we</hi> might find relief.—No, my Brethren, we are not yet reduced to the ſad neceſſity of acting unbecoming that ſpirit of liberty we profeſs.—Some may argue that the Iſlands have upwards of ſeventy members in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; but let us remember they are not choſen by the Weſt Indians; they only happen to be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that have ſugar eſtates; and any American gentleman, that chooſes to ſettle in England, and will not begrudge the knavery and the price, may obtain a ſeat.</p>
               <p>SOME of our neighbours, in Maryland, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their views a ſtep further, and propoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the monies due to their Merchants in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: But this, on reconſidering the ſubject, they will certainly give up. All liberty is founded in juſtice, and I hope every American will ſpurn at the thought of acting beneath the character of men and Chriſtians: Let us firſt do ſtrict juſtice to others, and then we can with confidence aſſert our own rights. The Merchants of England have entruſted us with their fortunes; they have placed in us the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013760_0006_0F91A9C3E7A81D68"/>
moſt unlimited confidence; nay, they are our warmeſt advocates and friends; ſhall we then unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take a ſtep that would infallibly ruin them? Far be it from us, and I hope the gentlemen of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland, who have haſtily adopted this ſentiment, will readily retract, when they conſider it in all its conſequences; amongſt which the <hi>breach of public mercantile faith</hi> ought not to be eſteemed the leaſt.</p>
               <p>OUR commerce with England being founded on mutual convenience, and voluntary compact, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly reſts with us to determine <hi>how far it ſhall be extended,</hi> and <hi>when it ſhall ceaſe</hi>; this is a right which even Lord North, with all his arbitrary views, <hi>dare</hi> not deny. No man can be obliged to purchaſe goods of another; the ſeller can do no more than expoſe his wares to public ſale, the buyer is to determine <hi>what, when,</hi> and <hi>how much</hi> he will buy; this being the caſe, it becomes now a queſtion, <hi>whether this is not the time to make a general exerciſe of that power</hi>: As an individual, after having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely weighed the ſubject, I give my voice for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting it, in its <hi>fulleſt extent.</hi> I would recommend <hi>a general non-importation,</hi> as the moſt effectual means of convincing the people of England of how much importance we are. Their manufacturers will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feel the ſtagnation of trade, and remonſtrate in our behalf to the Legiſlature; here is our ground, here let us fight them; 'tis a ground we can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with an honeſt conſcience, and let us not quit it, till they have diſavowed the right of taxing <hi>by whatever name</hi>; and let us not forget to inſiſt on a repeal of the <hi>Wool bill,</hi> the <hi>Hat bill,</hi> and the <hi>Iron bill,</hi> which are in their nature more obnoxious to liberty than the Revenue acts. Perhaps it may be ſaid we cannot do without Engliſh goods long enough to effect our purpoſes; I do aſſure you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013760_0007_0F91A9C50FA7C830"/>
it is moſt certainly a miſtaken opinion; if we can but determine to throw by our luxuries, nor caſt off our clothes till they are ready to fall from our backs, we have ſtock ſufficient to laſt for years to come. Let every patch on our garments ſtand as a proof of our patriotiſm, and <hi>let no man be aſhamed of an old coat.</hi> But as in the effecting ſo deſirable a purpoſe, the burthen will fall particularly heavy on the Importers and Retailers, many of whom have no other way of ſupporting their families, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend an earneſt attention to <hi>their</hi> ſituation; for it would be the higheſt injuſtice to require <hi>them</hi> to fall a ſacrifice to the general cauſe:—'Tis through them we are to conquer—then let us not doom <hi>them</hi> the unhappy victims, to ſpring the mine, that <hi>we</hi> may enter the citadel. The preſent tax demanded of us is ſo trifling, that, for the mere <hi>quantum,</hi> it might not be an object of our attention; but all the horrid train of Parliamentary impoſitions, which would certainly follow, muſt rouſe every man to acknowledge the neceſſity of our bleeding freely in this important conteſt.</p>
               <p>TO apply the propereſt remedy on this occaſion, may not fall within the ſmall ſphere of my diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: What occurs I humbly offer to conſideration. If the former annual profit of every Importer and Retailer was to be candidly and fairly ſtated, and the deficiency, that might ariſe during the non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, made up to them by the public, I ſhould with the utmoſt chearfulneſs pay my proportion of the tax;—but as it is not probable, that any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor would be hardy enough to give his aſſent to a bill for that ſervice, it is a ſcheme that muſt be rejected. Therefore I would propoſe, that a large judicious Committee be choſen, who ſhould fix the rates, at which Merchants and Retailers might ſell
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013760_0008_0F91A9C70E0CEC80"/>
their ſtocks on hand; and that thoſe Rates be fixed ſo high, as to be a probably ſufficient compenſation for their ſuffering in the public cauſe: And that they ſhould become bound to each other, not to ſell under price. Thus every conſumer would contribute his proportion, and pay the joyful price of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. But before a ſtep of this kind is taken, let it be by the <hi>joint voice</hi> of the <hi>country</hi> as well as <hi>town:</hi> Let <hi>their</hi> ſentiments be taken, <hi>their</hi> liberties are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as well as ours; perhaps <hi>they</hi> may project ſome ſcheme more likely to anſwer the end. Let us be open to every man's counſel, we have but one point to aim at, and it matters not who hits the mark.</p>
               <p>THE Honourable Houſe of Burgeſſes in Virginia, whoſe noble ſentiments of liberty, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of ſpirit, juſtly entitle them to a foremoſt rank amongſt the American Legiſlatures, have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the matter with a becoming mixture of firmneſs and moderation; and if I am led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert ſome of their opinions, it is with the utmoſt reſpect and deference. Had their Governor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to continue the ſeſſion a few days longer, they would probably have made the neceſſary ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on their own reſolves.—A tenderneſs for the Manufacturers of Great-Britain, ſo far as it is conſiſtent with the welfare of America, is what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry humane mind amongſt us muſt applaud; and I honour them for the ſentiment: But ſhould it appear on cloſer inveſtigation, that a partial attachment to <hi>their</hi> intereſt would eſſentially injure our own, no man can heſitate to determine on the part we ought to take. Impelled by reſentment againſt the Eaſt- India Company, for their ungenerous and <hi>officicus</hi> attempt to rivet on us the cruel ſhackles forged by the <hi>iron hand</hi> of Parliament, it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013760_0009_0F91A9C730190CA0"/>
at, if every American ſhould unite in a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to let <hi>them</hi> feel the juſt puniſhment of their folly. Should we determine on a partial non-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by confining it ſolely to Eaſt-India goods, it would undoubtedly be a very heavy blow to the Company, and might intereſt them in a repeal of the acts we complain of: But on the other hand, it muſt be obſerved, we ſhould unite the manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt of England againſt the repeal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by caſt an unlooked for weight into the miniſterial ſcale; for as many of the manufactures of India are imitated in England, and for others they make good ſubſtitutes, we could not more effectually grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Engliſh artiſan, than by withdrawing our cuſtom from the India warehouſe; and in this the landed intereſt would concur. Whatever increaſes the demand for the manufactures of a country, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually extends to the Landholder; for the Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having money to ſpend, can afford to pay a good price to the Farmer, and <hi>he</hi> of courſe a good rent to the Landlord. Thus inſtead of facilitating our meaſures, we ſhould furniſh the Miniſter with freſh ſtrength to proſecute his determined plan of ſubjugating the Americans. However far the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mier may have bent his force to ſupport the <hi>India Company,</hi> I cannot think he will abandon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of taxing America, purely to ſerve <hi>them.</hi> Should the ſcheme of a partial non-importation take place, and be attended with the conſequence, here ſurmiſed, chagrined at the diſappointment, and mortified with the want of foreſight, we muſt <hi>ſtill</hi> have recourſe to other meaſures. If a partial non-importation was thought abſolutely necceſſary, ſtrange as the propoſition may ſeem, I ſhould think it more adviſeable to confine ourſelves to the uſe of Eaſt-India goods ſolely; whereby a jealouſy would be excited between the Engliſh and India
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013760_0010_0F91A9C7F67BA990"/>
intereſt; and a repeal might thereby be brought about; but this is by no means conſiſtent with <hi>my</hi> apprehenſion of the matter. It is <hi>A GENERAL NON- IMPORTATION HONESTLY ADHERED TO,</hi> that muſt work our deliverance; it is the only natural peaceable remedy in our power. It may be ſaid, that thereby the poor manufacturers of Great- Britain will be reduced to great want and diſtreſs, and that as they by no means promoted the acts, they claim the ſame reaſoning in their favour, as our Brethren in the iſlands: but their caſes are by no means ſimilar. The Iſlanders might actually ſtarve without our ſupplies; but the poor of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>cannot, will not,</hi> periſh with famine, whilſt there is bread in the land. The laws of England ſecure a ſupport to the neceſſitous; the rich, who made thoſe laws, know they <hi>muſt</hi> ſupport them; and ſhould it be dealt out with a ſcanty hand, the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed ſpirit of Engliſhmen would quickly trample down the diſtinctions of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to their own wants. Inſtances of this ſort are not to ſeek; the annals of George the ſecond and third produce them in abundance; and no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has more ſeriouſly engroſſed the attention of thinking men in the nation than the clamour about proviſions. Here we may ſenſibly wound them, but let it not be a mortal blow: far be it from the heart of a child eſſentially to injure a parent; let our inciſions be no deeper than are juſt neceſſary to diſcharge the corrupted maſs that collects about her vitals, and to couch the cataract in her eyes; and if her auditory nerves are too much clogged, let us inject a little of the <hi>ſpiritus Americani,</hi> and reſtore to her that neceſſary ſenſe:—But to quit the metaphor. Let us endeavour to convince them, that the Iſland of Great Britain is properly a land of manufacturers, ſurrounded by harbours for exportation; and that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013760_0011_0F91A9C8C11B66C8"/>
the continent of America is a moſt valuable granary at her ſervice. Let them but repeal all reſtrictive laws, and freely open to us their ports, and then I truſt they will never ſee their Manufacturers
<q>forſaken, nor their ſeed begging bread.</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE genius of America is agriculture, and for ages to come muſt continue ſo. An extenſive wilderneſs to the weſtward will long receive the gradual over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of population; and the Manufacturer of Great-Britain will never meet with a formidable rival in the ſhape of an American Farmer, ſo long as he can purchaſe the cloathing of his family with the produce of his fields. 'Tis numbers cloſely pent up together, that point out the neceſſity of applying art to nature, and new modeling her materials.</p>
               <p>I crave your patience, Brethren, to attend me a little further. We have now had time to take a retroſpective view of our conduct towards the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent cargoes of Tea ſent to this continent; ſome of which have been deſtroyed, ſome landed, and ſome ſent back. Moderate men begin to think, that the deſtruction of the Tea at Boſton was rather a raſh procedure, and that recompence ought to be made. If I underſtand the Philadelphian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee right, they meant to adviſe ſuch a meaſure to our afflicted Brethren; and I heartily concur with them therein. Some amongſt us congratulate the Pennſylvanians on getting ſo happily through <hi>their</hi> affair; but, Brethren, I cannot think we ſhould leave it here; if the Tea deſtroyed at Boſton requires payment, on a principle of equity and juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the property of others, with equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety may it be expected from us to pay for the freight and damages of the Tea ſent back from hence. The property of the Eaſt-India Company
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013760_0012_0F91A9C976BFE650"/>
was alike injured in both caſes; and, from a parity of reaſoning, it becomes a charge upon us. Let it not be ſaid the Company <hi>has made no ſuch demand,</hi> therefore <hi>we will make no ſuch propoſal.</hi> I apprehend the laws of right and wrong are eternally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably the ſame; and, from a ſenſe of juſtice, we ought to be beforehand with the payment. He that is no honeſter than the laws of government require, will never ſtand foremoſt in the liſts of honour.— Yes, my Brethren, I am bold to recommend the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offer of a compenſation, and ſhall heartily ſubſcribe my quota.</p>
               <p>BRETHREN—I beg leave to extend my views ſtill a little further. After every aſſembly on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent has atttempted to take legal and conſtitutional meaſures for redreſs, and either their attempts are defeated, or their meaſures fail, then arrives a moſt intereſting, a moſt alarming period. When a nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can derive no benefit from its government, the very end of government is fruſtrated; and the wretched inhabitants are reduced near to a ſtate of nature, and have all to begin anew.—I cannot help expreſſing my aſtoniſhment, as I proceed in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, at the raſhneſs and unparalleled folly of Great Britain, a nation ſo highly valued for its jealous preſervation of civil liberty, that her conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her colonies on the preſent occaſion, muſt greatly tarniſh the glory of her annals. Has ſhe trained up her children, like calves in the ſtall, to fall bloody victims by her own unnatural cruel hands?—What could ſhe wiſh from us more than we freely gave? For whom have we toiled in this once uncultivated wilderneſs? For whoſe benefit do we riſe up early, and lie down late, is it not for Great Britain?—Are not our ſails ſpread to every wind that blows under heaven, to bear away the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013760_0013_0F91A9CA6BAF0B60"/>
dear earnings of the ſweat of our brow, that they may at laſt centre in Britain? Are we not her faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful generous cuſtomers for all the various commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of her induſtrious workmen? Do we clamor at the prices they exact! Do we not cheerfully pay whatever they are pleaſed to charge us for their goods? Whenever, in the courſe of trade, we collect the ſpecie of other nations, we laviſhly pour it into Britannia's lap; whilſt, with an honeſt confidence in each other's honor, we content ourſelves with a medium <note n="*" place="bottom">Paper Money.</note> of commerce of no intrinſic value, that our once fond Mother may revel in our real wealth. What more, in a commercial way, has ſhe a right to wiſh?</p>
               <p>BUT to return from this digreſſion,—If Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by an arbitrary exertion of power, reduces us to a ſtate of anarchy: ſo much muſt every man be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with the bleſſings of civil government, that he will wiſh to raiſe from the ruins a new fabrick ſomewhat reſembling the old.—If we cannot have the benefit of advice from our conſtitutional Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, we muſt have recourſe to the <hi>Vox Populi</hi>:— A new Phoenix muſt ariſe out of the aſhes.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would reſpectfully propoſe, that every county in every province ſhould elect as many members for a popular Aſſembly, as they now return to their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Aſſembly. That the qualifications for the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and elected, be the ſame in both elections. That when this is done throughout the continent, a place of congreſs ſhould be appointed; and each popular Aſſembly ſhould inſtruct and ſend at leaſt ſix members, and that this GRAND ASSEMBLY ſhould unite in a firm and reſpectful remonſtrance to the whole Legiſlature of Great Britain; aſſerting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013760_0014_0F91A9CAEA69F0D0"/>
our natural and acquired rights, and tendering <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of accommodation.</hi> For, Brethren, we are unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Great Britain by the ſtrongeſt and cloſeſt ties of intereſt, as well as affection; ſhe has a right to expect <hi>ſomething</hi> from us at ſome future day;—with ſubmiſſion I ſpeak it—I ſay ſhe has a right to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>ſomething</hi> from us, and the time is perhaps not very diſtant, when we ſhould determine what <hi>that</hi> ſomething ſhall be.</p>
               <p>IT has been formerly urged that the Americans, buying the manufactures of Britain, do actually and <hi>bona fide</hi> pay all the taxes levied on the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers; becauſe a ſufficient living profit muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to the Manufacturer, after paying thoſe taxes. This argument, tho' at firſt view ſpecious, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend is not ſo extenſive in its concluſion, as the writers on the ſubject imagine. If we contend that we pay a <hi>proportionable</hi> part of the taxes of Great Britain, by purchaſing her manufactures, it muſt be obſerved, that we do not pay higher for thoſe goods than her own inhabitants, who conſume of their own manufactures a much larger quantity than we do.—Therefore on the ſubject of taxes ariſing out of their manufactures, we with them, and they with us, are juſt upon a level; and of courſe every actual tax paid by them towards the ſupport of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, excluſive of what they pay in the prices of the manufactures they uſe, is juſt ſo much more than we pay.</p>
               <p>IT may perhaps be ſaid that England, being greatly enriched by having ſuch valuable cuſtomers, is bound, in point of intereſt, to ſecure and protect us; and ſhould we determine never to contribute a ſingle farthing towards her coffers, but in the way of trade, and even had ſhe no means in her power
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013760_0015_0F91A9CF15BCA6C8"/>
of extorting it from us, ſtill would ſhe continue to ſhield us with her arm, and cover us from danger. For what man throws up a farm as uſeleſs for ſo weak a reaſon, as it's not always yielding him an hundred fold; he will eſtimate the whole charge of cultivation, and then, if the produce exceeds the coſt, he is encouraged to proceed. Why have the Engliſh ſpent ſo much in defence of Portugal?— Is it for affection?—Is it for preſerving the balance of power?—Or is it for ſome annual ſubſidy?— No—it is for the protection of ſuch valuable cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the poſſeſſion of their gold, that they may live to export it for the Manufactures of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; being fully ſenſible of the benefit of riches flowing from induſtry. But waving the policy of England, let us, my Brethren, with the true ſpirit of honeſt men, do the thing which is juſt. <hi>Let Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica be characterized by an eye of diſcernment, a heart of integrity, and an open hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is true we have internal taxes, for the ſupport of government amongſt ourſelves; but thoſe taxes, only reſpecting our internal convenience and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, include no competent idea of defence againſt a foreign power. If America ſhould eſtabliſh an independance, which I pray Heaven avert, we ſhould ſoon fall a prey to ſome of the maritime Princes, unleſs we could maintain a fleet ſufficient to guard our coaſt; how far this would be practicable, I leave every American to judge for himſelf. As the caſe ſtands at preſent, we turn our eyes to Britain on every impending danger; we look to her fleets for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence. Ought we not then, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to think of contributing ſome portion of the national expence? Though in the all powerful hands of Providence, the fleets of nations, and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013760_0016_0F91A9D046031FA0"/>
armies of Kings, are but as chaff before the wind, and his <hi>fiat</hi> is ſufficient to ſcreen us from every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chination of evil; yet as he is pleaſed to permit his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to breath forth that ſpirit of rancour and ill-will towards each other, for purpoſes in his wiſdom far beyond my conception, the concerns of human civil government point out carnal means of preſervation; and, till a much wiſhed univerſal reſtoration of purity ſucceeds, the policy of nations muſt partake of the ſpirit of war. Therefore, Brethren, ſuppoſe we ſhould tender them ſome annual ſum for the ſupport of government, and raiſe it in certain quotas amongſt ourſelves. Let us ſtipulate for the ſame free trade <hi>they</hi> have; and let America be conſidered as joined to Great Britain. If the inhabitants of London, Liverpool, and Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol, enjoy an equal privilege in trade, why ſhould not <hi>we</hi> be conſidered in the ſame point of light? What narrow ſoul'd policy is it that draws a line of diſtinction between a Briton and an American? Let the wealth of the Britiſh empire equally diffuſe itſelf, and like water find its level. If a flood of wealth pours into a country through the channels of trade, it quickly ebbs out again in purſuit of luxuries and dainties; and thus, by ſucceſſive undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, gives motion to the ſprings of the whole empire. Our diſtant ſituation renders it impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to unite us with each other in legiſlation. Let each govern its own internal affairs, and all unite in the grand <hi>bulwark</hi> of the nation. What ſhall be the portion for America to contribute, will become a queſtion of deep deciſion, nor ſhould it be haſtily determined. I would wiſh England to make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and leave us to deliberate on it.—I know America would be generous,—I hope England would be juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013760_0017_0F91A9D0ECBD0C78"/>BEFORE the point is finally ſettled, let it be well aſcertained what is to be underſtood by <hi>acts for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating of trade.</hi> Amongſt our political writers on the American ſide of the queſtion, there are ſome of ſuch high characters for judgment and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to make me leſs poſitive in aſſerting <hi>my</hi> opinion on the ſubject. But I muſt confeſs I could never be convinced, by their arguments, of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of drawing a line ſo near the borders of <hi>taxation,</hi> as not to encroach upon that <hi>ground</hi>; a ground that is worth contending for—a ground we <hi>muſt</hi> contend for with all our might. Let it be remembered that the King has a negative upon all our bills, which ought to be deemed a ſufficient check upon our conduct. We acknowledge the King of Great Britain for our Sovereign—we love him—we revere him—we are attached to him both by policy and principle; but <hi>cannot—muſt not</hi> allow <hi>any kind of authority in his Parliament</hi>; and if <hi>that</hi> Parliament would but attend to the true conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional intereſt of the empire, they would ceaſe to claim it.</p>
               <p>AND now, Brethren, let me recommend unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and prudence amongſt ourſelves. Let no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of <hi>ſects</hi> or <hi>countries</hi> prevail amongſt us. Let little party views ſubſide and ſink in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe; and let the calamities that at preſent threaten us, tend to unite us
<q>in one firm band of amity and love.</q>
Hence we may hope to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our poſterity a glorious <hi>proſpect</hi> of laſting freedom, embelliſhed with a back ground of fertile fields, and thickly ſettled villages. Then ſhall our children, and childrens children, bleſs the virtue and reſolution of their forefathers, whilſt nobly purſuing our virtuous plan, they cultivate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013760_0018_0F91A9D1AB4BE0A8"/>
an amazing American empire, and rank in ſplendor, independance, and riches, with all the united powers of the Eaſtern World.</p>

               <p>THE more I conſider the importance of the preſent controverſy, the more am I convinced of the neceſſity of wiſdom in our councils, by which we may more certainly expect, under Providence, a happy iſſue to our <hi>virtuous</hi> ſtruggle: and <hi>virtuous</hi> I have no doubt it will be hereafter termed, by even thoſe with whom we now contend:—but we muſt keep the ſtricteſt guard over our paſſions.—Reaſon muſt command our forces, and juſtice lead the way to conqueſt: thus ſhall we ride triumphant over our enemies, and compel them both to fear and admire us.—Pardon me, Brethren, if in purſuing this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſeem ſometimes to aſſume the ſtile of dictation; I mean but to give my honeſt guileleſs ſentiments —ſentiments that are but the pure effuſions of a heart devoted to my country,—I cannot ſit an idle unconcerned ſpectator, Codrus like, "amidſt a burſting world." And O! that I could unite the bewitching powers of eloquence and wiſdom, that, through the medium of your paſſions, I might gain the plaudit of your judgment.—I know there needs but your calm attention, and all will be well.— Juſtice and truth will ever prevail, and their fierceſt enemies fall at laſt proſtrate at their feet.

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013760_0019_0F91A9D283A768D8"/>
may be tedious, but a virtuous perſeverance will gain the day.</p>
               <p>THE ſparkling ideas of a warm imagination are too apt to ſoar into the regions of danger, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out providing a proper retreat, involve the bold adventurer in unthought of perplexities. But let us, my Brethren, like ſkilful Generals, ſend our ſcouts abroad—view the deſigns and ſtrength of our enemy, and ſecure the moſt advantageous poſts the ground will admit.—Calmneſs in council, and previous manoeuvres, mark as ſtrongly the genius of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as preſence of mind, and courage in the field. The nation whoſe wiſe policy in the cabinet baffles the invidious attempts of hoſtile neighbours, without calling forth the horrors ot military carnage, ſhines brighter in the annals of a chriſtain age than if poutrayed with all the ſplendid clangor of arms died in blood, and ſurrounded with the victorious tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of fallen thouſands.</p>
               <p>THOSE who ſtand on higher ground than I do, may probably have their circle of viſion enlarged, and with ſtronger optic organs look further into diſtant events.—Mine I confeſs have been too much confined to a narrower ſphere; and nothing but my country's weal could tempt me to clamber up the rugged mountains of politicks.</p>
               <p>I have already, with much ſubmiſſion, declared my ſentiments, that a <hi>general non-importation</hi> was the only weapon we ſhould wield in this unnatural mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial war; and wiſh I may be happy enough to convince my countrymen that we need not go further.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:013760_0020_0F91A9D329202708"/>SHOULD the <hi>propoſal</hi> made by ſome of our ſouthern Brethren, and countenanced by ſome in this province, be adopted—the <hi>propoſal of a non-exportation to Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>—I conceive it would be but giving ourſelves a more deadly wound—<hi>Whatever our country, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and frugality, can ſpare for exportation, is juſt ſo much added to its riches</hi>; whether we depoſit it in the hands of an Engliſh merchant till called for, or order it immediately back in mercantile inveſtment.</p>
               <p>THAT a heavy dept is incurred by us in England, for the ſeveral articles of her commerce, is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly true; and that it is a debt which we mean honeſtly to pay, I believe is alſo <hi>as</hi> true; and that after the contracted limitation of credit is expired, the Engliſh factors will expect, and the American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants will allow, that an intereſt of five per cent. ought to commence; and though the intercourſe between the two countries ſhould have a temporary ceſſation, the terms of the firſt contract would ſtill be binding, and an accumulating load of debt preſs with aggravating weight upon our ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>IF we ſuppoſe this continent to take from Great- Britain the value of <hi>three millions</hi> per annum, we may reaſonably preſume that the importers in America are at all times <hi>that ſum</hi> in debt. For though ſome may trade on ſuch extenſive capitals as will enable them to keep within the limited time of payment, yet there are ſo many who fall ſhort of their contracts, that the ſuppoſition may readily be granted. Admit then, we ſtop all intercourſe with England.—From that inſtant will begin an intereſt of five per cent. on the enormous ſum of three millions, which amounts to no leſs than one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling per annum; a ſum that muſt actually
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013760_0021_0F91A9D6F0526C20"/>
be remitted to them, whenever we renew our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. During this important interval, if the money due to our Engliſh merchants could be employed to ſuch advantage, as to pay us for our trouble, and reſerve one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling per annum for their uſe, politically ſpeaking, the continent might be ſaid to be no great ſufferers, but, viewing it in that moral point of light which I hope every American will advert to, we ſhould do them the higheſt injury. Every gentleman in buſineſs will readily aſſent to the propoſition, that <hi>receiving intereſt is by no means an equivalent to the man in trade.</hi> If money is ſaid to be the "ſinews of a nation," it is the very nervous fluid in the commercial ſyſtem, which, pervading the muſcular powers, gives force to contract or extend thoſe ſinews; it is the very life, ſoul, and eſſence of trade. How then can we recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ourſelves to the commiſſion of ſo flagrant an act of injuſtice; but if our feelings of virtue fail us, let us apply to thoſe tender ſtrings of intereſt, which are ever at uniſons in the great commercial harp; <hi>there</hi> let us ſtrike, and the ſound will vibrate in every ear.</p>
               <p>IT has been ſaid that
<q>whatever a country, by its induſtry and frugality, can ſpare for exportation is juſt <hi>ſo much</hi> added to its riches.</q>
Now if we dam up this ſurplus amongſt ourſelves, like cloſing the pores, or checking perſpiration, we produce a putrid collection—a confined fermentation ſucceeds— and nature ſtruggling with the diſorder, throws the body into a fever; which though frequently effecting a cure, ſometimes proves fatal. Should all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Britain ceaſe, our invention need not be long racked, to conceive the effect it would produce; nor can I be charged with officiouſly pointing out to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013760_0022_0F91A9D907265668"/>
our enemies a road of conduct, which their own eyes muſt diſcover, and which their preſent ſyſtem of policy would defend. He that plays a cautious game, will never riſque a blot to the chance of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight: and <hi>he</hi> would certainly ill deſerve the affection and confidence of his countrymen, who perceiving an impending danger, forbore to give warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If with ſuch a heavy debt againſt us we break off our connection, is it not natural for our creditors to take the alarm; poſſeſſed of their fortunes, and out of their reach, muſt they not wiſh to keep a watchful eye over us? Is it probable they can conſent to our trade with other nations in Europe, with wealth <hi>properly theirs</hi>: If government interfered in favour of the Eaſt India Company, for the paultry ſum of fifteen or eighteen thouſand pounds deſtroyed by perſons unknown; how much more likely is it, that ſhe will exert herſelf on behalf of the whole trading intereſt of Great-Britain, to bring to juſtice the private "defaulters of unaccounted millions?" Let us ſuppoſe, to take a clearer view of the argument, for conjectures ſhould ever be encouraged, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability points the prudence of the ſearch; I ſay let us ſuppoſe, that the Parliament of England, with their high notions of ſovereignty and <hi>omnipotence</hi> (though I with reverence explode the application of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion</hi>) ſhould ſhut up <hi>our</hi> harbours to every port of Europe; though we might fire with rage, and ſwell with indignation, our efforts would be futile, and our clamours unheard.—The patriot might <hi>mourn,</hi> and the peaſant might <hi>feel,</hi> whilſt increaſing murmurs ſpread through the land, and tear us with civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Liberty revered of all—that darling of the Britiſh ſoul, that heavenly ſpark, lodged in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart for purpoſes great and important, is yet ſo nearly, ſo cloſely connected in every mind, with
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013760_0023_0F91A9DA2B1BF320"/>
the pleaſing gratifying ideas of <hi>property,</hi> that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>that</hi> is endangered, the firſt alarm is loud and ſerious.</p>
               <p>OUR fields, through the wanted providence of the great Lord of the ſoil, produce their uſual crops— our barns expand with the preſſing load of unnum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered ſheaves; and a joy "like unto the joy of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt" ſpreads a ſerenity of countenance through thouſands, ten thouſand families—in pleaſing confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and with unwearied diligence, they beat the golden ears, and prepare the joyful produce of a twelve month's labour—Whiſtling as they go, and forming a general concuſſion of earth, from every diſtant frontier, they roll along in <hi>heavy loads</hi> the grateful tribute of their toils—let us follow them to the capitols—to the ſeveral ports of embarkation— but hold—grief ſwells my heart—a tremor ſeizes on my limbs—my whole nervous ſyſtem becomes diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered—every inflexion of the bowels of compaſſion ſtrains with involuntary convulſions—I am ſcarce able to proceed—they approach—they enter the once buſy ſtreets—they ſtartle at the general void— for a moment they pauſe—ſurprize and amazement almoſt forbid them to enquire the cauſe—but ſoon, too ſoon they find the general diſtreſs—THE PORT IS SHUT—the demand is over, they return to their once joyful homes, ſolemn and diſconſolate; pondering as they paſs along, and watering the ground with their tears.</p>
               <p>WHEN our honeſt endeavours have been faithfully exerted, and fail of their expected ſucceſs; when it has pleaſed the great diſpoſer of events to order his providence contrary to our wiſhes, and blaſt our beſt and well meant deſigns; with humble reſignation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013760_0024_0F91A9DAAE26E548"/>
and ſubmiſſion, we can ſit down in mournful peace; and having no imprudencies to add to our misfortunes, we can look up, with confidence, for ſome favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change:—But when juſtice, and a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, deny that heart-felt ſolacing reſource, when the dictates of paſſion have run counter to every idea of right, from whence is our peace to flow? Where ſhall we look for comfort? Will not our far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, the ſtrength and ſupport of our land, reaſon back from the conſequence up to the cauſe? Will they not ſee that our inattention to the eternal rule of right has plunged them into this abyſs of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and that in purſuit of <hi>our own</hi> liberties we have infringed upon the rights of <hi>others?</hi> Will they not recommend, will they not urge a change of meaſures; perhaps at a time when our enemies may not be diſpoſed to ſuffer our landing on the ground from whence we embarked? Will they not—but I fear to proceed—Hence, my Brethren, let us be warned, and ruſh not into ſuch probable danger. Let us continue to export to them as uſual, let us if poſſible <hi>double</hi> our exports, let us bring them in our debt. The merchants of England are men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and principle, and with them we ſhall be ſafe, in them we ſhall find friends. What though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, ariſing from tobacco cultivated in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern provinces, may amount to above 400,000 l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per annum, and a general non-exportation of that article ſhould be determined on; the wheels of government might probably thereby be retarded in their motion, but freſh ſprings would quickly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the machine go on, at leaſt for a time; and the preſent ſtruggle between America and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, will moſt aſſuredly turn in favour of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which can longeſt hold out—let all our force be bent againſt their <hi>manufacturers; they</hi> are the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013760_0025_0F91A9DB73870270"/>
againſt which our batteries muſt be levelled; let us but make an impreſſion <hi>there,</hi> and the conteſt will certainly be decided. The actual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the various manufacturing branches are men of honeſt principles and lovers of liberty, but poſſeſſed of ſuch ſcanty means, that the <hi>week's earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> but juſt bring round the <hi>week's ſupport.</hi> Their employers in the different towns, who ſupply them with raw materials, and pay them for their work, are moſt of them men of middling fortunes; and can only advance to the workmen, in proportion as they receive remittance from the exporting merchant; Therefore if the orders from America <hi>ceaſe</hi> the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation goes down ſtep by ſtep, till the loom and the anvil become <hi>at reſt.</hi> I the more earneſtly dwell on this point, becauſe I know of no other reſource un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven for our preſervation: I want to enforce it in every man's mind, and when conviction once gains ground, the work is half finiſhed. Though I have already preſſed on this ſubject, I doubt it is not ſufficiently adverted to. 'Tis urged by all, that the ſtep would anſwer every purpoſe our moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine wiſhes could expect, were it but <hi>practicable,</hi> but it is ſaid the importers <hi>will not</hi> conſent to it: I inſiſt <hi>they muſt</hi> conſent to it, <hi>we muſt make it their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to conſent</hi> to it; and <hi>then</hi> they will not refuſe —I, applaud their reſolution in objecting to being the only ſufferers, when our purſes enable us to ſhare the burthen. 'Tis ungenerous, 'tis unjuſt to expect it of them. There never was a time ſo big with the neceſſity of opening our eyes, and our purſes, as the preſent. Let it but paſs over, and long may we range through an extenſive circle of events, before the ſame conjunction appears. <hi>Liberty,</hi> the brighteſt conſtellation that ſhines in the political himiſphere, is now riſing towards its zenith in America: If we
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013760_0026_0F91A9DC2C81B128"/>
ſuffer it to ſet, without effecting the work, which its light diſplays to our view, the dark ſhades of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very will extend acroſs our land, and <hi>too late</hi> we may lament the delay.</p>
               <p>I contend—and <hi>I contend with a zeal which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces me I am right,</hi> that we <hi>muſt not</hi> paſs by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent temper of the times. Our paſſions cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain upon the ſtretch; we ſhall gently relax from the ſeverity of ſtrict right, and heedleſly and gradually ſlide down the hill of oppoſition; our rulers will become our tyrants; and, from a country of happy freemen, we ſhall degenerate into a land of abject ſlaves. I ſummons you, Brethren, I conjure you, Brethren, if you love your country, if your wives, if your children are dear to you, if your dignity as men has any influence over you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir yourſelves on the occaſion. O that my voice could reach to the innermoſt regions of your hearts, and I could <hi>there</hi> imprint what I feel! Though I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere the land from whence my anceſtors ſprang, though the ſound of Briton was ever grateful in my ear, the indignities now offered us, rouſe a Roman ſpirit in my heart, and forbid me to feel the calls of nature. Have ye, Brethren, no virtue left, ſhall temporary intereſt prevail over your country's future weal, or will you unlock the treaſures you have gained, and pour them into the common ſtock? Truſt me, friends; believe me, my countrymen; whatever you advance at this intereſting period, <hi>is fixing chains and fetters on the ſums that remain,</hi> but if niggardly you clinch the miſer fiſt, and graſp your <hi>all,</hi> as with ſeeming ſecurity, the day is not far off when you muſt ſurrender the whole to a tyrant's will. Therefore unite with one voice, and ſay, we <hi>will</hi> ſupport the men who muſt ſtand foremoſt in the charge. To draw your attention, from the importance

of the ſcene before you, to a private object, were to trifle with the cauſe, I ſhall only declare that I am, in no ſhape, connected with importing or importers; my earneſtneſs ariſes purely from a love of liberty ſupported by juſtice.</p>
               <p>SINCE my firſt addreſs I have ſeen ſome of the late debates in Parliament, and find the thought <hi>of an accommodation</hi> there ſuggeſted—but, it is ſaid, we have tendered no ſuch propoſal—I rejoice to find the ſentiment originate in that Houſe, and I wiſh, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we may not ſuffer it to die away—we have many friends there, and we ought to ſtrengthen their hands.

               <p>WE are told that if they give up the preſent du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on tea, which was only reſerved as a kind of declaratory right of taxation, that we ſhall quickly make other claims; that we ſhall demand a repeal of the duty on wine, &amp;c. <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Cornwall's Speech.</note>—<hi>Their fears are certainly well grounded</hi>—we <hi>ought</hi> to demand it.—Shall it be called <hi>a regulation of trade,</hi> for an American to be obliged to carry the wines of Portugal to an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh outport, and <hi>there</hi> depoſit a duty—ſhall the wines of Madeira pay 7 <hi>l.</hi> ſterling per ton in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica for the purpoſes of <hi>regulating trade</hi>—the very conception is big with abſurdity.—Was England a country of vineyards, and their grand ſtaple the juice of the grape, with ſome colour of juſtice, might ſhe wiſh to reſtrain us from buying of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nations.—The grand Proteſtant intereſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of England's <hi>pretended ſupremacy,</hi> would be an argument on both ſides the water ſufficient to unite us; but as the Engliſh never did, nor ever can attempt to cultivate the vine, any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands on that ſcore muſt proceed more from the rapacity of their cravings than the juſtice of the tribute.</p>

tale:—<hi>ſtill were they Britons</hi>—many were the dangers, and repeated the trials, before any kind of eſtabliſhment was made—before a durable landing was effected—<hi>ſtill they kept hold of Britannia's hand</hi> —they grew—<hi>ſtill ſhe ſupported them</hi>—their eyes were ever towards her for defence—if differences aroſe amongſt themſelves, they appealed to Britain for juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and plead her deciſions as right.—Year after year the natives of the realm embarked for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed land; <hi>but ſtill were they Engliſhmen</hi>—Their dependance on England, and ſubmiſſion to Engliſh legiſlation had ſo intimately connected itſelf with every idea of government, that their very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were interwoven.—The father taught the ſon to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>revere</hi> the old man's native land; and with attentions ſolely engroſſed by the improvement of their farms, the plants of government were raiſed by ſeeds from England. Britiſh Parliaments early extended their care over the <hi>new world,</hi> and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were not alarmed—the <hi>ſupremacy of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> they had never been taught to doubt becauſe never exerted to their injury; thus confidence on one hand, and an opinion of right on the other, growing up together, a kind of tacit ſubmiſſion took place.—When the act for reſtricting our manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>firſt</hi> came abroad, the right was but <hi>gently</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by the Americans, who, ſlumbering under the old prejudices in favour of Parliamentary power, ſupinely bowed their heads.—At length when our enemies of the Houſe of Bourbon began to envy us "our pleaſant places," and make encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our land, England took up the quarrel; and, by the help of the colony forces, under Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, drove them from the continent; but this was not done without large drains from the coffers of Britain; yet ſo much did they eſteem it <hi>their</hi> cauſe,

that taking into conſideration the great ſums ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by this <hi>infant country,</hi> they ordered us a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome reimburſement—<hi>ſtill they looked on us as their children.</hi>—</p>
               <p>DURING the war, we had great intercourſe with England—officers of the army were continually paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and repaſſing; many of them ſons of the beſt families. Gentlemen on their travels extended their routs to America; and even Peers of the realm land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our ſhores. Fluſhed with the joy of victory, and pleaſed with the men by whom we conquered, we laviſhed the fruits of our induſtry in ſocial ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets. —We diſplayed a parade of <hi>wealth</hi> beyond the bounds of moderation and prudence; and ſuffered our gueſts to depart with <hi>high ideas of our riches— theſe</hi> were communicated to their friends at home, and the tale went round. The nation was oppreſſed with a heavy load of debt, great part incurred by the defence of America, and the ſons of England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to clamour for bread; how natural then was it for Parliament to hunt out freſh reſources? and when their children abroad paraded in all the pride of plenty, how plauſible the ſcheme of <hi>acquiring</hi> their aid.—The power of Parliament had ſcarce ever been denied, or but <hi>feebly</hi> oppoſed. The ſuggeſtion of <hi>right</hi> was never permitted to have full ſcope in their minds.—The ideas of a <hi>nullum tempus</hi> act, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of liberty, they had never conceived.—Time immemorial, and long uſage, had placed them ſo ſecure, that the <hi>records</hi> of reaſon were thought ſcarce worth the ſearch.—They began like men, with <hi>warranted titles,</hi> to break up the ground. A rich vein of oar was promiſed by the miners; and a <hi>Greenville</hi> undertook to ſink the ſhaft—but quick as lightening, in <hi>piercing</hi> the ſoil, it communicated the

Their <hi>active minds,</hi> darting acroſs the great Atlantic, conſidered America as contiguous to Britain. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had not furniſhed them with a <hi>ſimilar connexion,</hi> and their rule of conduct was only to be determined by their <hi>own</hi> opinion of right; and <hi>they,</hi> undertaking to become <hi>ſole</hi> judges in the caſe, have fallen into the unhappy error which produces our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.—I can make great allowance for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conduct of Great Britain; every American can feel for her miſtake.—They took us as babes at the breaſt; they nouriſhed us, and leading us gently along, ſupported and inſtructed us—with pleaſure they viewed our ripening years, and gloried in the goodly figure to which we were attaining.—With ſwift and rapid growth we approached to riper age; and, truſt me, Britons, we <hi>feel</hi> within our boſoms a <hi>ſpirit</hi> that beſpeaks us <hi>your genuine off ſpring.</hi>— We look to manhood—our muſcles ſwell out with youthful vigour; our ſinews ſpring with elaſtic force; and we feel the <hi>marrow of Engliſhmen in our bones.</hi> The day of independant manhood is at hand—we <hi>feel</hi> our ſtrength; and, with a filial grateful ſenſe of <hi>proper</hi> obedience, would wiſh to be eſteemed the <hi>friend</hi> as well as <hi>child</hi> of Britain, In <hi>domeſtic</hi> life, we all allow there is a time when youth ſhall no longer

               <p>THOUGH in my laſt paper, with the impetuous rapidity of a heated fancy, I darted through aeras yet unborn, and plunged into the diſtant regions of futurity, I beg leave, my brethren, to conduct you back in ſafety, to the important and intereſting reign of George the Third.—A Prince, whoſe goodneſs of ſoul, and unſuſpecting heart, unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for his people, have unwarily betrayed him into the enſnaring meaſures of deſigning men; men whoſe luſt for power, and rapacious purſuit after riches, would tempt them to ſwallow up both King and and kingdom, were they not ſenſible of the neceſſity of exhibiting to public view ſo oftenſible a power as royalty, under whoſe patronage and protection they are artfully undermining the conſtitution, and prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commit the moſt horrid parricide on their country. Lulled into ſecurity, and wallowing in luxuries, the nation is ſilently gliding down the ſtream.—The bark ſeems at reſt—the ſurface of the deceitful current is calm and ſerene—the banks are in verdure, and the ſhrubs and the flowers beguile with their fragrance, whilſt the foaming roar of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant cataract is ſcarce ſeintly heard.—Alas, Britannia! —without ſome friendly eye perceives thy floating danger, and ruſhing into the flood drags thy galley to ſhore—thou art gone—irretrievably gone; and may America prove that friend.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:013760_0036_0F91A9E8EE525A48"/>I DO not pretend, my brethren, to any ſyſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal order in the courſe of theſe reflections; I caſt them as mites into the treaſury, as they ariſe in my mind, and if any ſentiments are found amongſt them of weight and importance, my labours will not be loſt. Much has been ſaid on the ſubject by various writers, and poſſibly ſome ingenious digeſter may hereafter collect and form them into a found Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſyſtem of policy.

               <p>IT is now generally allowed that a congreſs of the colonies is abſolutely neceſſary; and as I have no doubt that part of their reſult will be the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ambaſſadors to attend, in perſon, with our complaints at the Court of Great Britain; every aid, however feeble, cannot be deemed impertnent; and every argument that can be held forth, to ſupport the common cauſe, will at leaſt be liſtened to; and certain it is, the grand deſideratum on this occaſion is to embark with the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt proofs we can procure, to convince the rulers, and the people of Great Britain, that it is <hi>their intereſt</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to our grievances, and grant us redreſs.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS in purſuing this object, it may not be amiſs to make a few political calculations; that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, at one view, the vaſt importance of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I am well aware that the obſervations I am now about to make, will at the firſt glance, have ſo much the air of viſionary ſpeculation, that many of my readers will turn from me with indignant contempt; but they will pleaſe to obſerve, I am endeavouring to unfold to view, the mighty chart of a cultivated Continent; for cultivated it undoubtedly will be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our children have ſlept many ages in the peaceful

grave;—and as every whole is made up of parts, we ought now to conſider ourſelves as members in embryo of this ſtupenduous body, and much are the people of England intereſted in ſtudying the ſubject; for ſwiftly the time paſſeth away, and much it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them to watch our increaſe, and accommodate themſelves to our growth.</p>
               <p>THOUGH it may be a conſiderable time before the full accompliſhment of the following calculations ſhall happen, yet whoever attentively peruſes the great volume of nature, will find ſufficient ſcope for the exerciſe of foreſight and reaſonable conjectures.</p>
               <p>PETER the Great, Czar of Muſcovy, with a genius penetrative and perſevering, pierced far into the dark abodes of futurity; and, from a wild barbarous and contemptible ſtate, formed a plan of empire, of which his predeceſſors had never conceived the moſt diſtant idea; and which at this day has riſen to ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable height of grandeur, that her connections are ſought with reſpect by the firſt powers in Europe. If a century before the acceſſion of Peter to the Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a diviner had foretold her approaching glory, his countrymen would have treated him with ſcorn and deriſion; and well they might, for nothing but a genius like Peter's could have ſurmounted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and cuſtoms of barbarians. But with us, where every liberal art has its votaries, where ſcience enlarges the mind, and where manly freedom is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued and enjoyed, nothing but a retrogration into the ſavage obſcurity often centuries ago can obſtruct or retard the rapidity of our progreſs.</p>
               <p>AFTER craving the kind indulgence of my reader, in gratifying me with a latitude to purſue an inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating fancy, I will venture to entruſt to his candor the harmleſs reveries of a leiſure hour.</p>

If from the firſt inhabiting this country in 1578 by a few ſettlers, under many difficulties (with annual imports from Europe, conſiderably leſs than at the preſent day) we have increaſed to the amazing number of three millions, for truly amazing it is—how much more rapid muſt be our progreſs for the next two centuries?</p>
               <p>WHERE the means of ſubſiſtence are eaſily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by induſtry, and a ſcope of country offers equal to the increaſe—the conjectures of population, formed by a very ingenious writer <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Franklin.</note> amongſt ourſelves, will certainly hold good.

               <p>TO take a more extenſive view of this grand ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it may not be amiſs to conſider the immenſity of the tract we have to cover. If we reckon from the Polar Circle paſſing through the ſouth part of Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the Tropic of Cancer paſſing through the Gulph of Mexico, we ſhall find an extent of country of 2967 miles, and admitting the lands weſtward, to extend on an average 55 degrees in longitude, there
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013760_0039_0F91A9EB4F4F6730"/>
will be at leaſt 2475 ſtatute miles; which number ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the latitude, viz. 2967 ſtatute miles, gives 7 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions 3 hundred and 43 thouſand 3 hundred and 25 ſquare ſtatute miles, and as each ſquare mile contains 640 acres, we may compute within the habitable part of America 4699 millions 7 hundred and 28 thouſand acres of land. If we divide this into farms of 100 acres each there will be 46 millions 9 hundred and 97 thouſand 2 hundred and 80 farms; and allowing each farm to maintain five perſons, the lands of North America will ſupport 234 millions nine hundred and 86 thouſand and four hundred inhabitants. Perhaps it will be ſaid that the great ſpaces covered by lakes, bays and rivers, and the large portion of land unfit for cultivation in every part of the continent, particularly in Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, will render a large diſcount neceſſary; but if we conſider what vaſt numbers collect in cities, towns, and villages, without a ſingle acre of ground to ten families, it may be reaſonably conjectured that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a more than ſufficient allowance will be made. But to take a more accurate ſight, let us look into the ſtate of countries already full ſettled with inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. England is reckoned by <hi>ſome</hi> writers, to contain 25 millions of acres and 4 millions 6 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſouls, and by <hi>others</hi> 39 millions of acres, and 6 million ſouls.—Suppoſe we take the medium—the number of acres will then be 32 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, and the inhabitants 5 millions 300 thouſand, which is but about ſix acres to each individual; whereas in our preceding calculation of the numbers in America, we have allowed only 5 ſouls to each 100 acres, being 20 acres each; which is above 3 times as much as is found neceſſary in England; but ſuppoſe we ſtr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> off for water, bad land, &amp;c. ſo large a proportion as <hi>one fourth,</hi> ſtill there will remain 15 acres to each ſoul, though they ſhould amount to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013760_0040_0F91A9ED401B7358"/>
the number before ſpecified, viz. 234,986,400, for a crooked round number ſay 235 millions; which is nearly equal to the number of inhabitants in Europe, Aſia and Africa; ſuppoſed by ſome writers to be about 300 millions.</p>
               <p>AS I proceed in this ſubject I am ſtruck with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the immenſity of the view before me; but when I contract my ſight to the minutia of the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal movements of England, I am aſtoniſhed at their debates. Could they dwarf the Americans like the tree of an eſpalier, well might they expect to reach and eat of the <hi>fruits</hi>; but when it tours from the ground, and ſpreads its lofty branches in the air— <hi>they</hi> are only to be acquired by the aid of its limbs.— America <hi>muſt</hi> grow—England <hi>muſt</hi> perceive it, and yet ſhe neglects to reaſon properly on the event. All the deſiderata of their government centre in power, and yet they are employing every poſſible agent to defeat their own purpoſes.—Wiſe and prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures would ſo conciliate the affections of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, that they would readily fall in with the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the <hi>proper</hi> legiſlative branch, and ſubmit to a negative controul for ages to come, if violence and oppreſſion did not rend them aſunder.</p>
               <p>THE ſeat of government reſts in England; all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable prices are veſted in the crown. The right of making war or peace are royal prerogatives. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, alliances and treaties, by which every Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, will eſteem himſelf bound, are determined in England. All conqueſts and new ceded countries, though even obtained by the aſſiſtance of the colonies, veſt in the King, without murmur or complaint. Shall England ſay then that America is independant, becauſe acts of Parliament are not permitted to tax
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013760_0041_0F91A9ED6A8E39E0"/>
her inhabitants.—Let them but be ſatisfied for the preſent, with the immediate advantages reſulting from mutual intercourſe, and in caſes of neceſſity from our voluntary aids, and then it may not be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to point out to them a fund, that may prove of the utmoſt importance.</p>
               <p>IT has already been ſhewn that America contains about 4,700 millions of acres, now if we ſuppoſe a quit rent to the crown of only one farthing ſterling per acre, it amounts to the annual ſum of 4 millions and 95 thouſand 8 hundred and 33 pounds. It will be ſaid that a great portion of the inhabited part of America is granted in charters, without ſuch quit rents being reſerved, and therefore it can never amount to the ſum here ſurmiſed. Let us then ſtrike off one fourth part, which will be a ſufficient allowance for the preſent ſettlements, as well as for waters and waſte lands as already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—But if the crown was to inſtruct its Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors to grant the lands as faſt as they are purchaſed of the natives to <hi>actual</hi> ſettlers, without the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant claims of a ſtring of officers, the quit rents might be raiſed to even <note n="‖" place="bottom">All lands hereafter granted in New-York are to bear a halfpenny ſterling quit-rent, and be ſold at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſale for the benefit of the Crown.</note> a halfpenny ſterling per acre, and the ſettlers would be gainers by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. Then ſtriking off one fourth of 4,700 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of acres, and affixing a halpenny ſterling on the remainder, viz. 3,525 millions, the annual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from the quit rents would be 7 millions 3 hundred and 43 thouſand 7 hundred and 50 pounds. Here would be a tax ſo equal and eaſy, that the wheels of government might move without friction, and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013760_0042_0F91A9F079642F38"/>
perform their annual revolutions without noiſe or jar. No man would complain of the burthen, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came part of the terms of his original contract. The ſcale on which I have ſet out I know is large, but not more ſo than the chart admits of; nor ſhould it be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by thoſe at the helm. Government will moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly derive great aſſiſtance from this ſource, ſmall as it may ſeem at preſent, if properly attended to. But they will do well to remember the force of their own arguments in their preſent debates, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently guard againſt the danger of our one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting them.</p>

And are we thus to go cap in hand?</hi>"—I hope, my Brethren, you will pardon my making ſuch large extracts from debates which you have already ſeen, but I thought it might not be amiſs, to take a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective view of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Parliament: I call it the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Parliament, becauſe countenanced by ſo large a majority; but does not the heart of every American boil with indignation in peruſing it?

We have taken a diſtant view of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe revenue ariſing to the Crown from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; a revenue that is already begun, and, if fully collected, amounts to no deſpicable ſum.</p>
               <p>IF "chartered rights are <hi>by no means ſacred things,</hi>" and we are to admit the doctrine of breaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, when
<q>unfit and inconvenient for public utility,</q>
how long time will thoſe hardy politicians allow to elapſe before America ſhall ſit in judgment on the queſtion. Will they call it fifty or 100 years; or will they vainly hope that heedleſs centuries will glide ſilently away, in tame and ſtupid ſubmiſſion to unnatural ſubjection. If the immenſe ſupplies from America are ſquandered away in profuſion and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; if the common enemies of the empire are gaining ground on our power, by the debaucheries and profligacy of an enfeebled and enervated ſyſtem of Britiſh policy, will not our ſucceſſors revive the arguments of the preſent day, and produce them as caſes in point. Let not a Britiſh Parliament rave with indignation at ſentiments like theſe, and ruſh impetuous into vindictive reſentment; let them rather ſit calmly down, like maſter builders, and wiſely count the coſt. Let them look back into their own <hi>hiſtory,</hi> and mark the progreſs of the State;—<hi>there</hi> they will find, that the power of England has ever
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013760_0045_0F91A9F4332D0F18"/>
been in an exact ratio to her commerce. How much then is her intereſt concerned in preſerving a good underſtanding with her Colonies.</p>
               <p>SOME, who affect to treat her trade to America with contempt, when compared with her other connexions, would do well to make an accurate view of the great commercial ſcale. The Princes of Europe, ſenſible of the vaſt importance of trade and manufactures, are every were exerting the utmoſt of their influence amongſt their ſubjects, to train and cultivate the commercial arts; how much England has already felt the effect of their deſigns, the languiſhing ſtate of <hi>ſome</hi> branches of their manufactures may feelingly and forcibly inform them. In Europe her ſyſtem of trade is contracting, but in America a moſt noble and extenſive field expands to her ſight. Here is her mart, here is the grand vent of her induſtrious artiſans. Let the <hi>Brtiſh Senate</hi> cultivate harmony and friendſhip, whilſt <hi>we</hi> till our fields? And, diſtant as our ſituations are, a waving band of Britiſh canvaſs ſhall unite us together, and a floating iſthmus of Royal Engliſh Oak ſhall extend through the main. Ship in ſight of ſhip ſhall unfold one of the wonders of Augur the ſon of Jakeh, and mark a
<q>way in the midſt of the ſea.</q>
               </p>
               <p>POSSIBLY ſome may be alarmed with the motion of granting to the Crown of England a halfpenny ſterling on our land. I acknowledge, on a curſory inſpection, the expediency of it may prove doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but, brethren, if you will pleaſe to indulge me a little further, in giving ſcope to a <hi>political imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> we will examine the ſubject in a pretty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive point of view.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:013760_0046_0F91A9F502B91908"/>THE levying of taxes on a nation, in ſuch juſt directions, as to fall equally on all, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, has been hitherto deemed one of the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal impoſſibilities of Government; but every ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who proſecutes the happineſs and ſtrength of a country, will make it his indefatigable ſtudy to approach as near to that deſired equality, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſtitution of the ſtate will admit.</p>
               <p>THERE are few governments in the world, but have ariſen to their preſent height of grandeur, or fallen to their preſent ſtate of decay, by inſenſible and unpremeditated gradations.—Barbariſm has leiſurely fled before civilization, without leaving any certain fixed plan behind. From century to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury the forms of government have been varied, but have ever been calculated to the meridian of the preſent day.—Perhaps it is left for us in America, boldly to chalk out a new plan, and ſhew to <hi>reviving</hi> Eaſtern realms, if <hi>reviving</hi> ſhould ever be their fate, that the true art of government is yet to unfold.— But I fear to proceed—methinks I grow preſumptuous in my views, and, brethren, your patience begins to be exhauſted—ſhall I proceed?—or ſhall I drop the pen?—You're ſilent—I'll venture on.—</p>
               <p>WHEN a country is ſo entenſive in itſelf, as to produce the means of ſubſiſtence to its inhabitants, its land may be juſtly ſaid, to be the origin and fountain of all its wealth; and the value of every article of its production, will in ſome meaſure be regulated by the value of the land. If the landlords of a country rent out their grounds at twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per acre, and the ground yields but ten buſhels of wheat per acre, and the wheat ſells but for two ſhillings per buſhel, the farmer will be inevitably
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013760_0047_0F91A9F5C2EEEE48"/>
ruined. Then either the landlord moſt lower his rent, or the wheat bring a higher price, otherwiſe the ground will remain untilled. If the eſtate is ſo circumſtanced, that the rent <hi>cannot be lowered,</hi> the wheat will undoubtedly riſe; for the farmer will not purſue his labour without a living pay. Thus the value of the produce of a country will ever bear a proportion to the <hi>value</hi> of the land, if that <hi>value</hi> cannot be abated; and, of conſequence, every inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant will be affected in proportion as he poſſeſſes more or leſs property. Now lands ſubject to <hi>Quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> are ſo circumſtanced, that the <hi>value</hi> in that reſpect <hi>cannot be abated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF we ſuppoſe all future lands granted in America to be charged with the annual payment of an half-penny ſterling per acre, the conſumers of the produce of the ſoil, muſt pay a certain proportion of the <hi>rent or tax</hi>; and thus there will be a pretty equal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution through the land. But to make ſome <hi>greater</hi> proviſion for a future <hi>greater</hi> day, theſe lands might be granted at an halfpenny for the firſt 100 years, conditioned to advance a halfpenny every century, for ten centuries to come; by which time, if not long before, the whole continent would probably be full ſettled. The neat revenue would then be ſeventy- three millions four hundred and thirty-ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred pounds; nor would this tax ever be thought high. Extenſively wild as theſe bounds may ſeem, they are ſtill within the limits which time ſhall encircle. When Egbert, the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of England, firſt ſwayed his ſcepter, it wanted but 27 years of being as diſtant from the reign of George the third as from the preſent important day to this mighty aera of American grandeur:— and <hi>ſix</hi> ſuch periods even <hi>then</hi> had rolled away ſince
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013760_0048_0F91A9F677E75338"/>
creation began. But to return—If it be ſaid, that the great difference in the qualities of the ſoil would render the tax unequal, it muſt be obſerved, that the worſt lands will always be the laſt taken up, and that every ſubſequent purchaſer of good land will pay proportionably more for it, as it excels in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. In countries where they are circumſcribed within narrow limits, and the ſea almoſts ſurrounds them, the inhabitants are obliged for ſubſiſtence to borrow ſupport from the main; therefore when the trade of ſuch a nation greatly exceeds the value of its lands, it is reaſonable to look to her commerce for aſſiſtance in defraying the neceſſary expence of government; as in England, where the whole rents of the land ſome years ago were eſtimated at only nine millions, when probably the pubic charges amounted to ſix.—But in this mighty continent the inland tracts are ſo immenſe, and ſo diſtant from the ſea, that a proper land tax, judiciouſly laid on all new granted lands, will in all probability, in a ſeries of years, anſwer every neceſſary expence.</p>
               <p>I HOPE I ſhall not hereby too much alarm the landed man, by propoſing to lay the whole burthen of the tax on the landed intereſt; for it ought to be conſidered that, with reſpect to future purchaſers, every man now reſident on the continent ſtands ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly on an equal footing; and every purchaſe made after ſuch a regulation, will be a fair and open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made between the purchaſer and the public: nay, it will prove an immediate advantage to the preſent land-holder, whoſe lands not being ſubject to ſuch an impoſt, like thoſe in England clear of tythes, will always command a higher price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:013760_0049_0F91A9F739858E30"/>TO provide an eaſy and equitable fund for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſervices is the <hi>ſecond</hi> grand object of a Legiſlature —the <hi>firſt</hi> being to ſecure the impartial adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice.</p>
               <p>NOW if we penetrate ſeriouſly into the important ſtudy of probable events, we ſhall certainly be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe, that when the numbers, power, and revenues of America exceed thoſe of Britain—<hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the ſeat of empire will ſurely take place.</hi>

               <p>GEORGE the Firſt, when called to the throne of England, never harboured ſo abſurd a thought as to wield the Engliſh ſceptre in the Electorate of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover; the centre of his dominions was the place of his choice; nor would the nation have been ſatisfied without it. How long it may be before a ſimilar tranſlation ſhall happen in favour of America, I will not undertake to determine—but ſhould the Georges in regular ſucceſſion wear the Britiſh diadem to a number ranking with the Louis's of France, many a goodly Prince of that royal line will have mingled his aſhes with American duſt; and not many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may paſs away, before one of the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the World, on aſcending his throne, ſhall declare with exulting joy, "<hi>Born and educated amongſt you, I glory in the name of</hi> AMERICAN."</p>
               <p>WHEN this important day arrives, as arrive it moſt ſurely will, if kind Providence is pleaſed to bleſs us with harmony and peace amongſt ourſelves, can there be a more pleaſing, more joyful proſpect for our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, than to receive their Monarch with a revenue ready prepared, a revenue ſufficient to anſwer every exigency of the State.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:013760_0050_0F91A9F7EC1C9270"/>ENGLAND may ſmile, with contemptuous ſneer, at theſe vain chimeras of an American brain; but ſo certainly as events follow their cauſes, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets purſue their wonted revolutions, the empire of Britain will devolve on America. Theſe are truths which I want to imprint on every mind, which I wiſh every American to feel; and then with manly dignity they will aſſert their rights, nor baſely cringe to the lawleſs uſurpation of unreaſonable power.</p>
               <p>IF it were not diverging too far from the idea of <hi>Political Reflections,</hi> I would conclude them with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding a conjecture which has in ſome ſort ariſen out of the vaſtneſs of the ſubject.</p>
               <p>A NEW world is now opening before us, and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity is extending her wings over theſe Weſtern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of ignorance. Aſia, Africa, and Europe have had the glad <hi>tidings of ſalvation</hi> ſounded amongſt them, and by the bleſſed influence of a heavenly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator are every where ſpreading amongſt unbelievers —perhaps when Barbariſm and Infidelity are expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from the face of the globe, and Chriſtianity has univerſally extirpated the ſeed of ſin—Earth may have done her work—the ſurrounding impulſions on matter may be withdrawn, and all Nature be diſperſed, in the twinkling of an eye, into the boundleſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of ſpace, when every unembodied ſoul ſhall inſtantly flow back in rapture to that immenſurable ocean of love and mercy, from whence it originally derived.</p>

Though the writer of theſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> for reaſons which he then thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, brought them to a cloſe in his laſt paper, yet fired with the grateful idea of ſerving his country, and holding up his hand againſt the engines of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, he ventures with ſubmiſſive deference to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his pen: Nor ſhall the envenomed ſhafts of malicious inſinuations <note n="‖" place="bottom">Theſe papers were attacked in ſome of the publick prints with great virulence, as breathing too much of the ſpirit of moderation —<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>WHEN impending ruin awaits an ill judged ſtep, and to retreat is worſe than to advance, is it to be eſteemed culpable or ſtrange, that the man of caution and prudence ſhould move with deliberation, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with diſtruſt?—With many ſuch I have met, but yet have never dared to declare them diſaffected to the cauſe, or traitors to their country.

you, that we ought carefully to avoid attempting more than we can perfect; and the obſervation is undoubtedly juſt: But then it remains to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, what <hi>are</hi> thoſe things in which the danger lies; ſome of them will ſay, that the Colonies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without their annual imports from Great- Britain; therefore, if we ſhould agree to a general non-importation, and the Parliament ſhould reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold out, we muſt ſink in the conflict as ſoon as our ſtock in hand is exhauſted, and be reduced to ſue for peace on their own terms. Humiliating thought indeed!—But I truſt, my brethren, theſe fears are groundleſs.—Grant me but <hi>one point,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> by no means an <hi>impracticable one</hi> to a reſolute and virtuous people, and I think a <hi>mode</hi> may be ſtruck out, which would enable us to ſtand the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary ſiege, though <hi>ſeven times longer than the ſiege of Troy</hi>—The <hi>point</hi> I beg you to grant me is, <hi>that you will content yourſelves with the abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for the mere ſupport of the body</hi>; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſuade myſelf to doubt the manly reſolution of the Americans, in ſpurning at the idea of foreign luxuries when ſet in competition with "<hi>eſſential li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>" —Shall ſlavery, with all her direful train, be ſuffered to ſurround our dwellings, and impriſon us with chains and bolts of our own forging?—Shall the independant ſpirit of a free American, that would brave the fierceſt enemy, ſink proſtrate at the unworthy feet of luxury, and ſurrender up our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rights for the paultry pomp and pageantry of unmanly tinſel.—How think ye were your brave forefathers dreſſed, when with truly Britiſh ſouls they withſtood the ſtorms of invading neighbours, and bared their brawny muſcles to advance on the daring foe?—Did they wanton, think you, in the flowery ſilks of Perſia, and tarniſh their growing

glory with embelliſhed veſts? Did the ſparkling gems of India, or the ſhining glare of Peruvian ore, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the emboldened minds of your martial an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors? —No.—But we will not ſearch deep into the records of antiquity for inſtances of ſtern manly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. I truſt the true ſeeds of Britiſh honour are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the breaſt of every Britiſh ſon, and when called forth, by the enlivening rays of the glorious ſun of liberty, they will bloſſom with fragrance, and bear in abundance.—I call you then, my brethren, I entreat you with ardor, to remove every obſtruction that impedes your road, and your childrens road, to the temple of happineſs.</p>
               <p>LET us, my brethren, conſider <hi>what are the real and abſolute neceſſaries of life.</hi> We ſhall find them preſently reduced to the two ſimple points of <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the ſupport of our natures,</hi> and <hi>coverings from the inclemencies of the weather.</hi> The former an all gracious Providence has amply and generouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided us; a proviſion for which my heart, with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential gratitude, bows at his Almighty throne, and thankfully accepts for me and mine my humble ſhare; and may every depending ſoul unite with me in humiliating wonder and amazement at the <hi>merciful</hi> continuation of his bleſſing to a people too much eſtranged from his ways. What do we ſtand in need of, which the various climes of this extenſive conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent will not indulge? If the ſpices of India are withheld from our tables, perhaps we may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in their ſtead, the fragrance of health. But to provide for the heats, and the colds, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of dreſs, may require a more earneſt attention. Every neceſſary for <hi>ſhelter from the weather</hi> we have amongſt ourſelves, and the means of procuring every <hi>neceſſary</hi> implement of labour and huſbandry. Stone,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013760_0054_0F91AA0029097670"/>
clay, lime, timber, iron, oil and paints, abound in our land: We have alſo lead; and if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ourſelves with the ſimple idea of <hi>ſhelter from the weather,</hi> the workmen we have amongſt us will effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſupply our wants. Glaſs for windows can be made amongſt us; and, if encouraged, will grow in quantity; and though we can't immediately be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with all we want, yet when our neceſſity calls on our virtue for ſupport, we ſhall find that <hi>ſmall rooms</hi> and <hi>few</hi> of them will not be abſolute ſudden diſſolution to the ſoft framed Lady, or fine formed Beau.—Let us but take a view through the country, and we ſhall find many a healthy happy pair, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a numerous offspring, beneath the ſcanty roof of one ſingle room.—Let us look round the walls of their homely cot, and then when we return to our plenteous cities, we may cry with the Athenian Philoſopher,
<q>How many things are here, which I do not want.</q>
—But to return to the principal and moſt important object, our clothes. Many parts of the continent are ſo well adapted to the raiſing of flax, that it might become a ſtaple article; and in others, a little further to the ſouthward, hemp might be improved to good advantage, on ground not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very rich; and cotton we know will come to good perfection in the Carolinas and Georgia; theſe, when wrought up, will provide us very amply with ſummer wear; for I aſſure you, brethren, it is very poſſible for the <hi>faireſt Lady and fineſt Gentleman</hi> to <hi>exiſt,</hi> at leaſt four months of the twelve, with theſe American productions, though <hi>rough and coarſe.</hi> But the greateſt difficulty is to provide for the winter blaſts, in our northern colonies. The wool raiſed on the continent is yearly conſumed amongſt us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the amount of woollens, formerly imported from England, we muſt now think of a ſubſtitute in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013760_0055_0F91AA023615A078"/>
America, if Parliament ſhould hold out the ſiege, till our ſtores are exhauſted, and our clothes are in rags; which ſome think they will certainly attempt.—In part to remedy this evil, it might be well immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to revive the reſolution, formerly taken, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the breed of our ſheep, by preſerving the lambs, to as great a number as the farms can poſſibly ſupport; though this, I am ſenſible, will not furniſh us a ſufficient ſupply for many years to come. The Neutrals formerly ſettled on our Commons, being reduced to great want, picked their old clothes to pieces, and new ſpun them up: An example not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of imitation.</p>
               <p>A FULL ſuit of clothes, for a common ſized man, will take about ſeven pounds of wool, and perhaps more for a woman; which I believe will require, on an average, at leaſt three ſheep: Therefore if every farm conſiſt of five perſons, as ſome wills be women, and ſome children, we may ſuppoſe it to require <hi>fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſheep</hi> to ſupply the family in clothes; a number not very conſiderable, and yet perhaps more by one fourth than our farms, one with another, ſupport; and then, as a conſiderable part of the inhabitants in each province dwell in towns and villages, the number of ſheep muſt ſtill be further increaſed, before <hi>they</hi> can be ſupplied: and after all, we have made no allowance for ſtockings, or coverings to our beds, which articles alone will at preſent conſume all the wool on the continent. Thus we might be reduced at laſt, by an obſtinate perſevering Miniſter, to an abſolute ſubmiſſion, if we had no other <hi>reſourſe.</hi> A fear of this, I am perſuaded, diſcourages many from joining heartily in a non-importation agreement. But happily for us, we <hi>have</hi> that reſource. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource which <hi>cannot</hi> fail us, if our <hi>pride</hi> does not ſtand
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013760_0056_0F91AA0271A0D968"/>
in the way.—What think you, my brethren, of LEATHERN DOUBLETS—do you ſtart at the thought with indignation, or will you ſacrifice your fancy for gentility to the ſaving of your country.— The deer ſkins annually ſhipped from America, if immediately ſtopped exporting, will amount to a quantity <hi>ſufficient to clothe the whole of our inhabitants,</hi> by the time our ſtock of woollens is exhauſted. I knew a labouring man who had a buckſkin veſt, which laſted him <hi>ſeventeen</hi> winters, and is ſtill in wear.—The Beau may keep up the ſprightly buff, the farmer may tinge them ruſſet grey, and the bench, the bar, and the pulpit may ſtill put on the ſable dye; nor would a Lady's ſkirts be diſgraced by the ſkin of a doe— what nation think ye, would <hi>dare</hi> attempt enſlaving theſe men in <hi>leathern jerkins?</hi>—Firm, ſtout, and independant, they might defy the malice of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whilſt their fields found them bread, and their woods wrought their clothes.—'Tis not a viſionary ſcheme, it is both practicable and prudent; and if any ten gentlemen in this city will order a full ſuit of buckſkin againſt the fall, the <hi>Political Reflector</hi> will heartily join the number.—I know they will be warm, and I am ſure they will be ſtrong; nor would I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſtockings, I have had them made of doe ſkin dyed black, and much reſembled ſilk. Should this ſcheme generally take place, our ſheep might have time to encreaſe, and our ſtocks of Engliſh woollen might laſt the longer. The gain hereby to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent would be immenſe; for if we ſuppoſe only one million of men, who wear a complete ſuit of clothes each, there will be at leaſt three millions ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand yards of broadcloth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, which, on an average at eight ſhillings ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling per yard, amounts to one million five hundred thouſand pounds ſterling; and ſuppoſe our patriot
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013760_0057_0F91AA032B8232E8"/>
ſuit to laſt us only <hi>ſeven years,</hi> before we caſt it off for our ſervants, there would be a ſaving in the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Great Britain of ten millions five hundred thouſand ſterling; from which perhaps we ought to deduct three millions five hundred thouſand for the actual coſt of the ſkins to the Indians, which would be a large allowance. Thus we ſhould ſave <hi>a million ſterling a year</hi> for the ſeven years, beſides the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our ſervants a year or two more; for I will not ſuppoſe them all to be ſuch good economiſts as the labourer abovementioned. I beg, brethren, you will conſider this point well. The ſummer's ſun now ſhines with all its force, and the ſcorching heats of a ſouthern climate almoſt annihilate the remembrance of the ſhivering blaſts of a northern wind, but <hi>ſoon</hi> they will be with you, and truſt me, brethren, you will find a buckſkin ſuit a <hi>faithful friend</hi> in a winter's day. Then inſtantly let us agree to ſtop the exportation of deer ſkins; and encourage our ſkinners to fall to work.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER ſubject I would beg leave to remark on. We are now on every hand preparing for a Congreſs from the ſeveral colonies; and much will depend on the wiſdom and unanimity of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; it is a ſentiment that cannot be too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on. Various are the conjectures of the <hi>mode</hi> which ſhould be adopted by them when met; all agree in the neceſſity of an earneſt and ſpirited <hi>addreſs,</hi> but many contend that till the effect of the addreſs is known, no other ſtep ſhould be taken. I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge though I eſteem an addreſs abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as a piece of decent and reſpectful decorum, and as a proof of our hearty diſpoſition to renew our former union and good underſtanding, yet I dare not flatter myſelf with the expectation of much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013760_0058_0F91AA03EACE3C98"/>
from <hi>that</hi> only. If we deny their power, they may refuſe us a hearing; nor indeed can they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently</hi> liſten to our claims whilſt the act remains in full force, by which they declare their "<hi>right to bind us in all caſes whatever.</hi>" That act muſt be repealed before they will conſent to treat with us; and year after year may ſlide away in the nogociation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive that our reſolutions of withholding from them the benefit of our cuſtom, ſhould take place at ſome certain time to be fixed at the <hi>congreſs.</hi> It will probably be <hi>then</hi> too late to ſtop the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Fall's goods, but before the next Spring orders could be complied with, we might be certain of their <hi>receiving</hi> or <hi>rejecting</hi> our addreſs. They may poſſibly at firſt treat our advances with contempt, but they will find it a ſerious buſineſs; and that we are cuſtomers not to be trifled with. They muſt at laſt be reduced to <hi>treat</hi> with us, and to <hi>treat</hi> with us on the footing of <hi>friends</hi>; friends who would wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in their boſoms the pleaſing connexions which formerly ſubſiſted; connexions which have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make both them and us a great and happy people. Matters are now reduced to ſuch a criſis, that it becomes abſolutely neceſſary to form a <hi>charter of connexions.</hi> The repeated exertions of parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary power, over one of our ſiſter colonies, muſt juſtly alarm every province on the continent. If no bounds are to be preſcribed to their <hi>wills,</hi> if penal laws are to be made from time to time, by a Britiſh Senate, for the puniſhment of paſt ſuppoſed offences, without even calling on the delinquents to make their defence, I contend that the vaſſals of an eaſtern monarch are <hi>as free</hi> and <hi>as happy</hi> as the ſubjects in America. But perhaps the eyes of England may be opened, and they will diſcover the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of giving us a <hi>Bill of Rights</hi>—if ſo—with whom ſhall they treat? Is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013760_0059_0F91AA04F924DC48"/>
they will enter into ſo important a negociation, with the Members of the enſuing congreſs? It is with ſubmiſſion, I declare my belief, that they will object to that body, as not being the legal repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the people.—For if Great Britain were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to fix the terms of our future connexion, and ſhould demand from the Members of the congreſs <hi>their credentials,</hi> and whether they thought themſelves fully empowered by the voice of the people, to ſettle the ſolemn boundaries of power, think you, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they would venture on the arduous and mighty taſk.</p>
               <p>IT is ſinning to be ſilent, where ſo much is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; and the man who holds his peace when the fate of nations is at ſtake, deſerves neither the protection of civil government, nor the bleſſings of liberty.—I <hi>cannot</hi> be ſilent—I <hi>muſt</hi> declare that though the preſent congreſs is a neceſſary ſtep, and the mode of appointing it the only way left in our power, yet when we and our poſterity are to be bound by the line of the preſent day, if government at home ſhould now call on us to <hi>run that line</hi>—I muſt contend that the <hi>men</hi> to whom this ſolemn charge is committed, ſhould receive the <hi>full and united voice</hi> of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. When once the boundaries are eſtabliſhed, and the laſting way marks of future ages engroſſed on the important parchment, it may not be eaſy to get them removed or erazed: Much then does it behove us to ſet out <hi>conſtitutionally</hi> and regularly on this grand deſign.</p>
               <p>WHEN an individual ſhall dare to ſtep forth with his private opinion, and offer it to public notice, on affairs of the utmoſt moment to his country, much does he riſque in the attempt. Whilſt ſome will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the buſy promptneſs of impertinent zeal,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013760_0060_0F91AA06EB9F2128"/>
                  <hi>others,</hi> with ſuſpicious anger, will charge on his guilty head, the barbarous deſigns of a miſchievous incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary.—Hard is the <hi>middle</hi> path to find. To preſerve the due equilibrium of an <hi>upright conſcience,</hi> and the deſirable reputation of an <hi>honeſt citizen,</hi> requires both dexterity and virtue in a greater degree than gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally falls to our ſhare. But let not the way faring man hereby be diſmayed; let him boldly diſcharge his conſcious duty, and leave to the grand diſpoſer of events the reward of his labours.</p>
               <p>IF we ſift into the motions of empires, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſults of deep held councils, we ſhall find the whole proceeds from <hi>ſingle ſentiment of man by man</hi>; ſhall then a fear of being ſingular in opinion ſuppreſs the riſing thought and ſtifle a conception at its birth? Or ſhall we not rather proclaim with ſocial toleration, "He that hath a dream, let him tell his dream." Then with reſpectful deference to my countrymen, I would beg leave to propoſe, that in the addreſs to be preſented to his Majeſty by the congreſs—they ſhould pray, that he would be pleaſed to give inſtructions to all his Governors on the continent, to give their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a law, to be preſented them by the ſeveral Aſſemblies, for the appointing two or more perſons from each province to join in a great continental council, for the purpoſe of determining the grand ſubject of an <hi>American Bill of Rights</hi>; which grand council ſhould, by the ſeveral bills, have full power given them to proceed to London, and to enter upon the negociation with the legiſlature of Great Britain; and when finally adjuſted, be reciprocally binding on Great Britain and the colonies. This would be a legal and firm contract; and as it would be determined on and agreed to, by men appointed by aſſemblies choſen by the people, no poſſible objection could ariſe on the part of the Americans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:013760_0061_0F91AA07A99873E8"/>THE neceſſity of ſuch a legal congreſs cannot be too much inſiſted on; and were every letter wrote home to our friends in England, to convey the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, I know nothing more likely to affect it. The diſturbances that have already ariſen, and which muſt be expected ſtill to ariſe, from time to time, <hi>muſt</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the neceſſity of determining the point of power <hi>where</hi> it is to lye, and <hi>how far</hi> it is to extend.</p>
               <p>EVERY difference between the Colonies and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land will be grateful news to our natural enemies, and nothing can be more deſirable by them than an open quarrel. How far <hi>French gold</hi> may contribute to widen the breach, and ſpur up a reigning mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to enlarge in his claims, may be difficult to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veil; but the hiſtory of courts gives us too many fatal proofs of the baſeneſs of corruption to leave us without fear. If the preſent Miniſtry are from under the influence, we have no time to loſe.</p>
               <p>BUT to return—Some may probably conceive, that the members of the preſent congreſs are veſted with full powers, if the people of England were diſpoſed to enter on the buſineſs; but we have already ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they would not undertake it. The modes of appointing them have been ſo various, and in ſome caſes through neceſſity ſo quickly determined on, that it is much to be doubted, whether a line <hi>run by them</hi> would be eſteemed by their conſtituents ſufficiently authentic.</p>
               <p>IN the ſeveral interior concerns of our private po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, we carefully attend to the legal choice of men who are to tranſact our affairs:—How much more eſſential then is it, to eſtabliſh on its proper baſis ſo important a ſuperſtructure as is now to be reared.

There never was a <hi>treaty</hi> ſince creation began, ſo extenſive in its conſequence, and ſo nice to diſcuſs.

               <p>AS it is the happy and undoubted right of every <hi>freeman</hi> to ſpeak his candid ſentiments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve or controul, I cannot, in juſtice to the cauſe of liberty, ſuppreſs a few remarks on ſome of the reſolves entered into by the Pennſylvania Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee; whilſt, at the ſame time, I join the general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of their well tempered ſpirit, and general mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>THE firſt reſolve I would beg leave to remark on is the 13th, in which they declare,
<q>That the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of merchandize of every kind within this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ought not to take advantage of the reſolves relating to non-importation in this province and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013760_0063_0F91AA0AD6B76A18"/>
elſewhere; but that they ought to ſell their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, which they now have, or may hereafter import, at the ſame rates they have been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do within three months laſt paſt.</q>—This is a ſubject I have very attentively conſidered, and I cannot conceive upon what <hi>policy, prudence, or juſtice,</hi> the reſolve is founded.</p>
               <p>A VERY conſiderable number of worthy honeſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens and countrymen, for their own comfortable ſubſiſtence, and the public convenience of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have thrown their fortunes into the dry good bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, upon the reaſonable confidence of a probable ſale, and living profit; and their expectations have been pleaſingly gratified; they have acquired repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in their ſeveral neighbourhoods, a plentiful ſupport for their families, and are ranked amongſt the uſeful members of ſociety. At length the unhappy diſſentions of the times point out <hi>theſe men</hi> as the only probable <hi>means</hi> by which we are to obtain relief. We are obliged to tell them, Gentlemen, the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our country oblige us with reluctance to call on you for a ſacrifice, which we are fully ſenſible muſt be highly injurious to your intereſts.—<hi>You</hi> only are the men by whom redreſs can come; and on <hi>your</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and diſintereſted love of your country, we are ſolely to rely; therefore we requeſt you for the cauſe of liberty, for the ſake of tranſmitting freedom to <hi>your</hi> children, and <hi>our</hi> children, to lend us your aid to ſave our country. By every generous manly breaſt ſuch a requiſition would be received with <hi>reſolute,</hi> but <hi>ſorrowful</hi> aſſent.</p>
               <p>MEN who have engaged their fortunes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions in a particular channel of trade, cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily divert them into others; nor indeed is there
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013760_0064_0F91AA0B6E1AEAE0"/>
room for the change, Thoſe men, who have many of them ſupported handſome figures in ſociety now find themſelves called on to ſerve their country, at the riſk of their fortunes; for ſhould the diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any length of time, and the non-importation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unbroken, the ſources of their living muſt fail them, and the merchant and retailer muſt break in upon their principal; and we well know there are many amongſt us, who ſupport a good and fair credit upon ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> a capital, that a ſhort ceſſation would reduce them to great diſtreſs; yet the nature of the caſe is ſuch, that on <hi>theſe men</hi> we are obliged to call for a ſacrifice, that may perhaps prove their <hi>ruin.</hi> A love for the liberties of their country ſilences their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and truſting to the virtuous generoſity of their countrymen they ſubmit to their fate; but how great muſt be their ſurprize, think you, when they are told, that they are not only to be deprived of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive benefit of trade, which they once enjoyed in common with the reſt of their fellow citizens and countrymen, but that they muſt alſo be ſtripped of the <hi>poor little reſource</hi> that was left them, of <hi>raiſing the prices of their goods,</hi> whereby every conſumer, by paying a ſmall matter more than he had been uſed to pay, would contribute his proportion of the burthen in a manner which would be leaſt likely to wound the delicacy of the ſufferer. Should a purchaſer now pay ten ſhillings more in the price of a piece of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, than when the importation was open, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant would receive it with freedom and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as ſome kind of compenſation for his loſſes; but if, inſtead thereof, he ſhould hereafter be obliged to receive it as an <hi>alms</hi> from his country, how deep would be the wound, and where is the man ſo void of ſenſibility as to wiſh to inflict it!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:013760_0065_0F91AA0D61830290"/>WHEN public calamities admit of no reſource but the ſacrifice of individuals, and the miſfortunes of a nation, are only to be averted by offering them up as victims, at the altar of ruin, the wretched ſufferers muſt bow to their unhappy doom, and forfeit their <hi>all</hi> to their country's weal. Was this the ſad caſe at preſent, I ſhould hold my mournful peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign them with ſorrow to their fate. But will any man riſe up and and ſay—<hi>they</hi> are the men and <hi>they only,</hi> who <hi>muſt</hi> bear the loſs.—I beſeech you grant them one ſhadow of a reaſon to make them conſent; either convince them, that it is for their ſakes alone, that the preſent ſtruggle is engaged in, or that you are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unable to lend them your aſſiſtance:—If you do neither, where lies the virtue of your conteſt.
<q>Other mens troubles,</q>
ſays Swift,
<q>we bear with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</q>
other mens money we ſpend with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I fear it is a decree that ſullies both our virtue, and our cauſe.—Where are the men that will ſerve us with fidelity, when we conſign them and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending families to miſery and poverty?—Where, I pray is the ſacrifice which <hi>we</hi> make on this important occaſion? But I cannot, my Brethren, perſuade my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to believe, that you mean to leave it here; that you mean to take no ſhare of the burthen.—If you do —though I ſhould ſtand alone—I muſt proteſt againſt the injuſtice of the determination.</p>
               <p>I AM not unaware of the reflections which may be caſt on the hardy impertinence of an individual, who dares to diſſent from the united voice of ſo reſpectable a body as that great committee, for ſorry I am to find, that the vote was unanimous. Had it been the reſolve of a general Congreſs, from whence there lay no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, a ſubmiſſive ſilence might more juſtly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as that grand council is yet to meet, and to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013760_0066_0F91AA0DAF18C728"/>
take into conſideration the ſeveral reſolves of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, any previous ſtrictures ought not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Perhaps I may be miſtaken in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of this matter, and ſhould be extremely obliged to any Gentleman to quiet my ſcruples.</p>
               <p>ARGUMENTS may poſſibly be adduced in ſupport of the meaſure, which have never occurred to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; it is not from a vindictive tenacity of opinion, that I am thus ſtrenuous, but from a deſire of obſerving the ſtricteſt rules of juſtice in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Some I know have objected to our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the hard caſe of the merchant and retailer, affirming "<hi>that it is a meaſure the country have been ever averſe to:</hi>" If it be really ſo, why have not the reſolves from the ſeveral counties declared it?—I have carefully examined moſt of them, if not all, and don't remember to have met with ſuch a ſentiment; nor can I conceive the country ſo void of generoſity as to wiſh to regain their liberties without bearing their ſhare of the burthen. I will not believe they deſerve ſo injurious a reflection, nor that they deſire ſo unjuſt an exemption.—Let it not be ſaid that the meaſure of a non-importation, if ſpiritedly entered into, will ſoon effect its purpoſe, and that by the time the merchant has ſold off his ſtock, the diſpute will be over, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will be no ſufferer by the reſtriction. It ſhould be remembered, the profit of the vender ariſes from the quantity of goods ſold, and that whenever his ſtore remains without a ſupply his ſales muſt be daily leſs. He that imports three thouſand ſterling per annum, is ſuppoſed to ſell annually to that amount; and of courſe whenever his imports ſtop, his ſales muſt begin to decreaſe; in leſs than twelve months his ſtore will be unſorted, and his choice of goods ſo ſmall that the profits on his ſales will ſcarce pay his houſe rent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:013760_0067_0F91AA0E6D984D60"/>IF for argument ſake we admit that the diſpute will be ſettled by the time his ſtock is diſpoſed of, yet he will be a conſiderable ſufferer by the deficiency of his ſales, and the length of time that will unavoidably elapſe before he obtains a freſh ſupply. But on the other hand, if our oppoſition ſhould be ſlower in its operation than our ſanguine wiſhes would lead us to hope, what are the unhappy traders to do? To what branch of buſineſs can they fly for ſupport? Their numbers are great, their families large, and many of them far advanced in life. Shall we ſend them to the woods to hew down the trees, and learn thus late in life the laborious buſineſs of agriculture.—Think not that I am endeavouring to draw an exaggerated pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſtreſs; it is from the feelings of my heart I ſpeak, feelings which ſhould awaken every mind to attend to the ſituation of a brother, and impreſs it with a deſire of aſſiſting to ward off an impending blow.</p>
               <p>SOME may ſay the accumulated profits of their trade will amply enable them to ſuſtain a ceſſation of buſineſs; but we well know ſmall is the number thus circumſtanced; yet admitting it was generally the caſe, what mode of reaſoning can be produced to ſhew the neceſſity of <hi>their</hi> bearing the whole load on their ſhoulders, whilſt the reſt of us who are <hi>equally intereſted,</hi> are <hi>equally able.</hi> The incumbent expences of government are never ſo large, even in times of the greateſt danger, but that a few amongſt the great and rich, could provide the ſupplies; yet what legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature ever undertook to levy on <hi>them</hi> more than their juſt proportion. The man of inferior circumſtance, is called on for his mite, and a juſt contribution is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed through the land; and thus would it be in the caſe before us, ſhould the prices of goods be advanced;
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013760_0068_0F91AA0F7AE9C598"/>
the rich who conſume the moſt in quantity, and the higheſt in price, will conſequently pay a proportion ſuitable to their abilities; and thoſe who are the leaſt able to pay will always be the ſmalleſt cuſtomers. But let us ſuppoſe that the prices of goods ſhould be advanced, that the merchant ſhould have a briſk ſale, and that the conteſt between Britain and the colonies ſhould be ſuddenly over; ought we not to rejoice that they are gainers by the ſacrifice they ſo frankly made, or ſhall we with avaricious ſouls begrudge them the reward of their virtue? They certainly riſque much in the ſtruggle, then why ſhould we deprive them of the chance of gain? To judge properly on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, let every man ſuppoſe himſelf a vender of goods, and then let him be aſked the queſtion, <hi>what part he apprehended the community ought to take in his behalf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE only poſſible <hi>reaſon,</hi> that I can conceive to operate againſt taking their ſituation into notice, is a <hi>reaſon</hi> which I hope we ſhall never have occaſion to apply. I mean the ſtopping our exports to the Weſt Indies. Should this be done, I muſt then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſo heavy a burthen would fall on the <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> that we ought not to raiſe on <hi>them</hi> the prices of goods; <hi>they</hi> would be ſufficiently diſtreſſed, by the reduction of the prices of their own produce, and well might they object to the encreaſed demand of the dry good merchant, when their wheat, their corn, their pork, and their lumber, remained drugs on their hands.</p>
               <p>IN a former number I objected to the mode of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining redreſs of our grievances, by diſtreſſing the Weſt India iſlands, but forbore to extend my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings on the ſubject, ſo far as it would bear; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering myſelf, that a meaſure that had neither ſound policy, nor juſtice, for its ſupport, would need but
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013760_0069_0F91AA1024A46EA0"/>
ſmall oppoſition: but I ſince find, that the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Pennſplvania, in their twelfth reſolve, declare,
<q>that if any proceedings of the parliament, of which notice ſhall be received on this continent, before, or at the general Congreſs ſhall render it neceſſary in the opinion of that Congreſs for the colonies <hi>to take further ſteps than are mentioned in the eleventh Reſolve,</hi> (viz. non-importation from, and non-exportation to Great Britain,) in ſuch caſe the inhabitants of this province <hi>ſhall adopt ſuch further ſteps,</hi> and do all in their power to carry them into execution.</q>
This reſolve I confeſs has conſiderably alarmed me, a reſolve which though it did not paſs without conſiderable debates, and had no great majority in its favour, yet is ſo extenſive in its nature, as to deſerve a ſerious examination. How far the Committee appointed by the Houſe of Aſſembly in this province, will be inſtructed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the reſolve, is beſt known to themſelves, but I hope they have adverted to the probable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a non-exportation to the iſlands.</p>
               <p>WHEN we reaſon from conjectures, and draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from probabilities, I am ſenſible of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of our purſuits; yet many of the affairs of men are ſo circumſtanced, that they admit of no other guide, and hence ariſes the neceſſity of judging of future by paſt tranſactions.</p>
               <p>WE find the parliament of Great Britain, by a moſt unjuſtifiable exertion of power, have diveſted private perſons of property, a town of its trade, and a whole country of its chartered privileges, without <hi>a charge or a hearing.</hi> When power is veſted in <hi>ſuch hands,</hi> what is there too great, or too daring for them to attempt.—Miſtake me not, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I am not about to perſuade you to relinquiſh
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013760_0070_0F91AA13C47C9710"/>
a jot of your juſt pretenſions, from principles of fear or apprehenſions of danger, I mean but to perſuade you to a reſolute and prudent oppoſition; an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which juſtice will ſtand by, and virtue approve. Leave not theſe haughty rulers the leaſt ſhadow of pretence for diſplaying their power, but convince them by your wiſdom and perſeverance, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our reſolutions, they muſt ſubmit to our terms.</p>
               <p>TO alarm with falſe fears of a precipice, when the wide plain is open to our view, or to point out a danger where all is in ſafety, would juſtly merit ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule and contempt; but when objects intervene, or miſts obſcure the proſpect, let thoſe who advance be ſure they are right, when they ſend round the watch word, and cry "all's well." As a faithful cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel to my country, I can't help declaring, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry the approach of an enemy, and warn you to keep on your guard—What if we ſhould mount up the tower of <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> and take a view of the ſcenes before us.—The Congreſs are met—they determine to ſtop all exports of proviſions and lumber to the iſlands; <hi>not for any miſconduct of the inhabitants,</hi> but that by pinching them with <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>want,</hi> their brethren and friends in England may hear their piercing cries, and urged from motives of humanity and compaſſion to <hi>them,</hi> may plead for <hi>us.</hi>—Their cries are heard—the Parliament is aſſembled; for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it our preſent miniſter will not advance a ſtep out of the common road, without the ſanction of the nation.—He informs them that the Americans have formed the cruel reſolution of ſtarving the <hi>iſlands,</hi> and that by diſpatches from <hi>thence</hi> they are under the greateſt conſternation, from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a general inſurrection of their negroes and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013760_0071_0F91AA14D2A744C0"/>
an approaching famine. As every compaſſionate mind kindles quickly at ſcenes of diſtreſs, and fires with reſentment at the cruel perpetrators, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly produced, the means of ſpeedy relief are inſtantly ſought for—the general murmurs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land amongſt the poor, at the exorbitant price of the neceſſaries of life, render it an unadviſed ſcheme to ſupply the unhappy ſufferers with proviſions from thence; as thereby the prices would be raiſed on themſelves, and the people might clamor for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to our claims—What is to be done—a valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the territories of the nation is likely to be deſtroyed, by the barbarous policy of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans—How are they to act? Let us take a review of the ſentiments of the Engliſh, when Corſica was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the French.—How loud did the nation clamour in favour of diſtreſſed innocence, and how many amongſt them would gladly have plunged into a war with France, to reſcue the Corſicans from their approaching miſery? And had the rulers at the helm poſſeſſed the ſame knight errantring genius, their liberties might have been ſaved, at the expence of a few hundred thouſand lives, I hope I ſhall not here be underſtood, that I had no commiſeration for the calamities of a brave and depreſſed people—but when two evils preſent, the leaſt is to be choſen. When the poor foundering bark is toſſed with the inclement ſtorm and driven amidſt the foaming rocks with daſhing fury, we may view with ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic agony of ſoul, the horrors of the ſcene, and pity from our hearts the trembling ſinking crew; but cannot do more, for inſtant diſtruction to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would be inevitable in the attempt.—But the caſe now before us is quite the reverſe. The very ſummit of miniſterial wiſh is to "<hi>lay us proſtrate at their feet:</hi>" therefore whenever the ſame ſpirit of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013760_0072_0F91AA16C4E036F8"/>
compaſſion ariſes in the breaſts of the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on behalf of the inhabitants of their <hi>own</hi> iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, they will find a daring miniſtry prompt at their ſervice, ready to work up their wrath, and kindle their rage.—Is it not likely they will tell the nation—you <hi>ſhall</hi> not ſuffer by ſupplying the iſlands. —Your colonies have broken through every tie of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>humanity,</hi> and have no further claims to the protection of juſtice.—Long have they called aloud on liberty and virtue as their patrons, but they have now ſwerved from the line of their own drawing, and the nation is no longer obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the rules of neighbourly commerce.—What think you, my brethren, if with ſentiments like theſe, they ſhould determine on obliging us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our ſupplies?—What if they ſhould demand with compulſive threats at our gates, an immediate embarkation to the iſlands, of our uſual ſupplies.— How ſhould we act? We might doubtleſs contend, that this was an exertion of power, which <hi>no laws</hi> but thoſe of <hi>force</hi> can warrant or ſupport; but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings from, the mouth of a cannon carry convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to be withſtood. We know there are times, when public emergencies ſupeecede an adherence to the principles of the conſtitution; what law autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizes the ſeizing on a ſeaman's perſon, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to ſerve in a ſtate of government ſlavery? Where is the ſtatute for impreſſing my horſes, my carriages, and my ſervants, for the uſes of a cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigning? Yet we know they have been the conſtant practices of the navy and army. The merchant may contend that his property is his own, and that no man can legally oblige him to venture it abroad. —So may the ſailor argue, and nothing but the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the caſe</hi> will be urged in ſupport of either, an <hi>argument</hi> which ſeems at preſent, to be one of the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013760_0073_0F91AA176D12CD98"/>
fundamentals in the Engliſh conſtitution.—They may tell us, that the iſland are <hi>actually ſuffering</hi> by our <hi>unjuſt reſolutions,</hi> and that they come to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the diſtreſſed.—We may offer to treat, and to enter into a diſcuſſion of the right, but hunger and want will admit of no delay.—If we continue inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, what muſt be the conſequence?</p>
               <p>THERE is not a man on the continent more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than I am for the ſupport of our liberties; but never can I think of contending for them on the principles of <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>injuſtice</hi>; whilſt <hi>they</hi> are our ſuppport, we can neither look for the approbation of good men, nor the protection of a juſt and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence, and ſhall loſe the few remaining friends we have yet in parliament. Virtue will ever ſupport us, and bear us out in the midſt of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and perſecutions; but if once we quit <hi>that ground,</hi> we wander into a labyrinth of perplexity and confuſion, which may bring down our gray hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been ſaid, I hope it will not be objected, that if we are deterred from entering into the meaſure of a non-exportation to the iſlands, from an apprehenſion of a miniſterial <hi>demand</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it, that the ſame power may be exerted to oblige us to break through our reſolutions, of <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our orders for Engliſh goods</hi>; for ſhould they be weak enough to attempt it—I will dare to aſſert, there is not a merchant in Britain who would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his goods abroad on ſuch compulſive terms.</p>
               <p>IF my apprehenſions on this, ſubject are wrong, and my fears groundleſs, I am not the firſt man who has been miſtaken in his judgment; I am earneſt for
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013760_0074_0F91AA1838B833E0"/>
the preſervation of our liberties, and that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of this new world may enjoy a happy ſeries of unmoleſted joys.</p>
               <p>THE difficulties in which we ſhall involve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent manufacturers in England, by withholding our trade, is advancing, I am ſenſible, a ſtep beyond the line of ſtrict moral rectitude; but the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our nature are ſo great, that the forms of our policy too often interfere with that harmony of order, which is indicated by the precepts of a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian life; and O that the happy period was arrived, when
<q>we ſhall beat our ſwords into plow ſhares, our ſpears into pruning hooks,—when nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ONE obſervation more I beg leave to make before I cloſe this paper. By the reſolves of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colony juſt publiſhed, they recommend both a <hi>non-importation</hi> and a <hi>non-conſumption</hi> agreement. Now with ſubmiſſion to the Gentlemen of that Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, I conceive that a diſtinction in that caſe was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary. If a non-importation had been rejected, from an apprehenſion that the merchants would not comply with ſuch a requiſition, then I ſhould think it a very proper expedient to determine againſt the conſumption of all goods imported after the agreement was entered into; but where there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a general diſpoſition, amongſt the merchants and traders, to enter into the aſſociation, I cannot perceive the neceſſity, or propriety, of entering into a non-conſumption agreement,—Surely it cannot be thereby meant to decline the purchaſe of goods already amongſt us, and imported on the honeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a probable ſale, and many of them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013760_0075_0F91AA18F202DB40"/>
paid for:—this would be committing an injury which we cannot intend.</p>
               <p>IT is not without much pain, that I have ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently objected to the meaſures, which have been propoſed; and would an honeſt conſcience have ſuffered me to be ſilent, I ſhould gladly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a ſolemn ſpectator, and watched with anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye the commotions of the continent. When proſperity flattered, I ſhould have rejoiced in private with a few boſom friends, and when diſtraction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our councils, I ſhould have ſtolen into ſome ſilent retreat, and bemoaned with aching heart the diſtreſſes of my country.</p>

               <p>WHILST the mind is diverted from objects of perſonal intereſt, to the more important affairs of national concern, will it be deemed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to ſeize on it in that unguarded moment, and conſign it a prey to the cauſe of virtue; or can the ſubject of this paper be thought foreign or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, when the queſtion in agitation is a queſtion of liberty.</p>
               <p>TO every principled and virtuous ſon of freedom I ſeriouſly appeal, and crave your attention to a ſubject united and connected with the common cauſe. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to come calm and unprejudiced—diveſted of every ungenerous and unmanly ſentiment, with hearts and ſouls unreſervedly devoted to the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013760_0076_0F91AA1AF4C58198"/>
of the day; the buſineſs of eſtabliſhing the ground work of laſting happineſs to extenſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</p>
               <p>GOADED by oppreſſion, and urged by the exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of unjuſt and unreaſonable power, the inhabitants of America have unitedly riſen in a manly and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppoſition. Unawed by the tyranny of imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rulers we rouſe with indignant hearts, and boldly aſſert the extent of our rights. Every latent ſpark is drawn forth to enlighten the ſcene. The clouds of obſcuring ignorance are expelled and diſperſed, whilſt the blaze of human freedom darts far and wide its chearing rays. We trace with enquiring minds the principles of government; we cloſely inveſtigate the origin of power, and deduce from unvarying laws that Man the image of his maker—Man, a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the angels, has a title, an undoubted title to unlimited freedom, and though the neceſſities of civil ſociety oblige us, for the conveniencies of life to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up part of the unbounded liberty of our natures, yet this ſurrender we cautiouſly circumſcribe, and mark it within the bounds of public good, by which every individual is protected in his juſt and equal ſhare. At firſt when the dedications of power are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the injury of the people, they riſe with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous anger and enquire the cauſe; but ſuch is the depravity of human nature, and the artfulneſs of vice, that the very means which were deviſed to ſecure and protect, become the engines of deſtruction. With diſcretionary confidence we truſt power in the hands of a few, and theſe by a gradual inſatiable deſire of unlimited ſway are, with boundleſs purſuits, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the principles of their appointment. Nation after nation have fallen victims to the luſt of power, and the wretched inhabitants can now ſcarcely deſcry the veſtiges of freedom.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:013760_0077_0F91AA1B2A35B5B8"/>ENGLAND by its conſtitution has the happy mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of power and liberty; but vice has ſapped its foundation and is preparing to exhibit it to after ages, as the mighty ruin of a once noble fabrick. Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica with retrograde aſpect aroſe in the weſt, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to eaſtern realms the comely and graceful figure of Liberty. Raiſed on a throne of Truth, with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at her right hand, Juſtice on her left, Wiſdom with the pages of antiquity diſplayed before her, and Innocence ſupporting her ſhield. When firſt ſhe "aroſe from out the main" the morn was ſtill, the ſky was ſerene, the weſtern air breathed ſoft and gently its refreſhing gales, and pleaſingly held forth the ſigns of a joyful and happy day; but ſoon there came a lowering cloud with black and horrid gloom, which obſcured its glories, and caſt a baneful ſhade acroſs the land.—Pardon me, my brethren, for thus roving into the fields of Fancy, and kindly receive me again at the gates of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>THE long diſputes depending between England and her coloniſts have compelled them into a cloſe ſearch after their natural rights, and as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly declared them in reſolves from one end of the continent to the other, I will make bold to take a review of their general ſentiments of liberty.</p>
               <p>NOV. 29th, 1765, the Aſſembly of South Carolina reſolve, that his Majeſty's liege ſubjects in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince are entitled to all the inherent rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his natural born ſubjects within the kingdom of Great Britain—that the increaſe, proſperity, and happineſs of the <hi>people</hi> of this province depend upon <hi>the full and free enjoyment of their rights and liberties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:013760_0078_0F91AA1C1137E9C8"/>SEPT. 28th, 1765, the Aſſembly of Maryland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, that the firſt adventurers and ſettlers of this province of Maryland brought with them, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their poſterity, and <hi>all other</hi> his Majeſty's ſubjects ſince inhabiting in this province all the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, privileges, <hi>franchiſes,</hi> and immunities that at any time have been held, enjoyed, and poſſeſſed by the people of Great Britain.</p>
               <p>SEPT. 21ſt, 1765, the Aſſembly of Pennſylvania reſolve, that the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of this province are entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>all the liberties,</hi> rights and privileges of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects in Great Britain, or elſewhere, and that the conſtitution of government in this province is founded on the <hi>natural rights of mankind</hi> and the <hi>noble principles of Engliſh liberty,</hi> and therefore is, or <hi>ought to be perfectly free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DEC. 25th, 1765, at a large and reſpectable meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the colony of Connecticut, for the county of Windham and parts adjacent, they reſolve, that <hi>God has by nature given us a right to freedom,</hi> and by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn charter, compact, and agreement made with our forefathers we are, as natural heirs by inheritance, entitled to all the rights and privileges of the Engliſh conſtitution, by which our <hi>natural rights</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</p>
               <p>SEPT. 16, 1765, the Aſſembly of Rhode-Iſland reſolve, that the firſt adventurers, ſettlers of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's colony and dominion of Rhode-Iſland and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence plantation, brought with them, and tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their poſterity, and <hi>all other</hi> his Majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſince inhabiting in this his Majeſty's colony, <hi>all the privileges</hi> and immunities that have <hi>at any time</hi> been <hi>held, enjoyed,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſed by the people of Great
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013760_0079_0F91AA1CA99BA068"/>
Britain,</hi> and that by a Charter granted by King Charles the Second, in the 15th year of his reign, <hi>the colony aforeſaid</hi> is declared entitled to <hi>all privileges</hi> of <hi>natural born ſubjects</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, as if they had been abiding and born within the realm of England.</p>
               <p>OCT. 29, 1765, the Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts-Bay reſolve, that there are certain <hi>eſſential rights</hi> of the Britiſh conſtitution which are <hi>founded in the law of God and nature,</hi> and are the <hi>common rights of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>; therefore, that the <hi>inhabitants</hi> of this province are <hi>unalienably</hi> entitled to thoſe <hi>eſſential rights</hi> in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with</hi> ALL MEN, and NO LAW OF SOCIETY <hi>can, conſiſtent with the law of God and nature, diveſt them of thoſe rights.</hi> That his Majeſty's ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica are, in reaſon and common ſenſe, entitled to the ſame extent of liberty with his Majeſty's ſubjects in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>THESE ſeveral reſolves from South-Carolina to New-England fully indicate the general idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, entertained by the coloniſts at the time of the Stamp Act. And the ſentiments in the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition are much the ſame, ſome of the reſolves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couched in the ſame words, they reſt their claims on the juſt principles of "<hi>natural right,</hi>" and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their privileges, as
<q>founded in the law of God and nature, and the common rights of mankind;</q>
rights which
<q>no law of ſociety can conſiſtently diveſt them of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, my brethren, I will beg leave to come cloſe to the point, and call for an examination of our own conduct—Let us try if it will ſquare with our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, whether we can reconcile the <hi>exerciſe of</hi> SLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERY
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013760_0080_0F91AA2071511F40"/>
with our <hi>profeſſions of freedom,</hi>
                  <q>founded on the law of God and nature, and the common rights of mankind</q>
—I beſeech you, brethren, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate and diſintereſted minds to ſurvey the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—Can we ſuppoſe that the people of England will grant the force of our reaſoning, when they are told, that <hi>every colony</hi> on the continent is deeply involved in the inconſiſtent practice of <hi>keeping their fellow creatures</hi> in <hi>perpetual bondage?</hi> So much has been wrote on this ſubject by abler pens, that it may be difficult to ſet it in ſo new and ſtriking a point of light as to gain your attention; but whilſt the evil remains, the ſame arguments will neceſſarily ariſe; nor will they ever loſe their force. In vain ſhall we contend for <hi>liberty,</hi> as an "<hi>eſſential in our conſtitution,</hi>" till this barbarous inhuman practice is driven from our borders. Let him who claims an exemption from the controul of Parliamentary power, ſhew to the world, by what right, human or divine, he keeps in cruel ſlavery his <hi>fellow man.</hi> We declare with a joint voice, that ALL <hi>the inhabitants of America</hi> are entitled to the privileges of the inhabitants of Great-Britain; if ſo, by what right do we ſupport ſlavery?—the inſtant a ſlave ſets his foot in England he claims the protection of the laws, and puts his maſter at defiance; if Britiſh rights extend to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, <hi>who</hi> ſhall detain him in bondage? If his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended owner can ſhew no perſonal contract with the unfortunate African, is there a court on the continent, that would unrighteouſly declare him a ſlave? You ſay you bought them of thoſe who had a right to ſell.—I diſpute it—on behalf of the injured Blacks, I diſpute it, and call on you to ſhew your title. When a ſervant is offered for ſale in the colonies, are we contented with the Captain's aſſeverations?—no—we call for the indenture,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013760_0081_0F91AA2203B87420"/>
the perſonal contract; if <hi>that</hi> is not to be produced, where is the man who will be hardy enough to ſell him? If he is indebted for his paſſage, he is at liberty to make his own bargain with the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer, and enters into a voluntary temporary ſervitude; even if he be a <hi>convict,</hi> and has <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his life</hi> to the laws of his country, and is reſpited for tranſportation, I preſume no Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ever came over unprovided with authentic do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments from the records of Newgate; though many contend, that ſervitude is no part of their ſentence, as being inconſiſtent with the liberty of an Engliſhman, and I have been aſſured that ſome, on their landing in America, have demanded their liberty.—If this be the caſe—if the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution guards the liberties of men, who have been condemned to die for the breach of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's laws, how comes it that <hi>we</hi> undertake to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict ſo barbarous a puniſhment upon the natives of Africa, for <hi>their</hi> tranſgreſſions in Guinea, which is the laſt wretched argument of refuge, which the advocates for ſlavery inſiſt on; and that not content with <hi>gloriouſly</hi> taking up the cauſe of an Ethiopian ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage government, and <hi>nobly</hi> becoming their <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able executioners,</hi> we viſit the ſins of the fathers to the lateſt generations; but if we admit the propriety of the argument, I requeſt on behalf of the injured and diſtreſſed, that you produce the records of their courts, or the proofs of their crimes; if you do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what better teſtimony do you ſhew for your poſſeſſion than the houſe-breaker or highway-man? —Wherever a man claims and ſupports his property, he ſhall undoubtedly recover it. Now every ſlave, by his perſonal appearance, makes <hi>that</hi> claim,—he for ever carries about him the ſtrongeſt proofs in nature of his <hi>original right</hi>—he is the firſt grand
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013760_0082_0F91AA23F13EEB18"/>
link, and unleſs his pretended owner ſhall deduce a regular chain of conveyance, I contend that, by the laws of the Engliſh conſtitution, and by our <hi>own declarations,</hi> the inſtant a Negro ſets his foot in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, he is as free as if he had landed in England. If <hi>force</hi> and <hi>power</hi> are the only important links in the title, what arguments can we advance in <hi>their</hi> favour, which will not militate againſt ourſelves, whilſt England remains ſuperior by land and by ſea.</p>
               <p>SHALL a climate, a colour, or a country, determine the miſerable inhabitants as ſlaves and vaſſals to the reſt of the world; or from what quarter ſhall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our reaſonings, to prove and ſupport our tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing power?—Is there ſuch a thing with Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—high claiming Engliſhmen—as <hi>partial</hi> liberty? Has the Almighty decreed <hi>us</hi> their maſters, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading the workmanſhip of his hands, ſtamped ſlave to eternity on their foreheads? By what law has he thus veſted us with barbarous and cruel ſway? Is it poſſible we can ſit down in the cool of the day, and laying our hands on our boſoms, ſay we believe they were formed for our ſervants? On the other hand I would aſk, Is there a ſingle argument to be adduced in ſupport of <hi>our</hi> right to their ſervices, which would not equally hold in favour of <hi>their</hi> enſlaving <hi>us,</hi> if we were trepanned into their country? But why need I argue on the point? I cannot conſent to believe that there is a ſingle ſlave holder on the continent, who is from principle a tyrant. Their intereſts are ſo nearly connected with the ſubject, that their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are miſled. With ſuch men it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; their reaſon lies buried and concealed; when called forth it appears with reluctance, and urges its efforts with enervated force. Yet many there are in
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013760_0083_0F91AA2431771600"/>
the ſeveral colonies, who are earneſtly concerned in this important cauſe.—To <hi>you,</hi> my brethren—<hi>you</hi> genuine ſons of liberty, they look for ſupport. Let us ſet foot to foot and ſhoulder to ſhoulder, to expel this horrid demon from our land.—How oft is my heart ſunk into ſorrowing ſympathy with theſe poor and unfortunate wretches. When I hear of the brutal cruelties exerciſed over them, by their inhuman own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when I view theſe uſurpers of human freedom, baſking in the beams of ſucceſs, and bowling through life with undaunted career, I look up with wondering eye to the great and Almighty Author of our being, and am loſt in contemplating the diſpenſations of his Providence.</p>
               <p>THE noble, ſpirited and virtuous Aſſembly of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, not long ago petitioned his Majeſty for leave to paſs an act to prohibit the importation of ſlaves, as inconſiſtent with the principles of humanity; but the petition was rejected. Yet ſhould the colonies, with their joint voice at the Congreſs, make a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible remonſtrance againſt the iniquity of the ſlave trade, it would breathe ſuch an independant ſpirit of liberty, and ſo corroborate our own claims, that I ſhould dare to hope for an intervening arm of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be extended in our favour. Should the colonies gain permiſſion to paſs prohibitory acts againſt future importations, I ſhould then, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectant joy, look forward for the glorious dawning of a day of liberty.</p>
               <p>UNIMPORTANT as this may ſeem to ſome, I heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate not to pronounce, that the true intereſts and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of America are more intimately connected with it, than with the repeal of every act which now agitates the continent—<hi>one</hi> we might probably out grow in a
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013760_0084_0F91AA24ECAB39F8"/>
ſeries of years, but <hi>the other</hi> would "ſtrengthen with our ſtrength," and involve us in endleſs perplexities. If a ſtop could be put to the importation, the grand difficulty would be over. Means might ſoon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to diſcharge this unhappy race amongſt us, and wear out the monſtrous badge of unrighteouſneſs. To the Congreſs I would earneſtly urge this weighty point, and to the internal policy of every govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I would preſs the neceſſity of removing every legal obſtruction, which ſtands as a bar to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I am unacquainted with the general laws of emancipation in the ſouthern and the eaſtern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but thoſe of Maryland, Pennſylvania and New- Jerſey have fallen within my knowledge. In the firſt, any ſlave holder may ſet his ſlaves at liberty without charge or encumbrance, provided they are not aged or infirm, but in Pennſylvania the law requires a bond of indemnification of thirty pounds, to prevent the ſlave becoming a burthen to the townſhip, and the law is ſo worded as to admit of a doubt, whether ſuch bond totally diſcharges the maſter's eſtate; and in ſome caſes the courts, before whom ſuch emancipation is to be declared, have ſo far exerted their power, as to refuſe admitting the ſecurity, though undoubtedly good, and the ſlaves intended for freedom healthy and young; by which means, they were kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage againſt the inclinations of their owners. In New- Jerſey, the law requires a ſecurity of two hundred pounds, but the aſſembly of that province, at their laſt ſeſſion, took up the matter on virtuous principles, and made an eſſay towards "<hi>an act for the more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table manumiſſion of ſlaves,</hi>" by which any perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his Negro free, before proper authority, at the age of twenty one, may do it without charge or encumbrance, and for every year exceeding that age, the owner ſo intending to ſet him free, is to pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013760_0085_0F91AA25B5C85F20"/>
the hands of the overſeers of the poor, the ſum of twenty ſhillings, which ſhall be a total diſcharge: This with a few diſcretionary reſtrictions is publiſhed in their votes, for the inſpection of their conſtituents, and it is hoped by every lover of liberty, that it will paſs into a law at the next ſeſſions.</p>
               <p>WERE the colonies as earneſt for the preſervation of liberty, upon its <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> principles, as they are to oppoſe the ſupremacy of an Engliſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, they would enter into a virtuous and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual</hi> reſolve neither to import, nor to purchaſe any ſlaves introduced among them after the meeting of the Congreſs. A reſolve ſo replete with liberty, ſo truly noble, would indelibly convey to future ages a memorable record of diſintereſted virtue; whilſt thouſands, ten thouſands yet unborn, might bleſs them in their native ſhades, carving on the ſmooth bark of every tree, NOBLE AMERICANS. With grateful hearts might they look up "<hi>to the unknown God,</hi>" and urge this ardent prayer— <hi>Great and Almighty ruler of the Univerſe, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er down the choiceſt of thy bleſſings on yon weſtern climes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HERE I ſhall cloſe theſe reflections, and ſubmit them to the candour of my countrymen. If my conceptions of equity, or conjectures on the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal intereſts of the continent, ſhould differ from many of my brethren, I ſhall open my heart to conviction, and ſtand a willing convert to the voice of reaſon. The welfare of my country alone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my feeble pen, and prompted me to ſteal on the public with a cloak of diſguiſe; a cloak which may haply protect me from the keenneſs of invective, and ſhield me from reproach. Though the ſtorms
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013760_0086_0F91AA266BBF14D8"/>
of obloquy and virulence, may pour o'er my head with unremitting violence, and the loud thunders of angry zeal may roar in my ears with inceſſant peals; though the flaſhes of political fire may dart their forky vengeance with fierceneſs round my dwelling,—ſnug and retired, beneath the ſhelter of a humble roof, I brave the danger and defy the ſtorm.</p>
