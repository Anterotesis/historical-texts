            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With all the Chriſtian Charities moſt affectionately beloved! Give ear, I beſeech you, to the wiſe counſel of the Eldeſt of Apoſtles, who hath directed our attention to the more ſure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well, that we take heed, as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn and the day ſtar ariſe in our hearts: And this word, which came not in old time by the will of Man, but was ſpoken by Holy Men of God, who ſpake as they were moved of the Holy Spirit, hath teſtified before hand, on this wiſe, in the 31ſt Chapter of JEREMIAH and the 6th Verſe.</p>
            <q>—THERE SHALL BE A DAY, THAT THE WATCHMEN UPON THE MOUNT EPHRAIM, SHALL CRY, ARISE YE, LET US GO UP TO ZION UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD.</q>
            <bibl>31ſt JEREMIAH, 6th Verſe.</bibl>
            <p>AND was there a day, when the Watchmen of Ephraim which is Iſrael, did cry, and in the language of antecedent prophecy, ſay, ariſe ye, let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God? Yes, verily, there was; and of this day, emphatically, it may be ſaid, as David ſpake in ancient time, behold, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which the Lord hath made, let us rejoice therein, and be glad with exceeding great joy.—Indeed, it is the day of days, anointed with the oil of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs above its fellows, and infinitely more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than the day of creation, when the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029410_0005_0FE17241A634AF78"/>
ſtars ſang together, and all the firſt born ſons of immortality ſhouted loud for joy. To this day, the day that we are now aſſembled to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate, the day of the advent of Shiloh, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, God manifeſt in the fleſh, our general progenitors looked forward through an eye of faith, and worſhipping the Bruizer of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head, as they leaned on the Staff of Hope, a better and a more enduring Paradiſe, than that of Eden preſented to view.—This, alſo, was the day which Abraham and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heirs of the ſame promiſe, beheld afar off, as in the viſions of the Almighty, and rejoiced in ſpirit to ſee, although at two thouſand years diſtance; for the ſolemnity of an oath and the immutability of Jehovah had not only promiſed, but on this day, more abundantly confirmed, all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places, in Chriſt Jeſus, the Saviour of the World, to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth.—Nor did the Patriarchs, who by faith have obtained a good report, alone bear teſtimony to the dawn of the day ſpring from on high. —The Law which came by Moſes, as the appointed ſhadow of good things to come, was reflected from the body of Jeſus,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029410_0006_0FE172439FD36660"/>
full of grace and of truth; and all that was made according to the pattern ſhewed on Mount Sinai, exhibited in lively figures, the eternal purpoſe purpoſed in Chriſt, of whom the whole family in Heaven and in Earth is named.—A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and a far greater cloud of witneſſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs us around: They are raiſed up from their beds where they lie in glory, and being dead, they yet ſpeak in the name of the Lord: Theſe are the Prophets, who diligently enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning ſo great Salvation, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of the exceeding abundance of the riches of Grace, which from before the World began, was hid with Chriſt in God. The ſpirit of all prophecy is the teſtimony of Jeſus, the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, the Counſellor, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace; and the pens of theſe ready writers have noted in the Scriptures of truth, the birth, the life, the ſufferings and the conſequent glory of Meſſiah. How beautiful, ye Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, encompaſſing the walls of Jeruſalem, were your footſteps in every intermediate age! Yours, in truth, were the feet of them, who brought good tidings of good, glad tidings of great joy, being ſhod with
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029410_0007_0FE17245270DA670"/>
the preparation of the glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed; whilſt your tongues, in the language of eloquent oratory, publiſhing Peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming Salvation, ſaid, unto Zion, God even thy God reigneth, and cried, unto the ends of Earth, Behold, the Deſire of all Nations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>Amid this illuſtrious Aſſembly of glorified El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, there appeareth One, divinely exalted above his fellow ſervants. Lo, he deſcendeth on the outſtretched pinions of love: His gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are light, reflecting light caeleſtial: It is Gabriel, who ſtandeth in the preſence of God: Welcome, thrice welcome, all hail, thou Angel of the Lord: Thou comeſt as a miniſtering Spirit, miniſtering unto Salvation's heirs: We know thee, who thou art, the highly favored of the moſt Higheſt: It was thine, to adminiſter thoſe conſolations which are neither ſmall nor few, to the Man greatly beloved in ancient days: It was thine to gladden the heart of Zacharias, as worſhipping on the right ſide of the Altar of incenſe: It was thine to announce the riſing of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, to the virgin daughter of the humbleſt tribe amid
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029410_0008_0FE17248D01566B0"/>
Judaea's thouſands: It was thine, to rejoice the ſpirits of adoring Shepherds by the bleſſed tidings of a Saviour, who is Chriſt, the Lord: It was thine, to lead forth thy fellow watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, thrones, dominions, principalities and powers, when every golden harp was tuned to notes of love, and tongues of Cherubim and Seraphim in concert ſang, Glory unto God in the heights of the higheſt, and on earth, peace, good will towards men.</p>
            <p>And did the four Spirits of the living God, who reſt not day nor night, from praiſe, keep jubilee on this auſpicious morn? Did the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſeated round the rainbow encircled throne, caſt down their crowns, fall proſtrate and adore? Did the fulneſs of the hoſts of heaven, ten thouſand times ten thouſand and thouſand of thouſands worſhip the Firſt Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten when brought into the world? And ſhall man, for whom this Child was born, ſhall man, to whom the Son is freely given, refuſe the homage of Caeleſtial Potentates? Nor to the Lamb made known, aſcribe all honor, bleſſing, might, dominion, majeſty and ſtrength, whilſt from his inmoſt ſoul, the ranſomed of Heaven,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029410_0009_0FE1724A5D680F98"/>
redeemed from above, he breathes amen, amen. Forbid it, gratitude for mercy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved! Forbit it love, for love unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Come, let us then ariſe, and going up to Bethlehem Ephratah, ſee the place where the Lord is laid, and ſearch out the habitation of the Holy One of Iſrael.—It is the voice of the Watchmen of Ephraim which crieth, ariſe, ſhine, for your light is come: His companions in bliſs, to their fellows cry, the glory of the Lord is revealed: And trumpet-tongued Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alds reſpond, that all fleſh ſhall ſee ſalvation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Men, Brethren and Fathers, wherewith ſhall we come before the King, the Lord of Hoſts on this morning, or bow ourſelves in the preſence of the moſt High God? What thanks ſhall we render unto Him for his excellent loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? how ſhall we praiſe Him worthily for his unſpeakable gift? The Spirit and the Bride hath ſaid, come, and let him that heareth ſay, come, and let whoſoever will, come up hither, and worſhip. May our hearts be deeply impreſſed, with a ſolemnized ſenſe of the gracious invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every tongue adopting the language
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029410_0010_0FE1724C4E7ED0C0"/>
of the Prodigal, anſwer aloud, I will ariſe and go up to my Father's houſe. At a moment like this, the world and its faſhion which are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away ſhould have no charms. At an hour like the preſent, the luſt of ambition, the love of Mammon, and the zeſt for pleaſures falſely ſo called, ought to be extinguiſhed, and the whole man, in body, in ſpirit and in ſoul, alive only unto God. For this is the fulneſs of time, which Angels from everlaſting girded up the loins of their minds, with ſobriety, ſtedfaſtly to gaze upon: And the bringing in of the Firſt Begotten into the world, ſhall henceforth be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the many manſions of eternity, by the ſpirits of the juſt already perfected, and the general aſſembly delivered from great tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Ariſe, therefore, ye that dwell in duſt and ſing. Awake thou, that ſleepeſt! leave the cares of life, the deceitfulneſs of riches, the piercing ſorrows of pleaſure, in the vally of Achor beneath; and towering on the wings of faith, aſcend Mount Zion's ſacred top, for there hath the Almighty ſet his own Anointed, the firſt born of his ſtrength, the man, my Fellow, ſaith the Lord, and worſhip him, all ye Gods, is the high command.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:029410_0011_0FE1724DD528A810"/>My Fathers, the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof! My Brethren, in the three fold cord of Adam, Solomon and Jeſus Chriſt! My Siſters, accounted as the glory of the man! indulge me, to perſuade with all gentleneſs; ſuffer me, to entreat as a Brother; permit, that I fervently beſeech your undivided attention, in the fellowſhip of the Spirit and the bond of Charity, whilſt the dignity of the brightneſs of the glory of God; the wonderful works of the expreſs image of his perſon; the beauty of the example ſet forth in his moſt holy pattern, and the excellence of the commandment whereunto we are delivered, ſhall energetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enforce the cry of the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, who lift up their voices tegether and ſay, ariſe ye, and let us go up to Zion, unto the Lord our God, the God of Angels, and the God of men.</p>
            <p>Who is the Saviour born this day in David's city? What babe is that within the manger laid? Whoſe are theſe ſwaddling clothes? Hath the burning Seraphim put off the body full of light? Has Gabriel come down to dwell in thick darkneſs? Does Abraham the friend of

God tabernacle with men? Is one of the old Prophets born again? No, verily, no.—Jeſus, the Saviour born to day, Chriſt the Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the manger laid, the ſecond Adam wrapped in ſwaddling clothes, is exalted above all theſe names, is higher than every name that is named in heaven, or in earth.—Unto which of the Angels hath it been ſaid, at any time, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? Who is the Patriarch, of whom it is written, I will be to him a Father and he ſhall be to me a Son? To which of the Prophets, is it ſpoken, ſit thou on the right hand of the Majeſty on high? God at ſundry times and in diverſe manners, ſpake in time paſt, unto our fathers, by them. The viſion of the ancients hath failed. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the Prophets are ſealed. The miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of flames of fire is done away. He now is come, who hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name, even the appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo the worlds were made, and unto whom it is ſaid, by Him, who giveth not his glory to another, thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; and, thou, Lord, in the beginning haſt laid the foundations of the earth; and the heavens are the work of

It is the Lord your Creator, the Creator of all things, whether viſible or inviſible, without whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was made, that is made, who is found in faſhion as an infant: It is He who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, and in whom the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelleth bodily, who hath put on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſimilitude of a babe: It is He, whoſe gracious providence extends from the riſing of the ſun, to the chambers of the weſt; whoſe domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion ruleth over all, from the Miniſtring Spirit of the inner court, to the little ſparrow neſtling on his altar, who hath aſſumed the likeneſs of a child. —The glorified with glory before all worlds were, ſaw there was no man: The Alpha, the Omega wondered there was no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor: The beginning, the ending, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty looked, there was none to help: The Lord, who was, who is, and who is to come, beheld, and there was none to uphold: He therefore took upon himſelf the ſeed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; and in as much, as the children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

No marvel indeed, that Iſrael's ſweet Pſalmiſt exclaimed, Lord, what is Man that thou art ſo mindful of him, or the ſon of man that he is viſited thus?

The unhappy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick, ſore vexed, oft times falling in the fire, and oft times in the water, is healed by the great Phyſician of ineſtimable value.

The deaf, is bleſſed with ſalvation's welcome ſound, the ſweeteſt accent ever heard on earth. The impotent, for thirty-eight long years, whom no kind friend baptized in the troubled pool, is cured by the word of power. The maimed, wanting limbs, receive new members for the body, from the Head of every man. The leper dwelling in a ſeveral houſe abides no more alone; no longer cries unclean, unclean: His ſkin is freſher than a child's: His fleſh is fairer than the babe's. The woman ſore diſeaſed, her living ſpent, her plague increaſed, needs but to touch the garment's hem: Virtue goes forth and makes her ſtraightway whole. The crooked, bowed down for eighteen years, by Satan bound, is looſed on the Sabbath-day. The dropſy quits the ſecret reſervoirs of life: Its overwhelming waters know their bounds: Thus far they come, and here, the riſing wave is ſtayed.

Prieſt of our profeſſion, the High Prieſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and faithful, who in the days of his fleſh, offered up himſelf through the Eternal Spirit, a living ſacrifice for ſin, holy and acceptable. It was of neceſſity, ſaith the Apoſtle, that the true Melchizedek ſhould have ſomewhat to offer. Sacrifice and burnt offering, as offered by the law, with thouſands of rivers of oil, or tens of thouſands of rams, could not make Aaron who did the ſervice, perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience. The blood of bulls, and of goats, and the ſprinkling of the aſhes of an heifer, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finiſhed ſin, made an end of tranſgreſſion, nor brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs.

Come, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and my ſiſters, let us ariſe and ſay with the venerable Patriarch, we will go up yonder and worſhip. The miniſtry of Jeſus in death, was glorious: It engraved as with the graving of a ſignet, on the palms of his hands, the love wherewith God ſo loved the world: But the miniſtration of the Spirit, in the power of the reſurrection ſhall be infinitely more glorious, and that love which hath its abiding, when faith is ſwallowed up of viſion, and hope loſt in joy unſpeakable, will forever ſurpaſs the height, the depth of finite underſtanding, and wrap even Angel hoſts, and Heaven's high courts, in ſolemn ſilence.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath ſuffered all things that were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: The ſcriptures are accompliſhed which ſpake of his humiliation: He is about to enter into his glory, and to ſee of the travail of his ſoul: He is looſed from the cords of death: It is impoſſible that he could be holden of them. The Lord is riſen indeed, in the ſpirit and the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:029410_0034_0FE1728201166588"/>
power of an endleſs life: He hath ſaid unto death, O death, I will be thy plagues: He hath witneſſed to the grave, O grave, I will be thy deſtruction. The Conqueror over both hath gone up with a ſhout: The keys of death and of hell are in his hand. Lo, Jeſus aſcendeth on high: Far exalted above all principality and power: Angels, authorities and the world to come being in ſubjection, he ſetteth on the throne of his holineſs; and reigneth as a Prince and a Saviour to give repentance and remiſſion of ſins: The nations of the ſaved are the diadem of his beauty; a ſceptre of righteouſneſs is the ſceptre of his kingdom: His throne is uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by mercy and truth: In the multitude of people is the honor of the king: All kings, when they hear the words of his mouth ſhall ſubmit themſelves. To him is the gathering and obedience of nations: He ſhall rule from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth: It is a light thing that he ſhould reign over the houſe of Jacob forever; of the increaſe of his kingdom and of his peace, there ſhall be no end. From the riſing of the ſun to the going down of the ſame, prayer ſhall be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029410_0035_0FE1728388BDB778"/>
made continually unto him; a pure offering of incenſe offered in every place; and men ſhall call him bleſſed, becauſe they are bleſſed in him, from henceforth and forever, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
            <p>Are the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, ſilent? Do they ceaſe to cry aloud, ariſe ye, and go up to Zion unto the Lord your God? The Saviour born to day, Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord, is not only the King of ſaints, King of nations, and King of the whole earth, he alſo is the Great Prophet, to whom the Spirit was not given by meaſure. The ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and of knowledge; of counſel and of might, reſteth in all its fulneſs, on the Man Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. We, therefore, do err exceedingly, not knowing the ſcriptures, when our views of the prophetical character of Chriſt are bounded by thoſe predictions, which he delivered, whilſt tabernacling below. The lamp of ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy was light at the altar of heaven. The Baptizer with the Holy Ghoſt in fire, as the Lord, the Spirit kindled the living coal. All thoſe glorious things, that are ſpoken of the latter days, ought to be conſidered, as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:029410_0036_0FE172869F552610"/>
and the true ſayings of the faithful Witneſs on high; and every iota ſhould be received by us, upon whom the ends of the world are come, as if pronounced by an audible voice from above. The good word of our God ſhall never fall to the ground: The hills may depart, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains remove, and all theſe elements diſſolve: But his promiſe ſhall not return unto him void; it ſhall proſper whereunto it is ſent, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all the pleaſure of Jehovah. Amid an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety of ſublime paſſages, replete with the conſolations of the Comforter, the Times of Refreſhing from the preſence of the Lord, and the day of the Reſtitution of all things claim a diſtinguiſhed place. The finiſhing of the myſtery, as declared by all God's holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, is reſerved for the ſounding of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth trumpet, when the rainbow crowned Angel, ſhall proclaim, that the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdom of God and his Chriſt. Then, cometh the end, and the morning without a cloud, will reveal the Juſt, whoſe body the heavens muſt receive until that period, in all his goodneſs, as all his glory: Sorrow and ſighing, and ſickneſs and pain ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029410_0037_0FE172888E5EC988"/>
vaniſh as a dream, before the lifting up of the light of his countenance: The vail that is ſpread over all nations, the covering that is caſt over all people, ſhall be deſtroyed: And death, the laſt enemy, being perfectly ſwallowed up of victory, all tears ſhall be wiped away, from off all faces, for the mouth of the Lord of Hoſts hath ſpoken it. Indulge me to cloſe this faint deſcription, of the exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the riches of grace, as yet to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ages to come, by adopting the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful language of the devout Cowper, whoſe harp of ſacred poeſy, is never hung upon the willows, when he ſings the ſong of Moſes and the Lamb.</p>

            <p>Men, Brethren, Fathers and Siſters! The Watchmen of Mount Ephraim, beſeech, that ye ariſe and go up to Zion unto the Lord your God, for he hath given you an Example that ye ſhould walk in his footſteps: He hath ſet before you a pattern, that ye ſhould do in all things unto others, as he hath done unto you. Art thou a father, a huſband or a ſon, a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſervant, ruler or ſubject? Remember, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat thee, that a frequent recurrence to the example of thy Lord, a conſtant imitation of his moſt holy pattern, is the beſt preſervative from error, the ſureſt ſafe-guard from vice, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in ſafety from the great tranſgreſſion, when the pulſes beat quick, the paſſions ſound an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, and temptations preſs; whilſt ambition flatters, mammon ſpreads the gilded bait, and pleaſure points her ſerpent-ſting.</p>
            <p>Ye Watchmen, on the watch towers of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Ephratah, what remaineth to be added?
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029410_0039_0FE1728C01235608"/>
See, that ye refuſe not him who ſpeaketh from heaven, is their united anſwer. A voice from the Moſt Excellent Glory hath declared, this is my beloved Son, hear him. Chriſt Jeſus hath graciouſly ſummed up the Law and the Prophets in four comprehenſive words, love God, love Man: Theſe two commandments are not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: They connect duty with intereſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt with happineſs. To love our Creator, Preſerver, Redeemer and Saviour, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirement of a reaſonable ſervice. To love our brethren, is inſcribed upon the tablet of every heart, as with the pen of a diamond: But the chriſtian ought not to bound his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the houſe of his friends. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are to be loved with all fervor of charity. The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us thus to judge; and his precept hath enjoined it as a duty, which is founded on his own example. Give ye therefore all diligence to add unto your faith, virtue, and to virtue, knowledge, and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, godlineſs, and to godlineſs, brotherly kindneſs, and to brotherly kindneſs, love, even the love of friends and of enemies, which is the fulfilling of the Royal Law, and the bond of perfectneſs in heaven above and in earth beneath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:029410_0040_0FE172902A296D30"/>It is time, that we attempt to improve the ſubject before us, by a few pertinent reflexions, adapted to mutual edification.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Apoſtle, writing unto the Hebrews, having ſet forth the dignity of the Juſt God and the Saviour, hath exhorted, that we give the more earneſt heed unto the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we let them ſlip. The neglecting of ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord in Paradiſe, and hath been confirmed unto us, by the united teſtimony of Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Evangeliſts, with the trump of the Archangel, and the voice of the whole Hoſt of Heaven, will aſſuredly meet with a due recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, for if he, who deſpiſed Moſes' law was put to death, by the mouth of two or three witneſſes, of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, crucified him afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? Believe ye, therefore, in the Lord your God, ſo ſhall ye be eſtabliſhed;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029410_0041_0FE17291B2AC7150"/>
believe in his Prophets, ſo ſhall ye proſper. Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God. The fellow pilgrims, and ſojourners in this vale of tears, who were gathered unto their fathers, before Chriſt came in the fleſh, went on their way, rejoicing in the hope that was ſet before them, beholding the fulfilment of the promiſes afar off, and being perſuaded that He who had promiſed was alſo faithful to perform, their faith was accounted unto them for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. God hath graciouſly provided ſome better thing for us. We have heard with our ears, we have ſeen with our eyes, we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life. Thoſe, upon whom the ends of the world, are come, muſt be, of all men moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, if they cloſe their eyes againſt the clear ſhining of the true light, turn a deaf ear to the Charmer ever charming wiſely, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a heart of adamant againſt the Lord Chriſt. Let us, therefore, earneſtly pray, that we may be delivered from the ſin of unbelief, which doth ſo eaſily beſet, and run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the race that is ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus the author, and the finiſher of faith,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029410_0042_0FE16F0623FFE588"/>
and thus caſt anchor within the vail, whither the Forerunner hath for us entered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. At all times and in all places, it would be our wiſdom, to remember the years of the right hand of the Moſt High; his wonderful works from the days of old: The heavens which declare his glory, and the firmament ſhewing forth his handy work, are witneſſes on behalf of the Almighty, in every land, and their ſilent language is worthy of being heard among all nations; for, the inviſible things of God are hereby clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God Head: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creation, in all its multiplied wonders, nor Providence, which is arrayed in greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries than Creation, ſo fully reveal the nature of the Divine Being, or ſo clearly demonſtrate his attributes, as the eternal purpoſe of grace in Chriſt Jeſus from before the world began: On this, the nobleſt work of God, the corner ſtone of time was laid; and the top ſtone brought forth in eternity with ſhouting, ſhall cry grace, grace unto it. In truth, this firſt,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029410_0043_0FE17295F0CAB518"/>
laſt, finiſhed work, hath a claim to our conſtant remembrance. It deſerveth to be had in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, when we lie down, what time we ariſe, whether we wake, or ſleep, or live, or die: For, for this cauſe, Chriſt Jeſus both died and roſe, and revived again, that henceforth we ſhould not live unto ourſelves, but live unto him, who ſo loved us, that he gave himſelf for our ſins, that we might be delivered from this preſent evil world, and tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs, to an inheritance incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord, is not only worthy of being had in reverence, becauſe of his wonderful works in Creation, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Redemption and Salvation: But the beauty of his all perfect example ought to be devoutly contemplated at evening, at morning and at noon. As the Father Everlaſting, who of one blood hath made all nations, who dwell together upon the face of the whole earth, how richly hath he provided for the food, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and the cloathing of his offspring! In the character of a Son, what ſtrength of filial
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029410_0044_0FE17297F6FACC70"/>
affection, gratitude, obedience and love! The bleſſed among women, was tenderly thought of in the laſt moments of life: His addreſs on her behalf, to the beloved Diſciple, when treading the winepreſs alone, and taſting the bitterneſs of death, is ſo exquiſitely affecting, that even to read it without tears, would argue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt inſenſibility. In brief, amid all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing, the much loved relations of life, as a Parent, a Brother, a Friend, Jeſus ſtandeth greatly preheminent; and the word of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, energetically heard in his example, is, Go thou and do likewiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The new commandment whereunto we are delivered, ought to be adopted as the rule of life. All its ways are pleaſantneſs. The path of obedience is peace. Permit me, therefore, to conclude in the language of an eminent, and a faithful ſervant of the Lamb. Finally, Men, Brethren and Fathers, with all the chriſtian charities moſt affectionately belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, whatſover things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, or, if there be any other
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:029410_0045_0FE17299E1FEF8F0"/>
virtue, or, ought elſe deſerving praiſe, as learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and received from the Lord Jeſus, or as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the Apoſtles and Primitive Churches, think ye continually on theſe things; and let your conſequent good works, the evidence of faith in Chriſt, as the adorning of the doctrine of the Saviour God, furniſh an anſwer unto every man, of the reaſon of the hope that is within you. It is yet a very little while, and the Watchmen of Mount Ephraim ſhall cry, ariſe ye from earth and aſcend to heaven. At this all important, heart affecting, ſoul inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting moment, may the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit, enable us to anſwer, we come unto Thee; for thou art the Lord our God, the God of Salvation, our guide unto death and beyond it, forever and for ever, Amen and Amen.</p>
