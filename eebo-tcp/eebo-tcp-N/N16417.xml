            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The ſails reduced. A ſhoal of porpoiſes. Laſt appearance of cape Spado. Sea riſes. A ſquall. The ſails further diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Mainſail ſplit. Ship bears away before the wind. Again hauls upon the wind. Another mainſail fitted to the yard. The gale ſtill increaſes. Topſails furled. Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant-yards ſent down. Sea enlarges. Sun-ſet. Courſes reefed. Four ſeamen loſt off the lee main-yard-arm. Anxiety of the pilots from their dangerous ſituation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute behaviour of the ſailors. The ſhip labours in great diſtreſs. The artillery thrown overboard. Diſmal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the weather. Very high and dangerous ſea. Severe fatigue of the crew. Conſultation and reſolution of the officers. Speech and advice of Albert to the crew. Neceſſary diſpoſition to veer before the wind. Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the propoſed effect. New diſpoſitions equally unſucceſsful. The mizen-maſt cut away.</p>

                        <l>On either ſide they riſe; tremendous ſcene!</l>
                        <l>A long dark melancholy vale between.</l>
                        <l>The balanc'd ſhip, now forward, now behind,<note place="bottom">Ver. <hi>908.</hi> That the reader, who is unacquainted with the manoeuvres of navigation, may conceive a clearer idea of the ſhip's ſtate when <hi>trying;</hi> and of the change of her ſituation to that of <hi>ſcudding,</hi> I have quoted a part of the explanation of thoſe articles as they appear in the Dictionary of the Marine.
<p>Trying is the ſituation in which a ſhip lies nearly in the trough or hollow of the ſea in a tempeſt, particularly when it blows contrary to her courſe.</p>
                              <p>In trying as well as in ſcudding, the ſails are always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in proportion to the increaſe of the ſtorm; and in either ſtate, if the ſtorm is exceſſive, ſhe may have all her ſails furl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or be, according to the ſea-phraſe, <hi>under bare poles.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The intent of ſpreading a ſail at this time is to keep the ſhip more ſteady, and to prevent her from rolling violently, by preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſide down in the water; and alſo to turn her head towards the ſource of the wind, ſo that the ſhock of the ſeas may fall more obliquely on her flank, than when ſhe lies along the trough of the ſea, or in the interval between two waves. While ſhe lies in this ſituation, the helm is faſtened cloſe to the lee ſide, to prevent her as much as poſſible from falling to lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But as the ſhip is not then kept in equilibrium by the operation of her ſails, which at other times counterbalance each other at the head and ſtern, ſhe is moved by a ſlow but continual vibration, which turns her head alternately to wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and to leeward, forming an angle of <hi>30</hi> or <hi>40</hi> degrees in the interval. That part where ſhe ſtops in approaching the direction of the wind, is called her <hi>coming-to;</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary exceſs of the angle to leeward, is called her <hi>falling-off.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Veering or wearing, ver. <hi>641. 808.</hi> as uſed in the preſent ſenſe, may be defined, the movement by which a ſhip changes her ſtate from trying to that of ſcudding, or, of running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the direction of the wind and ſea.</p>
                              <p>It is an axiom in natural philoſophy, That every body will perſevere in a ſtate of reſt, or of moving uniformly in a right line, unleſs it be compelled to change its ſtate by forces impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and that the change of motion is proportional to the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force impreſſed, and made according to the right line in which that force acts.</p>
                              <p>Hence it is eaſy to conceive how a ſhip is compelled to turn into any direction by the force of the wind, acting upon any part of her length in lines parallel to the plane of the horizon. Thus in the act of veering, which is a neceſſary conſequence of this invariable principle, the object of the ſeaman is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the action of the wind on the ſhip's hind part, and to receive its utmoſt exertion on her fore part, ſo that the latter may be puſhed to leeward. This effect is either produced by the operation of the ſails, or by the impreſſion of the wind on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> maſts and yards. In the former caſe the ſails on the hind part of the ſhip are either furled or arranged nearly parallel to the direction of the wind, which then glides ineffectually along their ſurfaces; at the ſame time the foremoſt ſails are ſpread abroad, ſo as to receive the greateſt exertion of the wind, ver. <hi>916.</hi> The fore part accordingly yields to this impulſe, and is put in motion, and this motion, neceſſarily conſpiring with that of the wind, puſhes the ſhip about, as much as is requiſite to produce the deſired effect.</p>
                              <p>But when the tempeſt is ſo violent as to preclude the uſe of ſails, the effort of the wind operates almoſt equally on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ends of the ſhip, becauſe the maſts and yards ſituated near the head and ſtern ſerve to counterbalance each other, in receiving its impreſſion. The effect of the helm is alſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably diminiſhed, becauſe the headway, which gives life and vigour to all its operations, is at this time feeble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual. Hence it becomes neceſſary to deſtroy this equilibri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, which ſubſiſts between the maſts and yards before and behind, and to throw the balance forward to prepare for v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If this cannot be effected by the arrangement of the yards on the maſts, and it becomes abſolutely neceſſary to veer in order to ſave the ſhip from deſtruction, ver. <hi>927.</hi> the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen-maſt muſt be cut away, and even the main-maſt, if ſhe ſtill remains incapable of anſwering the helm by turning her prow to leeward.</p>
                              <p>Scudding is that movement in navigation by which a ſhip is carried precipitately before a tempeſt, ver. <hi>645. 808.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>As a ſhip flies with amazing rapidity through the water, whenever this expedient is put in practice, it is never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in a contrary wind, unleſs when her condition ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her incapable of ſuſtaining the mutual effort of the wind and waves any longer on her ſide, without being expoſed to the moſt imminent danger.</p>
                              <p>A ſhip either ſcuds with a ſail extended on her fore-maſt, or, if the ſtorm is exceſſive, without any ſail, which in the ſea-phraſe is called ſcudding <hi>under bare poles.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>The principal hazards incident to ſcudding, are generally, a ſea ſtriking the ſhip's ſtern; the difficulty of ſteering, which perpetually expoſes her to the danger of <hi>broaching-to;</hi> and the want of ſufficient ſea-room. A ſea which ſtrikes the ſtern violently may ſhatter it to pieces, by which the ſhip muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably founder. By broaching-to ſuddenly, ſhe is threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with loſing all her maſts and ſails, or being immediately overturned: and for want of ſea-room ſhe is expoſed to the dangers of being w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHEN ſubjects of the higheſt importance are ſubmited to the Public, an apology is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
                  <p>I have endeavoured, in verſes at leaſt equal to my own judgment, to expreſs my ideas of a late event, which, whilſt it awakened poetical feeling, muſt have excited national ideas.</p>
                  <p>I will not attempt to analyze a ſubject, which from its nature muſt preclude extreme regular compoſition, but appeal to the ſenſibility of my readers.</p>
