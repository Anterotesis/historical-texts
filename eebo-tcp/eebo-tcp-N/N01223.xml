            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>They will Pardon me, if I take the leave to joyn with him, in the Teſtimonies of our Great Eſteem, for an Honourable Diſpoſition to <hi>Love Good Men,</hi> and to <hi>Do Good in the World,</hi> his Excellent Brother-in-Law. The well-known Name of a, JOSEPH THOMPSON, has long been valued, and ſhall alwayes be Remembred, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where this Book is Publiſhed. God will be Glorified, for the Piety which adorns him, and the <hi>Pure Religion,</hi> which in the midſt of the World, and of Temptations from it, keeps him ſo <hi>Unſpotted from the World.</hi> It was the Maxim of a Pagan <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> in <hi>Livy, Raro ſimul hominibus, bona Fortuna, bonaque mens datur. Chriſtianity</hi> will, in this Gentleman, give to the World, an happy Experiment, that the Maxim is capable of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation. Becauſe a Book of <hi>Eſſayes to Do Good,</hi> will doubtleſs find its Agreeable Acceptance with One of So <hi>Good a Mind,</hi> and the Treaſurer of a Corporation formed on the Intention to do in <hi>America</hi> that Good which is of all the greateſt, whereof Sir <hi>William Aſhhurſt</hi> is the Governour, he alſo has a part in the Humble Tender of it; and it muſt wiſh unto Him <hi>all the Bleſſings of Goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The BOOK requires that now ſome Account be given of it. It was a Paſſage, in a Speech of an Envoy from His <hi>Britanick</hi> Majeſty, to the
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:001460_0006_0FB3499B79B05B38"/>
Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Twenty years ago; <hi>A Capacity to Do Good, not only gives a Title to it, but alſo makes the doing of it a Duty. Ink</hi> were too vile a Liquor to Write that Paſſage. <hi>Letters of Gold</hi> were too Mean, to be the Preſervers of it. Paper of <hi>Amyanthus</hi> would not be Precious and Perennous enough, to perpetuate it.</p>
            <p>To be brief, Reader, The <hi>Book</hi> now in thy Hands, is nothing but an Illuſtration, and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of that Memorable Sentence. As <hi>Gold</hi> is capable of a Wonderful Dilatation; Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has told us, it may be ſo dilated, that the Hundred thouſandth part of a <hi>Grain,</hi> may be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible without a <hi>Microſcope:</hi> This <hi>Golden Sentence</hi> may be as much Extended; no man can ſay how much. This Book is but a <hi>Beating</hi> upon it. And at the ſame time, 'tis a Commentary on that Inſpired Maxim, Gal. VI. 10. <hi>As we have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, let us do Good unto all men:</hi> Every <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> here made upon it hopes to be able to ſay, <hi>When I am tried, I ſhall come forth as Gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not been left altogether Uninformed, That all the Rules of <hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> are embryo'd in that One Word, MODESTY. But it will be no breach of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> to be very <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> in aſſerting, That the only <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Man, lies in Converſing with the Great GOD, and His Glorious CHRIST; and in Engaging as many others as we can, to joyn with us in this our Bleſſedneſs; thereby Promoting His <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> among the Children of Men; and in Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying

to <hi>Do Good</hi> unto all about us; to be <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings</hi> in our ſeveral Relations; to heal the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and help the Diſtreſſes of a Miſerable World, as far as ever we can Extend our Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It will be no Treſpaſs upon the Rules of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> with all poſſible <hi>Aſſurance</hi> to aſſert. That no man begins to be <hi>Wiſe,</hi> till he come to make this the <hi>Main</hi> Purpoſe and Pleaſure of his Life; Yea, that every Man will at ſome time or other be ſo <hi>Wiſe</hi> as to own, that every thing without this is but <hi>Folly,</hi> tho' alas, the moſt of Men come not unto it, until it be <hi>Too Late.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Millions of Men, in all Ranks, beſides thoſe whoſe <hi>Dying</hi> Thoughts are collected in, <hi>The Fair Warnings to a careleſs World,</hi> have at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their Conviction of it.

The Injuſtice of the Cenſures upon you, may be much, as if <hi>Paul</hi> rebuking <hi>Felix</hi> for his <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Unchaſtity,</hi> ſhould have been twitted with it, as an <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> and <hi>Inconſiſtency,</hi> in that very lately he had comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented this very <hi>Felix,</hi> and ſaid, He way very glad he had One of ſuch Abilities and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments to be concerned withal, and one ſo well acquainted with the affairs of his Nation.

A <hi>Pharaoh</hi> will do us no wrong if he tell us, <hi>Ye are Idle, ye are I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi> We have uſually more <hi>Strength</hi> to <hi>Do Good,</hi> than we have <hi>Will</hi> to lay it out.

            <p>It is a Surprizing Paſſage, which a late <hi>French</hi> Author has given us; <q>That a man <hi>of Good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is a Kind of <hi>Publick Enemy.</hi> And that by <hi>Engroſſing</hi> a great many Applauſes, which would ſerve to gratify a great many others, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be <hi>Envied;</hi> And that men do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>hate,</hi> what they <hi>Eſteem</hi> very much, but cannot <hi>Love.</hi>

venture to ſay, There is not one <hi>Whimſey</hi> in all my <hi>Propoſals.</hi> I propoſe nothing, but what the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of every Good Man will ſay, <hi>It were well, if it could be accompliſhed.</hi> That Writer was in the Right of it, who ſays, <hi>I can't underſtand, how any honeſt Man can Print a Book, and yet profeſs, that he thinks none will be the Wiſer or Better for the Reading of it.</hi> Indeed, I own that my Subject is worthy to be much <hi>Better</hi> Handled, and my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Handling it is not ſuch that I dare do as the famous Painter <hi>Titian</hi> did on his Pieces, write my Name, with a double, <hi>Fecit, Fecit,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Very well done:</hi> and I muſt have utterly Suppreſſed it, if I had been of the ſame Humour, with <hi>Cimabus</hi> another famous Painter, who, if himſelf or any other Spyed the leaſt Fault in his Pieces, would utterly deface them and deſtroy them, tho' he had beſtow'd a Twelve-months pains upon them.

               <hi>Who</hi> is the Author, there is no Need of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. This will be unavoidably known in the Vicinity.

            <head>ESSAYS to Do GOOD.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. SUCH <hi>Glorious Things are Spoken</hi> in the Oracles of our Good God, concerning them who <hi>Deviſe Good,</hi> that, <hi>A Book of Good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> may very reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Attention &amp; Acceptance from them that have any Impreſſions of the moſt <hi>Reaſonable Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> upon them. I am <hi>Deviſing</hi> Such a <hi>Book;</hi> but at the ſame time Offering a Sorrowful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, That if men would Set themſelves to <hi>Deviſe Good,</hi> a world of <hi>Good</hi> might be done, more than there is, in this <hi>Preſent Evil World.</hi> It is very ſure, The World has <hi>Need Enough.</hi> There Needs abundance to be done, That the Great GOD and His CHRIST may be more Known and Serv'd in the World; and that the <hi>Errors</hi> which are <hi>Impediments</hi> to the <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> wherewith men ought to Glorify their Creator and Redeemer, may be Rectified. There needs abundance to be done, That the <hi>Evil Manners</hi> of the World, by which men are <hi>drowned in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> may be Reformed; and mankind reſcued from the Epidemical Corruption and Slavery which has overwhelmed it. There needs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001460_0021_0FB349B27423DEB0"/>
to be done, That the <hi>Miſeries</hi> of the World may have <hi>Remedies</hi> and <hi>Abatements</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them; and that miſerable people may be Relieved and Comforted. The world has according to the Computation of Some, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Seven hundred millions of people now Living in it. What an ample Field among all theſe, to <hi>Do Good</hi> upon! In a word, <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> in the World, Calls for Innumerable <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> from us. To Do SUCH THINGS is to <hi>Do Good.</hi> Thoſe men <hi>Deviſe Good,</hi> who Shape any DEVICES to do Things of Such a Tendency; whether the Things be of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Importance, or of a <hi>Temporal.</hi> You ſee, Sirs, the General matter, appearing as Yet, but as a <hi>Chaos,</hi> which is to be wrought upon. <hi>Oh! that the Good Spirit of God may now fall upon us, and carry on the Glorious work which lies before us!</hi>

            <p n="2">§ 2. TIS to be Suppoſed, my Readers will readily grant, That it is an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, a Vertuous, a Laudable Thing to be full of <hi>Devices,</hi> to bring about Such <hi>Noble Purpoſes.</hi> For any man to Deride, or to Deſpiſe my Propoſal, <hi>That we Reſolve and Study to Do as much Good in the World as we can,</hi> would be ſo black a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that I am not willing to make a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of it in any of thoſe with when I am Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Let no man pretend unto the Name of, <hi>A Chriſtian,</hi> who does not Approve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of, <hi>A Perpetual Endeavour to Do Good in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001460_0022_0FB349B3E1B16D60"/>
World.</hi> What pretenſion can Such a man have to be, <hi>A Follower of the Good One?</hi> The Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> gladly accepted and improved the Name, when the Pagans by a miſtake Styled them, <hi>Chreſtians;</hi> Becauſe it Signifyed, <hi>Uſeful Ones.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who have no Ambition to be So, Shall be condemned by the Pagans; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom it was a Term of the Higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be termed, <hi>A Benefactor;</hi> to have <hi>Done Good,</hi> was accounted <hi>Honourable.</hi> The Philoſopher being asked why Every one deſired ſo much to look upon a Fair Object! he anſwered, That <hi>it was a Queſtion of a Blind man.</hi> If any man ask, as wanting the Senſe of it, What is it worth the while to <hi>Do Good</hi> in the world! I muſt Say, <hi>It Sounds not like the Question of a Good man.</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Origen</hi> calls it, the <hi>Spiritual Taſte</hi> of every Good Man will make him have an unſpeakable <hi>Reliſh</hi> for it. Yea, Unworthy to be diſcourſed as a <hi>Man,</hi> is he, who is not for, <hi>Doing of Good among Men.</hi> An <hi>Enemy</hi> to the Propoſal, <hi>That mankind, may be the better for us,</hi> deſerves to be Reckoned, little better than, <hi>A Common Enemy of Mankind.</hi> How Cogently do I beſpeak, a Good Reception of what is now deſigned! I produce not only <hi>Religion,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Humanity</hi> it ſelf, as full of a <hi>Fiery Indignation againſt the Adverſaries of the Deſign.</hi> Excuſe me, Sirs; I declare, that if I could have my choice, I would never <hi>Eat</hi> or <hi>Drink,</hi> or <hi>Walk,</hi> with ſuch an one, as long as I Live; or, Look on him as
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001460_0023_0FB349B55FFFC5C0"/>
any other than one by whom <hi>Humanity</hi> it ſelf is Debaſed and Blemiſhed. A very <hi>Wicked Writer,</hi> has yet found himſelf compell'd by the Force of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to publiſh this Confeſſion. <hi>To Love the Publick, to Study an Univerſal Good, and to Promote the Intereſt of the whole World, as far as is in our Power, is ſurely the Higheſt of Goodneſs, and makes that Temper, which we call Divine.</hi> And, he goes on. <hi>Is the Doing of Good for Glories Sake ſo Divine a thing?</hi> [Alas, Too much <hi>Humane,</hi> Sir!] <hi>Or, Is it not a Diviner to Do Good, even where it may be thought Inglorious? Even unto the Ingrateful, and unto thoſe who are wholly Inſenſible of the Good they receive!</hi> A man muſt be far gone in <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> who will open his Mouth, againſt ſuch <hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Actions!</hi> A better Pen has Remark'd it; yea, the man muſt be much a Stranger in Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who has not made the Remark. <hi>To Speak Truth, and to Do Good, were in the Eſteem even of the Heathen World, moſt God-like Qualities.</hi> God forbid, That in the Eſteem of the <hi>Chriſtian World,</hi> for thoſe Qualities, there ſhould be any Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. I Won't yet propoſe the <hi>Reward</hi> of <hi>Well-doing,</hi> and the glorious Things which the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God will do, for them who <hi>Deviſe Good;</hi> Becauſe I would have to do with ſuch, as will eſteem it, a Sufficient <hi>Reward</hi> unto it ſelf. I will imagine that Generous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, in my Readers, which will diſpoſe them to count themſelves <hi>well-Rewarded</hi> in the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001460_0024_0FB349B6E2643AD0"/>
Thing it ſelf, if God will Accept them to <hi>Do Good</hi> in the World. It is an Invaluable <hi>Honour,</hi> To <hi>Do Good;</hi> It is an Incomparable <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> A Man muſt Look upon himſelf as <hi>Dignifyed</hi> and <hi>Gratifyed</hi> by GOD, when an <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>Do Good</hi> is put into his Hands. He muſt Embrace it with <hi>Rapture,</hi> as enabling him directly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Great END of his Being. He muſt manage it with <hi>Rapturous Delight,</hi> as a moſt Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Buſineſs, as a moſt Precious Priviledge. He muſt <hi>Sing in thoſe Wayes of the Lord,</hi> wherein he cannot but find himſelf, while he is <hi>Doing of Good.</hi> As the Saint of Old Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sang, <hi>I was glad, when they ſaid unto me, Let us go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> Thus ought we to be <hi>Glad,</hi> when any <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>Do Good,</hi> is offered unto us. We ſhould need no <hi>Arguments,</hi> to make us Entertain the Offer; but we ſhould <hi>Naturally</hi> fly into the Matter, as moſt agreeable to the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> whereof we are <hi>made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers.</hi> It ſhould <hi>Oblige</hi> us wonderfully! An Ingot of Gold preſented unto us, not more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging! Think, Sirs, <hi>Now I Enjoy what I Am for! Now I Attain what I Wiſh for!</hi> Some Servants of God have been ſo Strongly Diſpoſed this way, that they have cheerfully made a Tender of any <hi>Recompence</hi> that could be deſired, (yea, rather than fail, a <hi>Pecuniary</hi> one,) unto any Friend that would <hi>Think</hi> for them, and <hi>Supply</hi> the <hi>Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of their Thoughts, and <hi>Suggeſt</hi> unto them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Special and proper <hi>Methods,</hi> wherein they
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001460_0025_0FB349B8AF8D1C68"/>
may be <hi>Serviceable.</hi> Certainly, To <hi>Do Good</hi> is a thing that brings its own <hi>Recompence,</hi> in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of thoſe, who reckon a kind <hi>Information</hi> of a Point wherein they may <hi>Do Good,</hi> worthy to be by them requited with a <hi>Recompence</hi> to the <hi>Informer.</hi> I will only Say; If any of you are Strangers unto ſuch a Diſpoſition as this, to Look upon an <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>Do Good,</hi> as a thing that <hi>Enriches</hi> you, and to Look upon your ſelves as <hi>Enriched,</hi> and <hi>Favoured</hi> of God, when He does Employ you to <hi>Do Good:</hi> I have done with you, I would pray them, to lay the <hi>Book</hi> aſide; It will diſdain to carry on any further Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with 'em! It handles a Subject on which the Wretches of the Houſe of <hi>Caleb,</hi> will not be converſed withal. It is content with one of Dr. <hi>Stoughtons</hi> Introductions; <hi>It is Enough to me, that I Speak to wiſe men, whoſe Reaſon ſhall be my Rhetorick, to Chriſtians, whoſe Conſcience ſhall be my Eloquence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. THo' the Aſſertion fly never ſo much like a <hi>Chain-Shot</hi> among us, and Rake down all before it, I will again, and again Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it; <hi>That we might every One of us do more Good than we do.</hi> And therefore, This is the FIRST, PROPOSAL, to be made unto us; <hi>To be Exceedingly Humbled, that we have done ſo Little Good in the World.</hi> I am not <hi>Uncharitable,</hi> in ſaying; I know not that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans upon Earth, which ought not to be a <hi>Bochim,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:001460_0026_0FB349B9E0FC7540"/>
in this conſideration. Oh! Tell me, what <hi>Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> I ſhall find it in! Sirs, Let us begin to bring forth ſome <hi>Good Fruit,</hi> by Lamenting our own <hi>Great Unfruitfulneſs.</hi> Verily, <hi>Sins of Omiſſion</hi> muſt be Confeſſed &amp; Bewayled; elſe we add unto the Number of them. The moſt <hi>Uſeful</hi> Men in the World, have gone out of it, crying to God, <hi>Lord, Let my Sins of Omiſſion be Forgiven to me!</hi> Men that have made more than ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience about well-Spending of their <hi>Time,</hi> have had their Death-bed made uneaſy by this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; <hi>The Loſe of Time now Sits heavy upon me.</hi> Be ſure, All <hi>Unregenerate</hi> Perſons, are, as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble has told us, <hi>Unprofitable</hi> Perſons. 'Tis not for nothing that the Compariſon of <hi>Thorns,</hi> and <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,</hi> has been uſed, to <hi>Teach</hi> us, what they are. An Unrenewed Sinner, alas, he never did <hi>One Good Work</hi> in all his <hi>Life!</hi> In all his <hi>Life,</hi> did I Say? You muſt give me that word again! He is <hi>Dead</hi> while he <hi>Lives;</hi> he is <hi>Dead in Sins;</hi> he has never yet begun to <hi>Live unto God:</hi> and, as is he, ſo are <hi>all the Works of his Hands;</hi> They are <hi>Dead Works.</hi> Ah! Wretched <hi>Good-for-nothing.</hi> Wonder, Wonder at the Patience of Heaven, which yet forbears <hi>Cutting-down,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Ground.</hi> The beſt, and the firſt Advice, to be given unto ſuch Perſons, is, <hi>Immediately to do their beſt, that they may get out of their woful Unregeneracy.</hi> Let them <hi>Immediately</hi> Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of their Turning to God, but how <hi>Unable</hi> they are to do it, and how <hi>Unworthy</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001460_0027_0FB349BB5FC3B6C0"/>
that God ſhould make them <hi>Able. Immediately</hi> let them lift up their <hi>Cry</hi> unto Sovereign <hi>Grace,</hi> to <hi>Quicken</hi> them; and let them then <hi>Try,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they cannot with <hi>Quickened</hi> Souls, <hi>Plead</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of a Glorious CHRIST for their Happy Reconciliation to God; Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Reſolve upon a Life of <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, and <hi>Serious Religion;</hi> and Reſign themſelves up unto the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that he may poſſeſs them, Inſtruct them, Strengthen them, and <hi>for His Name Sake lead them in tho pathes of Holineſs.</hi> There will no <hi>Good</hi> be done, till this be done. The very <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of all <hi>Devices</hi> to <hi>Do Good,</hi> is in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Born again,</hi> and in <hi>Deviſing Means, that a Baniſhed</hi> Soul may no longer be <hi>Expelled</hi> from the preſence of God. But you that have been brought home to God, have Sad cauſe, not only to deplore the <hi>Dark Dayes</hi> of your Unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wherein you did none but the <hi>Unfruitful Works of Darkneſs;</hi> but alſo, that you have done ſo <hi>Little,</hi> ſince God has Quickened you and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled you, to <hi>Do,</hi> the Things that ſhould be done. How Little, How Little have you Lived up, to the Strains of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> which might have been juſtly Expected, ſince God has brought you <hi>into His Marvellous Light!</hi> The beſt of us may mourn in our Complaint; <hi>Lord, How Little Good have I done, to what I might have done!</hi> Let the Senſe of this cauſe us to <hi>Loathe</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before the Lord: Let it fill us with Shame, and Abaſe us wonderfully!

any other, than with <hi>David,</hi> even make a Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of our couch, and a Bath of our Tears, when we conſider how little <hi>Good</hi> we have done! <hi>Oh! That our Heads were Waters,</hi> becauſe they have been ſo <hi>Dry</hi> of all Thoughts to <hi>Do Good! Oh! That our Eyes were a Fountain of Tears,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been ſo little upon the <hi>Lock out</hi> for Objects &amp; Methods to <hi>Do Good</hi> upon! For the <hi>Pardon</hi> of this <hi>Evil-doing,</hi> Let us Fly to the Great <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> which is our only <hi>Expiation.</hi> Plead the <hi>Blood</hi> of that <hi>Lamb of God,</hi> whoſe U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal <hi>Uſefulneſs</hi> is One of thoſe admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, for which He has been called, <hi>A Lamb.</hi> The <hi>Pardon</hi> of our <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> at <hi>Good Works</hi> being thus obtained, by Faith in that <hi>Blood which cleanſes from all Sin,</hi> that is the way for us to be reſcued from a Condemnation to <hi>Perpetual Barrenneſs.</hi> The dreadful Sentence of, <hi>Let no Fruit grow on thee for ever!</hi> will be reverſed and prevented, by ſuch a <hi>Pardon.</hi> Sirs, A True, Right, Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Proceedure to <hi>Do Good,</hi> muſt have this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> laid in the Foundation of it! We do not <hi>Handle the Matter Wiſely,</hi> if a <hi>Foundation</hi> be not laid thus <hi>Low,</hi> and in the deepeſt <hi>Self-Abaſement.</hi>

            <p n="5">§ 5. HOw full, how full of <hi>Devices</hi> are we, for our own <hi>Secular Advantage!</hi> And how <hi>Expert</hi> in <hi>Deviſing</hi> many <hi>Little Things,</hi> to be done for our ſelves! We apply our Thoughts, with a mighty Aſſiduity, unto the Old Queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I Eat &amp; Drink, and wherewithal ſhall I

We Sollicitouſly <hi>Contrive,</hi> that we may accompliſh <hi>Good Bargains,</hi> and that we may Steer clear of ten thouſand <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> to which, without ſome <hi>Contrivance,</hi> we may ly obnoxious. The <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of our <hi>Perſonal Callings</hi> we carry on with Numberleſs Thoughts, how we may <hi>Do Well,</hi> in what is to be done. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh our Temporal <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> in affairs that cannot be Numbred, we <hi>find out Witty Inventions.</hi> But, O Rational, Immortal, Heaven-born SOUL; Are thy wondrous Faculties capable of no Greater Improvements, no better Employments? Why ſhould a <hi>Soul</hi> of ſuch High Capacities, a <hi>Soul</hi> that may arrive to be clothed in the Bright <hi>Scarlet</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> yet <hi>Embrace a Dunghil!</hi> O let a <hi>Bluſh</hi> colouring beyond <hi>Scarlet,</hi> be thy clothing for thy being found ſo meanly occupied!

that we <hi>Love Him,</hi> or, that a carnal, and a Criminal <hi>Self-Love,</hi> has not the Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us?

'Tis a Melancholy conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which I am now upon: and I may ſay, an Aſtoniſhing One! You will hardly find <hi>One of a Thouſand,</hi> who does near ſo much, to Serve God and Chriſt, and his own Soul, as you may ſee done by Thouſands to Serve the Devil. <hi>An horrible Thing!</hi>

               <q>O my Soul; Thy <hi>Maker,</hi> and thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thy Love, and thy All!

A <hi>Little</hi> man may do a great deal of <hi>Hurt.</hi> And then, why may not a <hi>Little</hi> man, do a great deal of <hi>Good!</hi> It is poſſible the <hi>Wiſdom of a Poor man,</hi> may Start a Propoſal, that may <hi>Save a City,</hi> Serve a Nation!

            </p>
            <p>It is very Obſervable, That when our Lord JESUS CHRIST, would recommend this <hi>Zeal,</hi> with which the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> is to be Served, He did not mention an Exemple of <hi>Honeſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> no, but of an Unrighteous and Scandalous <hi>Diſhoneſty,</hi> (as of an <hi>Unjuſt Steward,</hi>) for our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation. The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of our Lord in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is much to be obſerved. His Deſign is, not only to repreſent the <hi>Prudence,</hi> but alſo the vaſt Induſtry, Ingenuity, Reſolution, and <hi>Heroick Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Soul,</hi> neceſſary in them, that would Seek and Serve the Kingdom of Heaven. There is no where to be found among men, that <hi>Vivacity of Spirit</hi> in <hi>Lawful</hi> Actions, which there is to be found in <hi>Unlawful</hi> Ones. The wayes of <hi>Honeſty</hi> are plain to men, and they require not ſo much <hi>Uneaſineſs</hi> in the Minds of men to manage them. Whereas your <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Cheats,</hi> and men that follow Courſes of <hi>Diſhoneſty,</hi> take wayes that are full of Difficulties: the <hi>Turns</hi> and the <hi>Tricks</hi> with

in Some, whom the Holy Word of God has cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Children of the Devil,</hi> may Exceedingly put us to the Bluſh. Our <hi>Obligations</hi> to <hi>Do Good</hi> are infinite: They <hi>Do Evil</hi> againſt all <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi> The <hi>Compenſations</hi> made unto them who <hi>Do Good,</hi> are Encouraging beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; They who <hi>Do Evil,</hi> get nothing to boaſt of; but <hi>Evil Purſues the Sinners.</hi> If the <hi>Devil</hi> do <hi>Go about,</hi> and People inſpired by him alſo <hi>Go about, Seeking what Hurt they may do,</hi> Why do not we <hi>Go about,</hi> and <hi>Seek,</hi> and Think, where and How to <hi>Do Good?</hi> Verily, T'were a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for a <hi>Good Angel,</hi> to do ſo.

            <p n="7">§ 7. TO the Title of <hi>Good Works</hi> there do belong, thoſe <hi>Eſſayes to Do Good,</hi> which are now urged for. To produce them, the <hi>Firſt</hi> Thing, and indeed the ONE Thing, that is <hi>Needful,</hi> is, A Glorious work of <hi>Grace</hi> on the Soul, Renewing and Quickening of it, and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying</hi> of the Sinner, and rendring him <hi>Zealous of

Good Works:</hi> A <hi>Workmanſhip of God</hi> upon us, <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> us over again, by JESUS CHRIST, <hi>for Good Works.</hi> And then, there is Needful, what will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow upon ſuch a <hi>Work:</hi> That is, A <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> to <hi>Do Good Works</hi> upon true, Genuine, Generous, and Evangelical <hi>Principles.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> are to be <hi>Stated,</hi> before we can go any further; when they are <hi>Active,</hi> we ſhall go a great deal further.</p>
            <p>It is in the firſt Place, to be taken for granted; That the <hi>End</hi> for which we do <hi>Good Works,</hi> muſt not be, To afford the Matter of our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> before the Law of the Holy GOD. Indeed, no <hi>Good Works</hi> can be done by any man until he be <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Until a Man be United unto the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST, who is <hi>our Life,</hi> he is a <hi>Dead Man.</hi> And, I Pray, what <hi>Good Works</hi> to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Such a Man? They will all be <hi>Dead Works.</hi> For, <hi>Severed from me ye can do nothing,</hi> Saith our Saviour. The <hi>Juſtification of a</hi> Sinner, <hi>by Faith, Before Good Works, and in Order to them,</hi> is One of thoſe Truths, which may ſay to the Popiſh Innovations, <hi>With us are the Gray-headed, and very Aged Men, much Elder than thy Father.</hi> It was an Old Maxim of the Faithful, <hi>Bona opera Sequuntur Juſtificatum, non praecedunt Juſtificandum.</hi> It is the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Good Works</hi> done by our Saviour and <hi>Surety,</hi> not our own, that <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> us before God, and anſwers the Demands of His Law upon us.

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001460_0036_0FB349CC594427A8"/>
before we arrive to do our own. Tis not our <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf, either as doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> or as being it ſelf one of them, which Entitles us to the <hi>Juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> of our Saviour. But it is <hi>Faith,</hi> only <hi>As</hi> Renouncing of our own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; Relying on that of our Saviour, provided for the <hi>Chief of Sinners,</hi> by which we are <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Sir, All your Attempts at <hi>Good Works</hi> will come to Nothing, till a <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi> in your Saviour, ſhall carry you forth unto them. This was the Divinity of the Ancients; <hi>Jerom</hi> has well Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it; <hi>Sine Chriſto Omnis Virtus eſt in Vitio.</hi> Nevertheleſs; Firſt, You are to Look upon it, as a glorious Truth of the Goſpel, That the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law</hi> (which preſcribes and requires <hi>Good Works</hi>) muſt by every Chriſtian Alive be made the <hi>Rule</hi> of his Life. <hi>Do we make void the Law thro' Faith? God Forbid. Yea, we Eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> The <hi>Rule,</hi> by which we are to <hi>Glorify</hi> God is given us in the Law of <hi>Good Works,</hi> which we <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy</hi> [I will Expreſs it <hi>ſo!</hi>] in the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It is impoſſible for us, to be Releaſed from all Obligations to Glorify God by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to this <hi>Rule;</hi> Sooner ſhall we ceaſe to be Creatures. The <hi>Conformity</hi> to that Rule in the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which our Saviour by His Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, has <hi>brought in,</hi> to <hi>Juſtify</hi> us, has for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Magnified the Law, and made it Honourable.</hi> Tho' our Saviour has furniſhed us, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſpotleſs <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> when His Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Law,</hi> is placed unto our Account;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001460_0037_0FB349CCA655A4F8"/>
Yet it is a <hi>Sin</hi> for us at all to fall ſhort in our own Obedience to the <hi>Law:</hi> We muſt alwayes Loathe and Judge our ſelves for the <hi>Sin.</hi> We are not under the <hi>Law</hi> as a <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> Our own Exactneſs in doing of <hi>Good Works,</hi> is not now the <hi>Condition</hi> of our <hi>Entring into Life. We unto us if it were!</hi> But ſtill, the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> holds us to it, as our <hi>Duty;</hi> and if we are in the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> we ſhall make it our <hi>Study,</hi> to <hi>Do</hi> thoſe <hi>Good Works</hi> which once were the Terms of our <hi>Entring into Life. Manet Lex tota Pietatis;</hi> That was the Divinity in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Dayes! There muſt be ſuch an Eſteem for the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Good Works</hi> retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever in all the <hi>Juſtifyed:</hi> A <hi>Law</hi> never to be Abrogated; never to be Aboliſhed! And then, Secondly, Tho' we are <hi>Juſtified</hi> by a <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith</hi> in the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God our Saviour,</hi> yet Good Works are demanded of us, to <hi>Juſtify</hi> our <hi>Faith;</hi> to <hi>Demonſtrate,</hi> that it is indeed that <hi>Precious Faith.</hi> A <hi>Juſtifying Faith</hi> is a <hi>Jewel,</hi> which may be <hi>Counterfeited.</hi> But now the <hi>Marks</hi> of a <hi>Faith,</hi> which is no Counterfeit, are to be found in the <hi>Good Works</hi> whereto a Servant of God is inclined and aſſiſted by his <hi>Faith.</hi> It is by a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating Work</hi> of the Holy Spirit, that <hi>Faith</hi> is wrought in the Souls of the choſen People. Now the ſame <hi>Work</hi> of God, and of <hi>Grace,</hi> which does in a <hi>Regeneration</hi> Diſpoſe a man to make his Flight by <hi>Faith,</hi> unto the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of his only Saviour, will alſo diſpoſe him to the <hi>Good Works</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian Life.</hi> And the Same <hi>Faith</hi> which

goes to the Saviour for a part in His <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> will alſo go to Him, for an Heart and Strength to do the <hi>Good Works,</hi> which are <hi>Ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> If Our <hi>Faith</hi> be not ſuch a <hi>Faith,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Lifeleſs</hi> one, and it will not bring to <hi>Life.</hi> A <hi>Workleſs Faith</hi> is a <hi>Worthleſs Faith.</hi> My Friend, Suppoſe thy ſelf Standing before the <hi>Judgment-Seat</hi> of the Glorious LORD. A Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a Prudent, Suppoſal; it ought to be a very <hi>Frequent</hi> One. The <hi>Judge</hi> demands, <hi>What haſt thou to Plead, for a Portion in the Bleſſedneſs of the Righteous?</hi> The Plea muſt be;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O my Glorious Judge, Thou haſt been my Sacrifice, Oh! Judge of all the Earth, Give Poor Dust and Aſhes Leave to Say, My Righteouſneſs is on the Bench. Surely, In the Lord I have my Righteouſneſs. O my Saviour, I have Received it, I have Secured it, upon thy Gracious offer of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Judge</hi> proceeds;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what haſt thou to Plead, That thy Faith ſhould not be Rejected, as the Faith and Hope of the Hypocrite?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Plea muſt be;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, My Faith was thy Work. It was a Faith which diſpoſed me to all the Good Works of thy Holy Religion. My Faith Sanctified me. It carried me to thee, O my Saviour, for Grace to do the Works of Righteouſneſs. It Embraced thee for my Lord as well as for my Saviour. It cauſed me with Sincerity to Love and Keep thy Commandments; with aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity to Serve the Intereſts of thy Kingdom in the World.</hi> Thus you have <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Reconciled. Thus you have <hi>Good Works</hi> provided for. The Aphoriſm of the Phyſician, is, <hi>Per Brachium fit Judicium de corde.</hi> The <hi>Doings</hi> of Men are truer and ſurer Indications, than all their <hi>Sayings,</hi> of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001460_0039_0FB349CFD96D8D50"/>
what they are <hi>within.</hi> But there is yet a further Conſideration, upon which you muſt be <hi>Zealouſly Affected</hi> for them. You muſt Conſider <hi>Good Works,</hi> as the <hi>Way</hi> to, yea, as a <hi>Part</hi> of, the <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> which is Purchaſed and Intended for you, by your Bleſſed Saviour. Without an <hi>Holy Heart</hi> you can't be fit for an <hi>Holy Heaven; Meet for the Inheritance of the Holy Ones</hi> in that <hi>Light,</hi> which admits no <hi>works of Darkneſs;</hi> where none but <hi>Good Works</hi> are done for Eternal Ages. But an <hi>Holy Heart</hi> will cauſe a man to do <hi>Good works</hi> with all his Heart. The Motto on the Gates of the Holy City is; <hi>None but the Lovers of Good Works to enter here.</hi> Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in what we read, <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Yea, to be <hi>Saved</hi> without <hi>Good works,</hi> were to be <hi>Saved</hi> without <hi>Salvation.</hi> Much of our <hi>Salvation</hi> lies in doing of <hi>Good works.</hi> When our <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>Enlarged</hi> and <hi>Unfetter'd,</hi> it is that we may <hi>Do</hi> ſuch Things. <hi>Heaven</hi> is begun upon <hi>Earth</hi> in the doing of them. Doubtleſs, no man ſhall come up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> who is not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. I will mention but one more of thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> which <hi>Good works</hi> grow upon. Tis that Noble one, of GRATITUDE. The Believer cannot but Enquire, <hi>What ſhall I render to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</hi> The Reſult of the Enquiry will be, <hi>with Good works to Glorify Him.</hi> We read, <hi>Faith works by Love.</hi> Our <hi>Faith</hi> will firſt ſhow us the Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and Marvellous <hi>Love</hi> of God, in Saving us. And the <hi>Faith</hi> of this <hi>Love</hi> will work upon our
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001460_0040_0FB349D126994190"/>
Hearts, until it has raiſed in us, an Unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flame of <hi>Love</hi> unto Him that hath ſo <hi>Loved</hi> us, and <hi>Saved</hi> us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, Theſe are to be our Diſpoſitions;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O my Saviour; Hast thou done ſo much for me? Now will I do all I can for thy Kingdom, and People in the World? Oh! What Service is there that I may now do for my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and for His People in the World!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principles to be proceeded on. And on them, I will obſerve to you a Notable Thing. Tis worthy of Obſervations, That there are no men in the World, who ſo abound in <hi>Good works,</hi> as the men who have moſt of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all pretence to <hi>Merit</hi> by their <hi>works.</hi> There are <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who have out-done <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in our Days, as well as in Dr. <hi>Willets.</hi> No <hi>Merit-Mongers</hi> have gone beyond ſome Holy Chriſtians, who have done <hi>Good works,</hi> upon the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of their being already Juſtified and Entitled unto Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>I take Notice, that our Apoſtle, caſting a Juſt Contempt on the <hi>Endleſs Genealogies,</hi> and Long, Intricate, Perplexed Pedigrees, which the <hi>Jews</hi> of his Time, ſtood ſo much upon; Propoſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof to be Studied, <hi>Charity, out of a Pure Heart, and a Good Conſcience, and Faith Unfeigned.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I will give you a <hi>Genealogy</hi> worth Ten Thouſand of theirs, Firſt, From <hi>Faith Unfeigned</hi> proceeds a <hi>Good Conſcience:</hi> From a <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> proceeds a <hi>Pure Heart:</hi> From a <hi>Pure Heart</hi> proceeds a <hi>Charity</hi> to all about us. Tis Admirably Stated!</p>

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:001460_0041_0FB349D3D87039C0"/>§ 8. IT is to be fear'd, That we too ſeldom <hi>Enquire</hi> after our <hi>Opportunities to Do Good.</hi> Our <hi>Opportunities to Do Good</hi> are our TALENTS. An awful Account muſt be rendred unto the Great GOD, concerning our Uſe of the <hi>Talents,</hi> wherewith He has Entruſted us, in theſe Precious <hi>Opportunities.</hi> We do not <hi>Uſe</hi> our <hi>Opportunities,</hi> many times becauſe we do not <hi>Know</hi> what they are; and many times, the Reaſon why we do not <hi>Know,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not <hi>Think.</hi> Our <hi>Opportunities to do Good,</hi> ly by Unregarded, and Un-improved; and ſo 'tis but a mean Account that can be given of them. We <hi>Read</hi> of a thing, which we <hi>Deride</hi> as often as we behold; <hi>There is, that maketh himſelf Poor, and yet has great Riches.</hi> It is a thing too too frequently Exemplified, in our <hi>Opportunities to Do Good,</hi> which are ſome of our moſt Valuable <hi>Riches.</hi> Many a man ſeems to reckon himſelf deſtitute of thoſe <hi>Talents;</hi> as if there were <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> for him to do: He pretends he is not in a Condition to <hi>Do any Good, Alas! Poor Man; what can he do?</hi> My Friend; <hi>Think</hi> again; <hi>Think</hi> often. <hi>Enquire</hi> what your <hi>Opportunities</hi> are. You will doubtleſs find them, to be more than you were <hi>Aware</hi> of. <hi>Plain Men dwelling in Tents,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a very <hi>Ordinary Character,</hi> may in a way of bright Piety, prove Perſons of <hi>Extraordinary Uſefulneſs.</hi> A Poor <hi>John Urich</hi> may make a <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Better for him. I have read of a Pious

               <hi>Weaver,</hi> of whom ſome Eminent Perſons would ſay, <hi>Chriſt walked as it were alive upon the Earth in that man.</hi> And a world of <hi>Good</hi> was done by that man. A mean <hi>Mechanick,</hi> who can tell what an <hi>Engine</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> he may be, if humbly and wiſely applied unto it!</p>
            <p>This then is the Next PROPOSAL. Without abridging your ſelves of your <hi>Occaſional Thoughts</hi> on the Queſtion, often every Day, <hi>What Good may I do?</hi> State a <hi>Time</hi> now and then for more <hi>Deliberate Thoughts</hi> upon it.

                  <hi>Meditation.</hi> Meditation,</hi> Tis one of the <hi>Maſters</hi> to make a <hi>Man of God.</hi> One Article and Exerciſe in our <hi>Meditation,</hi> ſhould be, to find out, the Things wherein a Greater <hi>Conformity</hi> to the <hi>Truths</hi> upon which we have been Meditating, muſt be Endeavoured. If we would be <hi>Good Men,</hi> we muſt often <hi>Deviſe,</hi> How we may grow in <hi>Knowledge, and in all Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> It is an Enquiry often to be made;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall I do, that what is yet Lacking in the Image of God upon me, may be Perfected? What ſhall I do, that I may Live more Perfectly, more Watchfully, more Fruitfully before the Glorious Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why ſhould not our <hi>Meditation,</hi> when we Retire to that <hi>Soul-Enriching</hi> Work of Shaping the <hi>Right Thoughts of the Righteous,</hi> Expire with ſome <hi>Reſolution's Deviſe</hi> now, and <hi>Reſolve</hi> ſomething, to ſtrengthen your <hi>Walk with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With ſome Devout <hi>Hearers</hi> of the Word, it is a
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001460_0046_0FB349DB4C6848E8"/>
Practice, when they have Heard a Sermon, to think; <hi>What Good thing have I now to ask of God, with a ſpecial Importunity?</hi> Yea, they uſe to call upon their <hi>Children</hi> alſo, and make them anſwer this Queſtion: <hi>Child, What Bleſſing will you now ask of the Glorious God?</hi> And Charge them then to go, and do accordingly.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this Piety, why may not this be one of the Exerciſes, that ſhall go to make with us a <hi>Good Evening for the Beſt of Days?</hi> On the <hi>Lords-Day Evening,</hi> we may make this one of our Exerciſes; To Employ moſt ſerious and awful Thoughts on that Queſtion; <hi>Should I Dy this Week, what have I left Undone, which I ſhould then wiſh I had made more ſpeed in the doing of?</hi> My Friend, Place thy ſelf in <hi>Dying</hi> Circumſtances; Apprehend and Realize thy Approaching <hi>Death.</hi> Suppoſe thy Laſt Hour come; the <hi>Decretory Hour:</hi> thy Breath failing, thy Throat rattling, thy Hands with a cold Sweat upon them, only the turn of the Tide expected for thy Expiration. In this Condition; <hi>What wouldeſt thou wiſh to have done, more than thou haſt already done, for thy own Soul, for thy Family, or for the People of God?</hi> Think; Don't <hi>Forget</hi> the Reſult of thy Thoughts; Don't <hi>Delay</hi> to do what thou haſt Reſolved upon. How much more Agreeable and Profitable, would ſuch an Exerciſe be on the <hi>Lords-Day Evening,</hi> than thoſe Vanities whereto that <hi>Evening</hi> is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Proſtituted, and all the <hi>Good</hi> of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Day</hi> Defeated? And if ſuch an Exerciſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001460_0047_0FB349DC5E4D3B90"/>
were often attended, Oh! How much would it Regulate our Lives; how Watchfully, how Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully would it cauſe us to Live; What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Number of <hi>Good Works</hi> would it produce in the World?</p>
            <p>Will you Remember, Sirs, Every Chriſtian is, <hi>A Temple of God.</hi> It would be a Service to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, if this Notion of Chriſtianity were more often, and clearly Cultivated. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there yet remains very much, for every one of us to do, that ſo the <hi>Temple</hi> may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on unto Perfection; Repaired, Finiſhed, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified; and the Top-ſtone of it Laid, with a Shout of <hi>Grace! Grace!</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>As a Branch of this Piety, I will recommend, a ſerious and fruitful Improvement, of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> which the Divine Providence obliges us, to take notice of.</p>
            <p>More Particularly;</p>
            <p>Have you received any <hi>ſpecial Bleſſings,</hi> and <hi>Mercies,</hi> from the Hand of a Merciful God? You do not ſuitably Expreſs your Thankfulneſs; You do not <hi>render again according to the Benefit that is done unto you;</hi> Except you ſet your ſelf to Conſider, <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord?</hi> You ſhould Contrive ſome <hi>Signal Thing</hi> to be done on this Occaſion; Some <hi>Service</hi> to the Kingdom of God, Either within your ſelf, or among others, that may be a juſt Confeſſion and Remembrance of what a Good God has done for you. Tis what the <hi>Goodneſs of God leads</hi> you to! I beſeech
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001460_0048_0FB349DDDFD74A78"/>
you, Sirs; How can a <hi>Good Voyage,</hi> yea, or a <hi>Good Bargain</hi> be made, without ſome <hi>Special Returns</hi> of <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto God? I would now, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of your <hi>Eſtates</hi> made a <hi>Thank-Offering,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Set apart for <hi>Pious Uſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whole <hi>Days of Thanksgiving</hi> are to be kept, when the Favours of God riſe to a more obſervable Heighth. Chriſtians of the Finer Mould, keep their <hi>Private</hi> ones, their <hi>Secret</hi> ones, as well as bear their part in the <hi>Publick.</hi> One Exerciſe for ſuch a Day, is, To take a <hi>Liſt</hi> of the more diſtinguiſhable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and Bounties, wherewith our God has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted us. And then, to contrive Some <hi>Notable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments</hi> of the Glorious Lord, in Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to Serve Him, and this by way of <hi>Gratitude</hi> for theſe Undeſerved Comforts.</p>
            <p>On the other hand. You meet with heavy and grievous <hi>Afflictions.</hi> Verily, Tis Pitty to be at the Trouble of Suffering <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and not <hi>get Good</hi> by them. We <hi>get Good</hi> by them, when they awaken us to <hi>Do Good.</hi> I may ſay, Never till then! When God is <hi>Diſtributing Sorrows</hi> unto you, the <hi>Sorrows</hi> come ſtill upon ſome <hi>Errands:</hi> The beſt way for you to find, that they do not come <hi>in His Anger,</hi> is for you to Mind the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands.</hi> The Advice is, That when any <hi>Affliction</hi> comes upon you, You immediately conſider, <hi>What Special Article of Repentance does this Affliction call me to? What Miſcarriage does this Affliction find in me, to be Repented of?</hi> And then, while the ſenſe of the <hi>Affliction</hi> is yet upon you, Sollicitouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001460_0049_0FB349DFF024E3E0"/>
Conſider, <hi>What Improvement in Godlineſs and Uſefulneſs does this Affliction call me to?</hi> Be more Sollicitous to Gain this point, than to Get out of your <hi>Affliction.</hi> Oh! the <hi>Peace</hi> that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and Poſſeſs and Raviſh your Minds, when your <hi>Affliction</hi> ſhall be found yielding the <hi>Fruits of Righteouſneſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> did well to call Afflictions, <hi>Theologiam Chriſtianorum.</hi> This may be a fit Place, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce One Direction more. We are Travelling thro' a <hi>Malicious</hi> and <hi>Calumnious,</hi> and <hi>Abuſive</hi> World. Why ſhould not <hi>Malice</hi> be a <hi>Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former?</hi> We may be unjuſtly <hi>Defamed;</hi> it will be Strange if we are not Frequently ſo. A <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation</hi> is commonly Reſented as a <hi>Provocation.</hi> My Friend, Make it only a <hi>Provocation to Good Works!</hi> The Thing to be now directed is this. Upon any <hi>Reproach,</hi> inſtead of being tranſported into a Rage at <hi>Shimei,</hi> Retire, and Patiently Ponder, <hi>Has not God hidden ſuch a Reproach, to awaken me unto ſome Duty? Unto what ſpecial Inſtance or Service of Piety, ſhould I be awakened, by the Reproach that is caſt upon me!</hi> One thus Expreſſes it. <hi>The Backbiters Tongue, like a Mill-clack will be ſtill Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that he may Grind thy Good Name to Powder. Learn therefore to make ſuch uſe of his Clack as to make thy Bread by it; I mean, To live ſo, that no Credit ſhall be given to Slander.</hi> Thus all the <hi>Abuſes</hi> you meet withal, may prove unto you in the Hand of a Faithful God, no other than the Strokes which a Statuary Employes on his Ill-Shaped

Marble; only to form you into a more beautiful Shape, and make you fitter to adorn the Heavenly Temple. Sirs, you are put into, a way to <hi>ſhake off a Viper,</hi> how advantageouſly!</p>
            <p>Yea, I am going to ſhow you, how you may <hi>fetch a Treacle out of a Viper. Auſtin</hi> would have our very <hi>Sins,</hi> come into the Invoyſe of the, <hi>All Things,</hi> that are to <hi>Work together for Good.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, firſt, I move, That our former <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> may now be Look'd upon, as our Obligation and Incitation to a Greater <hi>Fruitfulneſs.</hi> But this motion is too general. I will deſcend unto a notable Particularity. I would look back, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my paſt Life, and call to Mind what more <hi>Singular Cut-breakings of Sin</hi> have blemiſhed it, and been the <hi>Reproach of my Youth.</hi> Now, by way of <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> for that <hi>Grace</hi> of God, and that <hi>Blood</hi> of His <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thro' which my <hi>Crimes</hi> have been Pardoned, I would Set my ſelf to think, <hi>What Vertues, and what Actions, and what Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Kingdom of God, will be the moſt contrary to my former Blemiſhes? And what Efforts of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be the noblest and moſt palpable contradiction to the Miſcarriages, with which I have been Chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> Yet more particularly, <hi>What Signal thing ſhall I do, to Save Others from Diſhonouring the Great God by ſuch Miſcarriages, as I my ſelf once fell into.</hi> I will Study ſuch Things. Perhaps, the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Conſolation of <hi>Repentance,</hi> cannot be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Studied, than by ſuch a conduct.</p>
            <p>You ſhall give me leave, to preſs this one

more <hi>Point of Prudence</hi> upon you. There are not a few Perſons, who have many <hi>Hours of Lieſure</hi> in the way of their <hi>Perſonal Callings.</hi> When the <hi>Weather</hi> takes them off their Buſineſs, or when their <hi>Shops</hi> are not full of Cuſtomers, they have <hi>Little</hi> or <hi>Nothing</hi> to do; Now, Sirs, the PROPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAL is, <hi>Be not Fools,</hi> but <hi>Redeem</hi> this <hi>Time</hi> to your own Advantage, to the beſt Advantage. To the <hi>Man of Lieſure,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> it is an Advice of Wiſdom, <hi>Give thy ſelf unto Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Good <hi>Books</hi> of all Sorts, may Employ your <hi>Lieſure,</hi> and Enrich you with Treaſures more valuable, than thoſe, which the way and Work of your Callings would have purchaſed. Let the baneful <hi>Thoughts of Idleneſs</hi> be chaſed out of our Minds. But then alſo, Let Some Thoughts on that Subject, <hi>What Good may I do?</hi> come into them. When you have <hi>Lieſure</hi> to think on that Subject, you can have no <hi>Excuſe</hi> for not thinking on it.</p>
            <p n="11">§ 11. THE <hi>Uſeful Man</hi> may now with a very good Grace, Extend and Enlarge the <hi>Sphere</hi> of his conſideration.

One Great way to prove our ſelves <hi>Really Good,</hi> is to be <hi>Relatively Good.</hi> By This, more than by any thing in the World, it is, that we <hi>Adorn

the Doctrine of God our Saviour.</hi> It would be an <hi>Excellent Wiſdom</hi> in a man, to make the <hi>Intereſt</hi> he has in the Good Opinion and Affection of <hi>any One,</hi> an <hi>Advantage</hi> to do Good Service for God upon them: He that <hi>has a Friend</hi> will ſhow himſelf indeed <hi>Friendly,</hi> if he think, <hi>Such an One Loves me, and will hearken to me; what Good ſhall I take advantage hence to perſwade him to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will take place more particularly, where the Endearing Ties of <hi>Natural Relation</hi> do give us an <hi>Intereſt.</hi> Let us call over our ſeveral <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and let us have <hi>Devices</hi> of Something that may be called <hi>Heroical Goodneſs,</hi> in our Diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. Why ſhould we not, at leaſt Once or Twice in a <hi>Week,</hi> make this <hi>Relational Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the Subject of our <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and our <hi>Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> Particularly, Let us begin with our <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Relations;</hi> and <hi>Provide for thoſe of our own Houſe;</hi> Leſt we <hi>Deny</hi> ſome Glorious Rules and Hopes of our Chriſtian <hi>Faith,</hi> in our Negligence.</p>
            <p>Firſt; In the <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> how agreeably may the <hi>Conſorts</hi> think on thoſe Words; <hi>What knoweſt thou, O Wife, whether thou ſhalt Save thy Husband? Or, How knoweſt thou, O Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt Save thy Wife?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Husband</hi> will do well to think; <hi>What ſhall I do, that my Wife may have cauſe for ever to Bleſs God, for bringing her unto me?</hi> And, <hi>What ſhall I do that in my Carriage towards my Wife, the Kindneſs of the Bleſſed</hi> JESUS <hi>towards His Church, may be followed and reſembled?</hi> That this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

may be the more perfectly anſwered, Sir, Sometimes ask her to help you in the Anſwer; Ask her to tell you, what ſhe would have you to do.</p>
            <p>But then, the <hi>Wife</hi> alſo will do well to think; <hi>Wherein may I be to my Husband, a Wife of that Character;</hi> She will do him Good, and not Evil, all the Dayes of his Life?</p>
            <p>With my <hi>Married People,</hi> I will particularly leave a Good Note, which I find in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of <hi>Gervaſe Diſney</hi>

            <p>By conſequence, All the Afflicted in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, are to be thought upon.

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, You will <hi>Pitty</hi> them.

            </p>
            <p>But this is not all, 'Tis poſſible, 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you may do well to <hi>Viſit</hi> them; and when you <hi>Viſit</hi> them, <hi>Comfort</hi> them.

Yet, <hi>Be Glad,</hi> if any one tell you of them. Thank him who tells you, as having therein done you a very great Civility. Let him know, that he could not by any thing have more gratified you. Any <hi>Civility</hi> that you can ſhow, by <hi>Lending,</hi> by <hi>Watching,</hi> by — all the Methods of <hi>Courteſie;</hi> Show it; and be glad you can Show it.

Yea, Stay not until you are told of <hi>Opportunities</hi> to <hi>Do Good.</hi> Enquire after them; Let the Enquiry be Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, be Unwearied.

            <p>There was a generous Pagan, who counted a <hi>Day Loſt,</hi> if he had obliged no body in the Day. <hi>Amici, Diem Perdidi!</hi> O <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Let us try, whether we can't attain to Do Something, for Some Neighbour or other, every day that comes over our Head.

Good Angels <hi>Rejoycing:</hi> 'Tis alwayes, <hi>At the Good of Others.</hi> To <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in the <hi>Good</hi> of Others, and moſt of all in doing of <hi>Good</hi> unto them, 'tis <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In moving for the <hi>Devices</hi> of <hi>Good Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> a principal motion which I have to make, is; That you Conſult the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Intereſts of your Neighbourhood, as well as the <hi>Temporal.</hi> Be concerned, Left the <hi>Deceitfulneſs of Sin</hi> undo any of the Neighbours. If there be any <hi>Idle Perſons</hi> among them, I beſeech you, cure them of their <hi>Idleneſs;</hi> Don't nouriſh 'em &amp; Harden 'em in That; but find <hi>Employment</hi> for them. Find 'em <hi>Work;</hi> Set 'em to <hi>Work;</hi> Keep 'em to <hi>Work. Then,</hi> as much of your other Bounty to them, as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>Children</hi> in the Neighbourhood, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no Education, don't allow 'em to continue ſo, Let care be taken, that they may be better Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; and be taught to Read; and be taught their <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> and the Truths and Wayes of their only Saviour.</p>
            <p>Once more. If any in the Neighbourhood, are taking to <hi>Bad Courſes,</hi> Lovingly &amp; Faithfully Admoniſh them. If any in the Neighbourhood are Enemies to their own Welfare, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; Prudently diſpenſe your Admonitions unto them. If there are any <hi>Prayerleſs Families,</hi> never leave off Entreating and Exhorting of them, till you have perſwaded them, to Set up the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God. If there be any <hi>Service</hi> of God, or of His People, to which any
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:001460_0079_0FB34C77E31E3430"/>
one may need to be Excited, give him a Tender Excitation. Whatever <hi>Snare</hi> you ſee any one in, be ſo kind, as to tell him of his Danger to be <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared,</hi> and Save him from it. By putting of <hi>Good Books</hi> into the Hands of your Neighbours, and gaining of them a Promiſe to <hi>Read the Books,</hi> who can tell, what Good you may do unto them! It is poſſible, you may in this way, with Ingenuity, and with Efficacy, adminiſter thoſe <hi>Reproofs,</hi> which you may owe unto ſuch Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as are to be <hi>Reproved</hi> for their Miſcarriages. The <hi>Books</hi> will balk nothing, that is to be ſaid, on the Subjects, that you would have the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours adviſed upon.</p>
            <p>Finally. If there be any <hi>Baſe Houſes,</hi> which threaten to debauch, and Poiſon, and confound the Neighbourhood, Let your Charity to your Neighbours, make you do all you can, for the ſuppreſſion of them.</p>
            <p>That my PROPOSAL <hi>To Do Good in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and as a Neighbour,</hi> may be more fully formed and followed; I will conclude it, with minding you, That a World of <hi>Self-Denial</hi> is to be Exerciſed in the Execution of it.

Having for nothing again.</hi> To <hi>Lend</hi> a Thing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is to <hi>Hope</hi> that we ſhall <hi>Receive it again.</hi> But this probably refers to the, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But then, there is yet an Higher Thing to be demanded, That is; <hi>Do Good</hi> unto thoſe Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours who have <hi>Done Hurt</hi> unto you. So ſayes our Saviour, <hi>Love your Enemies, Bleſs them that Curſe you, Do Good to them that Hate you, and Pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you.</hi> Yea, If an <hi>Injury</hi> have been done you, improve it as a provocation to do <hi>Benefit</hi> unto him who did the <hi>Injury.</hi> This is Noble.

done, If in the cloſe of the Day, when you are Alone before the Lord, you make a <hi>Particular Prayer,</hi> for the Pardon and Proſperity, of any Perſon, from whom you may have ſuffered any Abuſe in the Day. And it would be Nobly done, If at laſt calling over the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of ſuch as have been Abuſive to you, you may be able to ſay, [the only Intention that can juſtify your doing any thing like to keeping a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them!] <hi>There is not one of theſe, but I have done him, or watch'd to do him, a Kindneſs!</hi> Among the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, there were the <hi>Haſideans,</hi> One of whoſe Inſtitutions it was, To make this Daily Prayer unto God, <hi>Remitte et condona omnibus qui Vexant nos.

            </p>
            <p>But I won't Stop here. There is yet an High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Thing to be demanded. That is; <hi>Do Good</hi> unto thoſe Neighbours, who will <hi>Speak Ill</hi> of you, after you have done it. So ſayes our Saviour; <hi>Ye ſhall be the Children of the Higheſt; He is kind unto the Unthankful, and unto the Evil.</hi> You will every day find, I can tell you, <hi>Monſters of Ingratitude.</hi> Yea, if you <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> any Perſon, with Doing for him, ſomething more than you have done for others, it will be well if that very Perſon do not at ſome time or other, hurt you wonderfully. Oh! the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> in ordering this Thing! Sirs, It is, that you may <hi>Do Good</hi>

            <p>It is a Propoſal made, by Holy Mr. <hi>Thomas White; That Able and Zealous Miniſters, might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Preach at the Schools. Becauſe the Preaching of the Word is the Converting Ordinance; and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be Obliged there to hear with more Attention,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:001460_0101_0FB34A04DDE35630"/>
than they often do in the Publick. And the Miniſters might here condeſcend unto ſuch Expreſſions, as might work moſt upon them, and ſuch as are not ſo fit for a Publick Congregation.</hi> I have read this Account of One who was awakened by this Advice, to do ſuch things as theſe;</p>
            <p>
               <q>At certain Times he Succeſſively Viſited the <hi>Schools.</hi> When he came to a <hi>School,</hi> he firſt made a <hi>Prayer</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Children,</hi> as much adapted unto their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he could make it. Then he went thro' the <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> or as much of it, as he thought neceſſary; making the ſeveral <hi>Children</hi> to Repeat the ſeveral <hi>Anſwers.</hi> But he ſtill broke the <hi>Queſtions,</hi> for each Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the <hi>Anſwers,</hi> to be underſtood by them, with a <hi>Yes,</hi> or, <hi>No,</hi> Expected from them. And he put ſuch <hi>Queſtions</hi> alſo, as would make them to ſee and own their own <hi>Duties,</hi> and often to Expreſs a Reſolution to Do their <hi>Duties.</hi> Then he Preached a Short <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to them; Exceeding Plain; on ſome Suitable Scripture; and with all the Artifice and Pungency he could uſe, to raiſe Attention &amp; Affection in them. After this he ſingled out a Number of <hi>Scholars,</hi> it may be Seven or Eight, or Ten; and bid each of them turn to a certain Scripture; which he made them Read unto the whole <hi>School;</hi> becauſe it ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto ſomething as he gave them to ſee by his brief Remarks upon it, which it particularly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Children to take Notice of. Then he concluded with a brief <hi>Prayer,</hi> for a Bleſſing on the <hi>School,</hi> and on the <hi>Tutors</hi> in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We are upon <hi>Viſiting;</hi> You will be ſure to <hi>Viſit</hi> the <hi>Poor</hi> as well as the <hi>Rich;</hi> and often mention the Condition of the <hi>Poor,</hi> in your Converſation with the <hi>Rich.</hi> Keep, Sir, a <hi>Liſt</hi> of 'em!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:001460_0102_0FB34A07E0E24238"/>And think on this. The <hi>Wind</hi> feeds no body, yet it may turn the <hi>Mill,</hi> which will grind the <hi>Corn,</hi> that may Feed the <hi>Poor.</hi> In Talking with the <hi>Rich;</hi> you may do this for the <hi>Poor</hi> in your <hi>Liſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, in Viſiting the <hi>Poor,</hi> you will take occaſion to diſpenſe your <hi>Alms</hi> among them. Theſe <hi>Alms</hi> you will, with as much contrivance as may be, make the <hi>Vehicles,</hi> to Convey the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of Piety</hi> unto them; yea, the Methods and Machines of obtaining from them, ſome Engagements to perform certain <hi>Exerciſes of Piety.</hi> All Miniſters are not alike <hi>furniſhed</hi> for <hi>Alms;</hi> they ſhould all be <hi>diſpoſed</hi> for them. They that have <hi>Small Families,</hi> or <hi>Large Intereſts,</hi> ought to be Shining Examples of Liberality to the Poor, and powre down their <hi>Alms</hi> like the Showres of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon them. Yet <hi>All</hi> ſhould Endeavour to <hi>Do what they can</hi> this way. What ſayes <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> of his Reverend Fathers <hi>Alms-Deeds?</hi> They will find, That the more they <hi>do</hi> (provided it be <hi>done with Diſcretion,</hi>) the more they <hi>may;</hi> The <hi>Loaves</hi> will multiply in the <hi>Diſtribution.</hi> Sirs, This Bounty of yours to the <hi>Poor,</hi> will procure a mighty Eſteem and Succeſs to your Miniſtry. <hi>Suadet Lingua, Jubet Vita.</hi> T'will be an ungain-ſayable Demonſtration, that you <hi>Believe what you Speak,</hi> about all the Duties of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but particularly of <hi>Liberality,</hi> and a <hi>Faithful diſcharge of our Stewardſhip,</hi> and a Mind weaned from the <hi>Love of this World;</hi> It will demonſtrate your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a <hi>Future State.</hi> It will Vindicate you

from the Imputation of, <hi>A Worldly Man;</hi> It will Embolden you, and Fortify you, with a great Aſſurance, when you call upon others, <hi>To Do Good,</hi> and abound in the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which <hi>God is well-pleaſed</hi> withal. <hi>Et ſic Exempla Parantur!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will do well to keep a Watchful Eye on the <hi>Diſorders</hi> that may grow up and get Head, in your Neighbourhood. Among other wayes to Suppreſs thoſe things, you may Form <hi>Societies for the Suppreſſion of Diſorders;</hi> Obtain a fit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Prudent, Pious, well affected Men, to <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate</hi> upon that Intention; Employ <hi>their</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and <hi>their</hi> Activity, for your Aſſiſtence in your Holy Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>One of the Rules given for the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> is, <hi>Give thy ſelf to Reading.</hi> Sirs, Let <hi>Gregories Paſtoral,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bowles's Paſtor Evangelicus,</hi> be ſome of the Books on which you beſtow a <hi>Reading.</hi> But then, if you Read <hi>Church Hiſtory</hi> very much, (and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the <hi>Prudentia Veteris Eccleſiae,</hi> Written by <hi>Vedelius,</hi>) but eſpecially the <hi>Lives</hi> of both Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and Modern <hi>Divines,</hi> you will ever now and then find, <hi>Methods to Do Good,</hi> Exemplified. You will then conſider, how far you may <hi>Go and do likewiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Serviceable may <hi>Miniſters</hi> be, unto one another, and unto all the Churches, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Aſſociations!</hi> Many things of General Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to all their Flocks may be advanced, and conſulted there. Yea, 'Tis Pitty, that there ſhould be the leaſt occaſional <hi>Meeting of Miniſters</hi>

at any time, without <hi>Some Uſeful thing</hi> propoſed in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero</hi> took it very ill, that <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> Slept, at his <hi>Muſick!</hi> It is very much, very much to be Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Sin of <hi>Sleeping at Sermons,</hi> were more Watch'd againſt, and more Warn'd againſt. Your <hi>Sleepy Hearers,</hi> if, alas, the <hi>Catechreſis</hi> may be allow'd that calls them <hi>Hearers,</hi> do miſerably loſe the <hi>Good</hi> of your Miniſtry; and the <hi>Good</hi> which you might, perhaps, have particularly deſign'd for them, whom at the Time of your Speaking what you prepar'd for them, you ſee Siezed with an horrible <hi>Spirit of Slumber</hi> before your Eyes.

            <p>There was a Worthy Miniſter whom the Great <hi>Cranmer</hi> deſign'd for Preferment; and he gave
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001460_0106_0FB34A0E20B42970"/>
this Account of his Deſign about him; <hi>Nihil appetit, nihil ardet, nihil ſomniaet, niſi</hi> JESUM CHRISTUM.

            <p>If I reſerve one thing to be mentioned after <hi>Finally,</hi> 'tis becauſe I am in a Doubt, whether it ſhould be mentioned at all. In ſome <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> they do not permit a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Goſpel to practiſe as a <hi>Phyſician;</hi> Becauſe either of thoſe Callings is ordinarily enough to find a full Employment for him that faithfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it. But, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of old, who reſerved in the Archives of their Temples, the Stories of the Cures thankfully acknowledged there; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from thence Directions for cures in ſuch caſes among their Neighbours. Nor has it been a rare thing it Later Ages for <hi>Clergy men</hi> to be <hi>Phyſicians.</hi> Not only ſuch Monks as <hi>Aegidius Athenienfis,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinus Afer,</hi> and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had Lieſure for it: but ſuch Biſhops as <hi>Bacbelt,</hi> yea, ſuch Arch-biſhops as <hi>Albicus,</hi> have appeared under that Character. So, <hi>Herbert</hi> adviſes that his <hi>Country-Miniſter,</hi> (or at leaſt, his Wife,) ſhould be much of a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to his Flock.

            </p>
            <p>There is another PROPOSAL, which has been tendered to all our Churches, and attended in Some of them.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Good Lawes</hi> are important <hi>Machines,</hi> to keep very much <hi>Evil</hi> out of the World; yea, they Reach none, without the <hi>Doing of Some Good</hi> unto them.

The <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of a People, in their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> or <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> will do well, to think, <hi>What is there ſtill defective in our Lawes, Leaving the Iniquities or Neceſſities of Men yet not provided againſt.</hi> And, <hi>What further Laws may be propounded, that the Reign of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs may be advanced.</hi> There have been <hi>Lawes,</hi> (and ſometimes none of the beſt, but <hi>Miſchiefs Eſtabliſhed by Lawes!</hi>) which have made the <hi>Names</hi> of thoſe that firſt moved for them to be Remembred. The Remembrance of having been, <hi>The man that firſt moved a Good Law,</hi> were better than a Statue erected for ones Memory. But if other men Forget it, Sirs, you will not want a Recompence in Gods, and your own Remembrance of it.

Even in <hi>Galens</hi> time we find <hi>Preſtigiaturas Aegyptias</hi> Practiſed; he himſelf writes of them. Other Countries were from <hi>Aegypt</hi> infected with them.

Since there is a <hi>Part</hi> of every mans Revenues due to the Glorious Lord, and ſuch <hi>Pious Uſes,</hi> it is not Fit that the Determination of <hi>What Part,</hi> it muſt be, ſhould be left unto ſuch Hearts as ours.

fixed any <hi>Part</hi> of our uſual <hi>Revenues,</hi> for Himſelf, as 'tis moſt Reaſonable that He ſhould have the Fixing of it, certainly a <hi>Tenth</hi> will be found the leaſt that He has called for. A <hi>Tenth</hi> is the <hi>Leaſt Part</hi> in the Firſt Diviſion of Numbers, which is that of <hi>Unites.

And how can we approve our ſelves <hi>Iſraelites Indeed,</hi> if we ſleight ſuch a Pattern of our <hi>Father Jacob?</hi> I will aſcend a Little Higher. In one Text we read of our <hi>Father Abraham, He gave Melchizedek the Tenth of all.</hi> In another Text we read of our Saviour JESUS, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of Melchizedek.</hi> Hence I form this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; The Rights of <hi>Melchizedek</hi> belong to our

JESUS, the <hi>Royal High-Prieſt</hi> now concerned in the Heavens for us. The <hi>Tenths</hi> were the Rights of <hi>Melchizedek.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Tenths</hi> belong to our JESUS.

and God has Bleſs'd them with ſo much <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> in it, that it has yielded <hi>more</hi> unto them, than the <hi>much</hi> of many others. And <hi>very often,</hi> I ſay, <hi>very often,</hi> they have been Rewarded with a ſtrange Succeſs, and Increaſe of their Eſtates; even in this World, ſeen the Fulfilment of that Word; <hi>Caſt thy Grain into the moiſt Ground; for thou ſhalt find it after many Dayes.</hi> And that word; <hi>Honour the Lord with thy Subſtance; ſo ſhall thy Barns be filled with Plenty.</hi> Hiſtory has given us many and charming Examples, of thoſe, who have had their Conſcientious <hi>Decimations</hi> Followed &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a Surpriſing Proſperity of their Affairs; And ſmall <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> or <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> have Riſen to Eſtates, which once they never durſt have dreamed of.

            <p>There is a City in the World, where every Houſe hath a Box hanging in a Chain, on which is Written, <hi>Think on the Poor;</hi> and they commonly conclude no Bargain, but more or leſs is put into the Box. The <hi>Deacons</hi> have the Key, and once a Quarter go round the City, and take out the Money. When that City was like to have been loſt; One who was not the beſt man in the World, yet could ſay, <hi>That he was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, God would preſerve that City from being Deſtroy'd, if it were only for the Great Charity they Expreſs to the Poor.</hi> Tis the Richeſt City of the Richeſt Country, for its Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that ever was in the World. A City that it is thought, ſpends yearly in Charitable Uſes, more than all the Revenues which the whole Fine Country of the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> brings in to the Arbitrary Maſter of it. You know, <hi>Manus Pauperum eſt Chriſti Gazophylacium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When you Diſpenſe your <hi>Alms,</hi> unto the <hi>Poor,</hi> who
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:001460_0147_0FB34BF9E26392D8"/>
know, what it is to <hi>Pray,</hi> you may oblige them to <hi>Pray</hi> for you by Name every Day. Tis an Excellent Thing to have, <hi>The Bleſſing of them that have been Ready to Periſh, thus coming upon you.</hi> Behold, A Surpriſing Senſe in which you may be, <hi>Praying alwayes.</hi> You are ſo, even while you are <hi>Sleeping,</hi> if thoſe whom you have ſo obliged are thus <hi>Praying</hi> for you! And Now, Look for the Accompliſhment of that word; <hi>Bleſſed</hi> is he that conſiders the <hi>Poor; The Lord will Preſerve him and Keep him Alive; and he ſhall be bleſſed on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very often your <hi>Alms</hi> are diſperſed among ſuch as very much need <hi>Admonitions of Piety</hi> to accompany them. Can't you contrive, to intermix a <hi>Spiritual Charity,</hi> with your <hi>Temporal?</hi> Perhaps you may Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them about the <hi>State of their Souls,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from them, which you now have a Singular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to do, ſome <hi>Declared Reſolutions</hi> to Do what they ought to do. Or elſe you may convey Little <hi>Books</hi> unto them, which certainly they will Promiſe to <hi>Read,</hi> when you thus beſpeak their doing ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> to the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, is undoubtedly the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the Nobleſt <hi>Charity,</hi> and of the greateſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. To furniſh the Poor with <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and <hi>Bibles,</hi> is to do an unknown Deal of <hi>Good</hi> unto them. To Publiſh and Scatter <hi>Books of Piety,</hi> and to put into the Hands of Mankind ſuch <hi>Treatiſes of Divinity</hi> as may have a Tendency to make them <hi>Wiſer</hi> or <hi>Better;</hi> no man knows what <hi>Good</hi> he does in doing ſuch things!

            <p>I have read this Paſſage, <q>It was for ſeveral years, the Practice of a Worthy Gentleman, in Renewing his Leaſes, inſtead of making it a Condition, that his Tenants ſhould keep an <hi>Hawk</hi> or a <hi>Dog</hi> for him, to oblige them, that they ſhould keep a <hi>Bible</hi> in their Houſes, for themſelves, and ſhould bring up their Children to <hi>Read</hi> and be <hi>Catechiſed.</hi>

               <hi>Land lords,</hi> 'Tis worth your Conſidering, whether you may not in your <hi>Leaſes,</hi> inſert ſome <hi>Clauſes,</hi> that may Serve the Kingdom of God.

            <p>But, alas, how much of the <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> in the World, is buried in Hands, where 'tis little better than convey'd back to the <hi>Mines</hi> from whence it came? Or Employ'd unto as little purpoſe, as what arrives at <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> where a large part of the <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> of the World, is after a Circulation carried as unto a Fatal Center, and by the <hi>Moguls</hi> lodg'd in Subſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Caves, never to ſee the light any more. <hi>Talia non facit bonae Fidei ac ſpei Chriſtianus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Yea, I will carry the matter further than ſo. The Saying may ſeem to carry ſome Affront in it; <hi>Idle Gentlemen and Idle Beggars, are the Poſts of the Common Wealth.</hi> But they that are offended muſt quarrel with the Aſhes of a Biſhop. T'was Dr. <hi>Sanderſons.</hi> Will you then think, Sirs, of ſome Honourable and Agreeable Employments? I will mention one. The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> forbad mens eating their own Brains; or keeping their good Thoughts to themſelves. Tis an Obſervation of the Incomparable <hi>Boyl,</hi> 
               <q>That as to <hi>Religious Books</hi> in

               </q> We all know, His own were ſo. It is no rare thing for Men of Quality, to accompliſh themſelves in <hi>Languages</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> until they have been Prodigies of Literature. Their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries</hi> too, have been Stupendous Collections; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards <hi>Vatican</hi> or <hi>Bodleian</hi> Dimenſions. An <hi>Engliſh Gentleman</hi> has been ſometimes the moſt <hi>Accompliſh'd Thing in the whole World.</hi> How many of theſe (beſides a <hi>Leigh,</hi> a <hi>Wolſely,</hi> or a <hi>Polhil,</hi>) have been <hi>Benefactors</hi> to Mankind by their incomparable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings? It were mightily to be wiſh'd, That <hi>Rich Men,</hi> and Perſons of an Elevated Condition, would Qualify themſelves, for the uſe of the <hi>Pen,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Sword;</hi> and by their <hi>Pen</hi> deſerve to have it ſaid of them, <hi>They have Written Excellent things.</hi> An Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Perſon of Quality</hi> in a Book of his Entituled, <hi>A View of the Soul,</hi> has a Paſſage, which I will Addreſs you with.

               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:001460_0151_0FB34C016780A008"/>I will addreſs you, with one PROPOSAL, more. Tis, That you would [As <hi>Ambroſius</hi> had his <hi>Origen,</hi>] wiſely chuſe a <hi>Friend</hi> of Shining A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, of Hearty Affections, and of Excellent Piety: A <hi>Miniſter</hi> of ſuch a Character, if it may be. And Entreat him, yea, Oblige him, to <hi>Study</hi> for you, and <hi>Suggeſt</hi> to you, <hi>Opportunities to Do Good:</hi> make him, as I may ſay, your <hi>Monitor.</hi> Let him Adviſe you from time to time, what <hi>Good</hi> you may do. Cauſe him to ſee, that he never gratifies you more, than by his Advice upon this Incention. If a <hi>David</hi> have a <hi>Seer</hi> to do ſuch a Good Office for him, and be on the <hi>Look out</hi> for to find out what Good he may do, what Services may be done for the <hi>Temple</hi> of God in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>There ſeems no Need of adding any thing but this. When <hi>Gentlemen</hi> occaſionally come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why ſhould not their <hi>Converſation</hi> be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Superiour Quality? Methinks they ſhould reckon it beneath People of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Employ their <hi>Converſation</hi> with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on trifling <hi>Impertinencies;</hi> or at ſuch a rate, that if their Diſcourſe were taken down in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand by one behind the Hangings, they would bluſh to have it Repeated unto them. <hi>Nihil ſed Nugae, et Riſus, et verba proferuntur in ventum.</hi> Sirs, It becomes a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to Entertain his Company, with the Fineſt <hi>Thoughts,</hi> on the Fineſt <hi>Themes!</hi> But certainly, there cannot be any Subject ſo worthy of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> as this; <hi>What Good there is to be done in the World?</hi> Were this

noble Subject oftner Started in the Converſation of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> an incredible Deal of <hi>Good</hi> would be done.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with Saying, you muſt <hi>come forth</hi> to any <hi>Publick Service</hi> whereof you may be capable, when you are call'd unto it. Honeſt <hi>Jeans</hi> has a Pungent Paſſage; <hi>The World applauds the Politick Retiredneſs of thoſe that bury their Parts and Gifts, in an obſcure Privacy, tho' both from God and Man, they have a fair call to Publick Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; But the terrible cenſure of theſe men by Chriſt at the laſt Day, will diſcover them to be the arranteſt Fools, that ever were upon the Face of the Earth.</hi> That Fault of not Employing ones Parts for the Publick, One calls, <hi>A Great Sacriledge in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the God of Nature.</hi> It was a Sad Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells, <hi>Inertia fuit Sapientia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">§ 20. YOu may Remember, That One of the Firſt of our PROPOSALS was, For EVERY ONE, to conſider, <hi>What is there that I may do for the Service of God, and the Welfare of Man?</hi> Tis to be Expected, That all OFFICERS, <hi>As ſuch,</hi> will conform, to what has been thus Propoſed. It ſhould be the concern of all <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> from the <hi>Emperour</hi> to the <hi>Enomotarch, To do all the Good they can.</hi> So then, there is the leſs Need of making a more Particular Application to <hi>Leſſer Officers</hi> of ſeveral Sorts, who have <hi>Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to Do Good,</hi> more or leſs, in every one of their hands.

            <p>In the CHURCH, ſometimes there are <hi>Elders,</hi> (as in the Primitive Times, <hi>Eccleſia Seniores habuit,</hi>) who <hi>Rule well, tho' they Labour not in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> It becomes theſe often to conſider; <hi>What ſhall I do, to prevent the riſe of Strife, or of any Sin, that may be a Root of Bitterneſs in the Flock?

            <p>There are <hi>Deacons,</hi> Entruſted with the <hi>Temporal Affairs</hi> of the Society. It would be well, if theſe would oftner conſider; <hi>What may I do, that the Treaſury of Chriſt may be increaſed?</hi> And, <hi>What may I do, that the Life of my faithful Paſtor may be more comfortable to him!</hi> And, <hi>whom of the Flock do I think defective in their Contributions to Support the Evangelical Intereſts, and what ſhall I Speak with Great Boldneſs in the Faith unto them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the STATE, there are many <hi>Officers,</hi> to whom the moſt Significant and Comprehenſive PROPOSAL, that can be made, would be, <hi>To Conſider their</hi> OATHES? If they would Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <hi>Ponder,</hi> and faithfully <hi>Perform,</hi> what their <hi>Oathes,</hi> oblige 'em to, a Deal of <hi>Good</hi> would be done.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, It is the conjecture of ſome <hi>Seers,</hi> That until the <hi>Temple</hi> be <hi>cleanſed,</hi> there will be no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Appearance of the <hi>Nations</hi> to worſhip in it.

Let us therefore do what we can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Churches <hi>Reformation,</hi> in order to its <hi>Dilatation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is probable, That the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in Operations, like thoſe of the Firſt Ages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſtianity was firſt <hi>Planted,</hi> will be again conferred from our <hi>Aſcended Lord,</hi> for the <hi>Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it.

               </hi> of Him!</p>
            <p n="2">

There are pretended <hi>Shepherds,</hi> in the World, that will never be able to Anſwer before the Son of God, for their Laying ſo little to Heart, the <hi>Deplorable</hi> Circumſtances, of ſo many People, whom they might, if they were not Scandalouſly Negligent, bring to be more Acquainted with the only Saviour. And there might be more done, that ſome of the <hi>American</hi> Colonies, may no longer be ſuch <hi>Cimmerian</hi> ones?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Why is no more done, for the Poor <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have little <hi>Preaching,</hi> and no <hi>Printing</hi> among them? If we ſent <hi>Bibles,</hi> and <hi>Pſalters,</hi> and other <hi>Books of Piety</hi> among them, in their own Languages, they would be <hi>Noble</hi> Preſents, and, God knowes, how <hi>Uſeful</hi> ones!</p>

               <hi>IV.</hi> Poor <hi>Sailours,</hi> and Poor <hi>Souldiers,</hi> call for our Pity. They meet with <hi>Great and Sore Troubles.</hi> Their <hi>Manners</hi> are too commonly ſuch, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no very Good Effects of their <hi>Troubles.</hi>

What ſhall be done to make them a <hi>better ſort of men?</hi> There muſt, beſides more <hi>Books of Piety</hi> diſtributed among them, other methods be tho't upon; <hi>Cadit Aſinus et eſt qui ſublevat. Perit Anima, et non eſt qui manum apponat!</hi> Let <hi>Auſtin</hi> awaken us.</p>

                  <hi>Eſſays;</hi> Hold on, ſaying, <hi>My God will Humble me, yet will I Glorify Him. Lord, Thou art Righteous; But ſtill I will do all I can to ſerve thy Glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> This indeed, is a more eaſy <hi>Humiliation;</hi> but then there is one to be demanded, of much greater Difficulty: That is, That you humbly Submit unto all the <hi>Diminutions,</hi> among <hi>Men,</hi> that God ſhall order for you. Your Admirable Saviour was one who <hi>went about</hi> ever <hi>Doing of Good;</hi> Mankind was never Viſited by ſuch a <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</hi> And yet we read, <hi>He was One ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</hi> Never any one ſo Vilified!

Embrace <hi>Exinani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> Embrace <hi>Annihilations.</hi> I find a Zealous and Famous <hi>Doer of Good,</hi> much Affected with the Picture of a Devout man, to whom a Voice comes down from Heaven, <hi>Quid vis fieri pro te?</hi> Whereto he replies, <hi>Nihil, Domine, niſi pati et Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temni pro te.</hi> Sirs, Let it be ſeen ſome where elſe than in <hi>Picture;</hi> be you the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it.

To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the World of that <hi>Good,</hi> they muſt be left unto a ſtrange <hi>Averſion</hi> for thoſe Men that would fain do it. This Creeples them, Fetters them, Defeats their Excellent Purpoſes! Nor is the <hi>Devil</hi> Idle on this Occaſion. A man who ſhall <hi>Do much Good,</hi> will therein do much <hi>Harm</hi> unto the Empire of the <hi>Devil.</hi> It would be much, if the <hi>Devil</hi> ſhould not <hi>ſeek to Devour,</hi> or take an Exquiſite Revenge upon ſuch <hi>Men of God.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God lay an Uncommon Reſtraint upon that <hi>Wicked One,</hi> ſuch is the <hi>Power of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> &amp; ſuch an <hi>Energy</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> has upon the minds of Multitudes, that he will notably &amp; bitterly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> himſelf upon any Notable <hi>Doer of Good;</hi> and procure him a <hi>Troop</hi> of Enemies, Three Volleys of Obloquies.

wilt run thro' a Troop; By thy God thou wilt Leap over a Wall.</hi> We may be ſo far from wondring, that <hi>Wicked men</hi> are Violently Diſaffected unto a man who does abundance of <hi>Good,</hi> and Spread as many Stories, and Write as many Libels, to his Diſadvantage, as ever the incomparable <hi>Calvin</hi> ſuffered from them; we may rather wonder that the <hi>Devil</hi> does not make this world hotter than a <hi>Babyloniſh Furnace</hi> for him; too hot for his Abiding in it. Sirs, If you will <hi>Do much,</hi> tis very likely that the <hi>Devil</hi> may ſometimes raiſe upon your Opportunities to <hi>Do Good,</hi> ſuch an <hi>Horrible Tempest,</hi> as may threaten a total Ruine unto them. You may fear that you ſee your <hi>Serviceableneſs,</hi> the <hi>Apple of your Eye ſtruck out;</hi> you may be driven to Prayers, to Tears, to <hi>Faſting often</hi> in Secret Places; Proſtrate in the Duſt, you muſt <hi>offer up your Supplications, with ſtrong Crying and Tears,</hi> to Him that is <hi>able to Save</hi> your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities from <hi>Death;</hi> you muſt Cry out, <hi>O Deliver my Soul, (my Serviceableneſs) from the Sword, my Darling, (my Serviceableneſs) from the Power of the Dog!</hi>

                  <q>The <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> yea, and oft his External Contrived Snares are ſuch, as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently give men a Palpable Diſcovery of his Agency. Whence is it, that ſuch wonderful Succeſſive Trains of Impediments, are ſet in the way of almoſt any man, that intends any Great &amp; Good Work in the World?

ſuch admirable Fruſtrations of many Deſigned Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Works, by ſuch ſtrange unexpected means, &amp; ſuch variety of them, and ſo powerfully carried on, as hath of it ſelf Convinced me, that there is a moſt Vehement Inviſible Malice permitted by God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Mankind, and to Militate againſt all Good in the World. Let a man have any work of Greateſt Natural Importance, which tends to no Great Benefit to Mankind, and he may go on with it, without any Extraordinary Impedition. But let him have any great Deſign for <hi>Common Good,</hi> in things that tend to deſtroy Sin, to heal Diviſions, to Revive Charity, to Increaſe Vertue, to Save mens Souls; yea, or to the Publick Common Felicity; and his Impediments ſhall be ſo multifarious, ſo far-fetch'd, ſo ſubtle, ſo inceſſant, and in Deſpite of all his Care and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, uſually ſo Succeſsful, that he ſhall ſeem to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be like a man that is held faſt Hand &amp; Foot, while he ſees no one touch him; or that ſees an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Blocks brought and caſt before him in his way, while he ſees no one to do it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I tranſcribe this paſſage for this purpoſe. O Doer of Good, Expect a Conflict with <hi>Wicked Spirits in High Places,</hi> to Clog all the Good thou doſt propoſe to do; And Expect that Reſtleſs Endeavours of Theirs, to overwhelm thee with Vile <hi>Ideas</hi> in the Minds, and <hi>Calumnies</hi> in the Mouthes, of many People concerning thee, will be ſome of their <hi>Devices</hi> to Defeat all thy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. Be not Ignorant of the Satanick Devices!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and if the <hi>Devil</hi> were Aſleep, there is Malignity Enough, in the Hearts of <hi>Wicked Men</hi> themſelves, to render a man that will <hi>Do Good,</hi>

very Diſtaſtful and Uneaſy to them. They are the Off-ſpring of him, who <hi>Slew his Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Works were Righteous;</hi> and they will Malign a man, becauſe he is Uſeful to other men. Indeed, <hi>Malis diſplicere eſt Laudari:</hi> But Wicked men, will <hi>Curſe</hi> a man, becauſe he is a <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Oh! Baſe and Black Diſpoſition!</p>
               <p>I happened once to be preſent in the Room, where a Dying man could not Dy till he had bewayled unto a Miniſter whom he had now therefore ſent for, the unjuſt <hi>Calumnies</hi> &amp; <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> which he had often caſt upon him: The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter asked the poor Penitent, what was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his <hi>Abuſiveneſs;</hi> whether he had been by any Miſ-reports impos'd upon? The man made this horrible Anſwer; <hi>No, Sir; 'Twas nothing but this; I thought You were a Good Man, and that You did much Good in the World, and therefore I Hated You! Oh! Is it Poſſible, Is it Poſſible,</hi> (ſaid the poor Sinner,) <hi>for ſuch a Sinner to find a Pardon!</hi> Truly, tho' other Cauſes may be pretended for the <hi>Spite</hi> and <hi>Rage</hi> of Wicked men, againſt a <hi>Fruitful Doer of Good;</hi> Yet I ſhall not be <hi>Deceived,</hi> if I fear, that oftentimes a ſecret <hi>Antipathy</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> lies at the Bottom of it. Or it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>Pale Envy,</hi> in Proud men, raging that other men are more <hi>Uſeful</hi> in the world than they, and vexing themſelves with worſe than <hi>Sicilian Torments,</hi> at the ſight of what God and man do for other men. <hi>They ſee it and are Grieved.</hi> Sirs, <hi>Non Bonus eſt qui non ad Invidiam uſque Bonus eſt,</hi>

In ſhort, We read, <hi>The Valleys are Covered over with Corn; they ſhout for Joy, they alſo Sing.</hi> We may be in <hi>Low</hi> Circumſtances: But if we abound in the Fruits of <hi>well-doing,</hi> &amp; if we feed many with our Services, we are <hi>Covered over with Corn.</hi> We ſhall <hi>Shout for Joy, &amp; alſo Sing,</hi> if we be ſo. The <hi>Conſcience</hi> of what we do, &amp; of what we Aim to do, will be a <hi>Continual Feaſt</hi> unto us. <hi>Our Rejoycing is this, The Teſtimony of our Conſcience!</hi> And, <hi>Recte feciſſe Merces eſt.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in doing of <hi>Good Offices,</hi> tis Inexpreſſible; tis Unparallel'd; tis <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical;</hi> more to be Envied than any <hi>Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> a moſt <hi>Refined</hi> One.

But, <hi>Memineris,</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant word of Encouragement unto a Souldier. I ſay, <hi>Remember;</hi> there's more to be <hi>Remembred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Serviceable</hi> Man comes to his <hi>Nunc Demittis,</hi> then, he who did <hi>Live Deſired,</hi> ſhall <hi>Dy Lamented.</hi> It ſhall be Witneſſed and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of him, <hi>That he was one who did Good in Iſrael.</hi> An <hi>Epitaph</hi> the Glory whereof is beyond that of the moſt Superb and Stately <hi>Pyramid!</hi> When the calumniators, who once <hi>Lick'd the File</hi> of his Reputation, ſhall have only the Impotence of

their Defeated Malice to reflect upon. And a <hi>Therſites</hi> will not have a more Diſadvantageous Article in all his character than this, <hi>That he was an Enemy to ſuch an</hi> Ulyſſes. But what ſhall be done for this Good man in the <hi>Heavenly World?</hi> His <hi>Part</hi> and his <hi>Work</hi> in the <hi>City of God,</hi> is as yet Incomprehenſible unto us.

What ſhall be done for him! He has done what he could for the <hi>Honour of the King of Heaven;</hi> All ſhall be done for him, that may be done for One whom the <hi>King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven delights to honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will give you All Summed up in one Word; It is that, Prov. 14.22. <hi>Mercy and Truth ſhall be to them who Deviſe Good.</hi> Children of God, There is a Strain of <hi>Mercy and Truth,</hi> in all the <hi>Good</hi> that you <hi>Deviſe.</hi> You <hi>Deviſe</hi> how to deal <hi>Mercifully</hi> and <hi>Truly,</hi> with every one; and bring every one to do ſo too.
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:001460_0194_0FB34C54B00CEB28"/>
And the <hi>Mercy</hi> &amp; <hi>Truth</hi> of God, now for ever En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for you, ſhall here Suffer you to <hi>Lack no Good Thing,</hi> but ſhall hereafter do you <hi>Good</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the <hi>Heart of Man,</hi> can yet <hi>conceive.</hi> A <hi>Faithful God,</hi> a Saviour who is one <hi>of Great Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> is He that has <hi>Promiſed</hi> it! <hi>The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have not forgotten the words uſed by the Excellent <hi>Calvin,</hi> when the order for his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Ungrateful <hi>Geneva</hi> was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. <hi>Certe ſi Hominibus Serviviſſem, mala mihi merces perſolveretur; ſed bene eſt, quod ei inſervivi, qui nunquam non ſervis ſuis rependit, quod ſemel promiſit.</hi> And I will conclude with a TESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONY that I ſhall abide by. Tis this; Were a Man able to Write in <hi>Seven Languages:</hi> could he converſe daily with the Sweets of all the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Sciences,</hi> that more Polite men ordinarily pretend unto; did he entertain himſelf with all Ancient &amp; Modern <hi>Hiſtories;</hi> And could he Feaſt continually on the <hi>Curioſities</hi> which all ſorts of Learning may bring unto him; None of all this would afford the Raviſhing Satisfaction, much leſs would any groſſer Delights of the <hi>Senſes</hi> do it; which he might find, in relieving the Diſtreſſes of a Poor, Mean, <hi>Miſerable Neighbour;</hi> and which he might much more find, in doing any <hi>Extenſive Service</hi> for the Kingdom of our Great SAVIOUR in the World; or any thing to redreſs the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries under which Mankind is generally Languiſhing.</p>

            <head>An Appendix; Concerning the ESSAYS that are made, for the <hi>Propagation of Religion</hi> among the Indians, in the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi>-Province of NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>IT has been deſired, That our Book of <hi>Eſſays to do Good,</hi> may give an Account, of Some that are actually Purſued, on One of the moſt important Articles that have been propoſed. The occaſion for this Deſire, has been given by ſome odd Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by ſome who expreſs a Zeal for, <hi>The Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Religion,</hi> as if nothing had been done that way, by any People of our Profeſſion, who readily own, <q>That we are for Embracing &amp; Diffuſing the Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of CHRIST, in the <hi>Original Purity</hi> wherein His Goſpel has given it unto us, without Humane <hi>Additions</hi> &amp; <hi>Inventions.</hi>
               </q> Tis true, We have cauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to blame our ſelves for our own <hi>Deficiencies</hi> in ſuch a Work of God. And if we give an Account of what we have done, it muſt be with an Holy Shame that we have <hi>done ſo little. Pride,</hi> and, <hi>Vain-glorious Oſtentation,</hi> Be thou at all poſſible Diſtance from the <hi>Relation,</hi> which our concern to have the Grace of God acknowledged, and a well-Deſigning Society of Good Men defended from Injurious Imputations, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled us to communicate unto the World.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be done with all the <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Brevity</hi> that the matter will allow of.</p>
            <p>In the Book Entituled, <hi>Magnalia Chriſti Americana,</hi> or, <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, there is a large
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:001460_0196_0FB34C57A8D2DDE0"/>
Account of what was <hi>formerly done,</hi> for the Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of our <hi>Indians.</hi> Thither we refer the Reader, for all that was <hi>formerly done:</hi> which when he Reads, he will certainly wiſh for more ELIOT's in the World. <hi>The preſent State of Chriſtianity</hi> among them, is what muſt now be Reported.</p>
            <p>The Number of <hi>Indians</hi> in this Land, is not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to what it was, in the middle of the former Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. The Wars which after an Offered and Rejected Goſpel, they perfidiouſly began upon the Engliſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Thirty years ago, brought a Quick Deſolation upon whole Nations of them. All that remain under the Engliſh Influences in the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi>-Province, are generally recovered out of their Paganiſm, to ſome ſenſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Chriſtianized Indians on the two Iſlands of <hi>Martha's</hi> Vinyard, and <hi>Nantucket</hi> make a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Body. At <hi>Martha's</hi> Vinyard and <hi>Elſabeth</hi>'s Iſlands, there are Ten Congregations, in which a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST is worſhipped. There are Two Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, and Ten Indians, that are Preachers to them, in their own Language. They have <hi>Schools</hi> alſo, in which their Children are taught to Read and Write; and know the Catechiſm. At <hi>Nantucket,</hi> there are at leaſt Three Congregations; and more than as many Preachers.</p>
            <p>From theſe <hi>Iſlands</hi> we will paſs to the adjacent <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> Where a careful Enquiry has been lately made, in a <hi>Viſitation</hi> ordered for that purpoſe by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for ſuch affairs. The Reſult of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was, That there are between Twenty &amp; Thirty Congregations of <hi>Chriſtianized Indians,</hi> here on the <hi>Main;</hi> whereto there belong near Three Thouſand Souls. Here are Ten Engliſh Preachers, who give them their Inſtructions and Aſſiſtences, and Preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, either on the <hi>Lords dayes,</hi> or in appointed
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:001460_0197_0FB34C5CE9A73928"/>
               <hi>Lectures.</hi> There are alſo between Twenty &amp; Thirty <hi>Indian</hi> Teachers, by whom the Exerciſes of the <hi>Lords-dayes</hi> are moſtly managed. They have in ſeveral of theſe Villages on the <hi>Main,</hi> alſo made handſome Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of their own, towards the Building of <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſes;</hi> wherein the Engliſh likewiſe have helped them. They have the whole <hi>Bible</hi> in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; which has been here twice Printed for them. This <hi>Great Light</hi> has been <hi>Satellited,</hi> with other Books which we have alſo printed for them, in their own Language. Their Library is continually growing, by <hi>New Books,</hi> wherewith we Serve and Suit the Intereſts of Chriſtianity among them, from time to time, as we ſee occaſion. And their <hi>Schools</hi> are multiplying. <hi>Family-Prayer</hi> alſo is frequently upheld among them. And their <hi>Marriages</hi> are uſually celebrated according to the Directions left by the famous ELIOT, whoſe Name ſtill is of much Authority with them.</p>
            <p>There are ſome Congregations of <hi>Indians,</hi> which are not advanced unto all the Priviledges of the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Church-State;</hi> not yet combining for, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of, all <hi>Special Ordinances.</hi> Yet a conſiderable Number of them are ſo; and ſome <hi>New Churches</hi> have been lately form'd and fill'd among them.</p>
            <p>The performances in the ordinary Congregations of the <hi>Indians,</hi> have been often ſuch, that there are very many Engliſh Witneſſes, who have not a little admired at the Gravity, the Attention, the Affection expreſſed in them. The pertinent <hi>Prayers</hi> (and, <hi>Sine Monitore, quia de Pectore,</hi>) the Orthodox <hi>Sermons,</hi> (at the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, the very Children of a dozen years old will readily turn to the Proofs,) and the Singing of <hi>Pſalms,</hi> with a Melody out-doing many of the Engliſh, in their Meetings, have been frequently obſerved with Admiration. To ſee ſuch forlorn Salvages, and the moſt ruteful Ruines of Mankind, not only <hi>Cicurated</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="unknown:001460_0198_0FB34C5F48D29738"/>
into ſome Civility, but alſo <hi>Elevated</hi> unto ſo much Knowledge and Practice of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> has to ſome appeared an amiable and admirable Spectacle!</p>
            <p>In their Churches, they have <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of their own; <hi>Ordained,</hi> Sometimes by the Hands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters; and ſometimes by the Hands of the <hi>Indian</hi> Miniſters, in the Preſence of the Engliſh; All after the Solemn Engliſh manner. And by <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions</hi> and <hi>Excommunications</hi> Publickly diſpenſed, they proceed againſt Scandalous Offendors: for which Intent, and that they may ſeaſonably Find and Heal all <hi>Scandals,</hi> they hold a <hi>Church-Meeting</hi> the Week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every Communion.</p>
            <p>One that is at this Time, a Pious and Faithful Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Miniſter, but Preaching alſo to the <hi>Indians,</hi> has given in unto us, this Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Gravity, and diligent Attendance in the Time of Worſhip, with the affectionate Confeſſions of ſuch as are Admitted, into the Church, make me hope, that many of them may have the Work of the Spirit wrought in them, <hi>according to the working of the mighty Power of God.</hi> Their Method, reſpecting thoſe that are Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into their Communion, is more according to the manner of the Churches in the Primitive Times, than is now practiſed among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in moſt Parts. The Perſon to be Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſtands forth in the midſt of the Aſſembly; and firſt makes a <hi>Declaration</hi> of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and ſometimes deſires <hi>Information</hi> in things more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and doubtful. And then, he makes a <hi>Confeſſion of Sin;</hi> which they do, (as I have ſeen) with <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> like him in the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:001460_0199_0FB34A2889E6D210"/>
                  <hi>Sixteenth</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Acts.</hi> And then he gives an Account of <hi>Experiences</hi> he has had, of Convictions, Awakenings, and Comforts; in which they are large and particular. After which (much Counſel and Exhortation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſtedfaſt in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Wayes</hi> of the Lord, being given them, by their <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi>) they are Admitted. I would, (and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groundedly) hope, That <hi>Additions</hi> are <hi>made unto the Church daily of ſuch as ſhall be Saved.</hi> There are many, which maintain a Chriſtian Converſation, and are to be accounted, not <hi>Almoſt,</hi> but <hi>Altogether Chriſtians.</hi> And this does Encourage the Preaching of the Goſpel to them; when we ſee, it pleaſes God to make it, <hi>His Power unto Salvation.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At preſent, we can do nothing for thoſe Bloody Salvages in the <hi>Eaſtern Parts,</hi> who have been taught by the <hi>French Priests,</hi> That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was a <hi>French</hi> Lady, and that our Great Saviour was a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Murdered Him, and that He Roſe from the Dead, &amp; is taken up to the Heavens, but that all that would recommend themſelves to His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, muſt Revenge His Quarrel on the Engliſh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which iſſuing out from their Indiſcoverable Swamps, they have often done with cruel Depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When we have had the ſhort Reſpites of a Truce with them, we have made ſeveral New At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to carry them the Tenders of a <hi>Glorious Goſpel;</hi> but they have preſently broke out into Freſh Hoſtilities, which have put an End unto all Good Expectations concerning them.</p>
            <p>There has been <hi>Something done</hi> to <hi>Chriſtianize</hi> the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> and other Indians, in the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut;</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="unknown:001460_0200_0FB34A2526CE6ED8"/>
but, <hi>Lord, who has believed!</hi> They have been obſtinate in their Paganiſm; however their obſtinacy has not put an End unto our Endeavours.</p>
            <p>An Exemplary Indian Miniſter, whoſe Name is <hi>Japhet,</hi> has of late years made ſeveral Salleyes, among his Pagan Country-men, about the <hi>Narraganſet</hi>-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and the <hi>Hand of the Lord has been with him,</hi> and many <hi>have Believed, and turned unto the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have made many Trials, to make the <hi>Joyful Sound</hi> of the Goſpel, reach unto the Five Nations, that are ſome Hundreds of Miles diſtant from us, to the Weſtward. All that is yet accompliſhed, is, To Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Reward the pains of ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, who proceed as far as they well can, that theſe may no longer be ſuch <hi>Fooliſh Nations;</hi> and have ſeen ſome comfortable Succeſſes of their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>The Principal concern for the Indians in the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſet</hi>-Province, is to Preſerve and Improve the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> already Profeſſed among them, and Prevent the loſs of a <hi>Noble Work</hi> by ſome Degeneracies, which have no very well boding Aſpect upon it: Eſpecially, to Prevent the Fatal Effects, with which the <hi>Bottel</hi> threatens it. In order hereto, various Methods are uſed continually, to keep a Watchful Inſpection on their Manners, and to make what Progreſs we can in <hi>Angliciſing</hi> of them. Theſe things are in the <hi>Practice</hi> Encumbred with Difficulties, beyond what can be by moſt men in the bare <hi>Theory</hi> imagined. But the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> here Entruſted, for the management of that Affayr, continually Conſult and Purſue, what may be moſt Subſervient unto the Grand Intention.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IT is a Paſſage of the Incomparable BOYL; <q>When I conſider, how much more to the Advantage of the Sacred Writings, and of Chriſtian Theology in general, diverſe Texts have been Explain'd and Diſcours'd of, by the Excellent <hi>Grotius, Maſius, Mede,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> and ſome other Late Great Wits, (to name now no Living ones,) in their ſeveral kinds, than the ſame Places have been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Vulgar Expoſitors, and other Divines; And when I conſider, that none of theſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies was at once a great Philoſopher and a Great Critick; I cannot but hope, that when it ſhall pleaſe God, to ſtir up Perſons of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Genius, well furniſhed with Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Learning, and the Principles of true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and ſhall give them an Hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Advance of His Truths, theſe men will make Explications, &amp; Diſcoveries that ſhall be admirable. — You ſhould no more meaſure the Wiſdom of God couched in the Bible, by the Gloſſes and Syſtems of Common Expoſitors and Preachers, than Eſtimate the Wiſdom He has Expreſs'd in the contrivance of the World, by <hi>Magirus</hi>'s or <hi>Euſtachius</hi>'s Phyſicks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="unknown:001460_0202_0FB34A299F2ADDD8"/>Many years after this, the admirable <hi>Witſius</hi> comforts us with a Paſſage of an obſervable Aſpect that way; <q>
                  <hi>Neque profecto officio hic ſuo defuerunt Illuſtres Animae.</hi>—There have not bees wanting thoſe Illuſtrious Men, who have obſerved all the Solid Diſcoveries in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> all the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſearches of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or that has occured in <hi>Phyſick</hi> or in <hi>Law,</hi> relating to the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> and have applyed it all with a Signal Dexterity to the <hi>Illuſtration</hi> thereof; And ſo 'tis come to paſs, that <hi>Theology,</hi> which had vaſt Riches of its own before, is now alſo Enriched with foreign <hi>Spoiles,</hi> and appears with thoſe Ornaments, which Extort, even from them that are moſt of all diſaffected unto it, a confeſſion of its moſt charming Majeſty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Noble Service to Mankind, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, having been ſo far Purſued, it is eaſy to imagine, that a Perſon of but common Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, applying himſelf unto it, might accompliſh a very <hi>Rich Collection of Illuſtrations,</hi> upon the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Book of Truth and of Life.</hi> It may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, but the Treatiſe now in our Hands may very agreeably do it, that the Friends of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Religion be now <hi>Advertiſed,</hi> of a Moderate Performance, which by the Help of Heaven, has been produced, of ſuch a Tendency.</p>
            <p>No little part of what has been Written on the Great Intention of <hi>Illuſtrating the Divine Oracles,</hi> has been peruſed. Some Hundreds of the <hi>Lateſt,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Oldeſt</hi> Writers, that have had any
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:001460_0203_0FB34A2B1F2432D0"/>
thing Looking that way, have been conſulted. Many Thouſands of their <hi>Fineſt Thoughts</hi> have been found out, Extracted, &amp; Digeſted. The <hi>Eye</hi> of the Authors Induſtry, has not yet <hi>Seen every Precious Thing;</hi> yet it has often, in the three Luſtres of years, which have ran ſince he began his Undertaking, <hi>Viſited the Place of Sapphires,</hi> and <hi>found the Dust of Gold,</hi> which is here Expoſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Refined part of Mankind, when it ſhall ſee cauſe to accept thereof. And there are Two Competent Volumns of the choiceſt <hi>Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (in <hi>folio</hi>) now lying ready for Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>The Work interferes not at all, with the Two very valuable Volumns of the POLAN <hi>Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> but may ask for it, as an agreeable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to attend upon them.</p>
            <p>It is hoped, That all Impartial Chriſtians, of whatever Denomination or Subdiviſion in Chriſtianity, will eſteem it, <hi>An uſeful Work;</hi> For it muſt needs be ſo, if the Books, from which the <hi>Beſt Things</hi> are fetch'd, and laid here together, were ſo.</p>
            <p>To beſtow the cenſure of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vanity,</hi> on the Propoſing of ſuch a Work for Publication, would be there-with to Reproach all Attempts in ſuch a way to Serve the Publick. 'Tis no Treſpaſs againſt the Rules of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> (but it would look like one againſt the Rules of <hi>Equity</hi> to call it ſo,) to give the Publick, a Report, and a Tender, of what has been thus Prepared. It
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:001460_0204_0FB34A2E20FA0FF8"/>
is a <hi>Lawful</hi> and a <hi>Modeſt</hi> thing, for a Man to Deſire, that ſo much of a Short Life, as has been Spent in ſuch a Preparation, ſhould not be <hi>Spent in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author Lives in Daily Expectation of his Death; But he Dies with ſome Hope, that the Glorious Head of the Church, will ſtir up ſome generous Minds, to forward an Undertaking So Confeſſedly Worthy to be Proſecuted.</p>
