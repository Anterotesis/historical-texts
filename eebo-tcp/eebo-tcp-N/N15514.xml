            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is with deference and esteem sufficient, perhaps, to render even intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion excused, that I have presumed to <hi>inscribe</hi> the following little piece to so very respectable a body.</p>
            <p>THE true spirit of laws, in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, as well as operation, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our religion, oppose not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate with, one another. The teachers of the latter, should ever regard the faithful conservators and executers of the former, as friends to <hi>both,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminently the Ministers of God, and the Benefactors of man.</p>

They know, you wish them to excel in virtue, in order that they may excel in character and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>

            <p>THESE very words, with one or two beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful verses preceding them, have been fixed on, in our church, to introduce the <hi>service of the day:</hi> a circumstance engaging me, by predilection, to make them the ground of what I have now to offer.</p>
            <p>No man did ever possess more piety, and real patriotism united, than Moses, the venerable conductor and lawgiver of the sons of Jacob. From these heroic principles, he refused the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and wealth of Egypt: he chose rather, for the people's welfare, to take his share in every difficulty and danger they had to conflict with. For their advancement too in that celestial wisdom which was to insure their happiness, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019768_0005_0FACAFFD8FD9E450"/>
their days within the promised land,—
"his doctrines incessantly dropped as the rain, his speech distilled as the kin<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass."
They found in him, an able head, a warm affectionate heart, and an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly powerful hand; for the God of Israel was with him.</p>
            <p>IT is not very often that a true hero or patriot is born, or that men are raised up <hi>illustrious</hi> for great and good actions in the world. Of the names that have been sounded loud and high by the breath of same, more have been as scourges, and a curse to mankind, than any benefit or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
            <p>REAL usefulness both in the smaller, and the larger circles of life, depends chiefly on upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of intention, sincerity, and goodness: and it can only be expected from greatness of ability, when that greatness goes in connection with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.—Yet, let it be remembered, for the conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of virtue, and her support, among whatever order of the people, or classes, she may be found, that, no labour of love, no act of beneficence, not even the silent breathings of an honest heart ascending from the loneliest cottage in the land,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019768_0006_0FACAFFE0984F748"/>
and wishing to draw down grace and blessings on the public—shall ever, in the sight of heaven, be disregarded or forgotten.</p>
            <p>THE chapter before us contains,
"the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel before his death."</p>
            <p>HIS ministry and divine legation were soon to close: they had been fulfilled with distinguished fidelity, and attended with superlative success. The numerous people of whom he had the charge, had now passed through the tedious dangers of the wilderness, and were near their entry into the promised land. The only barrier that remained, was Jordan. Over this, however, he was not to go himself.</p>
            <p>PREPARATORY to the resignation of his high trust, to Joshua his successor; and his ascent unto the top of Pisgah—having adjusted every great concern, and given his last solemn charge to that people whose prosperity was ever near his heart; he annexes thereunto a parting benediction. This had a respect, not only to the nation at large, but to every tribe distinctly and particularly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:019768_0007_0FACB001700A5318"/>THE stile is, in part, prophetic; descriptive of their several future fortunes and conditions: the spirit and manner of the whole is exceedingly sublime and animated.</p>
            <p>HE sets out with commemorating that instance of the divine goodness which concerned the United States of Israel, in general, (being a common bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to them all,) the Almighty's revelation of his mind and will to them, and the manifestation of his continual glorious presence, and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending providence.
"The Lord came from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai and rose up from Seir unto them: he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a law given them out of the midst of fire."—
"Yea, he loved the people."
—He owned them for his son, and his first-born; he consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted them a venerable holy nation; re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them under his special care, that he might instruct, and render them eminently happy.</p>
            <p>HE forthwith proceeds to notice the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the descendants of REUBEN; to foretell their prosperous condition, though they were not so considerable in respect of numbers as some other tribes.
"Let <hi>Reuben</hi> live, and not die; and let not his men be few."</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:019768_0008_0FACB002AAE57DB8"/>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> does not appear to be expressly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned here, inasmuch as [according to some expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors] that tribe was included in Judah, and "their inheritance" was blended with the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Judah: But it seems more probable that Simeon shares in the benediction of the first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned patriarch; and so his record stands in some ancient copies of this book.</p>
            <p>THE pre-eminent felicity of JUDAH is next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served—
"Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies."</p>
            <p>THE designation and privileges of LEVI do next take place.
"Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy One."
—Let there be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this tribe the sacred priesthood—the exalted honour also of consulting heaven, and receiving divine instruction by the High Priest, in relation to the public welfare; or, make them upright and faithful, as well as able and discerning in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of their trust.
"They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt offerings upon thine altar. Bless, Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:019768_0009_0FACB00388C50690"/>THE next in their order are BENJAMIN,
"The beloved of the Lord,"
dwelling in safety, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the presence of his glory all the day long;—JOSEPH possessing a delightful, fertile country, blessed of the Most High,
"for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things of heaven; for the precious things brought forth by the sun and moon; for the chief things of the ancient mountains;"
and for the kindly produce of the earth, and the fulness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and for the goodness of him that dwelleth in the heavens, and revealed himself in glory in the burning bush.</p>
            <p>—THEN follow
"the ten thousands of EPH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAIM, and the thousands of MANASSEH—;"
"ZEBULON rejoicing in his going out, and ISSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHAR in his tents"
—inviting the people to the sacred mountain to worship in the house of the Lord—; GAD in possession of an ample inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and presently enlarging it; dwelling in much safety, though encompassed with enemies;
"coming with the chiefs of the people—execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel"
—; DAN endowed with the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of
"a young lion, and leaping from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shan"
—: NAPHTHALI
"satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord"
—; and, lastly, ASHER, happy in a numerous beautiful off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019768_0010_0FACB004214EA838"/>
acceptable to his brethren; nourished with plenty; sustained with power; embellished with delight; favoured with numerous days, and a proportional increasing strength.</p>
            <p>HAVING in this elevated descriptive manner, characterised the state of each particular tribe; and pronounced in favour of them, distinct pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar benedictions,—he throws into one grand view, their general felicity, by representing the whole people as distinguished from every other, in having the most perfect all-glorious Being, for their Father, their Friend, their Saviour, their God; in possessing, under his gracious providence, every thing that could make them prosper;—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of victory, freedom, plenty, peace.—
"There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky."
—
"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee, and shall say, Destroy them.— Israel shall then dwell in safety alone: the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heaven shall drop down dew."
— Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019768_0011_0FACB00525F85E10"/>THE considerations I shall now dwell on a little while, deduced particularly from this last recited passage, are the following—</p>
            <p>THAT a nation, or people, counselled, protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and assisted by the Almighty God, must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be great and happy:</p>
            <p>THAT the only way in which a people can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and perpetuate this heavenly aid and favour, is in the extensive, general observance of purity and virtue:</p>
            <p>THAT to retain a constant, deeply impressed sensibility of the care of Providence and the smiles of Heaven; and to express this often in the most public general manner, must have an excellent effect upon the public manners and conduct.—</p>
            <p>THESE matters will directly lead us to what concerns ourselves at this day;—to review the past—to attend to the present—to look forward to the probable future fortunes of this rising country.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE divine most blessed Being, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and grace shed peace and goodness around individuals—doth often manifest himself to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their national capacity, as
"a crown of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019768_0012_0FACB0058F143EA8"/>
glory, and a diadem of beauty."
Before him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
"all nations are, comparatively, as nothing; and they are counted to him, less than nothing and vanity."
Yet doth he
"humble himself to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the things that are on the earth, as well as in the heavens."
He, whose knowledge and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendence are such, that the very hairs of our head are all numbered; and even a sparrow falls not to the ground without his order,—the same great Arbiter of every event, continually watches over the kingdoms and nations of the world, either to "build and to plant," and to cause them to prosper; or else
"to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict."</p>
            <p>THE grand extensive object of his various works and ways, is, the complete establishment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and happiness. Through the revolution of numerous periods, this his illustrious work is carrying forward. All the occurrences and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that happen in the world; the several causes whether natural or moral, with their effects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, that any where take place, are no other than instruments, under his controul, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his purpose: and, even where they appear not to the human eye to have that tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019768_0013_0FACB00655DB17C0"/>
his over-ruling power continually conducts them to it.</p>
            <p>THE human species, by the appointment of the Creator, being parcelled into nations; and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting, according to situation, times, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, distinct states, kingdoms, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; whatever is applicable to individuals, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as agents in the divine hand, may likewise be applied to those public bodies, though still in a larger view.</p>
            <p>AS to the Almighty's arrangement, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential allotment of gifts and qualifications, we may discern a very clear analogy between the state of individuals, and of nations. In the case of the <hi>former,</hi> the allotments are various, and of different degrees; so it is with the <hi>latter:</hi> And in regard to both, this maxim will always hold sure, that where much is given, the more (in point of duty and excellence) will be required.</p>
            <p>IT is in a national capacity, and within the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts of civil society, that men are capable of the greatest good, and have the opportunities of prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising the most extensive virtues—</p>
            <l>Theirs "are the plans of policy and peace,</l>
            <l>To live like brothers, and <hi>conjunctive</hi> all,</l>
            <l>Embellish life."—</l>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:019768_0014_0FACB0072F986708"/>
It is here that humanity, benevolence, charity, can best have their generous operation: It is here, men learn to live, and also are taught to die, not to themselves alone. It is here, that God is best seen and adored, the Friend of individuals—the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian God of nations.</p>
            <p>NOW, when He in his wise providence, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and, as it were accelerate the completion of his gracious plans, chuses that this people, or the other, should eminently grow in power; possess extensive territory; enjoy a happy equality among themselves; a reasonable well-confirmed freedom; and withal, practise, and hold up to the world, a religion pure and undefiled;—the various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances relating to their earlier, or more advanced condition, he watches over, and manages for good; a spirit of general wisdom, oeconomy, and prudence, he inspires; defenders of the public weal, able, determined, and faithful, he raises up and strengthens; events seemingly disastrous, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouls, and renders salutary;—in dangers he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages them; in conflicts he is their stay; and in the time of affluence and safety, their joy and their crown.</p>
            <p>IN this way did he peculiarly reveal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his excellencies to Israel of old; so did he
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019768_0015_0FACB007D3706508"/>
conduct, inform, magnify, and bless the children of "Abraham his friend," in all things which they waited upon him for; and as long as their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on his sole power and goodness was dutiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shown in ardent piety, and uniform obedience. —
"Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help."
—</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am led now to this next consideration, That the only way by which a people can ascertain, and render durable the Divine assistance and blessing, is, by attending duly to the unfeigned practice of holiness and virtue.</p>
            <p>IT is an established maxim in the order of things, and of very high authority, that,
"Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness exalteth a nation,"
but
"Sin is a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's reproach."
—As naturally as correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent effects flow from their immediate causes; so doth the happiness, or misery of nations, spring from virtue, or vice. That behaviour in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of society, which is consonant to truth, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, uprightness, purity, must, unquestionably, give to all their affairs, the happiest adjustment and disposition; place them on the firmest foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and insure to them the most success. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming to the rules of charity and goodness, they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019768_0016_0FACB0088A42E460"/>
cannot but advance each others ease and comfort: maintaining justice inviolate; adhering to a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, impartial, disinterested conduct invariably— observing temperance, frugality, together with an animated diligence in all things; especially vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating most sincerely the Supreme Lord of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial system; they must, with a collected, noble operation, build up, and render beautiful, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of public happiness.</p>
            <p>THE wise and gracious Ruler of the universe, delights in holiness and virtue.
"Whatever he delights in must be happy."
A temper, and such manners as resemble, in some considerable degree, his essential goodness, purity, and love, is that alone which blesses, and renders glorious an individual; the same will bless and glorify a number of individuals;—it is this which makes us happy, singly considered; it is this which will make us so, collectively.</p>
            <p>WE find the safety of states and countries in all ages, running parallel with the observance which they paid to the Divine Being and his laws. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and piety, even in countries where their true objects were unknown, had, we find, a propitious influence upon the public concerns: They fixed a restraint upon the passions of the people; they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019768_0017_0FACB00953D1C2D0"/>
strengthened and preserved their union; they heightened their moral sense; increased their ideas of a common interest; gave them a confidence in the time of dangers; firmness under trials; a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and temperance amidst their successes. The most flourishing periods of ancient <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> were those, in which a regard to the Powers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be above them, and the practice of their religion, even such as it was, did most obtain.</p>
            <p>IN that land where the true object of religious worship was known; where the only living God had been pleased to manifest his perfections, and his will,—the connection between piety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, was eminently conspicuous; the direct rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion subsisting between obedience to the heavenly orders, and the prosperity of the people, was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where discerned and felt.</p>
            <p>YOU cannot be strangers to the great and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promises held up to Israel, grounded on this condition, that they
"should hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord their God, to observe and to do all his commandments."
As citizens connected with the public—as members of domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic society—as venerable tillers of the ground— possessors of flocks and herds, and owners of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous property—as warriors too, called forth at
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019768_0018_0FACB00A271E2518"/>
times to guard and defend their country;—in every place, in every circumstance; and whatever rank or character sustaining, they were to be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful and happy.
"Blessed shall thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed when thou comest in, and when thou goest out.—The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee, to be smitten before thy face. He shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store-houses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto.—He shall establish thee an holy people unto himself."</p>
            <p>NOW these things are for an example and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all nations which were to come after; —meanwhile, the evils threatened, the vexation, rebukes, and manifold calamities which did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue, upon the general disobedience and ingratitude of that people, exhibit an awful warning—</p>
            <p n="3">III. A particular yet remaining to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is as follows,</p>
            <p>THAT to maintain a constant deeply-impressed sensibility of the eare of Providence, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Heaven, in regard to the affairs of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as individuals; and to express the fame frequently in the most public grateful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019768_0019_0FACB00AC96F4880"/>
tendeth to shed the happiest influence upon the public measures and behaviour.</p>
            <p>MOST certainly, that God who
"is not far from every one of us"
—in whom
"we live, and move, and have our being,"
we ought in every thing to see, acknowledge, and adore.—A prevailing perception of his presence, grace, and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, attended with such manners as that percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion invariably produces, must constitute felicity, wherever it is found. A <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful fervent operations, can alone constitute solid peace and pleasure.</p>
            <p>THAT which holds true in this matter, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to one or another of the human kind, may be transferred, as applicable to any number: that which can establish you, or me, in real quiet, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, and bliss, and produce as it were, a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise regained,</hi> in each smaller circle to which we more immediately belong; can do the same to multitudes—, can constitute the peace, the order, the prosperity of confederated millions.</p>
            <p>IS it not therefore desirable—is it not indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably necessary, for the general welfare, that this divine sense should prevail wide and far? that, at the least, the major part of every community
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019768_0020_0FACB00B9E480F58"/>
and state should possess its fulness, and show its power?—The more they know of God and his inestimable favours, the more will they admire and love him; and the higher this admiration and this love,—the more uniform, exalted, and pure, the returns will be of acknowledgment and praise. And it must then follow, that the State will flourish in proportion.</p>
            <p>THE Almighty Patron and Friend of pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals—the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, was the God of Israel as a nation; and he is at all times the God and Guardian of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and state, that pays a due respect to his super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending rule and majesty. Causes and effects are intirely at his command. Every circumstance, and every event, either by its immediate or ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate operation, proves subservient, under him, to his divine purposes. It is He who alone can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a blessing upon the counsels of a people, or confound their devices; who can strengthen and exalt them; or diminish and bring them low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who can open the heavens in their beauty, and shower down the abundance of his treasure; or shut them up in blackness, and send forth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his anger. It is He who brings health and plenty smiling through a land—or bids the pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to cleave to the inhabitants, and famine to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019768_0021_0FACB00C4E608AC0"/>
pursue them until they are consumed: It is He who gives them the victory in battle; or causes them to flee, or fall before their enemies.</p>
            <p>IN the seasons of public distress and evil, as it is a people's duty to humble themselves very deeply, and to exercise most solemn penitence; so, when it doth please the Almighty to crown the public with his benefits,—a general sense of gratitude, returns of thankfulness, in some degree proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, must, in every view, be decent, becoming, requisite—</p>
            <p>"O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness; and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men! That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people; and praise him in the seat of the elders!"</p>
            <p>THERE are blessings which speak with a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished energy;—which fill the soul with new<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> increasing pleasure,—which spread diffusively their influence and effects; adapted also to produce, and justly laying claim to, the devoutest praise of every member of society. Surely nothing should obstruct, or in any degree restrain, the spirit of holy praise, the exercise of lively thanksgiving
"unto God even the Father, in the name of our
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019768_0022_0FACB00D37932470"/>
Lord Jesus Christ:"
especially as he, whose preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous merits give influence to the sighings and the sorrows of a contrite heart, and render still accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table every request of the penitent and holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper,—renders their <hi>thanksgivings</hi> also divine, and sits the lovely sacrifice for presentation before the throne of the <hi>excellent glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF then such pious sensibility were cultivated, and kept awake;—were it happily to spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to become general; and at every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per season to be expressed in fervent united acts of social worship; the people among whom it so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, must prosper—the dispositions susceptible of happiness would grow upon them—; the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per disqualifying men for it, would decline;—the virtues which adorn society would all revive;— the vices which disgrace it would languish and die;—order, tranquility, and peace would be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; freedom would be established; and the truest dignity and glory ascertained.</p>
            <p>IN the course of these several considerations, I cannot doubt, my honoured audience, but that you have been making, as we went along, some useful improvement of them. You could not but perceive the relation which they bear in sundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, to our own circumstances as a people, at
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019768_0023_0FACB00DC95367C8"/>
the present period. This indeed I have steadily kept in view, from my first setting out, and through the whole of what hath been suggested.— To be yet more particular and express, may have its benefit.</p>
            <p>THE special purpose of our assembling now, you are all acquainted with. It is to recognise the Divine Superintendence in an event perhaps of as extraordinary magnitude as ever marked the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the world. It is, in the spirit of devotion to the Most High, and of good will towards mankind, to celebrate the memory of a day, from which our future fortunes are likely to derive a permanent complexion and establishment:—a day on which were laid, by the august Fathers of their country,
"the perpetual foundations of peace, liberty, and safety."</p>
            <p>THE morning of this anniversary, now the tenth in the course of revolving years, since the ever-memorable aera, hath, with an <hi>undiminished</hi> joy, poured its radiance from yonder skies.—Its blith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some hours waft blessings on their wings.
"The mountains and the hills break forth into singing."
A glory shines around: and the Recording Angel flies to report, and write in heaven—
ANOTHER YEAR OF FREEDOM TO A WORLD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:019768_0024_0FACB01024C83AB0"/>AFFECTION for the land we live in, must, at the least, be an innocent passion. The <hi>Amor Patriae,</hi> a steady, glowing, disinterested love for one's country, hath, by the wise and good in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, been held in estimation. This, as Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, we cultivate with ardor, in perfect consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, I trust, with the genius of the blessed gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and undivided from a sacred regard to the rights of all the kindreds of the earth. We wish, dependent upon none but the <hi>God of nations,</hi> to rise and prosper; yet, we wish not this prosperity, —heaven forbid! to the disadvantage, much less upon the ruins, of any people.</p>
            <p>WHILE we adore and bless the power of the Lord, for the revolution that hath taken place, it is in perfect persuasion, that it will issue in the noblest consequences; it is, in a consciousness "void of offence" towards the people from whom we separated; it is, in clear conviction, that <hi>the very time was come,</hi> for our assuming a distinct, personal rank in the family of nations; it is, in the experience, that religious and civil liberty go hand in hand.—</p>
            <p>I FEEL no inclination for refinement on a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this kind. Conjecture I would shun, as rather fruitless: and, the possible entertainment of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019768_0025_0FACB01217014840"/>
a speculating fancy, willingly forego. Matters of unquestionable fact, alone, and the consequences they are likely, in their nature, to draw after them, are to our purpose.</p>
            <p>METHINKS I see (and surely you discern with equal clearness) cause in abundance, to excite pleasure and exalted expectation;—though some, I must confess, for apprehension not so pleasing, and for regret.—In the distinguished aid and countenance of heaven, directing public measures, particularly at the conjuncture which we are looking back to; and in the conduct, still, of an <hi>illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous few,</hi> we find the one: In a deficiency of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures since, to complete the system of our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and in a too general want of virtue among the people, we can trace the other. But, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to bring forward, at this time, any thing that might cloud the hopes we would most fondly cherish.</p>
            <p>FROM the very rise of an arduous contest,—in what degree the counsels of America were illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from above; what special benediction and success attended the execution of them,—it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, minutely to describe.</p>
            <p>WHETHER we take a retrospective view of the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019768_0026_0FACB012563EBF78"/>
host of dangers that have at times environed us, yet seasonably were dispelled;—our weaknesses, that have improved into strength;—resources few and inconsiderable, growing into respectability;— occurrences disastrous on our side, soon issuing in our gain;—successes boasted of as brilliant on the part of our opponents, quickly terminating in their loss and disappointment;—and I may add, events numerous, diversified, shedding a positive renown upon the continental federal proceedings, as pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which bespoke the hastening full prosperity of that great country we inherit;—in all these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and particulars, 'tis obvious beyond a question, that
"underneath were the everlasting arms,"
—that the Lord was the shield of our help.</p>
            <p>IN connection herewith, and in relation to the same grand objects, and the Divine Arbiter of all, we place in the list of blessings—the tranquillity we enjoyed, even in the midst of war; the plenty that crowned the labours of the husbandman; the share of commerce flowing to, and from, our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ports; the means and opportunities of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table knowledge, especially divine;—the amity confirmed, on principles of mutual good, between this country, and some of the greatest powers of the earth; the valour, perseverance, and fine order of the soldiery, the judgment, magnanimity, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:019768_0027_0FACB0130E4BBE88"/>
enterprise of the generals, and others in command; the temperance and humanity which adorned their victories;—the <hi>peace definitive</hi> that was agreed to, and <hi>an undisputed possession of our liberties and independence.</hi> Such are the accumulated facts and occurrences, dignifying the mighty business we have had in hand.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>lines</hi> having <hi>fallen unto us in pleasant places,</hi> and our <hi>heritage</hi> being so <hi>goodly;</hi> the preservation and perfection of these blessings, should now be our leading aim. We can preserve and perfect them, only by revering their Great Bestower, and practising the virtues which he hath commanded, and delights in.</p>
            <p>SENATORS, and GUARDIANS of this rising Republic! Your abilities and nobleness of mind allow you not to doubt, that the felicity of a country depends on the virtue of its inhabitants; and the virtue of its inhabitants, on their being endued with a pure and manly piety. Unless the Divine Being hath the hearts of the people,— your laws will be considered as ungracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints; they will never sweetly draw, and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bind their affections. Unless their principles be rendered uncorrupt, and their morals pure, your very best contrived systems of policy—your
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019768_0028_0FACB013E85BB210"/>
most approved forms of government—your wisest plans of union and confederation, will never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the Public, stability, or happiness. Honour and recommend the religion therefore which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes the people's wisdom and welfare, by making them fear God; this will give your institutions an hold in their judgments and consciences, that no other principles can effect. Fix the credit of Christianity among them, and spread its glory by the lustre of Your Examples.</p>
            <p>CITIZENS OF THESE STATES!—You are in possession of an extensive, noble country. Fertility and beauty vie with each other, in favour of your ease, accommodation and delight. Freedom, with its train of multiplying benefits, is here establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as your own. Every avenue to national im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and the felicity of individuals, is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wide.—You will not be unmindful, I trust, of the mighty Giver of this wonderful prosperity. It is in obeying the God of your Fathers, that you will find his ancient mercies renewed; and all that have been lately bestowed, entailed upon you for ever. Your safety, your righteousness, and unchangeable excellency, will be in a <hi>conversation such as becometh the gospel.</hi> Proceed in every thing that is just, and venerable, and praise-worthy. Go on to love and cherish one another, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019768_0029_0FACB014911BD260"/>
of the same illustrious Family. Let your <hi>Union</hi> be indissolvable; and its <hi>Bond</hi> all the virtues that can adorn humanity. So will you, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's children after you,
"SING WITH GLAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS FOR JACOB, AND SHOUT AMONG THE CHIEF OF THE NATIONS."
