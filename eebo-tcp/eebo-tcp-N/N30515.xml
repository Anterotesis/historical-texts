         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR bleſſed Lord having in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, arm'd his Diſciples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the corrupt Principles of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> eſpecially in their Expoſition of the Law, which is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where call'd their Leaven; proceeds in this to warn them againſt their corrupt Practices; particularly their Hypocriſy and vain Glory in giving Alms, in Prayer, and in Faſting: Theſe, ſay the <hi>Arabians,</hi> are the three great Chriſtian Duties, the three Foundations of the Law, by them we do Homage to GOD with our three principal Intereſts; by Prayer, with our Souls; by Alms-giving, with our Eſtates; and by Faſting, with our Bodies: It is the laſt of theſe that our Lord treats of, in the Words of our Text; which indeed, when duly obſerved, is attended with the other two. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed JESUS offers the ſame Caution to his Diſciples, in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of every of them, <hi>e. g. When thou doeſt thine Alms,</hi> (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he, that is in ſecret) <hi>do not ſound a Trumpet before thee,</hi> avoid all Oſtentation, <hi>let not thy Left Hand know, what thy Right Hand doeth, that thy Alms may be in ſecret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret will reward thee openly.</hi> Not that it is unlawful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040518_0006_1015E8E31903EE40"/>
Charity in the Sight of others, when thereto call'd by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence: No! But only for that End that we may be ſeen by them. The Thing forbidden under theſe metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, is Oſtentation, and ſeeking our own Honour and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; and the Thing commanded is Sincerity in regard of our End: Tho' the Action of Charity be ſometimes neceſſarily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, yet the End ſhould be always ſecret: Thoſe that give their Alms for Oſtentation-ſake, have their Reward; not the Reward that GOD promiſeth to them that do Good: No! But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they promiſed themſelves, and a poor Reward it is; they did it to be ſeen of Men, and they are ſeen of Men, and applauded by them, and this is all their Reward: They have it in preſent Poſſeſſion, and nothing remaining in reverſion.</p>
                  <p>BUT thoſe that are ſincere and humble in Alms-giving, are not only graciouſly accepted in this Life, but will be openly rewarded by GOD himſelf in the Life to come; <hi>thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, he himſelf ſhall reward thee openly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN like Manner our Lord cautions his Diſciples againſt the ſame Evils, namely, Hypocriſy and Oſtentation in ſecret Prayer; which were too frequent and flagrant among the <hi>Phariſees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WHEN thou prayeſt, thou ſhalt not be as the Hypocrites are, for they love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the Corners of the Streets, that they may be ſeen of Men, verily, I ſay unto you they have their Reward.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Phariſees</hi> affected the moſt conſpicuous Poſture, and moſt publick Places for their private Devotion, with Deſign to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their Eminence in Religion, and this was all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit they obtained by it.</p>
                  <p>ALTHO' their ſtated Uſe of publick Places for private Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip without Neceſſity, was improper and unjuſtifiable; yet it was their evil Deſign herein that our Lord principally reprehends.</p>
                  <p>BUT as to the Poſture of ſtanding in Prayer, it was certainly lawful, proper, and uſual in publick Worſhip, (<hi>Matt.</hi> xi. 25. <hi>Luke</hi> xviii 11.) <hi>When ye ſtand praying, forgive,</hi> ſaith our Lord, and therefore it was their ambitious corrupt View herein, that our Saviour oppoſes, and on the contrary, councils his Diſciples, to chooſe for their ſecret Devotion, ſome Place of Retirement and Privacy, that being unobſerved and undiſturbed, it might be effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, both from Oſtentation and Diſtraction; and be pleaſing to that GOD who principally requires the Heart, and penetrates its moſt concealed Deſigns, and will in due Time graciouſly and honourably reward ſuch as are ſincere.</p>
                  <p>THE very ſame Language does our Lord uſe, the ſame Councils and Cautions does he give, reſpecting the Duty of <hi>Faſting,</hi> in the Words of our Text; which have a plain Reference to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Inſtances of Alms-giving and Prayer; as appears not only from the ſame Forms of Expreſſion, the ſame order of Diſcourſe uſed therein, as well as the ſame Perſons ſpoken of, and to; but likewiſe from the introductive Particle or firſt Word of our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040518_0007_1015E8E4B59F3410"/>
Text, <hi>Moreover,</hi> which manifeſtly ſhews its Relation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Inſtances; it is as if our Lord had ſaid, beſides what I have ſpoken to you upon Alms-giving and Prayer, <hi>Take theſe Directions which are of the ſame Kind, in Relation to the Duty of</hi> Faſting. <hi>Moreover, when ye faſt, be not as the Hypocrites are of a ſad Countenance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>NOW in the Words of our Text, three Things are obſervable, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Faſting</hi> recommended, the <hi>Manner</hi> of it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the <hi>Reward</hi> inciting hereto propoſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Duty</hi> of religious <hi>Faſting</hi> is recommended or enjoined upon proper Occaſions, <hi>i. e.</hi> when GOD by his Providence calls to it, or the Caſe of our own Souls upon any Account requires it.</p>
                  <p>OUR Lords preſcribing the <hi>Manner</hi> of obſerving it, neceſſarily ſuppoſes the Reaſonableneſs, Expediency, and Neceſſity of the Thing itſelf, yea, the Preſcription, or Injunction of that, to which the Mode relates; otherwiſe our Lord muſt be ſuppoſed with ſeriouſneſs to direct how his Diſciples ſhould do <hi>nothing;</hi> which is abſurd! Or that which is worſe than nothing, namely, what is ſinful!</p>
                  <p>TO ſuppoſe that the Mode or accidents of Things, can ſubſiſt without the Subſtance, is to run into the wild Deluſion of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> about <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> which equally oppoſes the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſober Reaſon, and evidence of common Senſe!</p>
                  <p>AND to ſuppoſe that our Lord would direct to the Manner of performing any Thing that is Evil, is in other Words to ſay, that he approves of it; which is as impious as the other is irrational!</p>
                  <p>BESIDES <hi>Faſting</hi> is recommended, in the ſame Manner as <hi>Almſgiving</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and therefore he that oppoſes the former, may with equal reaſon oppoſe the latter, and if ſo, Religion is ſtripped of its principal Parts, namely, Piety towards GOD, and Charity towards Men, and conſequently deſtroyed!</p>
                  <p>WHAT <hi>Piety</hi> towards GOD can a Man be reaſonably ſuppoſed to have, who does not pray to him? Will ſuch fear him, love him, and depend upon him, who pay him no Homage, return him no Thanks for Benefits receiv'd, nor own their Dependance on his Providence? And can there be real Piety without theſe? No, ſurely!</p>
                  <p>AND have ſuch <hi>Charity</hi> towards Men, who, when their Ability admits, and Occaſion requires, cuſtomarily refuſe to diſpenſe their Benificence to the proper Objects of it? In a Word, by this Method Religion is made as oppoſite to GOD, as unfriendly to Society!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Faſting</hi> is preſcribed in our Text, and that both <hi>negatively,</hi> and <hi>poſitively:</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>NEGATIVELY,</hi> Our Lord councils his Diſciples, <hi>when they faſt, not to be as the Hypocrites, of a ſad Countenance, for they disfigure their Faces, that they may appear unto Men to faſt.</hi> We are not to ſuppoſe, that our Lord here, prohibits ſuch a Garb and Geſture, as is ſuited to a Day of publick Faſting; for GOD
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040518_0008_1015E8E6A3B92C10"/>
himſelf ſometimes commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to put off their Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Nor was any thing more common among Good Men, than to cloath themſelves with Sackcloth, and put Aſhes on their Head, or ſpread them under them, upon ſuch ſolemn Occaſions; but what CHRIST prohibits, is their affecting thoſe Things for ſelfiſh and ſordid Purpoſes, while in the mean Time they wanted what was ſignified by them.</p>
                  <p>AND their making no difference between a private and publick Faſt. As our Lord had ſpoken before of private Alms-giving, and private Prayer, ſo he here ſpeaks (at leaſt principally) of a <hi>private Faſt,</hi> as appears from theſe Words, <hi>that ye appear not unto Men to faſt, but to your Father who ſeeth in ſecret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS is by no Means applicable to a <hi>publick Faſt,</hi> for then do Perſons appear to Men with whom they have ſocial Worſhip to faſt; the Deſign is known, the Buſineſs is no ſecret: Yea, and as it is their Duty to be deeply affected on ſuch a ſolemn Occaſion, ſo to appear in reſpect of Garb and Behaviour ſuitable to it! In private Faſts indeed the Caſe is otherwiſe, it is then no doubt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conceal from others obſervance, as much as we can, our private Exerciſes, and Humiliations.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whom our LORD frequently calls <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Faſting</hi> when they were deſtitute of <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, which are the Soul and Kernel of that Duty. They affected to appear more Humbled than they really were, and ſo mock'd GOD, and deceived Men, by their feign'd Pretences: This the Almighty juſtly reſents in the Propheſy of Iſaiah, <hi>is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen, a Man to afflict his Soul, is it to bow down his Head as a Bulruſh, and to ſpread Sackcloth and Aſhes under him, wilt thou call this a Faſt, an acceptable Day to the Lord?</hi> No! Bodily exerciſe, if that be all, will profit little.</p>
                  <p>BESIDES the <hi>Phariſees</hi> proclaim'd and blaz'd abroad their private <hi>Faſts;</hi> as they did their private <hi>Charities,</hi> and private <hi>Prayers;</hi> and ſo manag'd the Matter in reſpect of their appearance and geſture as to declare to every one whom they met with, that it was a Day of Faſting with them; to this purpoſe they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the Streets, when they ſhould have been in their private Rooms, and were clad in a poor Habit, affected a Melancholy Aſpect, and went a ſlow Pace, on Purpoſe to attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, and invite their Applauſe, that they might paſs for ſtrict and mortify'd Men.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Phariſees</hi> received their Name from hence as <hi>Grotius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that they were not contented to fulfill the Rites enjoyn'd by the Law, but were diſtinguiſh'd from others, by ſeverer Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of their own invention: And therefore they <hi>disfigur'd their Faces</hi> on <hi>Faſt Days.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2dly. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> CHRIST teaches us, how to Conduct a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Faſt, <hi>But thou when thou Faſteth anoint thy Head, and waſh thy Face, that thou appear not to Men to Faſt, but to thy Father which is in ſecret. i. e.</hi> Lay aſide all ſhew and appearance of Faſting, appear with thy ordinary Aſpect and Dreſs, and whilſt thou abſtaineſt from Bodily refreſhments, Endeavour to carry ſo that it mayn't be taken Notice of, conceal it as much as you can. rather ſhew the appearance of Gladneſs then of Grief.</p>
                  <p>IN the mean Time obſerve, that CHRIST doth not direct to abate any Thing of the reality of the Faſt, not to take a little Meat, or a little Drink, or any Bodily Refreſhment whatſoever, No! But to lay aſide the Shew of it, and make the inward Part of it our principal Care, namely to be Humble and Sincere before GOD, in obſerving this Solemnity, and to endeavour to approve ourſelves to him To all ſuch,</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly.

                  <p>THE Conſideration of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d's favourable acceptance of our <hi>Faſts,</hi> ſhould make us dead to the Hopes of Mens applauſe, as well as to the Fears of their cenſures. King <hi>David</hi> would not decline the Duty of <hi>faſting,</hi> tho' <hi>it was turn'd,</hi> by the Enemies of Religion, <hi>to his Reproach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF it be objected, that ſeeing CHRIST ſpeaks of a <hi>private Faſt</hi> in our Text, one of a <hi>publick nature</hi> cannot be thereby prov'd.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is a Miſtake, CHRIST approves of abſtinence, which is the Genus or Kind, that includes all the Species or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Sorts of it. Moreover, an Argument from the greater, is concluſive and certain. Seeing CHRIST approves of the Duty of <hi>faſting</hi> in private, when the Cauſes are leſſer and private; he muſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040518_0010_1015E8ED59D44248"/>
needs approve of publick <hi>faſting</hi> when the Cauſes are greater and more important, when it is obſerved humbly and ſincerely, with a ſecret Intention; or elſe be very unreaſonable, in preferring a private Good to a publick.</p>
                  <p>SEEING GOD has given us Bodies as well as Souls, is it but juſt and rational, that he ſhould be ſerved by both, not only in private but in publick?</p>
                  <p>IF it be ſaid, that <hi>Reformation</hi> is ſufficient without outward <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence</hi> I Anſwer, this will conclude as much againſt <hi>Alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Prayer:</hi> For, by a parity of Reaſon, we may ſay, it is enough to pray in our Hearts, and thus all vocal Prayer is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd; and likewiſe that it is enough to give Alms in our Hearts, and thus all Charity is deſtroy'd! In a Word, the aforeſaid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection tends to overthrow, in its Conſequences, all the outward Offices of Religion and Friendſhip at a Stroke, and therefore cannot be true!</p>
                  <p>FROM the Words of our Text thus explained, I would obſerve the following Propoſition, <hi>viz. That Religious Faſting is a Duty of Divine Inſtitution, and great Advantage to Mankind, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be obſerv'd with Care and Caution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN Diſcourſing upon this Propoſition, I would according to the Order of our Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Prove the <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> of Religious Faſting.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Open the <hi>Mode</hi> of its Obſervance</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Repreſent its <hi>Advantages</hi> and <hi>Importance;</hi> and then proceed to the Improvement.</p>
                  <p>Here it ſhould be previouſly obſerv'd that I made mention of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Faſting,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Medicinal;</hi> the former of which is preſcrib'd by the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> for a Civil Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſaving of Proviſion; the latter is uſed for the preventing of <hi>Sickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or recovery of <hi>Health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT <hi>Religious Faſting</hi> is undertaken, on the Account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; with deſign to aſſiſt the performance of the Duties o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it, and may be thus deſcrib'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is an Inſtance of divine <hi>worſhip</hi> preſcrib'd by God, to illuſtrate his Glory, and promote the Good of Mankind. Or in other Words,</p>
                  <p>THAT it is a Solemn voluntary <hi>abſtinence,</hi> from Food, Drink, and all the Pleaſures of Life, for a certain ſpace of Time, which is ſet apart to be ſpent in Prayer and Humiliation.</p>
                  <p>OR if the Conſtitution be ſo weak, as not to be able to endure a total abſtinence without prejudice to Health; yet they ſhould abſtain as far as is conſiſtent with it, which may be called a <hi>Faſt;</hi> but it is a total abſtinence that properly Claims that Character.</p>
                  <p>NOW this Inſtance of Religious Worſhip, is preſcrib'd by GOD otherwiſe it woud'nt be the worſhip of GOD, but Will-worſhip and ſinful Superſtition; the Duty in general is preſcrib'd imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the Word of GOD, but the Time for its Obſervation by the Mediation of Men; yet ſo nevertheleſs, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Day for a Faſt, does not depend upon the meer will of Men, but upon the Judgments of God, and Circumſtances of

Men; by which the Almighty calls to the Duty of <hi>faſting,</hi> and points to a ſuitable Seaſon for the Performance of it.</p>
                  <p>RELIGIOUS <hi>faſting,</hi> by Reaſon of the divine Judgments, that urge its Obſervation, may ſaid to be fourfold. <hi>viz</hi> either <hi>Perſonal,</hi> when the Judgments of God affect a particular Perſon only, and call him to a ſecret Obſervation of this Duty by himſelf alone.</p>
                  <p>OR <hi>Domeſtick,</hi> when extraordinary Calamities do affect and diſtreſs a particular Family, who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OR <hi>Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> when divine Judgments are inflicted, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be inflicted, upon a certain particular Church or Society, and they are hereby induc'd to obſerve religious abſtinence.</p>
                  <p>OR <hi>Provincial</hi> and <hi>National;</hi> when abſtinence is obſerv'd by the Generality of their Inhabitants, in purſuance of the Order of thoſe that preſide over them, becauſe of the Judgments of God upon them</p>
                  <p>THIS Duty of <hi>religious faſting,</hi> under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, ſeems to be <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> only</p>
                  <p>NOW the <hi>Occaſions</hi> hereof are theſe following, viz. <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sins</hi> committed by ourſelves or others. In the Time of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> there were <hi>publick faſts</hi> for the ſinful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with Infidel and Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>FARTHER, another Occaſion hereof, is either <hi>Judgments</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or threatned to be inflicted. When the <hi>Famine</hi> rag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Time of the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> God commanded them by him, <hi>to ſanctify a faſt, to call a ſolemn Aſſembly, to gather the Elders and all the Inhabitants of the Land into the Houſe of the Lord their God, and to cry unto the Lord: The Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, were</hi> on that Occaſion <hi>to weep between the Porch and the Altar, and ſay ſpare thy People O Lord, and give not thy Heritage to Reproach; then,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>will God be jealous for his Land, and pitty his People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND when the pious <hi>Prince Jehoſaphat,</hi> heard of the deſign of <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> to invade <hi>Judah, he fear'd, and ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaim'd a Faſt throughout all Judah; and Judah gathered themſelves together to ask help of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>MOREOVER it is proper to <hi>faſt,</hi> either when we engage in any <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>important Undertaking,</hi> or want <hi>Victory</hi> over ſome perilous and violent <hi>Temptation,</hi> that we may obtain Succeſs in the former, and Deliverance from the latter; thus when Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> was to intercede before the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, for her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were in the utmoſt Danger of utter ruin, as well as herſelf in the Attempt to reſcue them from it, ſhe ordered the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Shuſhan</hi> to <hi>faſt,</hi> which ſhe and her Maidens likewiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and indeed before this Order, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> who had heard of the King's bloody Decree, <hi>mourned,</hi> and <hi>faſted,</hi> and <hi>wept</hi> of their own accord; and <hi>many lay in Sackcloth and Aſhes!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND in regard of violent <hi>Temptations,</hi> methinks what our Lord

ſayeth of bodily Poſſeſſion, that <hi>that Kind goeth not out but by Faſting and Prayer,</hi> is eaſily applicable to them.</p>
                  <p>THE Exerciſe of religious <hi>faſting,</hi> both private and publick, is commended to our Eſteem and Obſervance, both in the Writings of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN <hi>Nehemiah heard,</hi> that the <hi>Remnant of the Captivity were in great Affliction and Reproach; and that the Wall of Jeruſalem was broken down, and the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>WHEN the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> underſtood from the Writings of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that the Space of 70 Years would put a Period to the Deſolations of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that the Time was drawing nigh, <hi>he ſet his Face to ſeek the Lord</hi> for that Mercy <hi>with Prayer and Faſting,</hi> (Dan. iii.) and elſewhere we are informed, that <hi>Daniel was mourning three full Weeks, and eat no pleaſant Bread, neither came Fleſh or Wine into his Mouth,</hi> (Dan. x.)</p>
                  <p>IN the twelfth Chapter of the Propheſy of <hi>Zecharias,</hi> we have a Prediction of the State of the Goſpel-Church, repreſenting that then the <hi>Spirit ſhould be poured forth,</hi> and in Conſequence thereof, that there ſhould be not only a great and general <hi>Mourning</hi> for Sin in publick Aſſemblies, but likewiſe particular in private Families; <hi>every Family mourning apart, and their Wives apart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW foraſmuch as our Lord repreſents religious Mourning, and Faſting as Terms of the ſame import, (<hi>Matt.</hi> ix. 15) the aforeſaid Propheſy is therefore an Argument of the divine Original, and conſtant Obligation of the Duty of <hi>Faſting,</hi> both perſonal, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick and publick: Thoſe therefore who profeſs themſelves Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the promiſed Effuſion of the Spirit of Grace and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; would do well to prove the reality of their Claim by a conſciencious Compliance therewith.</p>
                  <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Jehoiakim,</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> a Day of publick Faſting was proclaimed by the Order of GOD, that they might preſent their Supplications before the Lord, and every one return from his evil Way, and that in Conſequence hereof the Execution of divine Vengeance might be prevented, (<hi>Jer.</hi> xxxvi. 6, 7)</p>
                  <p>THE Prophet <hi>Zecharias</hi> makes mention of a publick anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Faſt of divine Approbation, in the ſeventh Capter of his Book the 4th and 5th Verſes, which the Almighty complains they did not ſincerely obſerve; <hi>when ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh Month, did ye at all faſt unto me, even to me?</hi>

                     <hi>NEHEMIAH,</hi> the pious, zealous, and faithful GOVERNOR of the <hi>Jews,</hi> a Gentleman of a brave and publick Spirit, who had very much at Heart the Good of that People, and was diſtreſs'd for their Impiety! ordered a religious Faſt, on account of the prevailing Iniquity of the Times; and was the firſt that ſigned and ſealed the Covenant entered into upon that Occaſion, to ſerve GOD, and avoid <hi>profaning his Sabaoth!</hi> (An Evil which lamentably prevails in this and the neighbouring Provinces, at preſent! See <hi>Neh.</hi> 9th, and 10th Chapters) He induced others to ſo good a Work, by his own amiable Example!</p>
                  <p>WHEN <hi>David</hi> and his Army, heard the News of the Defeat of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Troops of <hi>Amaleck, they rent their Garments, mourned,</hi> and <hi>wept,</hi> and <hi>faſted until the Even,</hi> (2 Sam. i. 12.)</p>
                  <p>NOR is the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> without Inſtances of <hi>Faſting.</hi> The forerunner of CHRIST, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> was a Man of ſingular Abſtinence, he came <hi>neither eating Bread, nor drinking Wine,</hi> (Luke vii 33.) He was ſo abſtemious, ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> that his whole Life was but one continued <hi>Faſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OUR Lord before he entered upon his publick Miniſtry, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelf by <hi>faſting,</hi> (Matt. iv.) and after his Entrance into it, ſometimes omitted to eat his Bread, and often continued long in lonely Retirement, which was doubtleſs attended with <hi>Abſtinence:</hi> And what he practis'd himſelf he recommended to others in the Words of our Text, which I have before conſidered</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ANNA,</hi> the Propheteſs, likewiſe ſerved GOD with Faſting and Prayer, (<hi>Luke</hi> ii. 37.) And the devout <hi>Cornelius</hi> obſerved the ſame Practice, (<hi>Acts</hi> x. 30.)</p>
                  <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 7 chap. and 5. ver. ſignifies, that <hi>married Perſons</hi> ſhould at Times <hi>give themſelves to Faſting and Prayer,</hi> and elſewhere farther obſerves, that he had <hi>approved himſelf the Miniſter of GOD in Labours, Watchings,</hi> and <hi>Faſtings,</hi> (2 Cor. vi. 5.) By the wholeſome Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of religious <hi>faſting, he kept his Body under,</hi> and brought it into Subjection to the Government of the Mind, as he himſelf elſewhere informs us, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 27)</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John faſted often,</hi> (Luke v. 33.) This proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intends their Performance of the Duty in a united ſocial Way, as an Aſſembly, ſeeing they were wont to pray together at ſtated Times, and had Directions from their Maſter to this Purpoſe, (<hi>Luke</hi> xi. 1.) And afterwards the Chriſtian Churches, often met for this End: Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ordained, and to be ſent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Church appointed a Faſt, to obtain the divine Preſence and Bleſſing on this ſolemn Occaſion, (<hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 3.) So likewiſe when they ordained Elders in every Church they prayed with faſting, (<hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 23.)</p>
                  <p>THESE <hi>Elders,</hi> are elſewhere enjoined to <hi>feed the Flock of GOD, exerciſing the Office of a Biſhop over it,</hi> (1 Pet. v. 1.2) for ſo the original Word <hi>Epiſcopuntes,</hi> ſhould be tranſlated: Hence you
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040518_0014_1015E8F5E5BE5E68"/>
may ſee that in the Apoſtle's Times, every little Flock as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word <hi>(Poimnion)</hi> ſignifies, had either one or two <hi>Biſhops</hi> to take the paſtoral Care over it; in thoſe primitive Times, the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>'s <hi>Dioceſe</hi> was but ſmall, for no more but one Society or Flock, and that generally a ſmall one, fell to the Share of one or two of them. But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>THESE Words of our Saviour, (<hi>Mark</hi> ii. 15.) <hi>then ſhall they faſt in thoſe Days,</hi> are not only a <hi>Prediction</hi> of what his Diſciples after his Departure from them ſhould do, but a <hi>Precept</hi> obliging them thereto.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER an Injunction to <hi>faſt,</hi> as well as to <hi>pray,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in theſe Words of CHRIST (Matt. xvii. 21.) <hi>This Kind goeth not out but by Prayer and Faſting,</hi> for this ſhews that in our Saviours Time, it was us'd with his Approbation upon important Occaſions.</p>
                  <p>IT is true we meet with no Example of national Faſts, in the <hi>New-Teſtament;</hi> nor can this be reaſonably expected, becauſe the Chriſtian Religion was not national in the apoſtolick Times.</p>
                  <p>CERTAINLY the Appointment of publick Faſts at proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is rational, for hereby it is made the joint Act of Churches, and States, and Humiliation under the mighty Hand of GOD the better promoted.</p>
                  <p>THIS the <hi>ancient Churches</hi> were ſenſible of, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed particular Days of <hi>faſting</hi> on Occaſion of publick Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, ſuch as <hi>Peſtilence, Perſecution, War,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> aſſure us. Yea, many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were directed by the Light of Nature or <hi>Reaſon</hi> only, to this Duty, witneſs the <hi>Ninevites, (Jona.</hi> iii.) the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> likewiſe, uſed ſome kind of Abſtinence, from ſome ſort of Food in Honour of their Gods, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. <hi>Hierocles</hi> and <hi>Purphery</hi> obſerve of the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, that they us'd Abſtinence to purge the Soul from the Diſorders of Senſuality, and to advance internal Goodneſs; to which valuable Purpoſes, by the meer unaſſiſted Dint of human Reaſon, they juſtly apprehended it had an excellent Tendency! In a Word, <hi>Caeſar</hi> teſtifies, that Abſtinence from ſome Sort of Food generally prevailed in the <hi>Pagan</hi> World.</p>
                  <p>IF it be objected, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf excuſes his Diſciple's O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Duty of Faſting:</p>
                  <p>I anſwer it is true, but in ſuch a Manner, as ſhews his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Obſervance of it, in proper Seaſons: This will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by conſidering the Nature of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Apology, which is to the following Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> That theſe were <hi>early Days</hi> with them, and that therefore faſting was not then ſo ſeaſonable as it would be afterwards, nor were they ſo able to endure the Severity of it; <hi>every Thing is beautiful in its Seaſon,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> truly obſerves, and indeed then only!</p>
                  <p>THOSE that enter into the Marriage Relation, muſt expect both Care and Trouble in the Fleſh; yet during the Nuptial Solemnity,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040518_0015_1015E8F868606D00"/>
they are cheerful, and it is but decent they ſhould be ſo. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples, were but newly married, the Bridegroom was yet with them, and the Nuptials yet celebrating, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mathew's:</hi> But when the Bridegroom ſhould be remov'd from them, to a far Country, then our Lord ſignifies, that it would be a proper time for them to ſit as a Widow in ſolitude and faſting; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to this, that under the Jewiſh Oeconomy, Perſons newly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd were, for a time, to be freed from the fatigues of War.</p>
                  <p>FARTHER, The Diſciples being but beginners in Religion, and not yet accuſtom'd to the ſeverer Exerciſes of it, as the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> were, <hi>who came neither eating nor drinking,</hi> as their Maſter did. Now in ſuch a Situation, to put them frequently upon faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might, perhaps, diſcourage them in Religion, or prejudice them againſt it, and ſo drive them to Apoſtacy from the Profeſſion of it: It was like to be of as ill conſequence as <hi>puting new Cloth upon an old thin Garment,</hi> and <hi>new Wine into old Casks:</hi> But to lead them to thoſe Severities by Degrees, was the moſt rational and ſafe Method, (See <hi>Mark</hi> ii. <hi>from the</hi> 18 <hi>to the</hi> 23 <hi>verſe</hi>) The bleſſed Jeſus conſults the Frame and Strength of his Followers, and Proportions their Difficulties thereto; <hi>he carries the Lambs in his Arms, and leads thoſe gently that are with Young;</hi> nor will he, who is Love and Goodneſs itſelf, <hi>break the bruiſed r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, or quench the ſmoaking Flax!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT may be again objected, that the <hi>faſting</hi> recommended by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our Text, is only ſpiritual faſting from Sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That ſuch a Notion is contrary to the <hi>etymology</hi> of the original Word, <hi>(neſteuete)</hi> which, as <hi>Paſor</hi> obſerves, is derived from <hi>ne,</hi> which in compounds is negative or privative, and <hi>ethio</hi> to eat; ſo that to <hi>faſt</hi> is not to eat, or to be without meat.</p>
                  <p>IT is likewiſe contrary to the univerſal <hi>Acceptation</hi> of the Word <hi>faſting</hi> in Scripture, as well as to its current meaning in other Writings; and the received ideoms of Speech.</p>
                  <p>AND it is likewiſe attended with many <hi>abſurdities,</hi> a few of which I ſhall mention; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is foreign to the Subject of CHRIST'S Diſcourſe in our Text, which was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> Faſting in a literal Senſe. It ſuppoſes an analogy between Sin and Bread, and conſequently repreſents it as neceſſary in ordinary Caſes; as good in itſelf; as nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Soul as Bread is to the Body; and likewiſe that it is only to be abſtained from at ſome extraordinary Seaſons; and that when we do abſtain from it, we ſhould not appear to Men to do ſo; that is, in other Words, we muſt carefully avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> before Men; whereas the Redeemer in the mean Time aſſures us, that <hi>if we are aſhamed of him and his Words, he alſo will be aſhamed of us, when he comes in the Glory of his Father with the holy Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AT this rate of allegorizing without neceſſity or preſident, and contrary to the Context, the reality of the Creation of the World and of Mankind may be deny'd, and on the contrary their

eternity contended for, ſeeing Converſion is called a Creation; and indeed the Caſe is ſo with the <hi>Bemiſts,</hi> they poſitively deny the Creation.</p>
                  <p>AND the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> Body from the Dead, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all his <hi>miraculous Works,</hi> may be in like manner deny'd, for Converſion is called a Reſurrection in Scripture. Now upon theſe Facts the Credibility of the Goſpel hangs; but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>AFTER the ſame Manner may alſo the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized, and then it will follow, that it is a damnable Sin to feed upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> by Faith, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE <hi>preparatory Offices,</hi> or Duties, are theſe two eſpecially, viz. <hi>Conſideration</hi> and <hi>laying aſide our worldly Buſineſs.</hi> We ſhould ſeaſonably and ſolemnly conſider the Nature and Qualities of the Occaſions of the Faſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Judgments of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the number and heniouſneſs of our Sins the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cauſes of them. Theſe Things we ſhould ponder upon
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040518_0017_1015E8FEE01C5A28"/>
and realize till our Hearts are deeply affected with a fear of God, with ſorrow for our Offences againſt him; with a deſire after his favour, and a Reſolution to ſeek and ſerve him; and hence it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſaphat, that he fear'd and ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaim'd a faſt throughout all</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, (2 Chron. xx. iii)</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER <hi>Preparative,</hi> is to lay aſide timeouſly our <hi>worldly Buſineſs,</hi> and order our temporal Concerns in ſuch a Manner, that they may be no hindrance to us in the Duties of the Faſt. (<hi>Levit.</hi> xxiii. 7, 8.) And no doubt theſe Preparatives ſhould be attended with devout Addreſſes to God for divine Influence, without which nothing can be done to purpoſe in Religion,</p>
                  <p>BUT the <hi>peculiar Duties</hi> that reſpect the Celebration of the Faſt, are either Negative or Poſitive. The <hi>Negative</hi> are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ABSTINENCE from all Food and Drink, as much as our Health can bear. (<hi>Eſt.</hi> iv. 16)</p>
                  <p>ABSTINENCE from all <hi>bodily Recreations,</hi> (Joel ii. 16.) <hi>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his Chamber, and the Bride out of her Cloſet.</hi> (Iſa. lviii 3.) <hi>Behold in the Day of your faſt ye find Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ABSTINENCE from all <hi>Ornaments of Dreſs,</hi> unſuitable to a Day of Humiliation. (Iſa. xxii. 12.) <hi>In that Day did the Lord call to weeping and mourning, to baldneſs and girding with Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poſitive Duties</hi> are theſe, namely, <hi>Humiliation, Prayer,</hi> and <hi>renewing our Covenant with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. WE ſhould humble ourſelves before Jehovah, in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin, a Condemnation of ourſelves for Sin, a Purpoſe and Promiſe to forſake it, and practice Virtue. And hence a Day of <hi>faſting</hi> is called by God himſelf, <hi>a Day for a Man to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict his Soul,</hi> (I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a. lviii. 5.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another poſitive Duty in the Time of the Faſt, is <hi>calling upon God's Name.</hi> Eza. viii. 21. <hi>Then proclaimed I a faſt at the River Ahava, that we might afflict ourſelves before our God, to ſeek of him a right way for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>RENEWING our Covenant with God,</hi> is alſo neceſſary, (2 Kings xxiii. 2, 3) <hi>And the King ſtood by a Pillar and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, with all their Heart and all their Soul. And all the People ſtood to the Covenant.</hi> It is neceſſary on a Day of faſting, to renew our Conſent to the Terms of the Covenant of Grace, to renew our Reſolution to perform the Duties thereby required; and to renew our reliance upon the Promiſes therein contained, for Guidance and Aſſiſtance to perform the aforeſaid Duties.</p>
                  <p>BUT to proceed, The principal Duty conſequent upon <hi>faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> is <hi>Reformation of Life,</hi> which ſhould be immediately begun in Church, State, Families, and particular Perſons. 2 Chron. vii. 14. <hi>If my People which are called by my Name ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves and pray, and ſeek my Face, and turn from their
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040518_0018_1015E9006438DF78"/>
wicked ways, then will I hear from Heaven and will forgive their Sin and heal their Land. The Faſt that God hath choſen,</hi> as was before obſerved, <hi>is to looſe the Bands of Wickedneſs, and undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppreſs'd go free, and deal our Bread to the Hungry, and to break every Yoke.</hi> When faſting is duly obſerved, it will incline us, in our after life, to avoid all the Methods of Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, and Cruelty; and on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to be merciful and charitable in the Sentiments of our Minds, the Speeches of our Lips, and the Actions of our Lives.</p>
                  <p>BUT more particularly in our <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>faſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. WE ſhould beware of <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> that we do not with the Phariſees in our Text, put on a guiſe of extraordinary Devotion, meerly out of Pride, to get a Name among Men; or with <hi>Jeſabel</hi> cover a covetous and cruel Intention therewith Of the ſame ſtamp were thoſe impious Jews, the Royal Prophet ſpeaks of, who <hi>faſted for ſtrife and debate, to ſmite with the fiſt of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> They oppreſs'd the Poor by their Cruelties, ground their Faces, and laid intollerable Yokes upon their Necks, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their pious Pretences.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. WE ſhould beware of <hi>Superſtition</hi> in our Faſts, by an over frequent Uſe of them, eſpecially of ſuch as are of a publick Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Faſting is an extraordinary Duty, and therefore not to be practiſed on ordinary Occaſions; otherwiſe it is apt to degenerate into Superſtition; to make Religion burdenſom, and diſcourage the Weak.</p>
                  <p>IT is unreaſonable in any to make the Yoke of Chriſt heavier than he has made it. Our compaſſionate Lord, who is Wiſdom and Love itſelf, did not think it proper to impoſe upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, either the Rigors of the legal Miniſtration, or the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom Traditions of the Phariſees, or even the Auſterity of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt;</hi> and hence it is ſaid, that <hi>his Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. WE ſhould beware of <hi>formality,</hi> in reſting ſatisfy'd with the outward Performance of the Duties of the Day, without an inward Senſe of them, and without a Reformation of Life, this formal Faſting is of no avail.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. FASTING has a natural Tendency to curb our ſenſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, by withdrawing the Fuel that inflames them As ſome Savage Beaſts are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>am'd by Hunger, ſo are thoſe brought hereby under the controul of Reaſon and Religion. Abſtinence was the firſt precept given to Man in Innocency, the Violation of which, has been the Source of innumerable Evils and Calamities to the whole human Race.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. FASTING is of <hi>advantage</hi> to aſſiſt the Performance of all Religious Duties. A few of which I ſhall mention, viz. <hi>Prayer, hearing the Word of God, Charity</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT was from the Perſwaſion of <hi>faſting</hi>'s being a help to prayer, that <hi>Jehoſaphat, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemia,</hi> anexed it thereto, in Junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of great Diſtreſs, when they wanted to exert the utmoſt vehemence and fervours! Reaſon teaches us, that as fullneſs of Bread is apt to make us drowſie, ſo on the Contrary, Abſtinence tends to make us more lively in religious Exerciſes!</p>
                  <p>NOR has religious <hi>Abſtinence</hi> leſs aptneſs to prepare the Mind to hear the divine Word with Attention and Reverence. <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the Prophet, was aware of this, and therefore ordered <hi>Baruch,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nereiah,</hi> to read the Roll of threatnings in the Ears of all <hi>Judah,</hi> in the Day of publick faſting; expecting that at that Time it would make the deeper Impreſſion on them, (<hi>Jer.</hi> xxxvi. 6.) inaſmuch as their Minds were freed from the fumes of the Body, and ſeparated from the Entertainments of Senſe, they muſt of Conſequence be more ſerious and compoſed, and therefore better prepar'd to give due Attention to the divine Oracles.</p>
                  <p>AND does not <hi>Abſtinence</hi> likewiſe tend to promote our <hi>Charity,</hi> for being hereby made ſenſible of want and hunger ourſelves, we are by our own Experience naturally led to compaſſionate thoſe who are by neceſſity forc'd to graple with ſuch hardſhips, and of Conſequence to relieve them. This not only Reaſon Demonſtrates, but evident Facts confirm, in the Caſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who was as famous for his <hi>liberality</hi> as his <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> (Acts x.) His abſtinence ſtir'd the Bowels of his Humanity to ſuccour the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent.</p>
                  <p>FARTHER, my Brethren, <hi>abſtinence</hi> promotes Humiliation and Contrition for Sin, by making us taſte the bitter Fruits of it; by denying ourſelves of thoſe Supports and Comforts, we abaſe ourſelves in ſignifying our unworthineſs of them, and Submiſſion to God's Government over us; as well as execute ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble revenge upon ourſelves, for our Rebellion againſt his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:040518_0020_1015E90523884488"/>
by the abuſe of his Creatures: Our feeling the painful Fruits that Sin has produc'd among Mankind, muſt needs tend to excite equal Indignation againſt it, and Sorrow for it, as well as a juſt Fear of the divine Judgments: Hence it is that Times of faſting were Seaſons of uncommon Sorrow in every Age of the Church, as appears from the Inſtances before produc'd, to which, for the Sake of Brevity, I muſt not add.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. FASTING is not only an efficacious and profitable, but very neceſſary Mean, to prevent the execution of extraordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned; as evidently appears from the memorable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Faſt of the Jews in the Time of Queen <hi>

                  <p n="4">4. RELIGIOUS Faſting is of equal advantage and efficacy to remove Judgments or Calamites that are actually inflicted; of this I would mention the two following Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>IN the civil Wars between the <hi>Benjamites</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the latter having been very unſucceſsful in their undertaking againſt the former, thereupon kept a publick and ſolemn Faſt, which was crown'd with Succeſs and Victory! (<hi>Judg.</hi> xx)</p>
                  <p>WHILE <hi>Samuel</hi> was Judge in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with deſign to teſtify their Repentance for their Iniquities and promote Reformation from them, he order'd the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be conveen'd at <hi>Miſpeh</hi> to a publick <hi>Faſt;</hi> which they kept with great Affection, and ſoon ſaw the happy Fruits thereof, in a very ſurprizing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over their <hi>Philiſtine</hi> Enemies, who ignobly attack'd them with hoſtile violence, in the very time of their religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii.)</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>FASTING</hi> obſerved with a proper frame of Mind, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to obtain the moſt important Benefits, temporal, ſpiritual, and eternal; that either particular Perſons or Societies need. An Inſtance of this we have in <hi>Ezra,</hi> who proclaimed a <hi>faſt</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain the Guidance and Smiles of Heaven, in and upon the difficult but important Enterprize of <hi>rebuilding Jeruſalem,</hi> and hereby obtained his generous and noble Deſign!</p>
                  <p>THIS View in <hi>faſting</hi> was not peculiar to the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> but is common to both. In entring upon all Matters of great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and Moment, both CHRIST and his Apoſtles <hi>faſted</hi> as was before obſerv'd. Our Lord's <hi>faſting</hi> in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to his engaging in the publick Miniſtry, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles followed his Example herein, by religious Abſtinence, before they undertook that ſacred Work; and in all ſucceeding Ages, the Practice of the Church has been agreeable to thoſe noble Preſidents, and in this Way they have reap'd valuable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages!</p>
                  <p>WHEN a Time of general Calamity and Deſolation is ſent, by a righteous GOD to puniſh the Iniquities of a ſinful People, then a <hi>Mark</hi> is ſet upon the Foreheads of the Men, that ſigh and cry for all the Abominations, which are done in the Places where they

have their reſpective Reſidence! (<hi>Ezek.</hi> ix.)

Almighty GOD ſeals theſe his Servants, and marks <hi>Zyons</hi> Mourners, he books their ſecret Sighs, and bottles up all their Tears!</p>
                  <p>BUT the Benefits of <hi>faſting</hi> ſincerly, and ſuitably performed, are not confin'd to this State of Tryal and Probation, but extend beyond the Grave. That gracious GOD who beholds ſuch with Complacence he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As Inſtances of paſſive Obedience, are more difficult than active, and therefore more noble, <hi>(nam quo ſublimiora eo dificiliora)</hi> ſo of Conſequence they will meet with a greater Recompenſe: Now among thoſe, may be reckoned the denying of Ourſelves at Times, of the Comforts of Life for CHRIST'S Sake; all ſuch may therefore rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is their Reward in Heaven: Such as ſuffer for CHRIST and the Goſpel's ſake, in any kind or degree ſhall in this Life receive an Hundred-fold, and in the World to come Life everlaſting: The Spirit of Glory and of GOD reſts upon them in the Way, and their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Bliſs at the End of their religious Courſe, ſhall be of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed Beauty and Luſtre, commenſurate to their Sorrows, their Sufferings, and their Labours here! <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>What has been ſaid, reſpecting the natural Tendency, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of religious Faſting, as well as the <hi>Pagan</hi>'s Diſcovery hereof, by the meer Force of human Reaſon, plainly ſhew that it is no arbitrary and alterable Inſtitution, but grounded upon the Nature and Reaſon of Things, which being ever the ſame, it is therefore moral, and of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obligation.</p>
                        <p>To be freed from any Duty of this kind, by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> would make it an unreaſonable and diſadvantageous Diſpenſation, inferior at leaſt in that Point to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> OEconomy, to which it is frequently and juſtly preferred by the inſpired Apoſtle, and declared to be a reaſonable Service; to be bereaved of a valuable Advantage, is no Priviledge, but a great Loſs!</p>
                        <p>Moreover ſeeing it is in this Life only, that temporal Judgements can be inflicted on a Society as ſuch, and temporal Mercies vouchſafed according to their general Behaviour, agreeable to the Rules of God's moral Government; it is therefore reaſonable and neceſſary, that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſuch ſhould unite in publick and ſocial Acts of Humiliation, to avert the one, and obtain the other.</p>

                  <p>WHAT has been ſaid, my Brethren and Fathers, ſerves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us how impious and unreaſonable it is in any, either to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or neglect, the ſeaſonable Obſervance of an Inſtitution, ſo firmly bottom'd on the higheſt Authority, and ſo directly conducive to ſecure and advance our moſt important Intereſts!</p>
                  <p>IT is trifling to object, that <hi>faſting</hi> is obſerved by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and therefore ſhould be neglected.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, muſt we diſbelieve and neglect all that they believe and practice, then we muſt deny the Being of a GOD, and that CHRIST is the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe they believe both; and we muſt quit Prayer entirely, becauſe they obſerve it, in ſome Sort; the bare mentioning of which Abſurdities ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them!</p>

                  <p>IT is exceedingly to be lamented, my Brethren, That the Duty of <hi>religious faſting,</hi> is ſo much neglected as it is, by many that profeſs Chriſtianity; have they forgot that <hi>Self-denial</hi> is one of the firſt Leſſons of the Religion of JESUS, and that we are enjoined by divine Authority, <hi>to crucify the Fleſh with its Affections and Luſts?</hi>

                  <p>FASTING, Sirs, has been practiced by the Profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, from time immemorial.</p>
                  <p>FASTING has been obſerved by divers Infidels of different Nations, by the Direction of natural Reaſon only.</p>
                  <p>FASTING is intirely rational; for ſeeing God has made the Body, it is but proper he ſhould be ſerved by it.</p>
                  <p>FASTING is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Duty, both in reſpect of <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Mean,</hi> appointed by the higheſt Authority, as a Medium to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the moſt precious, valuable and durable Benefits.</p>
                  <p>FASTING is an honourable Duty, in reſpect of its Author, Nature and Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> of it, is the bleſſed God, who is the Fountain of all Honour, which merits that Character.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Nature</hi> of it contains an Inſtance of the Creatures Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Subjection to the Sovereign Authority of its Creator and Lord, and that both in his Precepts and Providences, which being agreeable to the Rules of Juſtice, and Maxims of Reaſon, muſt needs be Honourable,</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>iſſue</hi> of it rightly obſerved, will be the open Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the infinitely wiſe God, and a State of perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the unſtain'd purity of the divine Nature, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Communion in the divine Love, and the raviſhing

Contemplation of the divine Excellency; all which imply the higheſt Honours a God can give, and a created Nature receive: Eſſential and inflexible Truth has told us, <hi>that thoſe that Honour him, he will Honour.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
                  <p>FASTING is a <hi>pleaſant</hi> Duty. I confeſs it is contrary to the vicious Propenſities of our degenerate Natures, which verge to Eaſe, to Indolence and ſenſual Gratifications inordinately; and conſequently make Men reluctant to reſtraint, tho' never ſo neceſſary, reſonable, decent, and honourable; and this doubtleſs is the ſecret ſource of the Strong Prejudices of many againſt the Duty I have been diſcourſing upon.</p>
                  <p>IT is indeed extreamly difficult for the Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to urge any Thing ſucceſsfully, that touches Men in ſo tender a Point; their Affections are apt greatly to byaſs their Judgment, in favour of what they love, tho' never ſo criminal; and even to that degree, that they will hardly give a fair hearing to what is offered againſt it. But ſeeing the Nature of Things, my Brethren, cannot be chang'd by your Fancies and Prejudices, and you muſt be judg'd at laſt according to them, it is your wiſeſt Courſe to be impartial; and therefore we do in the Name of our Maſter, the KING of KINGS and LORD of LORDS, deſire and demand a fair hearing, and calm Conſideration of what we ſay.</p>
                  <p>BUT notwithſtanding the Duty of <hi>faſting</hi> be croſs to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations, as has been obſerved, yet it is agreeable to the Mind, inaſmuch as it helps to reduce it to its juſt Empire over the ſenſual Appetites, and free it from their tyrannical Mutinies and Encroachments: And thus it tends to introduce a ſolemn Calm into the Soul, and bring it near to the bleſſed God, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Beauty and ſupream Good, the ſource of Sweetneſs, and center of Reſt, whoſe <hi>loving Kindneſs is better than life,</hi> and can only yield ſolid Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>IN a Word, <hi>Sirs,</hi> this opens a Fountain of ſpiritual, ſublime and ſuperior Sweets, which infinitely tranſcend all brutal Pleaſures; as well as exactly ſuit the ſpiritual and noble Nature, and realy equal the vaſt Deſires, the rais'd Hopes, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Duration of a human Soul! And may be reflected on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uneaſineſs: Surely <hi>Wiſdoms Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all its Paths are Peace.</hi> Again,</p>
                  <p>FASTING is a <hi>profitable</hi> Duty, as well as pleaſant: It is profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, my Brethren, to human Society in general, by preventing and removing publick Calamities, and in obtaining publick, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and permanent Benefits.</p>
                  <p>IT is profitable to ourſelves in particular, many Ways.</p>
                  <p>FASTING is profitable to our Bodies, in correcting their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſorders: By it the crudeties occaſion'd thro' exceſſes, are gradually digeſted and remov'd, and the Stomack, the Fountain of our nouriſhment, brought to its proper tone, and fitted for its proper Functions.</p>
                  <p>FASTING is profitable to our Souls, in curing their moral

Maladies and Diſorders: By it, our ſordid, ſenſual, brutal Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are weakned, thro the Subſtraction of their Incentives.</p>
                  <p>FASTING aſſiſts in all the religious Offices we owe to God and Man, as has been already obſerved, and thus we are Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to the Author of our Exiſtence, which is at once our higheſt Dignity and greateſt Felicity.</p>
                  <p>FASTING, Sirs, is not only pofitable in Time, but its ſalutary Effects reach to Eternity.

                  <p>WHATEVER unjuſt Invectives may be caſt upon them by Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and Epicures, <hi>who make their Belly their God, and Glory in their ſhame,</hi> they will meet with divine Approbation; that God who ſees the Sincerity of their Intentions, will finally vindicate their Conduct, and put Honour on their Perſons, before the vaſt Aſſembly of the Univerſe!</p>
                  <p>WHILE impenitent Senſualiſts and profane Scoffers, <hi>who walk after their own Luſts,</hi> are cover'd with ſhame and Comtempt, and rack'd with the accuteſt Anguiſh, the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> will accoſt his People in this gracious Language, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, and inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Lord Redeemer will give them a <hi>Reward</hi> of Mercy, more than proportion'd to their Self-denyal, Diligence and Fidelity.</p>
                  <p>A REWARD which no human Underſtanding can graſp with its ſublimeſt flights of Thought and grandeſt Sentiments; or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Tongue expreſs with all the Charms of Diction, with all the figures, fires and force of Language!</p>
                  <p>A REWARD which the boldeſt and moſt ſtriking Images in univerſal Nature are not equal to, but faint before and ſink in darkneſs and obſcurity!</p>
                  <p>A REWARD, large as our Deſires, and laſting as our Souls!</p>
                  <p>A REWARD of ſuch immenſe weight and value, that all the light and momentary Sufferings of this preſent Life, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be once compared with it.</p>
                  <p>A REWARD that contains a perfect and perpetual freedom from every Evil, both moral and penal; and the uninterrupted and eternal Poſſeſſion of all Good!</p>

                  <p>THE Prophet, after the miraculous Cure of his criminal Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, executed his Commiſſion with Zeal and Earneſtneſs, <hi>When he entered the City a Day's Journey, he cried and ſaid, yet forty Days and</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhall be overthrown:</hi> His bold and faithful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of his Meſſage, was attended with happy Influence and Succeſs, both upon the Prince and People; for in Conſequence hereof <hi>they believed GOD,</hi> and <hi>proclaimed a faſt,</hi> and <hi>put on Sackcloth from the greateſt of them even to the leaſt.</hi> Tho' <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was a <hi>Stranger</hi> to them, yet his juſt Deſcription of their Sins, his authoritative Declaration of their Danger and Doom, in Caſe they perſiſted in them; together with the Conſideration of a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Eſcape in the Uſe of proper Means, being attended with divine Influence, induced them to <hi>believe the GOD of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only to give Credit to the Threatning which <hi>Jonah</hi> denounced in his Name, but to believe him to be the Supream Lord of the Univerſe, whoſe Laws they had tranſgreſſed by their Impieties, and to whoſe Juſtice they were of Conſequence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious; they clearly ſaw their Deſert of Puniſhment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dreaded the Menace, which the Prophet publiſhed in the Name of his Maſter.</p>

                  <p>TO revere the Author of our Exiſtence, and go before others in good Examples tho of the humbleſt kind, at all Adventures, is not only a Proof of the ſobereſt Exerciſe of human Reaſon, but an Argument of a great and brave Mind!</p>
                  <p>THE greateſt of Men are not ſo much an Ornament to Religion by their pious Practice, as it is to them: In the mean Time, it is certainly an important Benefit to any People, when ſuch who are in high Places of civil Truſt among them, are Men fearing GOD and hating Covetuouſneſs; for their Example is apt to have great Influence on others in lower Life, as we ſee by the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> who imitated the laudable Pattern of their Prince. It is a juſt and general Maxim, that <hi>Example</hi> has more Efficacy than <hi>Precept,</hi> and that by the <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> in particular, their <hi>Subjects</hi> are form'd.<note n="*" place="bottom">Precepta docent, exempla cogunt, ad exemplum regis, totus, &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT on the contrary when Perſons who are cloth'd with civil Authority, and bear ſome figure in high Life, are not only deſtitute of Religion themſelves, but deride it in others with equal Vanity and Virulence, thereby induſtriouſly labouring to ſubvert all the valuable Intereſts of Society (of which Religion is the grand Support) which it is therefore the Duty of their Offices to encourage. I ſay when they are neither willing to <hi>enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themſelves, nor to ſuffer thoſe that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring to enter,</hi> it is no wonder if the pious and prudent lament! Seeing their impious Conduct, is as <hi>a troubled Fountain, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Spring,</hi> of whoſe Waters the Inhabitants of a City drink! <hi>When the Righteous,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>are in Authority, the People rejoice! But when the Wicked bear Rule, the People mourn!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT to proceed. The King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> took particular Care, to have a <hi>faſt</hi> ſpeedily appointed and notify'd to the People by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:040518_0028_1015E917BA74E3B8"/>
thoſe publick Officers who were wont to proclaim the Edicts of the King and Council. It is ſaid that he cauſed it to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and publiſhed: This ingemination or redoubling of the Words, not only confirms the Certainty of the Fact, but likewiſe ſignifies the deep Senſe which the <hi>King</hi> had, both of his own and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Sins, Danger, and Duty in this Exigence: The Concurrence of the Legiſlature in the Appointment of the <hi>faſt,</hi> and of the Body of the People in the Celebration of it, made it a national Act, and it was proper it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing a national Deſtruction was to be prevented by it.</p>
                  <p>NOW the Contents of the <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> for a publick <hi>Faſt,</hi> which are to be the <hi>Subject</hi> of our preſent <hi>Meditations,</hi> we have in the Words of our <hi>Text,</hi> together with the preeceeding and following Verſes. Theſe Contents ſhew us what was required by the Proclamation, and to what Deſign: They are indeed a valuable compend and ſummary of the principal Duties to be performed on ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, in all ſucceeding Times. The Duties mentioned are theſe four, viz. <hi>Abſtinence, Humiliation</hi> or <hi>Mourning, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Reformation.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Proclamation</hi> required a total <hi>abſtinence</hi> from Food and Drink, both by Man and Beaſt; <hi>let neither Man or Beaſt taſte any Thing, or drink Water.</hi> To pretend to <hi>faſt</hi> without abſtaining from Food and Drink, and all the Comforts of Life, as far as can conſiſt with the ſafety of our Bodies, and their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for religious Service, is meer mockery.</p>
                  <p>AND to add to the Solemnity of the <hi>Faſt,</hi> at that extraordinary Juncture, the Beaſts were to be reſtrained from Food and Drink, that a view of their Miſeries might affect the People the more, and that the Cry of Man, ſeconded by the cry of hungry Cattle, might enter the Ears of God, who preſerveth Man and Beaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Proclamation</hi> required, that Man and Beaſt ſhould be <hi>covered with Sackcloth;</hi> The Men were to put on a coarſe, a humble and uneaſy Dreſs, to ſignify the Humiliation of their Souls for Sin, and their Sorrow on the account of it, as well as fear of the divine Vengeance impending over them.</p>
                  <p>AND even the Beaſts muſt do Penance, as it were, as well as Man, becauſe they had been made ſubject to vanity as Inſtruments of his Sin; that either by their complaints, or ſilent pining for want of Food, they might ſtrike the Springs of their Owners Sorrows!</p>
                  <p>AND thoſe Beaſts, particularly the Horſes and Camels, on which they rode, and were wont to cover with rich Trapings, muſt be ſtripp'd of thoſe <hi>Ornaments</hi> and clad in <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the antient and modern Cuſtom of covering Horſes with black Cloth, at the Funerals of Noblemen; that they might ſeem to mourn on ſuch Occaſions, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves. The <hi>Perſians,</hi> in a Time of mourning, were alſo accuſtom'd to poll or clip their Horſes, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> informs us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:040518_0029_1015E919408BA218"/>SO that to be cover'd with <hi>Sackcloth</hi> ſeems to be a proverbial Expreſſion, ſignifying deep <hi>Mourning</hi> and <hi>Grief.</hi> Thus the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are ſaid, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, to be cover'd with Sackcloth:</hi> The chief Thing therefore here demanded of the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> was that they would humble themſelves before God, becauſe of their Offences againſt him, and that they would with bitterneſs bewail them.</p>
                  <p>NO doubt at a Time of publick <hi>faſting</hi> the <hi>Garb</hi> ſhould be ſuited to the Buſineſs of the Day; but that which is eſpecially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, is a <hi>humble,</hi> a <hi>mourning Mind;</hi> a ſincere mourning from the Heart, an Evangelical mourning from love to that God whom by Sin we have provok'd: A mourning great in Degree, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what proportion'd to the Number and heniouſneſs of our Sins: Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> teſtifies of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>they gathered together in Miſpeh, and drew Water and pourd it out before the Lord, and faſted on that Day.</hi> Theſe Words are deſigned to repreſent in a figurative manner, the plentiful mourning of the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Effuſion of their Tears on that Occaſion, reſembled the pouring forth of Waters: The <hi>Calde</hi> reads it, <hi>they pour'd out their Hearts in Repentance before the Lord;</hi> they wept Rivers of Tears, and ſorrowed after a godly ſort, as in the Preſence of God, from regard to his Majeſty, and with an Eye to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>O HOW amiable was this Convention! <hi>O that our Heads were Waters and our Eyes a Fountain of Tears,</hi> that we could with ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Contrition this Day bewail our own and others Treſpaſſes!</p>
                  <p>WHEN the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> enquired of JESUS concerning <hi>faſting;</hi> in his Anſwer he us'd the term of <hi>mourning</hi> in the room of it, to ſhew, that the one cannot be acceptably obſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other; <hi>why,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>do we and the Phariſees faſt oft, but thy Diſciples faſt not; and</hi> Jeſus <hi>ſaid unto them, can the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Bride-Chamber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them; but the Days will come, when the Bridegroom will be taken from them, and then ſhall they faſt.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">In like manner, by a metonimy of the adjunct, <hi>faſting</hi> is called <hi>weeping,</hi> becauſe the latter is a part of the former, <hi>Zec.</hi> vii. 3. <hi>ſhould I weep in the fifth month, ſeparating myſelf,</hi> i. e. from labour, food and the comforts of life?

ANOTHER Duty required by the <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the King and Nobles of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> to be perform'd on the Day of publick <hi>faſting,</hi> was to <hi>cry mightily unto God:</hi> Theſe terms do undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſignify great Vehemence, fervour and importunity in their Supplications for needed Mercy, and Deprecation of threatned Judgment.

                  <p>WITH <hi>Jacob,</hi> who as a Prince had Power with God and with Men, we ſhould determine not to let <hi>Jehovah</hi> go, <hi>unleſs he bleſs us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE relenting of the <hi>unjuſt Judge,</hi> ſtands upon ſacred Record, as an unanſwerable Argument of the irriſtable force of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Prayer; for if he who neither fear'd Gnd nor regarded Man, who was loſt to all Senſe of Religion and Humanity, was notwithſtanding overcome, meerly by the importunity of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous Supplicant, to grant her requeſt. How much more will that God who is Goodneſs and Benignity itſelf, grant Bleſſings to the Indigent, who <hi>pray always and do not faint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A CRYING Prayer pierces the Heavens. We read not a Word that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke, and yet God was mov'd by his <hi>cry,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in vehement Deſires, and inutterable Groanings; yet no doubt a Complication of ſore Diſtreſſes may even extort vocal Crys. <hi>I cry'd to the Lord with my Voice,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and he heard me out of his holy Hill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is ſaid of <hi>Hezekia, that the Lord heard his Prayer, for he had ſeen his Tears.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHEN Back-ſliding <hi>Ephraim</hi> began to <hi>bemoan</hi> himſelf, then were the Bowels of God troubled for him; then did Jehovah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>that he would ſurely have Mercy upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS importunate Supplication is an excellent Mean to obtain the Mercies we need, ſo it is an encouraging Token that they are near at Hand.</p>
                  <p>WHEN <hi>Elijah</hi> pray'd ſeven Times ſucceſſively for <hi>Rain,</hi> the watry Magazines haſtned from the Sea to refreſh the parched Earth.</p>
                  <p>IT is amazing that importunate Devotion ſhould as it were, conquer and controul Omnipotence! <hi>Ask of me Things to come, and concerning the Works of my Hands Command ye me.</hi> O ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous Condeſcention! When we exert the utmoſt Strength of our Souls in humble Devotions, and perſiſt in our Pleadings for needed Mercies, both of a publick and private Nature, drawn from the Glory of God's Name, the Perfections of his Nature, his Promiſes and Providences; theſe Petitions are like the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual blowing of the <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> over the Sacrifices, <hi>for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial before the Lord;</hi> or like the <hi>Watchmen</hi> upon the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem, who never hold their Peace Day nor Night, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not to keep Silence, or give him Reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AN admirable Inſtance of this Kind, we have in the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who in the midſt of Diſcouragements from the Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea and from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, nobly perſiſted! The Diſciples wanted her diſmiſs'd, becauſe ſhe troubled them by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them; and the bleſſed JESUS at firſt anſwered her not a Word, and afterwards ſpoke roughly to her, tho' with a Kind Intention, but ſtill ſhe follow'd with increaſing Importunity,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:040518_0031_1015E91E2EE8D1D0"/>
argu'd the Mercy into her Boſom, and obtain'd a high <hi>Encomium</hi> upon her Faith! <hi>Philoſophei he gune,</hi> ſays <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> the Woman Philoſophizes, ſhe diſputed the Mercy from the Redeemers Hand. May almighty God teach us all this bleſſed Philoſophy for JESUS Sake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IMPORTUNITY,</hi> my dear Brethren, does not conſiſt in a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Words, <hi>When ye pray,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>uſe not vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions, as the Heathen do; for they think to be heard for their much ſpeaking:</hi> but it conſiſts in an <hi>earneſtneſs of Spirit,</hi> to be heard, in a <hi>prudent Choice</hi> of proper <hi>Arguments,</hi> and in a <hi>reſolut perſiſting</hi> in our <hi>Requeſts,</hi> till they be anſwered; <hi>Hear me ſpeedily. O Lord, my Spirit faileth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: <hi>I would order my Cauſe before him, and fill my Mouth with Arguments,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job.</hi>

                  <p>WHEN the Multitude rebuked the <hi>blind Men,</hi> for crying after <hi>Jeſus,</hi> inſtead of being diſcouraged by ſuch Oppoſition, they cryed the more, ſaying, <hi>Have Mercy on us O Lord, thou Son of</hi> David, but <hi>Jeſus had Compaſſion on them, and touched their Eyes, and they received Sight.</hi> O, the Depth, the breadth, the Height of the Redeemer's Love!</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>poor Man</hi> that had a <hi>Palſey,</hi> who cou'd not get near to <hi>Chriſt</hi> below, becauſe of the Croud, did not give over his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in diſcouragement, but ſtill perſiſted, and got ſome Friends to carry him to the <hi>Roof</hi> of the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and untile it, and let him down thro' the Roof, into the midſt before <hi>Jeſus;</hi> no doubt ſome of the <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> fell down upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Head, or upon the Heads of ſome of his Hearers, and interrupted him for a little Space in his Sermon; this Behaviour look'd ſomewhat rude and unmannerly, yet the dear <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpoke not a Word of Reproof upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but on the contrary, encouraged the poor Man, and ſaid, <hi>be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee!</hi> O, the amazing Kindneſs and Condeſcenſion of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> Well might it be ſaid that our <hi>High Prieſt is touch'd with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> may we not therefore <hi>come with boldneſs to the Throne of GOD's Grace, that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in Time of need.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT why muſt we pray with ſuch importunity? I anſwer, it is neceſſary, both on Account of GOD and ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>God's Majeſty</hi> is wrong'd by Sin, and it is but reaſonable that this be felt and acknowledged before it be forgiven. Moreover it is a Diſgrace to <hi>God</hi>'s Mercy, to be aſk'd coldly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Almighty enjoins us to be importunate and urgent, that it may appear by our Groans how we eſteem his Grace!</p>
                  <p>NOR is <hi>importunity</hi> leſs neceſſary in reſpect of ourſelves, for without it we know not how to <hi>value</hi> the <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>God</hi> aright, and when the Caſe is ſo, are we likely to improve it? No! By no means! Thoſe that have been once poor, are careful of the Riches they have got by their Induſtry, while thoſe that are born to Wealth are often careleſs and profuſe, and therefore the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in general, orders it ſo, that Men ſhall not obtain Mercy

without Difficulty, <hi>they muſt ſtrive in an Agony to enter in</hi> at the <hi>ſtrait Gate, and take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence; they come with Weeping and with Supplication will I lead them</hi> ſaith GOD by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> This ſeems to allude to a Prince's Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Beggar on the Road, who aſks an Alms of him, but he goes on his Way as if he took no Notice, the Beggar perceiving this, follows him, and continues his Importunity till he prevails, by crying, O, Sir! I am a poor neceſſitous Creature, pray extend your Charity; or in other Words to this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>TWO things make Men importunate, namely a clear View of Danger great and near, and the Influences of the bleſſed Spirit. When the Diſciples ſaw that they were like to be drowned, they ſoon cryed out <hi>Maſter ſave us, we periſh!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT to open the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> more diſtinctly, it may not be improper very briefly to conſider, the venerable <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Aſſembly's Deſcription of it, which is this, that <q>It is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up of our Deſires to GOD; for Things agreeable to his Will, in the Name of Chriſt, with Confeſſion of our Sins, and thankful Acknowledgement of his Mercies.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Deſcription contains the following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> of Prayer, the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Manner,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> the <hi>Parts</hi> of <hi>Prayer:</hi> Each of theſe allow me to ſpeak a few Words upon.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> or he to whom we ſhould offer our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications is GOD only, for Prayer is a Part of his natural Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore it is his peculiar Prerogative; <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> It is God alone who knows all his People's Wants, who is preſent with them in them all, and able to ſupply them; and hence the <hi>Ninevites</hi> were juſtly enjoined in our Text, to <hi>cry mightily</hi> to God, and to none but him.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Eſſence</hi> or being of <hi>Prayer,</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>offering</hi> up our <hi>Deſires</hi> to God. Whatever Deſires we have after ſpiritual or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Benefits, yet unleſs they be offered or preſented to God, they can't be call'd Prayers, for Prayer is the Addreſs of an indigent Supplicant to his Superior for ſome Benefit, which neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a certain Homage in it.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> or Things pray'd for, muſt be <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to God's <hi>revealed Will</hi> of <hi>Precept</hi> or <hi>Promiſe.</hi> What the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has commanded us to ask or promiſed to confer, that and that only we ſhould ask; and if we do otherwiſe, we may expect a repulſe; <hi>ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, that ye may conſume it upon your Luſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in the general, is that it be offered in the Name of <hi>Chriſt, if ye ſhall ask any Thing in my Name,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>I will do it.</hi> Now this intends not only our mentioning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> in our Supplications, but our entire reliance upon his Merit for the Acceptance of them. It is in him only who <hi>is the Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> that we have <hi>acceſs</hi> to his Father. God is holy and we are ſinful, both in our Perſons and Performances,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:040518_0033_1015E921BA517568"/>
and therefore need a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to render them acceptable by the incenſe of his Merit.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> are theſe.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be <hi>Reverent, Behold I have taken upon me, who am but Duſt and Aſhes, to ſpeak to the Lord, O let not the Lord be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,</hi> ſaid Abraham. <hi>How dreadful is this Place, this is no other then the Houſe of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven,</hi> ſaid Jacob.</p>
                  <p>IT muſt be <hi>humble:</hi> To this purpoſe theſe Words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> are remarkable, <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the Deſire of the Humble, thou wilt prepare their Heart, thou wilt cauſe thine Ear to hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AGAIN, <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be <hi>ſincere,</hi> flowing from the Heart, and <hi>ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your Heart,</hi> ſayeth God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FARTHER, It muſt be <hi>believing; let him ask in Faith</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James.</hi> But what is that? I Anſwer, It contains theſe Things, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>firm Perſwaſion,</hi> that what we ask is agreeable to God's revealed Will, and that God is <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it; as likewiſe our <hi>entire Dependance</hi> upon his <hi>faithful Word</hi> to this End.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Importunity</hi> that ought to be in <hi>Prayer,</hi> I have before diſcourſed upon.</p>
                  <p>AND undoubtedly as <hi>Prayer</hi> in general, ſo in particular. The <hi>Prayer</hi> ſpoken of in our Text, includes theſe Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> not only <hi>Petition</hi> for the Mercies we need, and the <hi>Deprecation</hi> of the Judgments we fear. But likewiſe a humble <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of our Sins, and an Affectionate <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for Mercies received.</p>
                  <p>IN the publick Faſts obſerved in the Time of <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> there was a particular Confeſſion of Sin, accompanied with ſhame and grief.</p>
                  <p>WHEN <hi>Ezra</hi> heard of the Sin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after their return from Captivity, <hi>he ſat aſtoniſhed until the Evening, and then roſe up, rent his mantle,</hi> and ſpake to God in this Language, <hi>O my</hi> GOD <hi>I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my Face to thee my God!</hi> To the ſame Purpoſe ſpeaks <hi>Daniel</hi> upon the like Occaſion, <hi>to us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>belongeth confuſion of Face!</hi> The unreaſonableneſs and ingratitude that are in Sin, cauſe ſhame. Confeſſion of Sin is neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Humiliation for it, as well as Self-Condemnation and Juſtifying of God, whereby he is glorify'd.</p>
                  <p>AND if no Sorrow for Sin attends our Confeſſion of it, the Faſt wants its Beauty, and is like to fail of its Deſign. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inform us, that <hi>a Day of faſting is to afflict the Soul;</hi> and how can this be effected without Grief and Sorrow? Hence the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> aſſures us, that in his private Faſt, <hi>he mourned three full Weeks;</hi> and the Almighty reproved the Jews, that <hi>in the Day of their Faſt they took Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOR ſhould <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> for Mercies received be omitted: For the right Conſideration of Mercy, tends to aggravate Sin, and make our Confeſſion of it, and Grief for it, evangelical, <hi>the

                  <p>NOW <hi>Violence</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>in their Hands,</hi> partly to ſignify that it was daily committed by their Hands, which are the Inſtruments of Action; by the Hand Men are wont to take Things by force, and offer Abuſe and Injury to ſuch as reſſiſt them: And partly to ſignify, that they kept in <hi>forcible Poſeſſion,</hi> what they got by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice</hi> and <hi>Fraud,</hi> and would not reſtore it, without which Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance cannot be ſincere; according to that juſt and ancient Proverb, <hi>(non remittitur precatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum)</hi> the Sin is not pardon'd till the ill gotten Goods be reſtored.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Deſign</hi> of appointing ſaid <hi>Solemnity,</hi> was as the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> expreſſeſs it, <hi>to turn away God's fierce Anger, and prevent their periſhing.</hi> They were threatned with and in great Danger of Deſtruction; there was but a ſtep between them and ruin: It was therefore high Time to uſe proper Means to prevent it, and theſe their Reaſon taught them, were Faſting, Mourning, Prayer, and Reformation of Life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Motive</hi> that induced them hereto, was ſome Apprehenſion they had of the divine Goodneſs, <hi>who can tell,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce Anger, that we periſh not.</hi> They could not object againſt the equity of God's Judgment, or pretend to appeal to a higher Tribunal, yet they hoped in the divine Mercy, that while they were bewailing their Offences, while they were reſolving and endeavouring to alter the Courſe of their evil Conduct towards God and one another, and imploring divine Aſſiſtance herein, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> would be pleaſed to alter the Courſe of his afflictive Providences towards them, and forbear to execute the threatned Puniſhment. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In ſome Places of Scripture, <hi>God</hi> is ſaid <hi>to repent,</hi> and elſewhere it is ſaid, that <hi>he is not a Man that he ſhould repent:</hi> The true Meaning hereof is, that God cannot <hi>repent properly</hi> as Men do, who then change their Mind, and are affected with Grief; and no wonder ſeeing they are ſhort ſighted and imperfect Creatures: But theſe Things are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the infinite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, the <hi>Immutability, Perfection</hi> and <hi>Felicity</hi> of his <hi>Nature.

the following Propoſition, <hi>viz. That the Juſtice of GOD is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly manifeſt, or declared in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST:</hi> Altho' GOD ſpared guilty Man for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet he ſpared not his own <hi>Son,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Sinner's <hi>Surety,</hi> for the Honour of his <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN ſpeaking upon this Propoſition I would,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. OPEN <hi>the</hi> Nature <hi>of GOD's</hi> Juſtice. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. SHEW <hi>how it is gloriouſly manifeſt in the</hi> Redemption <hi>of Man by the</hi> Death <hi>of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, and then proceed to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of GOD, is that eternal <hi>Rectitude</hi> of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> whereby he orders and diſpoſes all Things, according to the <hi>Rules</hi> that his infinite Wiſdom has preſcribed; and governs all Mankind with the utmoſt Exactneſs and Impartiality in Relation to the Diſtribution of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments;</hi> to illuſtrate this we ſhould obſerve, that there is an intrinſick RECTITUDE and OBLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUITY in Things, and that the Reaſons and Relations of moral Good and Evil, do not depend upon any uncertain and arbitrary Principle; but are fixed and immutable, indiſpenſable, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; purſuant to this, that <hi>Truth, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and neceſſary Properties, in the divine Nature; antecedent to any Conſideration of the divine Will; and what he can no more alter or unſettle, than he can deny himſelf or ceaſe to be; that as he is the Maker and Governor of the World, he has an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Authority to make <hi>Laws,</hi> and enforce them with proper <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;</hi> that when Laws are thus enacted, he ſetts Bounds in ſome Meaſure to his own Authority; for Juſtice requires that he ſhould not preſcribe what is above Man's Strength, or if he does, that he ſhould give ſupernatural Power to obey it; that upon Obedience he cannot without Prejudice to his Juſtice, deny the promis'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or, upon Diſobedience, finally forbear to inflict the threatned Puniſhment: And from hence it follows, that GOD is neceſſarily obliged, both by his Nature and Covenant, to act with the ſtricteſt Juſtice and Impartiality, in all his Proceedings with Man: But I proceed to the</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Propos'd, Which was to ſhew how divine Juſtice is gloriouſly manifeſt, in the Redemption of Man, by the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the Particular in which, or Manner how divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> is glorify'd by the Death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is the Satisfaction that has been made thereto by it. In order to open this important and FUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAMENTAL POINT, of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION, and give it its juſt Weight, let me endeavour to repreſent,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE indiſpenſable <hi>Neceſſity</hi> there was of a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice, in order to our <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation.</hi> And,</p>

                  <p>NOW the Neceſſity of a Satisfaction to <hi>divine Juſtice</hi> in order to our Redemption and Salvation, appears from the Conſideration of the Nature of GOD, and his Relation to intelligent Creatures</p>

                     <hi>JUSTICE</hi> being a natural and neceſſary <hi>Perfection</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Nature,</hi> hath conſequently an invariable Reſpect to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Qualities of intelligent <hi>Beings,</hi> as divine Goodneſs in ſome Degree naturally and neceſſarily diffuſes itſelf upon Agents, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure and innocent, ſo likewiſe Juſtice terminates upon the Guilty and Nocent by Puniſhments equal to their Crimes; except a Satisfaction intervene. If it be impoſſible conſidering the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Diety that Holineſs ſhould be unrewarded, then ſurely it muſt be more impoſſible that Sin ſhould be unpuniſhed; ſeeing the Exerciſe of Juſtice is more neceſſary than that of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; for the Rewards which Goodneſs diſpenſes are pure Favour, inaſmuch as the Creature has received it's Being, and all its Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from GOD, all the Services it can perform, are due to him on account hereof, and if ſo, by the Payment of a juſt Debt, they cannot merit freſh Benefits; but the Puniſhments which Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice inflicts are due and demerited, for violating the Rights of Heaven, and all the Obligations they are laid under to GOD; ſeeing <hi>Juſtice</hi> in it's Nature is a Perfection, it muſt of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be in GOD, who is poſſeſs'd of all kinds of Excellency, and that in the higheſt Degree of Eminence, or infinitely, and if ſo it is inflexible and eternal.</p>
                  <p>SIN is directly contrary to the divine <hi>Purity,</hi> and therefore he muſt as neceſſarily hate it, as he loves himſelf; this is evident from the Law of Contraries, as well as from the Pſalmiſt's Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>The righteous Lord loveth Righteouneſs, but the Wicked his Soul hateth.</hi> Now <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is but a natural Effect, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Manifeſtation of this <hi>Hatred;</hi> and therefore it is not an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Conſtituion; it is true, the Time and Manner of it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is founded in divine <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> but the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of it is bottom'd on the eſſential <hi>Purity</hi> and Rectitude of the divine <hi>Nature</hi> to which Sin is repugnant.</p>
                  <p>BUT if together with what has been offered, reſpecting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; we conſider the Relation <hi>Jehovah</hi> bears to the moral World, it adds much Light and Force to this Argument.</p>
                  <p>ALMIGHTY GOD in the Character of a <hi>Governor,</hi> is obliged to protect the Laws of his Government from Reproach and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult.</p>
                  <p>AS it was proper and neceſſary, that the reaſonable Creature ſhould have a <hi>Law</hi> to direct it, in that <hi>Homage</hi> and Service, which it had a Capacity to perform to its Creator and Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>SO it is highly reaſonable that the aforeſaid <hi>Law</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by ſuch important Sanctions, as were neceſſary to procure the Creature's Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SIN</hi> being the greateſt moral <hi>Evil,</hi> becauſe oppoſite to the greateſt moral <hi>Good</hi> the bleſſed GOD, it is but ſuitable that it ſhould be puniſhed with the greateſt penal Evil, <hi>viz.</hi> Death.</p>
                  <p>NOW the <hi>Law</hi> being broken, was it not juſt and neceſſary, that the Penalty threatned ſhould be inflicted, either upon the Tranſgreſſor himſelf, according to the immediate Intent of the

                     <hi>Law,</hi> or upon ſuch a <hi>Surety</hi> in his room, as was able to make Satisfaction equivalent to the Offence; that ſo the <hi>Majeſty, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD might be rendered conſpicuous, as well as the Value he puts upon Obedience to his <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF the Penalty threatened be not inflicted, upon a proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, does it not reflect either upon his WISDOM, as if he had not with good Reaſon concerted the SANCTION, or upon his POWER, as if he was not able to inflict it, or upon his PURITY, as tho' he conniv'd with Tranſgreſſors; or upon his TRUTH, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as his Word is not perform'd. And would not Sinners be hereby induced to contemn the Law and the Lawgiver, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd in their Impieties? All which Conſiderations plainly prove the Neceſſity of Satisfaction for the Breach of GOD'S Laws; without this, GOD'S Hatred againſt Sin would not be declared, nor the <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Laws</hi> preſerved, nor a ſuitable <hi>Fear</hi> of offending him awak'd, every of which are neceſſary and excellent: It is true, temporal Magiſtrates are ſometimes obliged to diſpenſe with the Law, and ſpare an Offender, either thro' inabillity to puniſh him, or becauſe his Life may be of more Service to the State; and ſtill there is a ſuperior Tribunal, to which the Caſe either is, or ought to be referred; but GOD'S Government is very different, no Criminal can either eſcape his Notice, byaſs his Juſtice, or controul his Power; here is no Exigency of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that requires Impunity, no ſuperior <hi>Tribunal:</hi> Moreover the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of theſe <hi>Laws</hi> is more ſacred than that of Civil States and Kingdoms. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>HE that ſatisfies for another's Sin muſt be without Sin himſelf, for guilty Blood is impure and conſequently ſtains by its Effuſion rather than cleanſes: Now the Lord JESUS was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from Sinners, he appeared to take away Sin and in him was no Sin: To prevent his Infection with original Sin propogated by natural Generation, he was conceived in a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Manner, by the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> according to the Angel's Declaration, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the higheſt ſhall overſhadow thee, therefore alſo that holy Thing that ſhall be born of thee ſhall be called the Son of GOD.</hi> And as he was perfectly free from original, ſo likewiſe from actual Sin; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ghoſt, and with Power, the Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt forever after the Order of</hi> Melchizedek. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my Life, this Commandment I have received of my Father.</hi> Theſe Scriptures and many others that might be mentioned, do ſufficiently ſhew <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Authority and Commiſſion to mediate.</p>
                  <p>GOD the Father in this Conſtitution, is to be conſidered as a Governor, who by an Act of Supremacy and pure Juriſdiction, may diſpenſe with the Execution of the Law, upon ſuch Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, as fully anſwer the Ends of Government.</p>
                  <p>THE Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for that obliges the Perſon that Sins to ſuffer, and if the Caſe were ſo no Fleſh could be ſaved; nor is it diſannull'd, for if ſo no Obligation to Duty or Penalty would remain, but all Men are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to obey, and thoſe who impenitently neglect it, are under a Curſe, it is therefore only relax'd in regard of its Penalty, by a merciful Condeſcenſion of the Lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>IT is true the <hi>Moral Law</hi> cannot be relaxed, in reſpect of its <hi>Precept;</hi> for that being a <hi>Copy</hi> of the divine <hi>Purity,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty cannot deny himſelf by contradicting it, or allowing what is intrinſically Evil; nor can it be relaxed in Reſpect of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> and Weight of its Penalty in general, becauſe of the <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of GOD engaged to iſſue the ſame.</p>
                  <p>YET that the Penalty may be relaxed, as to the Perſon of the Sinner, for wiſe and juſt Reaſons, is evident by conſidering, that it is not the Evil of the Offender, that is primarily deſigned by it, But the Honour of the Lawgiver, and the Preſervation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order and Government; in caſe therefore thoſe valuable Ends can be attain'd, by ſubſtituting a Surety in the Place of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor to ſuffer for him; the End of the Law is anſwered.</p>
                  <p>ALTHO' the Threatning declared the Demerit of Sin in the Tranſgreſſor, and the Right of Puniſhing in the Creator and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, yet it cannot vacate GOD'S Power to relax it upon juſt and wiſe Reaſons; otherwiſe it would be abſurd and inconſiſtent with his Supremacy.</p>
                  <p>THE laſt <hi>Pre-requiſite</hi> that I mentioned, was the REDEEMERS <hi>Conſent</hi> to the Fathers Appointment; this was neceſſary to make his Sufferings ſatisfactory; for being GOD himſelf he could not be compelled by any ſuperior Authority; its true, after he had undertaken, he was then obliged to pay the Debt; but his firſt Engagement was altogether free and of Choice.</p>
                  <p>AND ſeeing that the <hi>Vertue</hi> of his Sufferings does not ariſe meerly from the Dignity of his Perſon, but from his Subſtitution in our ſtead, this rendered his Conſent likewiſe neceſſary; his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for others without his Conſent, if he could have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd thereto, would have been liable to the Charge of Injuſtice; and therefore the Scriptures expreſsly declare his willingneſs to undertake the Buſineſs of Mediation, Burnt-offering, and Sin-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou didſt not require, <hi>then ſaid I, lo I come, in the Volumn

                  <p>NOW having ſpoken of the Pre-requiſites neceſſary in order to Satisfaction; it is proper to diſcourſe on the Account which the Scriptures give of the Redeemer's Death, to the End we may know whether it was ſatisfactory or not, and to ſhew how divine Juſtice is therein glorified. Now the Scriptures repreſent the Death of CHRIST under a threefold Character, <hi>viz.</hi> as a Puniſhment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and as a Sacrifice to reconcile us to God. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. IT is repreſented as a Puniſhment for Sin, this will appear by conſidering.</p>
                  <p>THAT Man on account of his Tranſgreſſion, was ſentenced by the Law he broke to Death; and being inſolvent, the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by his Father's Appointment and his own Conſent, engaged as a Surety to pay the Debt; and hence he is call'd the Surety of a better Covenant, and he is ſaid to be made under the Law, that we might obtain the Adoption of Sons; he who was God over all bleſſed forever, was in reſpect of his human Nature, and as Mediator, ſubject to its Precepts, and liable to its Penalties, that by performing the one and ſuſtaining the other, he might redeem thoſe that were under the Law.</p>
                  <p>THE Debt we ow'd was not pecuniary but penal, a Creditor may forgive the former without Payment, becauſe it is his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but the latter cannot be forgiven without the Prince's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who is Guardian of the <hi>Laws,</hi> becauſe publick Juſtice is concerned in it.</p>
                  <p>JESUS CHRIST having aſſum'd the Relation of a SURETY, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came one with the Debtor, in the Judgment of the <hi>Law;</hi> and ſo was liable to their Puniſhment according to <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND this Puniſhment the Scriptures aſſure us, GOD as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Judge inflicted upon him; and hence he is ſaid to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up by the Determinate Council of GOD, and that the Lord laid upon him the Iniquities of us all, that is the Guilt of them, and Puniſhment due for them. It is farther ſaid, that it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and elſewhere that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was cut of but not for himſelf, that he was wounded for our Tranſgreſſions, bruis'd for our Iniquities, that the Chaſtiſement of our Peace was laid upon him, and that by his Stripes we are heal'd; that he himſelf bare our Sins on his own Body on the Tree. Moreover the Sufferings CHRIST endur'd, were anſwerable to the Penalty the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd, in Subſtance, the Death threatn'd was both Temporal and Spiritual, and thus our Lord, not only bore a Temporal Death, accompanied with great Diſhonour, and exquiſite Anguiſh, but likewiſe with the Curſe of GOD, and he alſo bore the Wrath of

                  <p>IN <hi>Chriſt's Sufferings</hi> we may obſerve the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of Puniſhment. The <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is ſomething afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, either privative in being deprived of ſome good, or poſitive in enduring ſomething grievous, both which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bore. The <hi>form</hi> of Puniſhment is when it is Inflicted for Sin, and this diſtinguiſhes it from a Calamity. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer'd Death for Sin not his own, and hence he is ſaid to bear our Sins, to be delivered up to Death for our Sins, yea, to be made Sin and a Curſe for US. The <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is the common good, partly in deterring Perſons from violating the Laws, which is the deſign of exemplary Puniſhment, and partly in maintaining the Honour and Intereſt of thoſe who have ſuffered by the Breach of the Laws, this is the Deſign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Puniſhment, anſwerable to which in the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Severity there expreſs'd is to deter from Sin, and maintain the Honour of the great Lord of the Univerſe, by making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the Injury done againſt him by Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. THE DEATH of CHRIST is repreſented in Scripture as the PRICE of our <hi>Redemption: Redemption</hi> in general is a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one from a Calamity by a <hi>Ranſom, i. e.</hi> Some valuable Conſideration, which is term'd a Price; to underſtand which let it be conſidered, that Man by Diſobedience to GOD was bro't into Miſery, ſuch Miſery as the Scripture often expreſſes by Captivity, which conſiſts in a ſervile Subjection to Satan and Death, to which Man was as it were committed for his Rebellion by the Supreame Judge and Governor; from this Calamity Men could no otherwiſe be delivered then by Ranſom, for by Order of Divine Juſtice we were detain'd Priſoners, and till this was Satisfy'd, no Diſcharge could be obtain'd; freedom from a Calamity without a Price is Deliverance ſimply, but not properly Redemption: The Word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to which the Scriptures aſcribe our eſcape <hi>(apolutroſis)</hi> ſignifies Deliverance by a Ranſom; and hence it is ſaid, <hi>that CHRIST gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, (antilutron)</hi> This Word is exceeding Emphatical, and ſignifies a Ranſom paid inſtead of another. <hi>Anti</hi> denotes Subſtitution, when a Thing or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040518_0052_1015E94FEA16E700"/>
Perſon is put in the Place of another; many Inſtances might eaſily be given of this, ſo that the Meaning of the aforeſaid Words, he gave himſelf a Ranſon for many, is this, that he died in their ſtead, and by his Life as a Price obtained their Redemption; which Truth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> elſewhere confirms, by ſaying that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has Redeem'd us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us; the Price upon Conſideration of which we are Redeem'd, <hi>is not corruptable Things ſuch as Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of CHRIST as of a Lamb without Blemiſh and without Spot,</hi> this Price was paid in our ſtead to GOD, for it was for Sin againſt his Majeſty, that we were caſt into Miſery, and by his Righteous Order detained in it; and therefore to him the Price of our acquitance muſt be paid; Satan is no more then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Juſtice: If CHRIST had died only for the Confirmation of the Goſpel, or to exhibit to us a Patern of Suffering, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> imagine, then what was there in his Death more than in the Death of other Martyrs, and how can we be ſaid to be <hi>redeem'd</hi> by it? Would it not be as ridiculous as blaſphemous to ſay, that we are redeemed by their Death? But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is repreſented in Scripture, as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to reconcile us to God; him Jehovah <hi>has ſet forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a true and real <hi>Sacrifice</hi> appears not only from the expreſs Declaration of Scripture, but from all the Ingredients of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being found in it, Chriſt <hi>our Paſſover,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, is ſacrificed for us;</hi> and in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he informs us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath appeared once in the End of the World to put away Sin by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>ONE <hi>Ingredient</hi> of a real and proper <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> was that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offering muſt be a Prieſt, <hi>every high Prieſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>taken from among Men is ordained for Men in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins;</hi> and was not <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſtitued a Prieſt by Oath after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AGAIN, The Things offered were to be of God's appointment, otherwiſe it was but Will-worſhip, even in freewill Offerings, tho' the Time of Offering was not fixed, yet the Things to be Offered were appointed; and thus was not what CHRIST offered, appointed and prepared by God, <hi>a Body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; this Body was animated with a Soul, which being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated therefrom in his Death, is ſaid to be <hi>made an Offering for Sin,</hi> by the Royal Prophet; and elſewhere he is ſaid to <hi>offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> i. e. both his Soul and Body, (<hi>Heb.</hi> ix.)</p>
                  <p>FARTHER, that which was offered for a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd; thoſe Things that had life were kill'd, and their Blood pour'd out, and the other Parts beſides the Blood were burnt, either wholy or in part: Thus our Lord was ſlain and his Blood ſhed, and his Soul was expoſed to his Fathers Wrath. And as the Jewiſh <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were burnt without the Camp: Thus did not JESUS ſuffer <hi>without the Gates of Jeruſalem.</hi> Moreover,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:040518_0053_1015E951D9EB96F0"/>
                     <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were offered to God only, and hence the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> terms t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.)</p>
                  <p>FROM the aforeſaid Particulars it appears, that all the <hi>Ingredients</hi> or <hi>Conſtituents,</hi> of a real <hi>Sacrifice</hi> are found in the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAVING already ſhewn that CHRIST'S Death was a <hi>real Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> I would proceed to aſſert and prove, that it was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Propitiation</hi> or <hi>Attonement</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO this End obſerve, that the <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices</hi> under the Jewiſh OEconomy, were figures and ſhadows of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now if the Types and Shadows had any propitiatory Vertue in them, much more the Antitype, elſe the Subſtance would not exceed the Shadow, which is abſurd. That the Jewiſh <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> did prefigure the Death of Chriſt, the Apoſtle declares at large in the ninth and tenth Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſians,</hi> where he calls them <hi>Figures and Shadows of good Things to come:</hi> but in the mean Time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that <hi>the Body is of</hi> Chriſt; as if he ſhould ſay, thoſe Propitiatory Jewiſh Sacrifices had ſome reſemblance of this, as the ſhadow has of the Body, tho' obſcure and imperfect; but the Subſtance and Perfection of Atonement is in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT to make this very important Point more evident, let me endeavour to prove, that all that was abſolutely neceſſary to a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Propitiation under the Jewiſh OEconomy, is to be found in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, <hi>e. g.</hi> The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, and likewiſe his Puniſhment was inflicted upon it, the Sacrifice was ſubſtituted in his Room, apeaſed the Almighty, and removed the Sinners guilt.</p>
                  <p>EACH of theſe Particulars deſerves and requires our Attention. The Sin of the Offender was laid upon the Sacrifice, or imputed to it and charged upon it, ſo as to be made reſponſible and liable to ſuffer for it, as if it had contracted the Guilt itſelf; even as a Surety is obliged to pay a Debt he never contracted, yea as much as if he had: The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was look'd upon and treated as a guilty Thing, tho' it had not fin'd itſelf; hence theſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were called <hi>Sins, (Levit.</hi> xx. 17) which is tranſlated <hi>Sin-Offering.</hi> Farther they are ſaid to bear the Iniquities of the People, (<hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 22.) <hi>and the Goat ſhall bear upon him all their Iniquities.</hi> We are farther informed in the aforeſaid Chapter, that the People laid their Hands upon the Head of the Sacrifice, confeſſed their Sins over him, and put their Sins upon him; <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſhall lay both his Hands upon the Head of the live Goat, and confeſs over him all the Iniquities of the Children of Iſrael.</hi> Putting them upon the Head of the Goat, ſignified, ſay the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Maſters, that the Guilt was transferred from the People to the Sacrifice that was offered for them. And hence the Scape Goat, and other Propitiatory Sacrifices, were look'd upon as execrable and poluted Things; and thoſe that touch'd them were po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040518_0054_1015E954A08F76E8"/>
Now as the Sin was charged upon and imputed to the legal Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſo our Sins were charged upon and imputed to JESUS CHRIST, as the Apoſtle obſerves to the <hi>Corinthians, he was made Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> How could he be made Sin who knew none, any other way than by Imputation? And how can his Righteouſneſs, who is God, be made ours by any other Method? Sin was imputed to Chriſt when it was charged upon him, and he obliged to ſuffer for it in our ſtead; as a Debt may be ſaid to be imputed to a Surety when he takes it upon himſelf, and is thereby obliged to pay it, tho' he never contracted it; and <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> is imputed to us when it is accepted for us, and we as realy entitled to its Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THE Sacrifices, by having the Sins of the People <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Sacrifice ſuffered the aforeſaid Penalties in the Offenders room and place, and this indeed neceſſarily follows from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars beforementioned, for to ſuffer in one's ſtead is nothing elſe but to ſuffer for another what he ſhould have ſuffered, that he may eſcape; thus the Sacrifice ſuffered Death for the Offender that he might not die, and therefore dy'd in his ſtead, its Life went for his Life, <hi>Levit.</hi> xvii. 11. <hi>For the Life of the Fleſh is in the Blood, and I have given it to you upon the Altar to make an Atonement.</hi> The Blood being the Vehickle of Life, when it goes, the Life goes; this therefore being offered to attone for them, or ſave their Lives, of Conſequence the Life of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice went inſtead of the Life of the Offender.</p>
                  <p>AND if, as has been before proved, both the Sin and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Offender were laid upon the Sacrifice, it muſt needs ſuffer in his room and place; but for farther Illuſtration of this important Point of the Subſtitution of the Sacrifice in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors room, it may be obſerved, that no Sacrifices were inſtituted for Capital Offences, ſuch as Murder, Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe the Sinner himſelf was to be cut off; but for other Sins which tho'

                  <p>WELL, if there was in the Sacrifices of Attonement a Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrifice in the Offender's room, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſuch a Sacrifice as has been proved, then it neceſſarily follows that he died not only for our Good, but in our room and place, ſeeing he is the Subſtance and Anti-type to which thoſe Shadows pointed, and in whom they have their Accompliſhment, and hence he is ſaid <hi>to die for the Ungodly,</hi> and to ſuffer the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt that he might bring us to GOD, juſt as the innocent Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the room of the guilty Tranſgreſſor, not only the original Words in thoſe Scriptures <hi>Huper</hi> and <hi>Anti,</hi> but the Things ſpoken of manifeſtly declare a Subſtitution of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Place of Sinners as a Sacrifice of Propitiation.</p>
                  <p>AGAIN, <hi>propitiatory Sacrifices</hi> were to appeaſe God and turn away his Anger, this is the Meaning of the Word <hi>Attonement,</hi> which was the Deſign of the <hi>Sin-Offerings,</hi> the <hi>Treſpaſs-Offerings,</hi> and the <hi>Burnt-Offerings,</hi> Levit. vii. 7. and i. 4. <hi>And he ſhall put his Hand upon the Head of the Burnt-Offering, and it ſhall be accepted for him to make Attonement for him.</hi> And this was alſo the Deſign of the <hi>Peace-Offerings,</hi> and this End thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices attained, many Examples of this Kind might be offered but I ſhall only, for brevity's ſake, mention one, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiv. ult. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>offered Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings, ſo the Lord was intreated for the Land, and the Plague was ſtayed from</hi> Iſrael. Becauſe the Lord by thoſe Sacrifices was rendered propitious or well pleaſed, therefore they are frequently ſaid to be of a <hi>ſweet ſavour to the Lord,</hi> Levit. i. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice is ſaid to be <hi>a ſavour of Reſt,</hi> as it is in the Margin, <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 21. on which Occaſion <hi>God</hi> ſaid <hi>he would not curſe the Ground any more for Man</hi>'s <hi>ſake.</hi> It is call'd a ſavour of Reſt, becauſe when <hi>God</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>NOW the ſame Words and Effects are aſcribed to the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (or to his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> which is the ſame) in our Text he is ſaid to be a <hi>Propitiatory thro' Faith in his Blood,</hi> by him, ſays the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans, we have received the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, Rom.</hi> xi. He is called our <hi>Peace, Epheſ.</hi> ii. 14. And the Chaſtiſement of our Peace is ſaid to be laid upon him, <hi>i. e.</hi> Puniſhments neceſſary to procure our Peace, and by his Blood and Death we are ſaid to be juſtified and reconciled. <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 9.10.</p>
                  <p>PREVIOUS to this Reconciliation, Satisfaction to Juſtice was neceſſary, which implies not only the Suffering of a Calamity,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:040518_0056_1015E95A5676E290"/>
but that in Subſtance, which the <hi>Law</hi> threatned and the Sinner deſerved. <hi>Juſtice</hi> that it may be ſatisfied requires the Execution of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Calamity aforeſaid muſt be endured by the Sinner, and in his ſtead by another, if one ſuffers upon his own Account, that can be no Satisfaction for another, all theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we have already proved, are verified in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and in the Subſtance which they prefigured.</p>
                  <p>ONCE more I may obſerve, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices removed Guilt or Obligation to Puniſhment, here obſerve, that Guilt may be ſaid to be threefold, <hi>viz. Civil, Ceremonial,</hi> and <hi>Moral. Civil</hi> Guilt conſiſted in a liableneſs to temporal Death, for ſome viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the civil or judicial <hi>Law, Deut.</hi> xxi. 9.</p>
                  <p>CEREMONIAL Guilt conſiſted in an Obligation to be debarr'd from the Privileges of publick Worſhip under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for ſome Breach of the ceremonial <hi>Law,</hi> for ſome legal Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. But,</p>
                  <p>MORAL <hi>Guilt</hi> conſiſts in an Obligation to endure eternal Death for tranſgreſſing the <hi>moral Law,</hi> for by divine Conſtitution the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of every moral Evil or Sin properly and intrinſically ſo call'd is Death; now the legal Sacrifices could free from the two former Kinds of <hi>Guilt,</hi> but the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone from the latter, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 13, 14. <hi>For if the Blood of Goats, and Aſhes of a Heiſer ſprinkling of the Unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh,</hi> i. e. promoted an external Sanctification or Expiation, as to the Fleſh, not as to the Soul and Conſcience, <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of</hi> Chriſt <hi>purge your Conſciences from dead Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE legal Sacrifices could not make him that did the Service, perfect, as pertaining to the Conſcience, becauſe they could not compenſate the Injury Sin had done to GOD, being finite, without which, <hi>Juſtice</hi> is engaged to puniſh the Tranſgreſſor with eternal Death.</p>
                  <p>THESE Sacrifices could only remove a civil and ceremonial <hi>Guilt,</hi> or liableneſs to outward Puniſhment enacted by thoſe Laws, (in Inſtances not grounded upon the Nature and Reaſon of Things, but meerly upon divine Sovereignity;) and ſhadow forth the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which being of infinite Value is ſufficient to ſatisfy divine Juſtice, remove the Guilt of moral Impurity, and ſave the Soul: Under the Law we are told, <hi>that without the ſhedding of Blood there was no remiſſion of Sins,</hi> and the Blood is ſaid to make Attonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> xvii 11. the Reaſon is, becauſe the Life was in the Blood, and therefore when the Blood was offered to make Attonement for the Offender, the Life of the Sacrifice was ſuppos'd to be given inſtead of his Life, and thus the Sentence of the Law threatning Death was executed, and ſo <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſatisfied. For this Reaſon the Blood of the Mediator is ſaid to <hi>ſpeak better Things than the Blood of</hi> Abel, for that cry'd for Revenge, but this procures Remiſſion to Believers; and this doubtleſs is the Reaſon why ſo frequent mention is made of the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:040518_0057_1015E95C68D12C48"/>
the <hi>New-Teſtament, viz.</hi> to ſhew that our dear Redeemer has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Law, Death itſelf, and thereby ſatisfied <hi>Juſtice,</hi> magnified the <hi>Law,</hi> and made it honourable.</p>
                  <p>BUT the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Satisfaction to Juſtice appears, not only from what has been ſaid upon the ſcriptural Repreſentation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death as a Puniſhment inflicted for Sin, as a Price to redeem us from Ruin, and a Sacrifice to reconcile us to GOD, but likewiſe from the Conſideration of the Quality of the Perſon ſuffering, the Degrees of his Sufferings, and the Effects of them.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Quality</hi> of his Perſon derived an infinite Value upon his Sufferings. Our Redeemer was the true and eternal GOD, co-equal and co-eternal with his Father, <hi>the Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> the Son of GOD, not meerly by Office, but by Nature, and therefore was able to make full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our <hi>Sins.</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of all Nations agree that Puniſhments receive their Eſtimate from the Quality of the Perſons that ſuffer: Tho' the Deity is impaſſible, yet it was a divine Perſon that ſuffered, and hence his Blood is call'd the <hi>Blood of GOD,</hi> in Scripture, this made his Sufferings of infinite Worth.</p>
                  <p>NOR was there any Defect in the Payment he made, we ow'd a Debt of <hi>Death</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> and his <hi>Life</hi> was offered up as a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> yea, <hi>he trod the Wine-preſs of his Father's Anger,</hi> and his divine Nature communicated an infinite Dignity to his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo that they were in Kind, Degree, and Value, ſuited to the Sentence of the violated <hi>Law,</hi> equal to the Demerit of <hi>Sin,</hi> and conſequently ſatisfactory to divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> provoked by it.</p>
                  <p>BUT methink, the Conſideration of the <hi>Conſequents</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death pours more Light upon this important Subject, and clearly proves the ſufficiency of his Satisfaction to <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW there are theſe three Conſequences of his Death that deſerve our preſent A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>OUR Lord, in Quality of our <hi>Surety,</hi> was arreſted by <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and detain'd as Priſoner in the Grave, till he had by his Death ſatisfied the <hi>Law</hi> and paid our Debt; upon which he received a Diſcharge in his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and hence the raiſing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is aſcribed to GOD as reconciled, <hi>Now the God of Peace, who brought again from the Dead the great Shepherd of the Sheep, thro' the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant;</hi> beſides it is aſcribed to his Blood becauſe that was the full Price of his and our Liberty. <hi>Juſtice incenſed</hi> arreſted and ſlew him, but <hi>Juſtice ſatisfied</hi> gave him a Releaſe and Acquittance, of which his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> is a clear Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>THE bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> having riſen from the Dead, aſcended into Heaven as our High Prieſt, there to interceed for us: Now his Admiſſion into Heaven, after he had undertaken to be our <hi>Surety,</hi> is a full and certain Proof that he has faithfully diſcharged that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040518_0058_1015E95EC11A2678"/>
important Truſt, this is doubtleſs the Meaning of theſe Words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John xvi. 10. He <hi>ſhall convince the World of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe I go to my Father,</hi> i. e. the holy Spirit ſhall convince and perſuade Sinners of the Compleatneſs of my perſonal and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Righteouſneſs, by the Argument of my aſcending to and being accepted of my Father, for without this he would exclude me from his divine Preſence.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had offered Sacrifices without at the Altar, for the Sins of the People, he opened the Vail and entered into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there offered ſweet Incenſe and the Blood of Sacrifices to render GOD propitious to them, (<hi>Levit.</hi> xvi. 14, 15.) Theſe Things were Figures of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to perform, the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> was a Type of the third Heaven, as that had a double Vail which ſeparated it from the inner Temple, and the outward Court, ſo is the third Heaven ſeparated from the Earth by the double Vail of the ſtarry Heavens and airy Regions, none that was impure might enter into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and into Heaven, we are told that <hi>no unclean Thing can enter;</hi> there was the Throne of GOD, for as the Pſalmiſt obſerves, <hi>He dwells between the Cherubims,</hi> there the Tables of the Law, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of divine Wiſdom and Purity, there the Cherubims the Figures of the bleſſed Angels, there the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> entered with the Blood of the Sacrifice, carrying the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his <hi>Breaſt-plate.</hi>

                  <p>THUS our great <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> after having by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a toned for the Sins of his People, entered into the eternal Sanctuary with his own Blood, <hi>bearing on his Boſom the Names of all the redeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of this there was a miraculous ſign given at his <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> for in the Moment he expired, <hi>the Vail of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was rent from the Top to the Bottom,</hi> to ſignify that the great <hi>High Prieſt</hi> had Authority to enter into Heaven itſelf as our Surety, and that his Deſign herein was to appear in the Preſence of God for us as the Lamb ſlain, (<hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 24.)</p>
                  <p>AS our LORD purchaſed <hi>Salvation</hi> for us, by the real Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Earth, ſo he applies it to us by his Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Heaven, which is a Commemoration of that Sacrifice; and therefore he is ſaid to appear before his Father by <hi>Sacrifice.

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF any Man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Righteous.</hi> His <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is attended with Majeſty and Efficacy: He does not now ſupplicate with <hi>ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> as in the Days of his Fleſh, but <hi>Wills</hi> Salvation to his People, <hi>Father I will that thoſe thou haſt given me be with me, that they may behold my Glory.</hi> Nor does his Suit ever fail of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> for it is juſt, he asks nothing but what he has bought by Blood.

inexpreſſible Intereſt in his Affection; and hence we are told, that <hi>him the Father heareth always.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>FARTHER, the preſent <hi>Exaltation</hi> of our <hi>Redeemer</hi> to the higheſt Degree of Dignity, Glory and Dominion, is a certain Argument of the ſufficiency of his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice by his obedient Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, becauſe it was promiſed to and conferred upon him by his Father as a Reward the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THAT he is now advanced to the higheſt <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Dominion,</hi> is evident from theſe Scriptures, (Epheſ. i.) <hi>When he raiſed him from the Dead, and ſet him at his own right Hand in heavenly Places, far above all principality and Power, and Might and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and every Name that is named, not only in this World but alſo in that which is to come, and hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT the Father promiſed to him, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> the aforeſaid Dignities as a Reward, and conſequent of his Humiliation, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe evident from theſe Places of Scripture, (<hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 26.) <hi>Ought not</hi> Chriſt <hi>to have ſuffered and to enter into his Glory:</hi> This doubtleſs refers to the Covenant of Redemption between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, before all Worlds, wherein the Son engaged to ſuffer for Sinners, and the Father promiſed to reward him for it; for without Reference had hereto, there was no Obligation either upon the Father or the Son in theſe reſpects, See alſo <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 8.9. <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death; wherefore God hath alſo highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Name, that at the Name of</hi> Jeſus <hi>every Knee ſhould bow.</hi> Heb. i. 3. <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our Sins, he ſat down on the right Hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW ſeeing the aforeſaid Exaltation, of being Head of the Church, and Lord of the Univerſe, was promiſed to the <hi>Mediator</hi> as a Reward and Conſequent of his Sufferings and Satisfaction; foraſmuch as it is diſpenſed, it is a ſufficient Proof that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is perform'd, on which the Promiſe was ſuſpended, or in other Word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>BUT the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death, are likewiſe Evidences of his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> by it, and therefore give farther force to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>The Death of JESUS has blotted out the Hand-Writing of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which was contrary to us, and took it out of the Way, nailing it to his Croſs <hi>i. e.</hi> entirely cancelled the condemnatory Sentence of the Law as to Believers; for in the aforeſaid Terms there is a manifeſt alluſion to the Defacing and Deſtruction of

obligatory Bonds. In the End of the World our great high Prieſt appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf; <hi>his Blood cleanſeth from all Sin,</hi> and not only extends its Efficacy to all Time paſt, but will to all Time coming; and hence he is ſaid <hi>to be the ſame Yeſterday to-day and forever, able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to the Father by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOR is the Death of CHRIST leſs efficacious in removing the Dominion and Stain of Sin, for by it the ſanctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit are procured, <hi>whereby we are renewed after the Image of God, and made meet for Communion with him;</hi> hence it was that <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed the <hi>Comforter</hi> as a conſequent of his Aſcenſion.

                  <p>AND is it not thro' the <hi>Blood of</hi> CHRIST <hi>that we have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enter into the holieſt?</hi> (Heb. x. 19) Which is a clear E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the compleat <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made by it: For without this, Juſtice would never ſuffer the Privilege of the Righteous to be confered on the guilty and depraved. To this very Purpoſe the Apoſtle himſelf argues, (Heb. v. 9.) <hi>He learned Obedience by the Things which he ſuffered, and being made Perfect, be became the Author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> The meaning of which is, that there was Obedience to the Fathers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings, and that after he had perfected the End deſigned by them, which was <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to Juſtice, he became the Author of Happineſs to all that are believingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his Government and Authority.</p>
                  <p>Having gone thro' the Heads of Diſcourſe propos'd; give me leave, becauſe of the inexpreſſible moment of this Subject, before I proceed to the Improvement, to offer a brief Anſwer to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objections that are made againſt the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Socinians</hi> object, that it is a Violation of Juſtice to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Puniſhment of one to another.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is ſo in ſome Caſes, but not in all, <hi>e. g.</hi> When the Perſon puniſhed has not Power to diſpoſe of his Life, does not conſent to the Puniſhment, and no valuable End can be anſwered by it, then it is no doubt unjuſt to transfer the Puniſhment upon him. But on the Contrary, when he has Power to diſpoſe of his Life, conſents thereto, and a valuable End can be anſwered thereby, it is not unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>NOW every of theſe Things are applicable to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He had full Power to diſpoſe of his Life, and freely conſented to his Death, (<hi>John</hi> x. 18.) <hi>I lay down my life, no Man taketh it from me, I have Power to lay it down and Power to take it again;</hi> nor was it poſſible he ſhould be held under the Power of Death, (<hi>Act.</hi> ii. 24.) otherwiſe no doubt it would have been unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſuch a one as he to endure it, for worthleſs rebels.</p>
                  <p>MOREOVER, an infinite Good reſults from his Death; God is hereby glorified, and guilty Sinners ſaved, and the great Ends of Government anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:040518_0061_1015E9674C231610"/>JUSTICE is no diſorderly Appetite, that aims principally at the Ruin of the Guilty, and is diſſatisfied without it. No, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Right with pure Affections, and is therefore content when the Injury is repaired, from whomſoever Satisfaction comes.</p>
                  <p>THO' an Inocent Perſon cannot ſuffer as Inocent, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice; yet he may contract an Obligation which will expoſe him to deſerved Sufferings. The Wiſdom and Juſtice of all Nations agree in puniſhing one for anothers Fault, where there is previous Conſent, as in the Caſe of Hoſtages; tho' it is eſſential to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted for Sin, yet not on the Perſon ſinning, for in the Judgment of the Law, the Sinner and Surety are one.</p>
                  <p>EXCHANGE in Criminal Caſes it is true is not allowed, but that is not from a Suppoſition of Injuſtice in its Nature, for then it would not be allowed in civil; but for other Reaſons, ſuch as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe Life is a Depoſitum committed to us, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till God or the publick Good calls for it; beſides the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick would ſuffer loſs by the Deſtruction of one of its Members, and perhaps the ſurviving nocent, or guilty Perſon, grow worſe by impunity.</p>
                  <p>Moreover we ſhould remember, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame Perſon, when abſtractly conſidered, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and when ſuſtaining the Repreſentation of others, ſince ſuch a one's Inocence, tho' it renders him incapable of ſuffering, ſtrictly ſo called, in the former of theſe reſpects, yet not in the latter, becauſe the Law then no longer looks upon his private but publick Character; and conſequently the Puniſhment of thoſe he repreſents devolves upon their Proxy. Theſe Things duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the aforeſaid grand and popular Objection vaniſhes into Smoke.</p>
                  <p>But it is again objected, that the Puniſhment which our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, underwent, was not the ſame which the Law threatned, and therefore is not Satisfactory; it is but the Death of one, but a tranſient and temporal Death, whereas the eternal Death of all was threatned.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is true there was a Difference in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but not in Subſtance. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did endure a real tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Death, and ſomething Equivalent to an eternal, in weight and value. He could not endure indeed the reproaches of a ſinful Mind, or the Anguiſh of Deſpair, becauſe it is impoſſible from the Nature of Things, that theſe Calamities could come upon an ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and divine Perſon, they being the reſult of perſonal Guilt and Impotency to atone for it; but our Lord endured Agonies of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Kind, the awful apprehenſions of a painful ignominious Death, the Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the unrelenting Vengeance of Almighty God, which all united at once againſt him; while in the mean Time the divine Nature, as it were, withdrew from his relief. Whatever were the Ingredients of that <hi>bitter Cup</hi> which God that mix'd them, and he that drunk them, only knew, yet this we may ſay, that it could be no ordinary <hi>penal</hi> preſſure,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:040518_0062_1015E96A5E65D088"/>
which could overwhelm his Soul with ſuch a deluge of Grief, diſſolve his Body into a ſweat of Blood, and at laſt extort that awful outcry, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> This inexpreſſible weight of Pain, which the dignity of his Perſon put an immenſe Value upon, made his Sufferings equal to the Guilt of all he repreſented, and more than equal to the ſufferings of all Mankind; the eternal anguiſh of the whole human Race could not have to much honoured the Juſtice and Law of God, as the Sufferings of God himſelf in our Nature, tho' but for a ſmall ſpace of Time</p>
                  <p>But to open and illuſtrate this Matter more fully, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, that it was impoſſible for the <hi>Redeemer</hi> to pay the Debt of Penalty denounced by the Law for Sin, in all the Circumſtances of it: He did indeed endure a <hi>natural Death</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but then it was but one in the Room of Millions, the Defficiency of which was made up by the Dignity of his Perſon.</p>
                  <p>BUT as to <hi>ſpiritual Death,</hi> tho' he bore ſomething like it, <hi>viz</hi> the withdrawing for a Time a comfortable Senſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love, and anguiſh of Spirit, in a Degree that we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or expreſs; yet it was impoſſible that he ſhould endure it in all its Parts ſtrictly and properly; for as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Life includes theſe two Things, <hi>viz,</hi> a Union to God by Faith and pious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, from which all truly ſpiritual and acceptable Acts proceed, ſo by the Law of Contraries, <hi>ſpiritual Death</hi> muſt needs include a real Separation from God, a real removal or privation of pious Habits, for ſo long as one has them, however clouded, weakned or out of Exerciſe, tho' he may be ſaid to be in a ſpiritual Sleep or Conſumption, yet he is ſtill alive.</p>
                  <p>NOW to ſuppoſe that the human <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſeparated from the divine Nature, as it is without Foundation in Scripture, ſo it deſtroys the infinite value of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of it to Juſtice, which depends upon that Union.</p>
                  <p>AND to ſuppoſe that the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was devoid of pious Principles or Habits, is to make him a SINNER realy and inherently, and thus to diſqualify him entirely from being a <hi>Saviour</hi> of others. The Reaſon is this, the moral Law being ſpiritual, in Regard of its <hi>Author, Nature</hi> and <hi>Deſign,</hi> and Perfect alſo, muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Purity in the Temper and Diſpoſition of the Soul, which cannot be without the aforeſaid Habits: Now if CHRIST wanted theſe, he was diſconformed to the Law, and ſo a <hi>Sinner</hi> realy and inherently, for Sin is any want of Conformity to, or Tranſgreſſion of the Law. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 4. He amartia eſtin, he anomia.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>IF ſo, CHRIST would want another MEDIATOR to ſave him, and therefore he was only made Sin by Imputation, being in the mean Time perſonally and inherently holy, harmleſs and undefiled, and knowing no Sin.</p>
                  <p>WHAT was defective in the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s human Nature,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:040518_0063_1015E96BDFDECC58"/>
in reſpect of the Species or Circumſtances of the Penalty threatned by the Law, was made up by its Union with the divine, and ſo rendered an equivalent to the demerit of Sin.</p>
                  <p>AND indeed in this Conſtitution, the Wiſdom of God appears admirably; for on the Suppoſition that <hi>Chriſt</hi> paid the Debt in Specie in all Circumſtances which the Law required, (were that poſſible) the Bond would be cancelled, and all thoſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented actually freed from the Curſe, at leaſt from the Time of the Payment made by the Surety, which Notion is as dangerous as abſurd.</p>
                  <p>BUT an EQUIVALENT puts it into the original <hi>Creditors</hi> Power whether he will accept of it at all, and when, and how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Benefits thereof to the Debtors.</p>
                  <p>AGREEABLE hereto the bleſſed God has, in unſpeakable Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs, ſo formed the Plan of the new Covenant, that none ſhall have any actual Title to, or Inveſtiture in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Purchaſe, until they be enabled to repent and believe.</p>
                  <p>THIS, rightly underſtood, entirely overſets the dangerous and inconſiſtent Doctrines of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> preſerves the Harmony of the Scriptures, and makes the Doctrines of Grace and Duties of Religion entirely conſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER Objection is this, How could God receive this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſince he himſelf was the Party that gave it? Or how could the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind, ſuppoſing him to be God, make Satisfaction to himſelf? The Anſwer is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>THAT the infinite Goodneſs of God in giving a Redeemer, does not diveſt him of the Office of ſupreme Judge, nor hinder him from receiving a <hi>Ranſom</hi> to preſerve the Rights of Juſtice inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To illuſtrate this Matter, we have an eminent Inſtance, not unlike it, in the Caſe of <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> the Prince of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> who paſſed a Law, that <hi>Adulterers</hi> ſhould looſe both their Eyes; and when his Son was convicted of that Crime, the People, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected him for his excellent Qualities, came and interceeded for him, <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> in a conflict between Zeal for Juſtice and Affection to his Son, took but one Eye from him, and parted with one of his own to ſatisfy the Law, and in this Action both paid and received the Puniſhment: He paid it as a Father, and received it as a Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator of publick Juſtice. In like Manner when guilty Mankind could not pay the Forfeiture of the Law, God, the Father of Mercies, was pleaſed to give it from the Treaſures of his Love, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Blood</hi> of his Son for our Ranſom; which he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the Supreme Judge received from <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs, and declared it <hi>to be an Offering of a ſweet ſmelling Savour to him,</hi> or a ſufficient Satisfaction to his Juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>NOR is it inconſiſtent with Reaſon, that the Son of God, clothed with our Nature, ſhould by Death make Satisfaction to the <hi>Deity,</hi> and therefore to himſelf. In a Difference between two Parties, a Perſon that belongs to one of them, may interpoſe for Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:040518_0064_1015E96D63FCD460"/>
provided he diveſts his own Intereſt, and leaves it with the Party from whom he comes. For Inſtance, when a Father and Son, both poſſeſſed of Imperial Power, have been offended by rebellious Subjects, it may not be improper for the Son to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> to reſtore them to the favour of their <hi>Prince,</hi> and yet at the ſame Time he reconciles them to himſelf, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures them the Pardon of an Offence whereby his own Majeſty was violated.</q> But the Time requires that I haſten to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
                  <p>HAS <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> been ſlain as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us? Then how vain, how uncomfortable and perilous is the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe who deny the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for hereby they endeavour to ſap the Foundations of the Chriſtian's Hope, and ſhut up the Springs of their Joy, hereby they oppoſe the continued Series of Revelation both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> To <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to <hi>Believers,</hi> is the <hi>ſame Thing</hi> in <hi>effect,</hi> as to deny his being <hi>ſacrificed</hi> for them, and equally <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> as has been before repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and if CHRIST has not died our Faith is vain, we are without Hope, Help, Comfort; but bleſſed be GOD, tho' the Doctrine of CHRIST crucified be to the <hi>Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the</hi> Greeks <hi>fooliſhneſs, yet to thoſe that believe, it is the Wiſdom of GOD, and the Power of GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAS <hi>Chriſt</hi> been ſet forth as a Sacrifice of <hi>Propitiation,</hi> then we may hence learn the Sinfulneſs of Sin and ſtrictneſs of divine Juſtice in the Puniſhment of it; its true, the Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> may be in ſome Meaſure diſcerned from its malignant Nature, being an Enmity againſt the bleſſed GOD, a Contrariety to, and diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reflexion upon all his adorable Attributes, as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Contempt of all the ſacred and unalianable Rights of his Government over the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> World.</p>
                  <p>BUT the moſt affecting Demonſtration of its Malignity appears in thoſe Puniſhments which are inflicted for it; the Torments of the <hi>Damned</hi> are, no doubt, equal to the Demerit, and therefore expreſſive of the great <hi>Evil</hi> of it: But they are too little thought upon and realiz'd by ſtupid, indolent Tranſgreſſors, until it be too late to obtain a Deliverance; and temporal Calamities cannot ſufficiently repreſent the infinite <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> of GOD againſt the obſtinate and ungrateful Contempt of his Goodneſs and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in the Sacrifice and Sufferings of CHRIST it is expreſſed to the utmoſt in the moſt ſtrong and flaming Colours. Had divine Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice rent the Heavens and appear'd on this Theatre, attended with the moſt terrible Images of Pomp and Majeſty, to puniſh the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Inſults caſt upon the Authority of GOD by impenitent Tranſgreſſors, it could not make a deeper and more abiding Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon our Minds, than the due Conſideration of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Lord JESUS: The drowning of the <hi>Old World</hi> by an awful Inundation of Water, and the dreadful Deſtruction of the Cities of the <hi>Plain</hi> by <hi>Showers of Fire,</hi> do not ſet the

Evil of <hi>Sin,</hi> and divine Severity in the Puniſhment of it in ſo ſtrong and ſtriking a Light; if we conſider not only the Depth of his Sufferings but the Dignity of his Perſon, and near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his eternal Father; he ſuffered not only <hi>Torments</hi> from Men many Ways, but his <hi>Father</hi>'s <hi>Wrath</hi> in a Degree equal to the Deſert of all the <hi>Sins</hi> of thoſe he repreſented; and the Perſon who endured theſe Things was the <hi>Son of GOD by Nature,</hi> and of co-equal Glory and Majeſty with his eternal Father. O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible is the Juſtice of GOD, that would not ſpare even his own innocent and beloved Son, when he became <hi>Surety</hi> for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</p>
                  <p>AND how then ſhall thoſe eſcape the angry Strokes of GOD'S <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I return to the</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Propos'd, Which was to enquire, <hi>who thoſe are that</hi> Sleep <hi>in</hi> JESUS. Previous to which I would obſerve, that <hi>Death</hi> is here compared to a <hi>Sleep,</hi> becauſe of the Analogy between them, eſpecially in the following Inſtances, namely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="unknown:040518_0069_1015E97A98BDD4F0"/>WHEN we <hi>Sleep</hi> our <hi>Senſes</hi> are <hi>bound up,</hi> ſo that we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what is done about us. And thus when we die, our Eyes are ſhut, our Eye ſtrings broken, ſo that we cannot behold what is done under the Sun.</p>
                  <p>WHEN we <hi>ſleep</hi> we are likewiſe <hi>unactive</hi> and cannot carry on the Buſineſs of Life. And thus in the <hi>Grave</hi> whither we all haſten, there is no Work nor Invention, and therefore we ſhould Work while the Day laſts.</p>
                  <p>FARTHER, <hi>Sleep</hi> gives <hi>reſt</hi> to the <hi>Body.</hi> And does not Death do ſo likewiſe? <hi>Job,</hi> ſpeaking of Death, ſayeth, <hi>I ſhould have lien ſtill and been quiet, I ſhould have ſlept, then had I been at reſt.</hi> In the Grave is a <hi>Reſt</hi> from labour and travail, a <hi>Reſt</hi> from trouble and oppreſſion, <hi>there the Wicked ceaſe from Troubling, and the Weary are at Reſt,</hi> a <hi>reſt</hi> from Sorrow and Suffering, no Sickneſs or Uneaſineſs ſhall afflict us there, and that which is indeed the beſt of all, there is a <hi>reſt</hi> from Sin and every Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to it!</p>
                  <p>AGAIN it may be obſerved, that <hi>Sleep</hi> is not <hi>perpetual,</hi> thoſe that Sleep for a while do awake at laſt. And thus thoſe that ſleep the ſleep of Death, ſhall awake and ariſe at the general Judgment. Hence the <hi>Grave</hi> is called a <hi>Bed,</hi> by the Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lvi. 2.</note> And hence the antient <hi>Fathers</hi> of the three firſt Centuries after CHRIST, called the <hi>burying Place</hi> a place of <hi>ſleep.</hi> Is it not upon this Account, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayeth, <note n="†" place="bottom">Proverbs xiv. 32.</note> that <hi>the righteous have Hope in their Death;</hi> there is Hope of their Reſurrection and happy State after Death, hope of ſeeing them at CHRIST'S com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge the World.</p>
                  <p>WE go to <hi>Sleep</hi> without diſtreſſing <hi>dread,</hi> nay ſometimes we earneſtly <hi>deſire</hi> it. And may not pious Perſons chearfully reſign themſelves to the Empire of Death, ſeeing the <hi>ſting</hi> of it is taken away, <hi>viz,</hi> the guilt of Sin? And do not ſome of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be <hi>diſſolved and to be with</hi> Chriſt <hi>which is far better?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW thoſe that <hi>ſleep</hi> in JESUS, are ſuch who have received him by <hi>Faith,</hi> have Communion in his Love, and conformity to his Law.</p>
                  <p>WHILE in a State of Nature we are ſeparated from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and muſt, in order to our vital union to him by Faith, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the Word and Spirit of God, of our guilty, dangerous and helpleſs Caſe, ſo as to be ſeriouſly affected with a view of it, and conſtrained to fly to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and embrace him as our <hi>Prophet, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>King</hi> without reſerve: When this is Real and Sincere, we are united to <hi>Jeſus</hi> in a ſaving Way; and, as a natural conſequent of this Union, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of divine Light, Love and Life are vouchſafed upon us, which transform us into the Image of God more and more in our inward governing Diſpoſitions; and encline us habitually to endeavour Conformity thereto in Practice. Thoſe that are in

                  <p>HERE it may not be improper to offer ſome general Hints concerning <hi>Death,</hi> which is doubtleſs a Diſſolution of the <hi>Union</hi> between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE ſacred Scriptures inform us, that <hi>Death</hi> came into the World by <hi>Sin,</hi> and is the <hi>Wages</hi> of it, and to this Teſtimony right Reaſon accords, for why ſhould a Puniſhment be inflicted without reſpect had to a previous Fault?</p>
                  <p>THAT which gives <hi>Death</hi> a very ſolemn Sound, is that it not only concludes the Projects, Labours, and Enjoyments of <hi>Life,</hi> but likewiſe brings the Seaſons and Means of <hi>Grace</hi> we enjoy to a final Period; we are then call'd to an account for our Stewardſhip, <hi>for we may be no longer Stewards. When Men's Breath goeth out, in that very Day their Thoughts periſh:</hi> All the Projects to ſecure a future temporal Good, which perhaps too much occupy'd and perplex'd their anxious labouring Minds, are ſuddenly broken and cruſhed by the Foot of <hi>Death,</hi> and they of Conſequence diſappointed of their fond Expectations!</p>

                  <p n="3">III.

                  <p>OUR Lord himſelf expreſsly aſſerts the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Dead in theſe memorable Words, <hi>Marvel not at this; for the Hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his Voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done Good, unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Life; and they that have done Evil, unto the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Damnation.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">John v. 28, 29.</note> It cannot be a ſpiritual Reſurrection or Converſion that is here intended, for then the Meaning would be that a Number ſhall be converted and born again in order to be damned, which is both falſe and abſurd, and contrary to what <hi>Chriſt</hi> has elſewhere declared! And therefore it is the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> that our Saviour aſſerts, for there are but theſe two Kinds of Reſurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> and of the <hi>Body.</hi> And hence <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſes to raiſe up his People at the laſt Day, who did before experience a ſpiritual Reſurrection or Converſion,<note n="†" place="bottom">John vi. 44.</note> and we are farther inform'd that GOD will <hi>ſwallow up Death in Victory.</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. xxv. 8.</note> It is but reaſonable and juſt, that thoſe <hi>Bodies</hi> which have been the Companions of the Soul in its Actions, ſhould be therewith rewarded according to them.</p>
                  <p>BUT the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the Dead, is, methinks, an unanſwerable Argument of our <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that he aroſe as a publick Perſon, as the Head of his Church, and promiſed that their Bodies ſhould be made like to his glorious Body.

                  <p>IT is true the Apoſtle ſays, that <hi>it is ſown a natural Body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual Body;</hi> yes, but ſtill he calls it a <hi>Body,</hi> and points to the ſame Body that was <hi>ſown</hi> or put into the <hi>Grave;</hi> and therefore muſt intend <hi>Matter</hi> however refind, or elſe he does not ſpeak good Senſe; but the latter is impious to imagine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the former is true.

                  <p>IN a Word, that <hi>ſpiritual Body,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, either has <hi>Matter,</hi> or it has not.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Caſe it not only follows, that every one will have two <hi>Souls,</hi> but that in order to the Formation of one of them, the Subſtance of the preſent Body muſt be reduced to nothing, for while it retains the Nature of a <hi>Body,</hi> it cannot be a <hi>Spirit;</hi> and if it be reduced to Nothing, how can it be ſaid to be turn'd into a Spirit?

And is it not more agreeable to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to conclude, that that Matter will be what was united to the <hi>Soul</hi> before, rather than Matter newly created, ſeeing there is no mention (in Scripture) of ſuch a new <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the general Judgment, nor is it conſiſtent with the divine <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to exert Almighty <hi>Power,</hi> in creating new Matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Neceſſity: Not to ſay that it is hard to reconcile the perpetual Puniſhment of Bodies newly created, without any Fault contracted by them to the common Maxims of Juſtice and Equity, which all Mankind do with one Voice acknowledge.</p>
                  <p>AND altho' ſinful and corruptible <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD,</hi> yet ſinleſs and incorruptible can; otherwiſe the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be excluded from a Place there, which is ſhocking to imagine!

                  <p>IT is true the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be,</hi> but bare Grain it may chance of Wheat, or ſome other Grain, <hi>but God giveth it a Body as it pleaſeth him, to every Seed its own Body.</hi> The true meaning of which is no more, than that God giveth to every Grain or Kind of Seed, ſuch a Body as is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Will, and a different Body according to the Nature of the Grain: Yet none can reaſonably deny, but that it is the <hi>Seed ſown</hi> which cometh up, tho' with a different Body in reſpect of ſome <hi>Qualities:</hi> When it is ſown, it is bare grain, but when it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain riſeth, it is not bare Grain, without either Stalk or Ear, which was the Body ſown; yet every particular <hi>Grain</hi> has its particular <hi>Body,</hi> and the ſame in <hi>Kind</hi> with itſelf, tho' different in <hi>Qualities.</hi> The Apoſtle's deſign in theſe <hi>Similitudes,</hi> is partly to ſhew the <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of a <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by obſerving, that <hi>that which is ſown is not quickned except it die;</hi> and partly to ſhew the <hi>Manner</hi> of it, in the different Qualities and Condition of <hi>Bodies</hi> after the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> to what they are at preſent; they are now <hi>mortal,</hi> but then they will be <hi>immortal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THE Doctrinal Propoſition I have been diſcourſing upon, eaſily applies itſelf to the preſent Occaſion, foraſmuch as there is Reaſon to hope, from the deceaſed Youths ſoundneſs in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Principles, acquaintance with experimental Religion, and blameleſs Converſation, that he ſlept in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> there is no Reaſon for his Relations indulging an exceſs of Grief, on Occaſion of his Departure from them to a better World. They ſhould rather ſpeak in the Language of <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>David, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good. The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away, bleſſed be the Name of the Lord.</hi> In the mean Time they ſhould be hereby excited to prepare for their own Change, by the earneſt Uſe of all appointed Means. When afflictive bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are conſcientiouſly improved, they become valuable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <hi>Hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> and behold Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah's Name wrote upon it. <hi>Deſpiſe not the chaſtning of the Lord, nor faint when ye are rebuked of him; for tho' no chaſtning for the preſent ſeemeth joyous, but grievous, nevertheleſs it yieldeth the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs unto them that are exerciſed thereby.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT to addreſs the Audience more generally. Seeing that thoſe who Sleep in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> are tranſlated to ſuch a bleſſed State, we ſhould enquire, whether we are in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> For ſurely none but ſuch who are in him in Life, can reaſonably expect to Sleep in him at Death. Have we received <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Faith?</hi> Have we had Communion in his Love? And are we conformed to his Law? Is <hi>Chriſt precious</hi> to us? Do we live to his <hi>Glory</hi> and upon his <hi>Offices?</hi> Do we love his People, and are we concerned for his <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Kingdom?</hi> Such as have experienced theſe Things, need not be afraid of <hi>Death,</hi> for it will be but as a refreſhing Sleep to them, a bleſſed <hi>inlet</hi> to a glorious Eternity. But ſuch as are deſtitute of the aforeſaid Characters, have great Reaſon to be afraid of Death, becauſe of the dreadful Conſequences of it to Chriſtleſs Souls. Is it not a dreadful Thing to be forever ſeparated from all the Sweets of Paradiſe, and to fall into the Hands of the living God?</p>
                  <p>DOES <hi>Death</hi> put a final period to all our temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Then ſhould we not labour to be weaned from them, and ſet our Affections on the Things that are above?</p>
                  <p>O BRETHREN! What Reaſon have ſuch dying Worms as we, who muſt be ſo ſoon reduced to Rotteneſs and Putrefaction, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040518_0081_1015E9970B724088"/>
who are liable to the ſtroke of Death every Moment, to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, watchful, and diligent in ſeeking and ſerving God?</p>
                  <p>THIS Inſtance of Mortality, calls aloud upon us all, to ſeek a vital Union to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpeedily and vehemently, that ſo when God-Man ſends his Meſſenger for us, we may ſweetly ſleep in him, and be at laſt brought in triumph with him to the general Judgement; To this End we ſhould confeſs and bewail our Offences, turn from them, and embrace the <hi>Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in particular, methinks, this <hi>Providence</hi> ſhould alarm <hi>young People,</hi> to <hi>remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth, while the evil Days are far off, when they ſhall ſay they have no Pleaſure in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O how amiable is <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>Youth!</hi> It is like Bloſſoms in the Spring, ſurely it is more likely that you ſhall find GOD in a way of Mercy in <hi>Youth,</hi> than afterwards, in caſe you ſeek him heartily; for your Hearts are now more tender and receptive of good Impreſſions, and GOD generally ſtrives more with ſuch, than others, <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me,</hi> ſaith the Almighty: But if ye give a deaf Ear to GOD'S gracious Calls by his Word and Providence, have ye not Reaſon to fear that his Spirit will ceaſe ſtriving with you, and that your Hearts will be judicially hardened!</p>
                  <p>SURELY the earlier ye turn to God, ye will have the clearer Evidence of your Sincerity, and the greater Opportunity of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſs to Mankind in general, and to your Relations in particular, upon whom the Example of your early Religion may have a bleſſed Effect, which may GOD grant, for CHRIST'S Sake.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Fathers and Brethren, the governing Paſſions of the human Soul, which are indeed the great Sources of Action, are <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear.</hi> Now the Religion of JESUS contains Arguments no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly adapted to influence both, which is indeed its peculiar Glory. Here are the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attractives to allure our <hi>love</hi> and ſtrike our <hi>ingenuity</hi> that ever were preſented to the human Mind. I mean redeeming Love and Goodneſs, the aſtoniſhing condeſcention of God himſelf in aſſuming our Nature, under the ruinous Circumſtances conſequent to our Apoſtacy, and therein enduring voluntarily and patiently, in his Name, Body and Soul, all that Contempt and Miſery which our Sins demerited, in order to reconcile us to GOD, and ſave us from Wrath and Ruin. O matchleſs Mercy! O amazing Goodneſs! O the intollerable, incomprehenſible and inxpreſſible Agonies and Pains our dear dear, Lord endured! One would think that the mentioning of this <hi>Love</hi> alone, was ſufficient to conſtrain Mankind to follow the <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s Standard, and to <hi>dare</hi> to be Holy. But ſad Experience proves the Contrary. Degenerate Mankind, while under the Dominion of Sin, are almoſt wholly loſt to all ſenſe of Ingenuity and Gratitude. Nothing truly Great and Noble has the habitual aſcendant in them. No! Immoderate Self-love is the ſecret Spring of all their Motions, and therefore it's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to alarm thoſe <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> Souls out of their fatal Security and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, by Arguments of <hi>Terror,</hi> that hereby they may be brought to a ſight and ſenſe of their Danger, and conſequently conſtrained to the earneſt Uſe of Means to obtain an eſcape.</p>
                  <p>THIS the primitive Miniſters of CHRIST were well aware of, as the Text I have choſen to diſcourſe upon informs us. They having had the Experience of the <hi>Terrors</hi> of God upon their own Minds, before their cloſure with JESUS, and having known their Neceſſity, Influence and Uſe, did labour by the ſame Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to be Holy, <hi>Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we perſwade Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND methinks among all the Arguments of <hi>Terror</hi> graſp'd in the ſacred Volumn, none is more affecting and awful than that of the <hi>General Judgment,</hi> and this is what our Text refers to, and is therefore the Subject of our preſent Meditations.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>General Judgment,</hi> my Brethren, is one of the moſt grand
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040518_0084_1015E99D8085E170"/>
and important Events that comes within the Compaſs of human Knowledge; the Conſideration whereof ſhould ſummons all our Powers to the moſt reverend and deep Attention.</p>
                  <p>THAT there is a JUDGMENT to come, appears from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subordination of Man to God, as a Creature to his Creator, a Subject to his Prince, and a Servant to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>FROM this <hi>Subordination,</hi> correſpondent Obligations do reſult: for the Neglect or Performance of which, it is but reaſonable they ſhould Account, and receive <hi>Rewards</hi> accordingly, otherwiſe the aforeſaid Relations and Obligations would be vain and to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>THERE are likewiſe natural Relations among Men, and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which give ground to ſeveral Duties of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> by the neglect of which others may ſuffer great Injury, of which they can ſometimes get no redreſs. Is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not then moſt juſt and reaſonable that ſuch Caſes ſhould be referred to the common Patron of RIGHT, in order to be ſuitably rewarded? This was the Apoſtle's Judgment in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he aſſures us, <hi>that it is a righteous Thing with God, to recompence Tribulation to thoſe that trouble his People, and to them who are troubled reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AND are there not many ſecret good and bad Diſpoſitions, which are not nor cannot be here awarded? Then is it not reaſonable that there ſhould be a Time when both ſhall be diſcloſed and obtain an anſwerable recompence?</p>
                  <p>THERE have been, and no doubt are in the World, ſuch Perſons who commit great Injuries, and yet no Juſtice can be got of them, either becauſe of their Policy, their Power, or Authority: Is it not neceſſary therefore that there ſhould be a ſupreme Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, before which ſuch grand, inſolent and ungovernable Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals ſhould be arraigned? Not to ſay that Conſcience accuſes for the moſt ſecret Crimes, and preſages a Judgment to come; yea the common Senſe of Mankind dictates the reaſonableneſs of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the Guilty. Does not every Perſon when he ſees ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther guilty of groſs Crimes, judge it unfit that he ſhould eſcape with Impunity? And will not the Mind be grated with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation or Grief by beholding the Inocent and Beneficent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering?</p>

                  <p>IF you enquire concerning the <hi>Judge,</hi> I anſwer, the abſolute Power of judging, inſeparably belongs to God the Father, he being our Creator, to his Judgment we ſtand obnoxious But the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> of this <hi>judicial</hi> Authority, is, for wiſe Purpoſes, committed to the Son.</p>

                  <p>AND ſurely, <hi>Sirs,</hi> it is but right that the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be veſted with a Power to reward his Friends, and cruſh his inveterate Enemies that ſo the apparent diſhonours of his Croſs may be forever rol'd away.</p>

                  <p>AS to the <hi>Manner</hi> of the judicial Proceſs, the ſacred Scriptures give us the following account hereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Time is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it, which is called <hi>a Day.</hi>

                  <p>AND ſhould not the Thoughts of the ſolemn judicial Scene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, excite all, both Miniſters and People to watchfulneſs and ſobriety, <hi>for we know not when the Son of Man cometh, at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</hi>

                  <p>LET us relieve Mens outward Wants as far as we have Ability and Opportunity: This, above all other Inſtances of Goodneſs, is particularized in the ſcriptural Deſcription we have of the <hi>General Judgment,</hi> I <hi>was Hungry and ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>O! let us forgive Injuries, <hi>he ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, who hath ſhewed no Mercy. If we forgive not Men their Treſpaſſes neither will God forgive ours.</hi>

                  <p>AND on the Contrary, dear Sirs, O let us labour to increaſe in that glorious Grace of LOVE, <hi>which hopes all Things, ſuffers long, and is kind, and is not eaſily provok'd.</hi> And let the Thoughts of the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi> deter us from Injuſtice, Covetouſneſs and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind and Behaviour. <hi>Let no Man go beyond and defraud his Neighbour, for God is the avenger of all ſuch.</hi> Seeing then that all theſe Things ſhall come to paſs, which the Scriptures

ſpeak of the laſt <hi>Judgment, what manner of Perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Conſideration of the <hi>laſt Judgment</hi> may ſerve to keep us from <hi>Infidelity,</hi> becauſe of the Confuſions and Injuſtice that are in the World, for this is but a ſhort Time of Trial; after the Concluſion of this Drama, all Things will be put to Rights and appear in their proper Colours. What tho' we endure unjuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives for a Time, God <hi>will bring forth the Righteouſneſs of his People as the Light, and their Judgment as the noon Day;</hi> and hence the Apoſtle obſerves, <hi>it was a ſmall Thing to him, to be judged of Man's Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW, <hi>Sirs,</hi> we ſhould be excited to examine our Sates, our Principles of Action, our Speeches and Works, and ſee whether they will ſtand the tryal of the <hi>laſt Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>METHINKS, dear Brethren, the Conſideration of the <hi>laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> may juſtly ſtrike <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Conſternation</hi> into every Tribe of Impenitents; if it be conſidered, that it ſhall be univerſal as to Perſons and Things, as well as impartial and irreverſible. God <hi>will bring to Judgment every Work, with every ſecret Thing;</hi> he will bring to light <hi>the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the Councils of the Heart,</hi> as I before obſerved.</p>
                  <p>THE moſt ſecret impious Thought muſt then be diſcloſed, and the moſt diſguiſed Contrivances brought to the open light of <hi>Day;</hi> and it is but reaſonable it ſhould be ſo, ſeeing the moral Good and Evil of Actions much depend upon their Intention. The Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is a <hi>diſcerner of the Thoughts, and ſearcher of the Heart,</hi> will, in the Day of his coming, examine and open the ſecret Springs of the Actions of Men; and then likewiſe ſhall their Words be ſcan'd and judg'd; and this is but reaſonable, ſeeing they are the moſt natural Indications of the Temper and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Mind, and often do much Injury to the Names, Bodies and Eſtates of Men. Our Lord aſſures us, <hi>that Men muſt give an Account of every idle Word in that Day, (Mat.</hi> xii. 36, 37.) <hi>and that by our Words we ſhall be juſtifyed, and by our Words we ſhall be condemned.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> informs us, that <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> propheſied of theſe Things ſaying, <hi>that the LORD ſhall come with with ten Thouſand of his Saints to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly Deeds and hard Speeches.</hi> How ſhall the <hi>lyar,</hi> the <hi>unjuſt Perſon,</hi> the <hi>whoremonger,</hi> the <hi>ſlanderer</hi> and <hi>back-biter</hi> then appear?</p>
                  <p>AND every evil Action muſt then be ſtript of all its preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and open'd in its horid deformity; yea and the Evils we have induced others to commit, we muſt then anſwer for. There a light ſhall be ſtruck into all the Works of Darkneſs, thro all the pretexts of Subtilty, and every impenitent Tranſgreſſor, with out Diſtinction, will be covered with Confuſion, and expos'd to contempt and ſcorn!</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Nimrords</hi> of the Earth, and all the Sons of Violence, of Blood and Rapine, that have ſacrificed the Lives of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040518_0088_1015E9A6F5D42AA8"/>
Thouſands to their Ambition and Avarice, and made Nations tremble before them, muſt ſtand appal'd before their Judge to receive their final Sentence: Then will they curſe the madneſs of their Arrogance, and <hi>cry to the Hills and Mountains to fall on them, and hide them from the Face of him that ſitteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</hi> All the human Race muſt appear at the dreadful Summons. The greateſt Potentates, the depeſt Politicians, the braveſt Heroes, as well as every Perſon of the meaneſt order, to receive their Doom, their final Doom! At that Tribunal there will be no difference or reſpect of Perſons obſerved between the greateſt Prince and meaneſt Peaſant. And that which makes the <hi>General Judgment</hi> the more ſolemn and dreadful, is that there will be no Appeal forever from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>WITH what awful Solemnity does the holy Scriptures repreſent the Scene of the laſt Judgement, then, we are told, that <hi>there will be diſtreſs of Nations, with perplexity, the Sea roaring and Men</hi>'s <hi>Hearts failing them for fear, that then the Sun ſhall be darkned and the Moon ſhall not give her Light, and all the Powers of Heaven be ſhaken;</hi> that the <hi>Archangel</hi>'s <hi>Trumpet ſhall ſound to the Extremities of the Earth, after which the Son of Man ſhall deſcend from the viſible Heavens in a Cloud, and appear in his own and in his Father</hi>'s <hi>Glory. Thouſands of Angels ſhall miniſter to him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſhall ſtand before him!</hi> The Son of GOD will come with Power and great Glory in flaming Fire, <hi>to take Vengeance on thoſe that know not GOD, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. Then the Sea ſhall give up her Dead, and Death and Hell ſhall deliver up their Dead,</hi> and the whole Atmoſphere be in one awful uniform Blaze! <hi>The Heavens ſhall paſs away with a great Noiſe and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth alſo and all its Works ſhall be burnt up!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THEN the Almighty Judge ſhall be ſeated upon his Saphire Throne from which the Earth and Heavens ſhall flee away.</p>
                  <p>WHEN our bleſſed Saviour came to ſuffer for the Sins of the World, he came in the Form of a Servant, and vail'd his Glory with a <hi>clayie Mantle;</hi> he ſtoop'd to aſſume the Infirmities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in the moſt humble Circumſtances, and was expoſed to Cruelty and Contempt: But when he comes as a Judge, he will aſſume his proper Greatneſs, and appear with a Splendor ſuitable to the Dignity of his Office, ſuitable to the Glory of his Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter! <hi>All Nature ſhall tremble before him, and the Foundations of the Hills ſhall ſhake becauſe he is Wroth!</hi> The Sars ſhall ſtart from their Orbs, and the Canopy of the viſible Heavens ſhall ſhrivel up into a flaming ſcroll, and the whole Earth ſhall be a burning trembling Globe of Fire. The great Redeemer will be cloth'd with Majeſty ſurpaſſing all Expreſſion, the Hair of his

When all theſe amazing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents are brought to paſs, and that in a ſudden and tremenduous Manner, how ſhall the Wicked appear; when the <hi>Curtain</hi> between both Worlds is drawn, and all the Inhabitants of Heaven, Earth, and Hell preſent themſelves to us at one View, how will it ſtrike the impenitent with Terror and Amazement, eſpecially when the final Sentence ſhall be pronounced, <hi>Go ye Curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fire, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To hear the Heavens roaring with dreadful Thunders, and the great Ocean bewailing the general Cataſtrophe, with the loudeſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs! To ſee the viſible Heavens cover'd with one ſheet of Fire, and ſending down burning Showers upon the reeling Earth! The ſulphurous Matter of which will doubtleſs catch fire and burſt its Bowels into burning Rivulets!

The whole Earth will be then like a burning <hi>Veſuvius</hi> or <hi>Aetna!</hi> Where will theſe poor Creatures fly for ſhelter who have no Friend in Heaven, or on Earth to help them in their Diſtreſs? What ſhame muſt cover their Faces? What Anguiſh rack their Hearts, when their ſecret Impieties are diſclos'd, before that vaſt Aſſembly of the Quick and Dead! How muſt a Sight of their Companions in Iniquity confound them and encreaſe their Woe and Horror? How ſhall ye be able to look the great Judge in the Face, whoſe Laws ye have broken, and whoſe Salvation ye have ſlighted?</p>
                  <p>O ſecure Sinners, your Eyes and Ears ſhall ſee and hear theſe Things! O what a ſcrole of Mourning and Lamentation and Woe ſhall then be opened before you?
