            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A JOURNAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MY honored father lived in Brookfield, in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, and engaged in the American army in the firſt year of the late war, at Roxbury, and died the ſame year, 1775.</p>
            <p>Being about the age of nineteen years, I enliſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Enſign JOHN TILLINGHAST, of Providence, ſo an expedition againſt the Indians in the year 1791. When the period arrived when I muſt quit my home, orders were received for a part of the ſoldiers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> twenty-eight in all, to embark on board a veſſel deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to convey us towards the Weſtern country, in which we went as far as New Brunſwick, under the command of Lieut. SHEARMAN. On our paſſage to New-Brunſwick we had bad weather, though we arrived there in ten days; we remained there about five days, and then being equiped with our guns and accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we marched towards Pittſburgh. The weather was exceeding hot, which made our journey very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious. We arrived at Pittſburgh ſometime in August; where Lieut. SHEARMAN religned and went home; and Enſign BALCH, of Boſton, took the command of the detachment, to Head-Quarters. We remained there about three weeks, and then we received orders to go down the Ohio River. The boats we went down in were of two inch plank of white oak; the length of them was about forty feet, and about ſixteen feet wide, and they rowed with four oars, and three men at each oar, and over the top of the boats there was a roof like the roof of a building, for a defence againſt the Indians firing from the ſhore; though one night we received ſeveral ſhot from them, but there was no man hurt; and ſo we continued our route night and day, until we arrived at FORT WASHINGTON, where we joined the main army. which conſiſted of about two thouſand men; and we remained there about two weeks. Then we received orders to match for the Miamis,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030135_0004_0FE49F08420E3308"/>
about twenty-five miles, and there make another halt, and build a fort, which is called Fort Hamilton, and the main army repaired to ſaid fort; but I was ordered another way, on command; firſt going twenty miles down the Ohio River, and then entered into another ſmall river called Big Miamis, that leads to Fort Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton. From thence we advanced about forty miles further; this command was under Enſign COBB, of Taunton, and Serjeant HOLLY, of Rhode-Iſland, and conſiſted of a corporal and twenty-four privates, which went to guard a boat load of proviſions round by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This boat drew about eighteen inches of water, but the river being lower than we were aware of, we were obliged to draw the boat by main ſtrength in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of fifty and an hundred yards at a time, in eight or ten inches of water, which cauſed us to be eight days on that paſſage. On the fifth day at night, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on the banks of the river, all except the boatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſaid they would ſleep under the banks of the river by the boat, which they did. We kept the guard on the bank of ſaid river for fear of the Indians; and juſt at day light one of the guard looked down the banks and cried out, there are Indians! he had no ſoonet ſpoke than the Indians fired at the boatmen under the bank of the river; and as the men roſe up, there was a ball ſtruck the buſhes about ſix inches off, above <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> heads; but as it happened there was no man hurt. We were all immediately alarmed. A ſmall party went in purſuit of them, and got ſight of the Indians, who were on horſes, and fired at them: on our firing at them they dropped their packs, and ſome ſkins, and ſeveral trifling things, which they had ſtole from the inhabitants the night before, which we got; one of the balls ſtruck an Indian on his rump, but his ſtooping forward on his horſe prevented his being much hurt, but cut his blanket from his rump to his ſhoulders; for after I was taken by the Indians, I ſound out that my maſter was there at that time, though I never dare let him know that I was in that party, but he often told me how nigh one of the Indians came being ſhot. The horſes they had ſtolen out of Judge Simmons's ſtable, about twelve miles below Fort Waſhington, and they were purſued ſo cloſe, and our firing open them gave them a fright, and they went ſeveral miles back on the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030135_0005_0FE49F0AD7148DD8"/>
ſame way they came, which gave the party a chance to come up with them, which they did, and purſued them ſo cloſe through the ſwamp that the inhabitants got their horſes again; but the Indians made their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and got off.</p>
            <p>We moved on our way with our boats, but the water being ſo low we made a very poor hand of getting along with it, though we went about nine miles that day; and at night we encamped upon as clear a place as we could find, for fear of the Indians coming upon us: and there was a guard of a ſerjeant and a corporal, and nine privates, and two ſentinels ſtood at ſome diſtance from the camp, to keep watch that no Indians came upon us unknown. But about ten o'clock in the evening, ſome Indians came creeping up to the fire, but the ſentinels fired upon them, which alarmed the whole party; we immediately brought water from the river and put out the fire, and every man took to a tree, and ſtood in that ſituation until morning. The Indians kept creeping round, and we exchanged ſeveral ſhot with them that night; but it being very dark there was no man hurt; and when it was day-light we went into our boat, and moved on our way, but we had not gone more than half a mile, when looking back we ſaw three Indians upon the ſhore where we had encamped, but being very much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued, we kept on our way and took no notice of them; and on that day about three o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we arrived at a ſmall garriſon called DUNLAP'S STATION, which was about ſixteen miles from the place of our deſtination, but we were obliged to leave our boat by reaſon of the lowneſs of the water.</p>
            <p>We remained there about two days, then we went through the buſh about ten miles, and came to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and there we remained until FORT HAMILTON was finiſhed, and then we received orders to march for the Maumee towns, leaving about forty men to keep the garriſon. The road we went we had to cut and clear as we travelled, day by day, which made our journey very tedious, for we could go but ſix or ſeven miles a day. We went on our march until we had got about forty-five miles, and then we built another fort, that is called FORT JEFFERSON; and alter we had been building ſaid fort about three days, I happened to be on the our-ſide
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030135_0006_0FE49F13F16E7AE0"/>
picket guard at night. The next morning there were three of the guard and myſelf, not having any duty to do, obtained liberty of our officers to go half a mile diſtance a hunting, being very ſcant of proviſions; and after we had paſſed the ſentinels, we parted, and agreed to take a ſmall circle and then to meet upon a plain, and I went to the right hand, and coming round a ſwamp in a blind foot path, a little diſtance from the plain, looking out for ſome game, not thinking of any danger, on coming into a thicket of bruſh, there roſe up three Indians, which you may think not a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me, I looked this way and that way for a place to run, but found it impracticable, for there were Indians on every ſide with their tomahawks over my head, ſo I ſaw that I might as well give up as to make any reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, dropping my firelock, and putting out my hand to ſhake with them, they ſhook hands with me, and bid me make haſte, and then they took me through a ſwamp upon a dry ridge, and ſat down for about an hour, and then went on again, and travelled until about twelve o'clock; then one of them gave a moſt hideous halloo, which made the woods ring again, and one of the Indians told me by and by I would ſee plenty of Indians, and in about half an hour one of them gave another halloo, and a quarter of a mile forward it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as though the woods were alive with Indians, and directly there came about twenty Indians running to meet us, ſome with knives and ſome with tomahawks, and painted ſo they looked more like ſo many evil ſpirits than any thing elſe. I thought then my life was ſhort, but they all came and ſhook hands with me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept three or four of them, who looked very ſurly at me, and two of them took hold of me and led me into a thick miry ſwamp, and came upon a little dry nole in the middle of the ſwamp, where they had had a fire about ſix days, watching the army; but no ſooner than I had got to the fire than one took off my hat, another my coat, and another my waiſtcoat, another my ſhoes, and one ſtript me of my ſhirt and gave me an old one in lieu of it, which was very dirty; they then brought me an Indian who could ſpeak Engliſh, and began to examine me to know what condition the army was in, I told them as good a ſtory as I could, as I ſaw they were upon the catch, I made as few words anſwer as I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030135_0007_0FE49F158317A810"/>
could; and after they had examined me as much as they thought proper, one of them went and brought me ſome roaſted veniſon, and a piece of bear's meat; and after I had eaten as much as I wanted, though I had not much appetite to eat, they aſked me if I could run faſt, I told them I could not; they then told me I muſt run or die immediately. Then they packed up their things and ſet out toward the Maumee town.</p>
            <p>When they firſt ſet out from the camp they ſpread themſelves every way, ſo that no man could know which way they went, and after they had gone about one mile that way, they came together again; and after they came together again the ſecond time, they gave me a pack of meal and ſome ſkins about the weight of a buſhel of corn; and then one Indian went forward, and they ſet me next, and the reſt of the Indians fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, hurrying me on, keeping me on the trot all the afternoon, until juſt night, then one of them told me to run, I told him I could not run, for I was very weary; I had no ſooner ſpoke than one of the Indians ſtruck me on the back of the head with the breech of his gun, which knocked me down to the ground, but I ſoon recovered and got up again, then I ſaw that I muſt run, though I was hardly able to walk, yet was obliged to run, and we went on that way until duſk of the evening. Then one of the Indians took me and lead me about half a mile from the path into a ſwamp, and the reſt of the Indians went with him, and went to making a fire; but my maſter took me and ſet down about two rods from the fire, and aſked me how I ſhould like to be tied, I told him I ſhould not like to be tied at all, but he ſaid I muſt be tied or may be I ſhould run away; then he took a parcel of cords, and tied me, he firſt tied my elbows behind me, and my hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward, and then drew a moggaſin over each hand, and tied them both together down to the waiſtband of my breeches, and then laid me on my back, and tied a cord round my neck, and another round my legs, and tied them faſt to a tree; and the Indians lay aſide me acroſs the cords. I lay in this condition until morning, and it may well be thought that I underwent a great deal that night, for I was tied in ſuch a manner that I could not ſtir hand nor foot, neither had I any thing to cover me but the heavens, for they never gave me ſo
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030135_0008_0FE49F1711CB4C40"/>
much as a blanket to put over me, though it ſnowed and rained; and in the morning when they untied me, I was ſo ſtiff with the cold I could not ſtand, but I rolled over the ground and rubbed myſelf awhile, and ſet by the fire, till I got ſo that I could go; then making themſelves ready, moved on their way to town again. When they had travelled about three or four miles they made a halt for about half an hour, then one of the Indians came and painted me black, and painted themſelves black likewiſe; but not knowing the meaning of being painted in ſuch a ſort, I thought it was done for their own diverſion. But they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately went on their way, until about ten o'clock in the forenoon, then making another ſtand, which had like to have been my laſt, they firſt ſpotted the trees around for ſome diſtance, and then made blacking of powder and marked the trees in all kinds of disfigured creatures. Then they came round and began to make a ſpeech, and the Indian that painted me, told me to get up. Now my maſter had gone in purſuit of a deer, and was not with the reſt of the company. In the mean time, while they were cutting their capers over me, my maſter came up and looked angry at them, and in a great rage, and made a long ſpeech to them, which ſeemed to diſpleaſe many of them, but they ſoon took up their packs and was for marching on. Now I was to have been tomahawked here, but I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it until after I was brought to the Maumee town; and my maſter coming up at that time, was the means of ſaving my life. But we had not gone far from this place, when the Indian that was the means of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my life told me to waſh off the black that was on my face, which he ſaid was no good, which I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately did, and then he painted my face red, which was a token that I was not to die. We went on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the day, and at night when we encamped, they bound me as they did before, which I thought was very hard uſage, to travel all day, and at night be bound in ſuch a manner. But on the third day, about four o'clock, we arrived at the Maumee town; but when we had got within about two miles of ſaid town, the Indians made a halt, and my maſter painted my face one half red and the other part black, and then tied a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030135_0009_0FE49F189FC19BB0"/>
large rope round my neck, which hung to my waiſt; then he took my pack from me, and one of the Indians that could ſpeak Engliſh told me by and by I ſhould come into town; and he farther ſaid, perhaps when you get into the town, ſome ſaucy boys will come out and ſtrike you, and if they do, you will ſee a long houſe, and you muſt run to that houſe and ſit down, and they will ſtrike you no more, which I found to be true: for when we had got within about half a mile of the town, one of the Indians gave a loud halloo, and it ſeemed as though the woods were alive with Indians for a mile round; and immediately the ſavages came running to meet us as thick as the ſquirrels in the woods, which I thought the moſt frightful ſight I ever beheld; but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly we came into the town, and as we paſſed the firſt camp there came out a young Indian warrior, and ſtruck me on the back of my neck, and I fell to the ground; and when I recovered on my knees, another gave me a kick, and kicked me on my face, and as ſoon as I got up another Indian caught me by the hand and ſaid run, run, you devil! and as I run he ſtruck me over the face and eyes; and when I had got within an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards of the long houſe which the Indian told me of the path on both ſides was paraded with Indians, as many as could ſtand; and as I run through, every one of them gave me a blow, ſome with their hand and ſome with a club, and others a kick with the foot, but every one would have a blow at me; ſo that when I got to the houſe, my face was as bloody as though I had dipped my head in blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other bruiſes all over my body. Juſt as I got to the door, and was going in, one of the Indians hit me on the ſide of the head and ſent me paſt the corner of the houſe; but I ſcrambled up again and went into the houſe, and as ſoon as I entered the door I met an old grey-headed chief, and ſhook hands with him, but I was ſo grieved with ſuch uſage, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain ſhedding tears, which I think almoſt every one would have done, but he ſaid you muſt not cry, for if you do the Indians will kill you; but I ſat down, and immediately they brought me a white man to examine me, which he did very cloſely, concerning the army, and what ſituation they were in, though I made my ſtory as ſhort as possible. And then they took him out
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030135_0010_0FE49F22190E1BB8"/>
and brought in another, to ſee whether I told one ſtory or not, and after they had re-examined me as much as they pleaſed, they went and brought me ſome of their bread made of pounded corn, and ſome hommany; and after I had eaten, they brought to me a little pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner boy that had been taken about two years before on the river called Monongahela, though he delighted more in the ways of the Savages than in the ways of Chriſtians; he uſed me worſe than any of the Indians, for he would tell me to do this, that and t' other, and if I did not do it, or made any reſiſtance, the Indians would threaten to kill me, and he would kick and cuff me about in ſuch a manner that I hardly dare to ſay my ſoul was my own, although I daily underwent the greateſt cruelty. Often times there would Indian ſtrangers come to viſit their tawny brethren, and the firſt ſalute they would give generally was to knock me down, and frequently to repeat their blows; and if I made any reſiſtance, or ſhewed reſentment before or after I got up, thoſe ſavage-like brutes would repeat the ſame treatment, with terrible additions. I was forced to ſubmit in ſilence to that uſage for the ſpace of a week.</p>
            <p>It being then about the time the Indians were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering to meet the American army for battle, there was a number of ſtrangers in the vicinity, and my mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter told me they would kill me, and took me from the long council-houſe to his wife's camp, although ſhe was gone to the hunting ground (which diſtance was about fifty miles) to winter; and the ſavages was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in this town for a general rendezvous, and remained here in number fifteen hundred, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, for one week, and then they all marched to meet Gen. St. Clair's army; and after thoſe Indians were gone, my maſter's ſon took me to their hunting ground, where his maſter and ſeveral young Indians were, where I had more of a dog's life than that of a chriſtian, for they would not allow me to ſleep in the camp with them; and if I made a hut by myſelf, the Indian boy would pull it away, as if it was only to wear and fatigue me, and if they thought I was offended at it, they did it with ſeeming more pleaſure, and I was obliged to ſubmit, and thro the protection of divine providence I was enabled to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030135_0011_0FE49F23A4E052A8"/>
In the beginning of winter thoſe ſavages lived only four or five days in a place, and would move eight or ten miles further at each move, and kept in continual motion until the ſnow was ſome depth; and by that time they had got one hundred and fifty miles from the town; at that time I had to build huts for five fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to cut wood and carry it ſome diſtance, becauſe they would not burn any but dry, &amp;c. I had a very ſhort allowance of proviſions, and being almoſt naked for the want of clothes, let the weather be wet or dry, hot or cold, I was kept at hard work of ſome kind or other, ſuch as dreſſing Deer-ſkins, or hunting Rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coons; and with ſavage ſhouts they would bid me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert myſelf, or I ſhould die. But the fatigues day and night was not all I ſuffered, for the Indian boys when I was aſleep, uſed frequently to put live coals at my feet, to divert themſelves in ſeeing me ſtart; and as I had no clothes to myſelf, I often lay very near the fire; one night a boy of the tawny breed drove me farther from the fire, but I told them that I would not lay back any further unleſs they would give me ſome covering, but their cruelty was further exerted in not giving me any thing to eat for two days afterwards; and ſome times I would get meat and lay it up in the camp, but the boys would frequently come in and give it to the dogs, on purpoſe to inſult me and put me to trouble; and one day there came one only into the camp where I fleat, took down my meat and gave it to the dog, looked me in the face and laughed. It offended me ſo much that I thought I might as well be tomahawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to live in torments and vexations, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately caught up a ſtick and ſtruck him over the head, and knocked him down, and almoſt ſtunned him; I was then certain there was not any poſſibility of ſaving my life, for he got up very quick and went to my maſter, and told him of the affair, and it proved well for me that he made additions to the ſtory. I went to a camp that belonged to an Indian trader, and told him what had happened, and deſired him to go and plead me off from being killed: but I had hardly told my ſtory, before I ſaw my maſter coming with his tomahawk in his hand, and ſeemed in a great rage, but the man went and met him, and deſired him to hear the other ſtory before he went any farther, which he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030135_0012_0FE49F2532AF4FB0"/>
complied with, and after he had heard the truth of the whole matter, and how he was always tormenting and fatiguing me, turned back and went his way, but never ſaid any thing of the affair to me afterwards. Soon after this affair happened, my maſter went a hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſeveral days, and when he came home he brought ſeveral ſtrangers with him, and they encamped but a ſmall diſtance from us, and at night my maſter told me to cut ſome wood for them, I replied that I was very hungry, for I had eat nothing that day, and he ſaw that I did not move ſo quick as I ought to have done, he called his ſon, and told him to bring his war club, at my hearing that, I caught bold of my leggings and maucaſins to put them on, but he came in a very great rage and violence with a war club in his hand, and ſtruck at me with great force, and would have killed me, but as I ſaw the blow a coming I knocked off the back part of the cabbin and eſcaped the blow, otherwiſe I ſhould have had my brains ſcattered through the camp; but I immediately got my tomahawk and went about three hundred yards from the camp, cut wood enough for them to burn that night; and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on my feet or legs, the cruſt of the ſnow being almoſt hard enough to bear me up, but breaking thro' nearly every ſtep being knee deep. Thus when I had done that ſmall taſk (as they called it) my feet and legs looked as if they had been cut and hacked with ſickles and croſſcut ſaws, the blood preſſing forth from each ghaſtly wound, from my knees to my toes; and when the ſavage-like brutes ſaw it, they laughed at me, and ſaid I had got a beautiful pair of ſtriped leggings on, which would make me reſt well, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They uſed to ſend me a hunting often times with the Indian boys, and ſometimes we ſhould be gone three or four days at a time; at night after I had made a fire for them, they would make me build another for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and one time in particular, that we were our, I ſuppoſed we were within forty miles of an American fort, and in the morning I came to the fire, as they lay aſleep, and took their tomahawks, and almoſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to kill them both, and make my eſcape unto the American fort; but I took the ſecond thought that the woods were full of Indians, and if they ſhould come acroſs my track, and follow me, they would have ten
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030135_0013_0FE49F26C3E0E798"/>
chances to catch me, where I had one to get clear of them; and I thought I ſhould have ſome opportunity of getting away without running ſuch a great riſk; ſo I concluded it was beſt to be as patient as I could, altho' I had the tomahawk up ſeveral times to drop it into their heads; but I forebore ſtriking.</p>
            <p>Not long after that, as one of the Indian boys was ſitting one day in the camp with me alone, he on ſide of the fire and I on the other, and having his bow in his hand, and a handful of wooden arrows, he would ſhoot them at me, and after many trials he ſhot one into my wrist, which bent the point againſt the bone, I caught hold of a ſtick about three inches thick and threw at him, and hit him on the ſide of his head, which knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him almoſt ſenſeleſs; but it happened to be when my maſter was gone, and he did not get home under three weeks after, and by that time it had all died away; for I never heard any thing more about it; although if my maſter had been at home I believe there would not have been any ſuch thing as ſaving my life; for I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to keep out of the way of the ſquaws for two days, or they would have tomahawked me themſelves.</p>
            <p>By this time of the year corn grew very ſcarce, and the meat was very poor, and but a little of it for my ſhare; ſometimes they would kill a raccoon, and my part of it would be the head without any thing to eat with it, that was my allowance for a day, and very often for two or three days, and nothing at all but what nuts I could find in the woods, and ſome other trifles, and about the middle of March, as ſome of the Indian boys were a hunting, they found a large black ſnake, that was drawn out of the water by a mink, and brought it to the camp, roaſted it with a ſquirrel, broke it up fine, and gave it to me to eat; but as ſoon as I found out what it was, I hove it down by the fire ſide, and when my miſtreſs perceived that, ſhe told me if I could not ear it, I ſhould not have any thing, and they never offered me any thing more for three days; but about that time there were ſeveral Indians going upon a ſcout towards the American frontiers, my maſter and all the Indians that belonged to our family, went with that party, and left me with my miſtreſs; but there were ſeveral other Indian camps, and ſome remaining Indians in the neighbourhood, who had orders to chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030135_0014_0FE49F3013DEBF08"/>
me if I ſhould be ſaucy to my miſtreſs; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in that place about a week, and ſome American Indians came within ten miles of us, and killed two or three families of the Delaware Indians, which put thoſe that I was with in ſuch a fright, that they fled to their towns, which was about one hundred and fifty miles, but the way we went it was two hundred miles, to keep out of ſight of ſome enemy Indians; the way being very bad that we went, our journey laſted three weeks, and all that time my miſtreſs never gave me one ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of any thing to eat, only what I could get in the woods, ſuch as ground nuts, and ſome other nuts, and having a pack to carry weighing ſixty or ſeventy pounds (that being my daily taſk) and frequently I could get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat for two days; ſometimes I ſhould get a pack of ground nuts, and my miſtreſs would take them all from me. One day I borrowed a gun of an Indian and went a hunting, to kill ſomething to eat, and by chance I ſound eight large black ſnakes ſunning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I killed and ſtrung them upon a ſtick, and carried them to the camp; my miſtreſs looking out imagined I had ſome black ſquirrels; I came into camp and threw down the ſnakes at the old ſquaws feet, which enraged her much, ſhe threw the tomahawk at me; the next thing that came to hand was a brand of fire, on which I was obliged to leave the camp, and did not come in again that day: but when the other Indians ſaw her, that knew of her giving me a roaſted ſnake to eat ſome days before, it pleaſed them very much, becauſe they ſaid I ſerved her tit for tat, or paid the old ſcore; in the evening ſhe called me, and aſked what I brought thoſe ſnakes to her for, I made reply that they were to pay her for the one ſhe gave me to eat, ſhe believing that I was even with her, let it drop, and it ſoon blew over, though I fared none worſe for proviſions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. When we arrived at the Maumee town, I was reſolved to make my eſcape from the Indians. We arrived at the town about the middle of the afternoon; and after I had made a camp for my miſtreſs, we not encamping on the ſide of the river the town was, I took a walk down the river to ſee if I could find a canoe to make my eſcape in, which I did, lying under the bank of the river, and in the evening about nine o'clock, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the old ſquaw had got aſleep, I got up and crept
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030135_0015_0FE49F31A04F3998"/>
away from the camp, and then had to go one quarter of a mile through thick buſhes to the river; it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly dark, and when I came there, the canoe was gone: I was obliged to make all the ſpeed I could to get back to the camp, for fear I ſhould be miſſed, and I had but juſt got to the fire, and laid down, before my miſtreſs called me to make up a fire; on the next morning there came a priſoner by the name of Morris Doyle, from over the river, and I went out to work and aſked him if he did not mean to try to make his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the Indians; he ſaid he did not know the woods, but if he could get any one to ſet off with him, he would go; I told him that I was reſolved to go that night, and he ſaid if we could get together he would go with me, and I aſked him how we ſhould get together; he ſaid his maſter had a very nice canoe, and oftentimes the Indians would come after they were gone to bed, to come over the river, and he had to get up and fetch them acroſs, and he ſaid I muſt come down when I thought the Indians were all aſleep and give an Indian halloo, and he would get up and come over the river with the canoe, and we would make the beſt of our way down the river, night and day, until we arrived at ſome chriſtian ſettlement; but it happened in my favour, my miſtreſs went over the river that day to ſee her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and when ſhe came back ſhe ſaid I muſt go over the river that night and ſtay there to clear land for corn: this pleaſed me very well, for I knew that I ſhould have a much better opportunity to make my eſcape from them, and after I had got over the river where I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work, I ſtaid there until about ſunſet, and then I aſked liberty of the Indian if I might go and ſee Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Doyle, I ſaid I had not ſeen him for a great while, and he told me I might, ſo I went to his camp, which was about a mile; when I came there he had juſt got over the river from work, I told him that he might make ready for a ſtart that night, for the ſooner we went the better; we could make our eſcape, for my maſter was gone out to war, and all the Indians that belonged to that family, and I did not think the other Indians would follow us ſo cloſe as my maſter; ſo we agreed to go that night, and as ſoon as it was dark I went out, as though I was going home, and lay in the bruſh, until the Indians were all aſleep, and then I came in very ſtill,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030135_0016_0FE49F332DA53DE0"/>
and awoke him, and we went down to the canoe, and when we came there we found no paddles in the canoe, and very poor poles, and the water was ſix and ſeven feet deep, and when we had gone down the river about half a mile, the Indian camps being very thick upon the banks of the river, they heard us going down, though it was ſo dark they could not ſee us, but there came an Indian down to the bank of the river, and called out three or four times, and aſked who was there; but we ſquat down in our canoe, and let the current carry us down paſt them, but we had not gone more than three miles before we were hailed again by the Indians; but we ſet down in the canoe until we drifted paſt the camp, and then we went about four miles, and there came an Indian out of his camp, and came down to the river with a brand of fire in his hand, and ſpoke in his own language, and aſked who was there, but we made no anſwer, but went on as faſt as we could; we went on for an hour and a half, and we ſaw ſome perſon going down by the ſide of us with a brand of fire in his hand; I then told Doyle that it was not ſafe for us to go any further in a canoe, for I believed that the Indian was going down to head us, ſo we run our canoe aſhore, and took to the land, and I went forward expecting that he was cloſe behind me until I had got as much as a mile, then I made a halt, and called him, but I could heal nothing of him; I ſaw that it would not do for me to tarry long, for I heard the Indian canoes after us; I went that night with all the ſpeed that I could make, although it was very ſlow, for it was exceeding dark, and about midnight it began to rain; ſome part of the way I went on the bank of the river, and the other part took to the woods, thick and thin, and went through ſwamps and thickets, ſometimes I would run, and very often was brought up with my legs againſt an old log, which would pitch me headforemoſt into the buſh for nearly a rod; and one time as I was a running, came to a gutter that run through from a pond, and the bank being almoſt ſtraight down about twelve feet deep, and it being very dark that I did not perceive it, and taking one large ſtep from top to bottom came headfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt into it in about four feet of water; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I made ſhift to force my way through. I believe any one muſt ſuppoſe that I was not a very little
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030135_0017_0FE49F34BB00F330"/>
frighted at that miſtep, but when I came to the bank on the other ſide, it being ſomething ſteep, I was very much troubled to get up, and falling back a number of times, but by good luck at laſt I got out; I travelled until daylight, and then went three miles back from the river into the woods, and came to a thick ſwamp, crept into a hallow log and lay there until evening, and then ſet out on my nocturnal rout; but faring very hard, and my being much bewildered, I did not know which way to ſteer, but I travelled about two hours, and could not find the river, then I was certain that I had got loſt; I then turned another courſe, and had not gone more than a mile before I came to a foot path, and then I did not know which way to go, but I happened to take the wrong way, and had not gone far before I met an Indian in the path; but I knew if I run I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be taken; and I thought perhaps if I could keep by him and ſay nothing, I might not be miſtruſted; but as I came near him he aſked me where I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I told him that I was hunting after a horſe, and had got loſt; he aſked me what my maſter's name was, I told him I did not know; but he was a Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware; then he aſked me if I thought I could find my camp alone; I told him that I expected that this path would lead to ſome camp that I knew. He ſaid there was a camp cloſe by us; then I told him that I would go there with him, and perhaps I ſhould know the way home from there; he ſaid he was a going there, then I believed I could not eſcape, as I could do no leſs than go with him, ſo I followed him to the camp, and when we came there, he aſked me if I knew the camp, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied no, I did not, but I would ſtay there until the next morning, and then I could find the way home; all this time he did not miſtruſt my running away from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, but when we came into the camp, he told them that I was loſt and wanted to ſleep there that night, ſo that I might find the way home in the morning; but in the mean time in came the infamous George Girty, the younger, and he knew me, and alſo that I had run away from the Indians, for they had been down to his camp that day after me; when he firſt came in he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at me, and ſpoke in the Indian language, and aſked them how I came there, they made anſwer that I was loſt, but Girty ſaid that I was a liar, for he ſaid there
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030135_0018_0FE49F3CD626F1B8"/>
were two that run away from the Indians, and I was one of them; for, he ſaid, the Indians was after us, and had left word with him to take me up if he could find me; then Girty aſked me if I did not run away from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, I told him I did not, he ſaid he believed I told a lie; they directly began to converſe together, to know what they ſhould do with me; Girty ſaid, that he would take me home with him, and the next day he would take me back to my maſter; all that while I ſet very well compoſed, as if I could not underſtand their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, although I knew if I could get over the river, I ſhould ſtand a very good chance to make my eſcape once more. The next day we ſet off to go to his camp, which was about ſix miles; he took very good care that I ſhould not go behind, for he put me forward, following on with a tomahawk in one hand, and his rifle piece in the other, and we went in that condition until we arrived at the river, and he called for a canoe, and we went acroſs, and ſoon came to his camp; but when we came there, his father and James Girty his brother, knew me, and ſeveral others of the Indians, and George Girty aſked me where I wiſhed to go; I told that I wanted to go where I could have better fare than I had among the Indians; he aſked me if they did not give me enough to eat? I told him, inſtead of giving me enough to eat, they gave me nothing at all. He aſked me if I was hungry, I told him that ſome victuals would be very kindly accepted, for I had not eat any thing for three weeks but what I could get in the woods; he told me if I would go and cut ſome wood and make a fire, I ſhould have ſomething to eat; it was then evening, and I cut ſome wood and made a fire. As I deſigned to make my eſcape the firſt opportunity, I ſat by the fire all night, and I made two or three attempts to get away, but the dogs would hear me, and make ſuch a barking that the ſavages would get up to ſee what the matter was; but early in the morning I heard them a whiſpering together to know what they ſhould do with me. The old ſquaws, and young Girty ſaid, they would carry me back that day to my maſter again. Hearing this, and not having any chance to get away, made me feel very down-hearted; and there was one George White-Eyes that could underſtand Engliſh—perceiving that I was ſomewhat troubled in mind,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030135_0019_0FE49F3F4A0B6940"/>
aſked me what the matter was, I told him that I heard them ſay that they would carry them back to my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but I told him I was reſolved not to go alive, for I knew they would put me to the torture in a moſt barbarous manner; and when he told them what I ſaid, they concluded to ſend word to the Indians that I was there, which they did, by ſending young Girty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. When he had been gone about half an hour, a little negro boy that belonged to James Girty, aſked me if I knew where young Girty was gone, I told him I did not, he ſaid that he heard them agree for me to be kept there all day, while they could give word to the Indians. When I heard this, I went to old George Girty, and aſked him where young Girty was gone, he ſaid he was gone after an horſe which was loſt. Then I was convinced there was evil determined againſt me. I then told him that it lay in his power to help me, and begged he would. He ſaid he thought I had better be contented to go back, for he did not think the Indians would hurt me. I told him he could not ſatisfy me with ſuch ſtories as that, for he knew better. He ſaid he could not aſſiſt me for fear of the Indians, for if they knew that he helped me, they would fall aboard of him; but he ſaid that I might go to James Girty, his brother, and perhaps he would aſſiſt me, which I did; and when I came to him he alſo told me he could not do any thing for me for fear the Indians would find it out and blame him. Then I aſsked him if I might not go over the river to one McDaniel's, that kept a ſtore on the other ſide, he ſaid I might go ſee him if I would come back again; I told him if he was afraid of my running away, he might ſend his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro boy with me, accordingly he did; but as ſoon as I got over the river, I told the boy to ſtand by the canoe 'till I run up to the houſe, and then I would come back again; but inſtead of going to the houſe I went into the woods about a mile, and crept under an old log, and lay there from ſunriſe until dark; then went to Mr. McDanie's and told him my condition, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his aſſiſtance; but he ſaid it was not in his power to help me; but if I had been there about two hours ſooner I might have had my paſſage into Detroit, for he had ſent two pettiaugers of packs to Detroit; but he could not aſſiſt me for fear of the Indians. I aſked

him if he could not help me to ſome proviſions, he ſaid he had none but what he bought of the Indians, and had not any on hand. Then I began to be almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged for fear of being taken; but by chance there was a priſoner who lived near by, who aſked me if I had not made my eſcape from the Indians, I told him that I had; he told me it was not ſafe for me to be there, for the Indians were hunting after me but a little while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; he adviſed me to go down the river that night; he gave me a paddle and ſhewed me a large pettiauger that I could go acroſs the river in to the ſide that the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage was, and there I would find a ſmall canoe, and to make the beſt of my way down the river; but when I got acroſs the river, and went paſt the town, I could find no canoe, except a birch canoe, and not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, I made out but poorly, and the wind blew very freſh up the river, ſo that it took me quite on the other ſide, hard by an Indian camp on the top of the bank, and the dogs made ſuch a barking that the Indians came out, but it was ſo dark they could not diſcover me, and as ſoon as they were ſtill I puſhed over to the other ſide of the river, and let my canoe drive, and made the beſt of my way by land; then I had about two miles to get paſt the Indians, and to add to my ſorrow, through thickets and over hedge fences, 'till I was almoſt torn to pieces; but after I had got about three or four miles paſt the Indian town, I heard two horſe bells at a little diſtance from the river, and went to them, and caught one, and took off the cords that his legs was tied together with, and made a halter of them, and put it on, and was juſt ready to mount when I heard the Indians a little diſtance forward, which obliged me to leave the horſe ſtanding, and make the beſt of my way on foot through ſwamps and pond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes. About twelve o'clock that night I came into a ſmall foot path, and I ſaw an Indian lay aſleep by the ſide of the road: previous to his laying down he had made him a fire, but it was almoſt out, except a ſmall coal which I happened to ſee, otherwiſe I ſhould have ſteped upon the Indian which when I ſaw gave me a ſtart: but I ſteping back ſoftly, and creeping by him, the Indian did not awake. So I went forward that night, until break of day. Then I went back into the woods about half a mile, and lay down and went to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030135_0021_0FE49F42697232F0"/>
ſleep 'till about ten o'clock in the morning, then I thought I would travel a little by day-light, and I went upon the ſhore, for the Indians were frequently paſſing and repaſſing in the road I went in. But after I had travelled about three miles on the ſhore, I ſaw an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian camp over the river, and they diſcovered me, and gave an Indian halloo, and I gave them another, and they hallood the ſecond time, and I again repeated the ſame, which made them miſtruſt I was not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, they likewiſe came down the river and got into their canoe and came after me; but the river being very wide, and the wind blew exceeding hard up the river, ſo that it drove them up ſtream ſome ways from me; for there was a long point made out into the river betwixt me, and where they had to go on ſhore, and as ſoon as they were paſt the point, I left the river and went into the woods about forty rods from the river's bank, and crept into a thick tree top that was laying down, where I hid my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; though I had not been there but a few minutes before the Indians came by looking after me, 'till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening, and then not finding me they returned back again; but I remained in this place until ſunſet. I ſuppoſed the Indians were all encampt for that day, ſo that there was no danger. I went on my way again. I had not gone but a few rods before I met three ſquaws, which gave me a ſtart, ſuppoſing there were Indians cloſe by, but as it happened, there was none to be ſeen. I travelled that night ſometimes on the run and then on the walk, ſometimes upon the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhore and then up in the buſh. My moggaſins were ſo worn out that my feet bled, but I made the beſt of my way 'till about the middle of the night, then I came where there was two large canoes loaded with ſkins, which belonged to the Indians that were encampt a ſmall diſtance from the river, and I went to the canoe to ſee if I could find any thing to eat, and found a bag full of Deers and Raccoons ſkull bones, for dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſkins; it being very dark, I took to be ſome bread, and when I had got my hands full, not trying to eat any 'till I had got ſome diſtance from them, and when I attempted to eat I found I was deceived, which vexed me very much, after I had taken ſo much pains to ſteal for my life a parcel of bones. But I made all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030135_0022_0FE49F4C02A4DD58"/>
the ſpeed I could to get away for fear of the Indians, and travelled 'till about an hour before day-light, and then I heard an Indian drum at a great diſtance off; then I began to be encouraged, for I ſuppoſed by the intelligence I had received, that I was not far from ſome chriſtian people. But when I had got down, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian town was upon the other ſide of the river, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept two or three camps, which were covered with flags, and ſtood on that ſide of the river, and I went to one of them and ſaw nobody except an old ſquaw and two ſmall children, ſo I made bold to go in and warm my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the fire, for I was very much fatigued and worn out, and chilled through with the cold, for it had hailed and rained all night, which made me very uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, being out in the ſtorm; and when I had ſet down by the fire about half an hour, the old ſquaw awoke, and made ſome movement, ſo I made the beſt of my way out of the camp, without being diſcovered. In the mean time it had got to be day light. Then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the river ſide. My mogaſins being quite worn out, and my feet ſo ſore and bloody, and body might eaſily tracked me on the ground; and when I had got down the river, about one mile, I came to a ſmall village of Indians, where there was a ſtore kept by a Frenchman, and as I paſſed by I ſaw the door partly open, and turning to go in, I ſaw the floor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with drunken Indians, and hearing one of them ſay in their language there is a white man; I turned and went round the houſe, and there I found a hog's-pen where the hogs had juſt crept out, and I crept into their place; but I had not been there long before the Indians came round the houſe, looking after me, but not finding me, they went in again; and directly a Frenchman came out of the houſe, and as ſoon as I ſaw him I preſented myſelf to him, and aſked him if he could not aſſiſt me, he ſaid he could not, for fear the Indians would find it out and kill him. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, he ſaid it was not ſafe for me to be there; for the Indians would ſoon be up an I likely to ſee me, and then it would be impoſſible for me to get clear; but he ſaid I muſt go ten miles further, and I ſhould come to an Engliſhman's houſe, where I ſhould be much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer than I was there; moreover, he ſaid I muſt be very quick in going, for the Indians would be up and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030135_0023_0FE49F4D9090B130"/>
after me, and it would not be poſſible for me to get away from them. I immediately went on ten miles, which I was about two hours in going, being very faint and tired, and my feet run with blood; and the firſt houſe I came to was a Mr. McCormic. My appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance at this time, may be ſuppoſed to be diſmal—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cloathing, almoſt ſtarved—and my beard and hair grown long and frightful.—When I came to the door and knocked, he bid me come in, and when he ſaw me in that frightful ſituation he was almoſt at his wits end, and cried out where the devil did you come from? I told him that I came out of the Indian country; he anſwered, what the devil brought you there; I ſaid it was my misfortune to get among them; he replied that there were a great many raſcals which he would be glad to have ſlaves to the Indians all their days. I thought then I might as well remained among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, as to have riſked my life thus far, and be ſo treated. I then aſked him if he knew any white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that lived near, he ſaid I would find them down the river. Then I bid him farewell, and went on my way down the river. I thought to myſelf it would be ſafe for me to keep round by the lake to Detroit, and not be ſeen any more as I could not tell a friend from a foe. And when I had gone on about half a mile down the river, walking along very ſlowly, and thinking to myſelf how I ſhould get by ſome Indian towns undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, that was on my way, I met a man by the name of Thomas Smith, an Indian ſtore-keeper; and as ſoon as he ſaw me he aſked me which way I was traveling, I made anſwer, where I could get quarters, though he knew by my appearance that I had made my eſcape from the Indians; he further enquired how far I had come, I told him from the Maumee town, which was an hundred and thirty-five miles from the camp: He then aſked me if I had any proviſions, I told him it was the fifth day ſince I had eat any thing but nuts; he invited me into his houſe, and ſaid he would help me to ſome, which I received very kindly; for truly he was the firſt friend I had found on my way. And when I had come in he gave me ſome victuals to eat, but I was ſo faint that a very little ſerved me. I had not been there more than an hour before the Indians came, is purſuit of me, and began to enquire after me; but
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030135_0024_0FE49F4F1D85D898"/>
Mr. Smith put me up in his chamber, and kept me hid there until his boat came from Detroit, then he put me on board and ſent me on my way thither. But on my way to ſaid Detroit, we had two or three Indian towns to paſs by, and the ſavages were appriſed of my running away, for they had the diſcription of me by the dreſs I had on when I came from them; but the boatmen gave me other clothes to put on, ſo that my garb appeared like that of a Frenchman; ſo I paſſed by undiſcovered, although we lay wind bound in an Indian town for ſome days.</p>
            <p>And ſo we arrived at Detroit, April 30, 1792.</p>
