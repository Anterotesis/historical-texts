            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>From the≈øe general reflections on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of our God, as we are now met to pay our la≈øt tribute of re≈øpect to the memory of the younge≈øt brother in our church, I ≈øhall attempt to addre≈øs you‚Äî</p>

            <p n="2">II. Name tho≈øe who are bound to give thanks unto the Lord for ≈øuch expre≈ø≈øions of his favour.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Illu≈øtrate the ≈øubject, by reciting to you ≈øome memoirs of the conver≈øion and experience of the youth whom God hath removed from us by death.

            <p n="1">I. By the <hi>conver≈øion of youth</hi> I do not mean that moral reformation which is frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a religious education; by cultivation

from pur≈øuing the round of arts; or, from the example of the be≈øt of men; although each of the≈øe is valuable, and highly to be e≈øteemed: Neither do I believe <hi>conver≈øion</hi> to be effected by the application of any external religious rite whatever; <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fle≈øh, nor of the will of man, but</hi> OF GOD. John i. 13. Mere civilized nature, is unregenerated nature ≈øtill. The conver≈øion of a ≈øinner is founded upon the regeneration of the ≈øoul by the God of all grace; a work which is perfect in its nature, and never fails to turn the ≈øinner out of him≈øelf, from all vain and ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous confidence, to the knowledge and ≈øen≈øible enjoyment of God through the cro≈øs of Je≈øus, i≈ø≈øuing in the glory of its Almighty Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed be the God and Father of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the re≈øurrection of Je≈øus Chri≈øt from the dead.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 3.

≈øee the kingdom of God.</hi> John iii. 3. The youth who is the ≈øubject of God's converting goodne≈øs, is quickened in his ≈øoul; turns from darkne≈øs to light, from the power of ≈øatan to the living God: he feels, hears, ≈øees, ta≈øtes, loves objects, the very rever≈øe with which he was conver≈øant before; and thus he differs from his former ≈øelf, in his approach before God, and as he is in his temper and conduct before mankind. It is nece≈ø≈øary for me to ≈øay, that this work of conver≈øion is not the mending or repairing of old corrupt nature, but is the free gift of <hi>a new heart,</hi> (Ezek. xxxvi. 26.) called <hi>the new man,</hi> (Col. iii. 10.) <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> (1 Peter iii. 4.) and which lives in con≈øtant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to the corrupt body of ≈øin, the fle≈øh lu≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again≈øt the ≈øpirit; and this ince≈ø≈øant conflict forms the chri≈øtian warfare till death ≈øhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever clo≈øe the ≈øcene. No man can lay claim to vital chri≈øtianity without knowing ≈øomething of this experience; and tho≈øe who really do ≈øo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimou≈øly confe≈øs, <hi>We are his workman≈øhip, created in Chri≈øt Je≈øus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ≈øhould walk in them.</hi> Eph. ii. 10. And although this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man≈øhip of grace may be oppo≈øed or ob≈øcured by ≈øin, by devils, or by men; yet, we may ≈øay, <hi>I

know that what≈øoever God doeth it ≈øhall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men ≈øhould fear before him,</hi> (Ecc. iii. 14.) el≈øe it would not be a good work of a good God! <hi>The Lord giveth grace and glory,</hi> (P≈øm. lxxxiv. 11.) and <hi>whom he ju≈øtifieth, them he al≈øo glorifieth.</hi> Rom. viii. 30. Happy youth, in who≈øe brea≈øt God hath begun this good work! Whenever our eyes behold ≈øuch, we may, with rapture, exclaim, in the ≈øpirit of our text‚Äî<hi>Prai≈øe ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may be more ≈øen≈øibly impre≈ø≈øed with the goodne≈øs of God in the conver≈øion of youth, let us‚Äî</p>

And a very little acquaintance with human nature will convince us, that <hi>childhood and youth are vanity.</hi> Ecc. xi. 10. The brea≈øt of youth is replete with the ≈øeeds of corruption; their pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions too often form fit fuel for the fire of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

Perhaps there never was a period when youths were more di≈ø≈øipated than the pre≈øent. Look around our city!

JOSIAH, born of king Amon, who was a wicked prince, did evil in the ≈øight of the Lord, e≈øtabli≈øhed idolatry in I≈ørael, and who≈øe court could by no means be thought favourable to cultivate piety in youth; yet, out of this black ≈øink of corruption God's goodne≈øs draws young <hi>Jo≈øiah.</hi> While in the eighth year of his age, while he was yet young, Jo≈øiah began to ≈øeek God; and, in his twelfth year, he ≈øo encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the vile idolatry of his nation, that he broke down their altars, burned their groves, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed their images, and e≈øtabli≈øhed the wor≈øhip of that gracious God, who had ≈øo di≈øtingui≈øhed him by his goodne≈øs in early life. 2 Kings xviii.

The pages of in≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration inform us, that <hi>angels de≈øire to look into the wonders of man's redemption,</hi> (1 Pet. i. 12.) that <hi>they are all mini≈øtering ≈øpirits ≈øent forth to mini≈øter to them who ≈øhall be heirs of ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> (Heb. i. 14.) and <hi>that there is joy in the pre≈øence of the angels of God over one ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that repenteth.</hi> Luke xv. 10. I therefore pre≈øume to believe, that as often as divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs converts a ≈øinner, young or old, the plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing event is immediately known in the courts above. Thus, all in heaven, as well as all the redeemed on earth, unite to prai≈øe the Lord for his goodne≈øs in the conver≈øion of youth! O that this occa≈øion may be the happy mean, by which God may grant a fre≈øh di≈øplay of his mercy, in converting unweary youth, and teach their hearts and lips to bear a part in prai≈øing redeeming love</p>

            <p>I THINK it my duty to write the dealings of God with my ≈øoul ever ≈øince I can remember, but not to be <hi>publi≈øhed</hi> while I live. I hope, by God's grace, to keep a <hi>Journal,</hi> that it may encourage me the more to look to him as my Lord and my God; and that I may ≈øee the many dangers I have been in, and the Lord's hand in conducting me through this wide wilderne≈øs.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt that I can remember of any thing, was at the death of my father; being, at that time, ≈øeven years old. I then often thought how could there be a God! I u≈øed to hear the mini≈øter ≈øay, "All men were ≈øinners, and God would puni≈øh them for their ≈øins." Still I thought that there was no God; that I ≈øhould not die, becau≈øe I was but a little child, and ≈øhould live to be a man; all children are good, and I am no ≈øinner. The≈øe thoughts, common to many children, attended me from month to month. As I grew older, I was more con≈øcious; I ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

forget the convictions I had at times when I went to bed, on reflecting what I had done the day pa≈øt, that I would not be ≈øo wicked, and that I would do better on the morrow; for I now began to think there was a God, and I knew I did offend him. My mother often told me there was a God, and the nece≈ø≈øity of his grace; but no ≈øooner was I out with boys, than all was forgotten; and, by the help of the wicked one, I was ru≈øhing head-long to de≈øtruction as fa≈øt as time could carry me. At ≈øchool, when twelve years old, I would feel the weight of ≈øin, and have tho≈øe ≈øerious reflections, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced tears from my eyes; and when the boys a≈øked me the cau≈øe of my weeping, I would ≈øay, I was ≈øick. My tutor frequently clo≈øed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs of the ≈øchool, on a Saturday, with a moral lecture from the ≈øcriptures, which, I mu≈øt own, was of great u≈øe to me, particularly on the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Jo≈øiah</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">Should the Author be ≈øpared, and Providence favour his wi≈øhes; he purpo≈øes to publi≈øh twelve of tho≈øe moral and entertaining Lectures, for the benefit of Youth.</note> and when he would tell us of the con≈øequence of ≈øwearing, gaming, lying, di≈øobedience to parents, Sabbath-breaking, &amp;c. &amp;c. it often cut me to the very heart; however,

the≈øe impre≈ø≈øions ≈øoon wore away. By certain dreams, and by the report of a comet having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, my convictions were increa≈øed, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan mo≈øt earne≈øtly to ≈øeek the Lord. I told my mind to one of my ≈øchool-fellows, and we both gave our≈øelves up to prayer and good conver≈øation, and our outward conduct was not as before, in roving and in breaking the Sabbath. If any two could have merited any thing of God by our works, ≈øurely we ≈øhould have done it; and we went on in this phari≈øaic way for ≈øome months. But the more I prayed and heard, the wor≈øe I grew; and I told my friend, that I could not tell what was the matter, nor what to do; 'till, at la≈øt, Providence was plea≈øed to direct my way to my tutor for advice; and, after ≈øeveral vi≈øits, I was enabled to lay my mind open to him, and thus, by inquiring of Zion's watchman, I have been directed to the gates of Zion with my face thitherward</p>

            <p>WHEN the Lord was fir≈øt plea≈øed to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my mind, I went under great di≈øtre≈øs, whether the Lord would hear my cries and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; for I thought that the Lord had kept me as the apple of his eye ≈øo many years, while I had been provoking his mo≈øt holy Maje≈øty, who, in ju≈øtice to me a ≈øinner, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned me to everla≈øting mi≈øery. If he had, it would have been ju≈øt; for I felt my≈øelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his law. My mind was ≈øo di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, that I was afraid to approach the throne of grace. I recollected many precious promi≈øes which I had heard and read; ≈øuch as, <hi>I love them that love me, and tho≈øe that ≈øeek me early ≈øhall find me.</hi> Prov. xviii. 7. <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wi≈øe co≈øt out</hi> John vi. 37. By the≈øe promi≈øes I was led to prayer, and all my heart's de≈øire was, none but Chri≈øt! none but Chri≈øt! He was all I wanted,

that he might clothe me with the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his righteou≈øne≈øs, for I felt I was naked, and could do nothing of my≈øelf without Chri≈øt. After this, the Lord enabled me to ≈øay, <hi>I have found him whom my ≈øoul loveth.</hi> Sol. Song ii. 4. This was he for whom I was ≈øeeking, and he was to me the pearl of great price!</p>
            <p>I once was much di≈øtre≈ø≈øed, whether I was in the right way of life or no; and it entered my mind, that I had heard people ≈øay, that ≈øome only fancied religion, and profe≈ø≈øed to be chri≈øtians, when they knew no more of its goodne≈øs than a dumb bea≈øt. I thought I al≈øo was only making a profe≈ø≈øion; but, how ≈øhould I know it? I went to prayer, ≈øelf-examination, and reading the ≈øcriptures. By the≈øe I found I was in the right way. When I came to con≈øider a little, I found that it never could be fancy that gave me ≈øuch a ≈øen≈øe of my guilty con≈øcience, nor in the power of man to make me feel what I did; the Lord it was, and glory be to his name<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
            </p>
            <p>By reading the ≈øcriptures, I found many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promi≈øes for poor guilty wretches to come to Chri≈øt, and to ca≈øt their burdens at the cro≈øs; for he ≈øaid, Matt. xi. 28 and 30. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036356_0033_10091E7C0F7D35C0"/>
and I will give you re≈øt. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart: and ye ≈øhall find re≈øt unto your ≈øouls. For my yoke is ea≈øy, and my burden is light.</hi> I≈øaiah i. 18, 19. gave me great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to pre≈øs forward: <hi>Come now, and let us rea≈øon together, ≈øaith the Lord: though your ≈øins be as ≈øcarlet, they ≈øhall be as white as ≈ønow; though they be red like crim≈øon, they ≈øhall be as wool.</hi> Precious promi≈øe this! It made me rejoice to think, that Chri≈øt gave ≈øuch an invitation to ≈øinners; and although my ≈øins were of a crim≈øon dye, I was led to ≈øee, that the Lord was able to pardon them, ≈øet me free, and give me to enjoy him for ever! One text which gave me encouragement to fly to Chri≈øt for refuge was, Rev. xxii. 17. <hi>The ≈øpirit and the bride ≈øay, Come. And let him that heareth ≈øay, Come. And let him that is a thir≈øt, Come. And who≈øoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> This promi≈øe was to me valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for I think that I had ≈øuch a de≈øire for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Chri≈øt, that nothing el≈øe in this world would have ≈øati≈øfied me.</p>
            <p>Some time after the≈øe enjoyments, I was brought very low on a bed of ≈øickne≈øs; a mo≈øt
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036356_0034_10091E7D9231A760"/>
painful di≈øorder; but all the pain to me was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for I felt the privilege of a father to go to. I often ≈øaid, the phy≈øician can do me no good‚Äînone but Chri≈øt! I could ≈øay with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ≈øhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</hi> P≈øm. xxiii. 4. I was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed in prayer; I felt happy in having a Chri≈øt to pray to; I enjoyed ≈øuch a nearne≈øs to him, that I often wi≈øhed to be with him; but I ≈øaid, not my will, but thine be done. Favoured with a vi≈øit from my tutor in this ≈øickne≈øs, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to read the 12th of I≈øaiah, and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ver≈øe. <hi>Behold God is my ≈øalvation, I will tru≈øt, and not be afraid, for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is my ≈øtrength and my ≈øong, he al≈øo is become my ≈øalvation.</hi> The≈øe very words were the de≈øire of my heart, and were my meditation day and night. I tru≈øted in him, and he was my ≈øtrength and my ≈øong. By this ≈øickne≈øs, I was led to ≈øee that the Lord could call me when he plea≈øed. There was one thing which made me to rejoice; it was, that I had fought the Lord when he called‚Äînot as Felix ≈øaid, "Go thy way; when I have a more convenient ≈øea≈øon, I will call for thee." Acts xxiv. 25. If I had
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036356_0035_10091E8008F03158"/>
≈øaid as Felix, I think I ≈øhould have been mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forever: but the Lord was plea≈øed that it ≈øhould not be ≈øo; he hath brought me thus far, and I can ≈øay with Abraham, <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped me.</hi> I have had many doubts and fears, whether I was the Lord's or no; but now I have an humble hope, through the blood of Je≈øus, that I have an intere≈øt in him; not for any worthine≈øs in me, but through his blood, which he ≈øhed for ≈øinners upon the cro≈øs; and thus I think, that the Lord has made a happy change in my ≈øoul through his grace. I hope, that while I live in this world of affliction, I may fulfil all his will which he hath revealed for his redeemed.</p>

            <p>LORD's-DAY: aro≈øe in the morning with the pre≈øence of the Lord, and was very happy in prayer, earne≈øtly de≈øiring a ble≈ø≈øing upon the day.

foot all places of idolatry, and building up the hou≈øe of the Lord. 2 Kings xviii. Hearing of the≈øe wonders of the Lord, made me to rejoice and ≈øay‚Äîwhy me! why me! Becau≈øe thou ha≈øt redeemed me, O Lord, my God! I felt nothing in me but what was contrary to him who loved me, and gave him≈øelf for me; but, of a truth, I de≈øired to be gathered to my grave in peace. At the ≈øupper of the Lord I found much nearne≈øs to him, and could rejoice and ble≈øs him for the rich provi≈øion he hath provided for his gue≈øt! O that I might live more honorably to my profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and ≈øtand more ≈øtedfa≈øt in the truth, that I may ≈øhow I am not of the world!</p>

               <hi>Dec.</hi> 18. The morning began with prayer, and ended ≈øo, yet with much coldne≈øs. O that I had ≈øpent my time better! I would rather be in the uttermo≈øt parts of the earth, than to live ≈øo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. I might have heard the word of God; but no, ≈øays ≈øatan; no, ≈øays my wicked heart, there is hearing enough‚Äîthe weather is cold‚Äî better ≈øtay at home. O my ≈øoul! where art thou? Going back into the world? Art thou ≈ølighting the wor≈øhip and the promi≈øes of thy God? God forbid! And may the God of all grace and glory grant, that I may not be left to

my≈øelf, to go where others go, and find no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort there! Thou who knowe≈øt my heart, and trie≈øt my reins, grant that I may enjoy thee more ≈øen≈øibly, and experience thy love more upon my heart, that, in this luke-warm ≈øtate of chri≈øtians, I may ≈øhine forth thy glory. Forbid, gracious God, that this year ≈øhould drop its curtain without a ble≈ø≈øing for me; ≈øooner let me cea≈øe to be, than to live without thy pre≈øence and ble≈ø≈øing upon me, and the church to which I belong!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 4, 1797. Enjoyed more of the pre≈øence of God the pa≈øt week than I have done for many weeks pa≈øt. How happy is it for a chri≈øtian to feel ≈øen≈øibly the all-≈øufficiency of Chri≈øt, who has cancelled <hi>all</hi> his guilt! O what a good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is he! He hateth putting away; he loves his people with an everla≈øting love; my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, my portion! He is ju≈øt ≈øuch a Saviour as I need; filthy as I am, he loveth me! Why? Becau≈øe he hath redeemed me. I felt mo≈øt ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly, at his table, how unworthy I was to eat of his <hi>bread,</hi> and to drink of his <hi>wine</hi>; but it was my privilege ≈øo to do. Keep me Lord, and I ≈øhall be kept.</p>
            <p>28th. Enjoyed but little comfort in Chri≈øt. I ≈øeem to have gone a≈øtray; but ≈øtill de≈øire to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036356_0039_10091E8AF59ADEB0"/>
find the path that leads to everla≈øting happine≈øs. O may the love of God be ≈øhed abroad in my heart by faith! On attending Mr. Warner's ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I enjoyed much ≈øatisfaction; it ≈øeemed as if the Lord was there indeed: may he grant that it may be the birth-place of many ≈øouls, and their numbers greatly increa≈øe!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 12. Enjoyed more comfort in hearing the word of God explained than for ≈øome time before; and I ble≈øs God that I can ≈øay, that I have not deceived my≈øelf, for the foundation is ≈øure, it is ≈øtronger than a rock. O how good is it, now and then, for the chri≈øtian to come at <hi>meal-time,</hi> like <hi>Ruth!</hi> Ruth ii. 14. Chri≈øt is ≈øolid food for the ≈øoul. May God grant that I may come often at meal-time! I have found it to be better than gold; it ≈øatisfieth the ≈øoul, and maketh it fat and flouri≈øhing. O that I could always be in the happy enjoyment of this! it is what my ≈øoul delighteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 1≈øt. The pa≈øt week I have experienced the ≈øevere≈øt trials I ever underwent, inward and outward. Well might Job ≈øay, <hi>Why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecuteth thou me, ≈øeeing the root of the matter is found in me.</hi> Job. xix. 28. A ≈øermon on the≈øe words from our mini≈øter ≈øuited my ca≈øe well. I ble≈øs God for the affliction, for its i≈ø≈øue
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036356_0040_10091E8DAFF90950"/>
was good; it led me to prayer every time I had a ≈øpare moment to go and pour out my complaint before him and pray, that the affliction may be always rather than not enjoy the divine pre≈øence; and I de≈øire to give God the glory, that it made my communion with Je≈øus the ≈øweeter. This Sabbath did not appear in vain; for I felt the love of God ≈øhed abroad in my heart. O that I might be always kept in ≈øuch an humble ≈øtate!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7th. Where am I? Yet out of hell! a ≈øpared monument of mercy. Where ha≈øt thou been wandering? Call to mind the pa≈øt week. How has my time been employed? Have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forgot the Lord, who <hi>loveth at all times!</hi> to forget him who never forgot me, even on the cro≈øs, when it would have been thought his pains were too great to think on me? Me! How then is it po≈ø≈øible I ≈øhould forget <hi>my Je≈øus!</hi> O, no! I would now come unto thee; I do feel the wickedne≈øs of my heart in departing from thee. Now, ble≈ø≈øed Je≈øus, make me nigh by thy blood! I determined not to enter the hou≈øe of the Lord until he had manife≈øted his love to me. I was going out; I entered my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet again, and there wre≈øtled with God for a ble≈ø≈øing, and that I might experience more hope and love in Chri≈øt's death; and before I got off

my knees, I felt my mind more compo≈øed, and I thought, that "praying breath ≈øhall not be ≈øpent in vain." In the evening ≈øervice, I felt much comfort indeed, and I think it is truly ≈øaid, <hi>and the king came in to ≈øee his gue≈øt.</hi> Matt. xxii. 11. I ≈øaw him whom my ≈øoul loveth; and I was very much affected in the admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's ≈øupper, to think he had done ≈øo much for me, and I love him ≈øo little, and deny him ≈øo often: I tru≈øt it was a time of love. Here, Lord, take my heart ju≈øt as it is; wa≈øh it in thy precious blood, and it ≈øhall be clean; and ≈øo let me walk in the world that I may prove thy <hi>young di≈øciple.</hi>

               <hi>July</hi> 23. How happy is my ≈øoul after having taken its repo≈øe in the bo≈øom of Je≈øus; how happy, no tongue can expre≈øs! Glory to God, that he hath called me by his grace! O how plea≈øant is it to walk in his ways, and to be kept as the apple of his eye! I feel ≈øen≈øibly for poor ≈øinners. O that I might, if it be God's will, be the means, through grace, of per≈øuading men of the <hi>terrors of the Lord!</hi> I have felt a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity for ≈øetting apart as much time as po≈ø≈øible for <hi>≈øtudy,</hi> that if the Lord ≈øhould be plea≈øed to call me to the <hi>mini≈øtry,</hi> that I may be a u≈øeful ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; that I might only preach <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and him crucified.</hi>

               <hi>March</hi> 18, 1798. On review of the week pa≈øt, I mu≈øt ≈øay that I have enjoyed much prayer, nor have I been ≈øo near to my God for two months part. O how good is it to be found in the Lord's ways! This afternoon, how ≈øweet the di≈øcour≈øe! and may God grant that it may be the means of bringing ≈øome ≈øoul <hi>to ≈øeek fir≈øt the kingdom of God and his righteou≈øne≈øs!</hi> Glory be to thee, O God, that thou ha≈øt taught me in any mea≈øure to ≈øeek thy face, and may many more ≈øeek thee in their youth!</p>
            <p>31≈øt. I felt my≈øelf very happy la≈øt week, in attending Mr. Warner's ≈øociety for prayer; and may God grant that all ≈øuch meetings may be ble≈ø≈øed for the e≈øtabli≈øhing many in the way! Many youths attend; the Lord bli≈øs them, and grant them many ≈øpiritual ble≈ø≈øings! This morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O how was my heart drawn out in prayer to Je≈øus for a ble≈ø≈øing upon my <hi>≈øoul,</hi> my <hi>mini≈øter,</hi> and the <hi>church!</hi> In approaching the table of the Lord, I realized the comfort and love there is in living near to God. Grant me grace to keep the vows I have made to te≈øtify my love to thee, by walking in thy ways, for thou Lord art my only hope and joy!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 16th. This morning I was more earne≈øt

in prayer than for the week pa≈øt, and I tru≈øt it was in faith, believing the Lord would ≈øend a ble≈ø≈øing to my ≈øoul, and give me ≈øtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øevere in his ways. The pa≈øt week has not been ≈øpent in ≈øo much meditation as I now could wi≈øh; yet, it is my mercy, <hi>my Lord</hi> is the ≈øame; and may I never be a≈øhamed to ≈øtand bold for the cau≈øe of my Lord and Ma≈øter! Lord ble≈øs the youth that come among us. Ha≈øt thou no heart to call? Why did≈øt thou teach me? Even becau≈øe thou woulde≈øt; then Lord do thou call ≈øome dear youth to thy≈øelf, and all the glory ≈øhall be thine!</p>

               <hi>May</hi> 12. Found much ≈øatisfaction in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>truth</hi> preached this day. O that I had an heart of gratitude to thee, O God, who art the only portion of my ≈øoul! Let me ≈øee my title clear to man≈øions in the ≈øky! I am <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner of hope,</hi> and thou ha≈øt taken me from the terrible pit and miry clay. Glory to thee for this rich grace towards me! This day was a good day to me, in writing the fir≈øt part of my life. O God, I would wi≈øh thee to chu≈øe my <hi>life</hi>‚Äîthe path‚Äîthe <hi>≈øituation</hi> in life‚Äîthe <hi>death</hi>‚Äî tru≈øting only in my Saviour's <hi>righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> for acceptance before thee.</p>

               <hi>July</hi> 29th. What mu≈øt I ≈øay? am I cold, or warm, or hot in religion? Have I lived the pa≈øt week as a chri≈øtian? Does not this day tell me I am out of the road or not? My ≈øoul, ha≈øt thou not often been engaged in private prayer on the Lord's-day, and felt thy dependance on God? Glory to God! there is one day in ≈øeven, which, by the aid of thy Spirit, I can bring to mind the pa≈øt week.</p>

               <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> 5th. Sen≈øibly I feel a craving de≈øire for the welfare of Zion, and to do her all the good I can. Lo≈øt ≈øome of the privileges the pa≈øt week, otherwi≈øe my mind has been much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed and happy in the enjoyment of my Lord. I could not forget that I was to meet him at his own table on the evening, Lord's-day; and now <hi>I have</hi> commemorated his dying love to me! <hi>Remember me! Remember me!</hi> This is my duty; and ≈øo far as I have been enabled, by his Spirit, I have remembered his dying words. O my ≈øoul! Realize what the Saviour hath done! Con≈øider the aggravations of thy ≈øins, which cau≈øed thy Saviour's ≈øorrow: his tears, his groans, and his burden! I felt happy at the table in having ≈øuch a Chri≈øt to go to.</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:036356_0045_10091E9A1872E170"/>On Friday, September 14th, when the pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence raged in this city, CHARLES HAZZARD made a vi≈øit to his pious aunt at York-town, near Peek's-kill. On the Saturday evening he was remarkably cheerful, and told his aunt, that he propo≈øed to ≈øpend the next day, being Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in private, for meditation and prayer; but, before the morning light, he was violently ≈øeized by the fever, and de≈øired to have little ≈øaid to him, but to enjoy his meditations. His aunt, anxious to know the ≈øtate of his ≈øoul, a≈øked him certain que≈øtions; to which he replied, "I am compo≈øed and re≈øigned, and the Lord is too good to me!" His di≈øorder grew ≈øo violently malignant, and created that inten≈øe ≈øtupor, that he was unable to ≈øay any thing more, or give any token of his ≈øtate of mind, and ≈øhortly put a period to his mortal life, aged eighteen years and ≈øix months.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>FROM the papers of CHARLES HAZZARD, now read, you who are acquainted with the ≈øcriptures, and with the power of God in the conver≈øion of man, are to form your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the reality of his per≈øonal religion, and the hope of his now po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing eternal bli≈øs. It is not my province, neither is it my wi≈øh, "to canonize the dead;" yet, from my per≈øonal knowledge of the youth, I pre≈øume, in chri≈øtian charity, to believe there was hope in his end. It ≈øen≈øibly impre≈ø≈øes my brea≈øt, that God ≈øhould have pre≈øerved my life, as a ≈øhattered tree in the garden of the church ≈øo many years, and amid≈øt ≈øo many ≈øevere ≈øtorms of affliction, while many youths of grace within the circle of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, who≈øe branches were covered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>≈ø≈øoms, and who≈øe fruit, in all probability, might have proved a rich benefit to ≈øociety, ≈øhould be cut down by death before my eyes! <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ≈øeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:036356_0047_10091E9FF1604A10"/>I feel a ≈øecret joy, that ≈øuch of my young friends were pre≈øerved, by the arm of my God, from falling into the ≈øtrong tide of corruption and error, making ≈øhipwreck of faith, and of a good con≈øcience, as thou≈øands of others have done; but were ble≈ø≈øed with <hi>an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance into the everla≈øting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the ≈øatisfaction derived from peru≈øing the diary of CHARLES HAZZARD, you mu≈øt be convinced of the propriety of tho≈øe who fear God, keeping memorials of his goodne≈øs to them in the ≈øeveral vici≈ø≈øitudes of their journey through life. This is one way, by which, <hi>in the ages to come, God ≈øhews the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne≈øs towards them through Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</hi> Eph. ii. 7. The advantages of this practice are great to our≈øelves and to others. <hi>As in water face an≈øwereth to face, ≈øo the heart of man to man.</hi> Prov. xxvii. 19. And, in a diary, reading ≈øuch a diver≈øity of thoughts, temptations, ≈øufferings, hopes, fears, plea≈øures, pains, expre≈ø≈øed by tho≈øe whom we believe to be the ≈øubjects of redeeming mercy, we are led to examine our≈øelves, derive comfort from a ≈øimilarity of ca≈øe, and thus, <hi>though faint,

yet pur≈øuing.</hi> Should your lives be prolonged to old age, you will find that ≈øuch a Journal will form a volume, in your own e≈øtimation, next in value to the Bible; and the peru≈øal of it will enable you, with Mo≈øes, to <hi>remember all the way in which the Lord your God led you in this wilderne≈øs, to prove you.</hi> Deut. viii. 2. I cannot, therefore, too much urge you, who are ≈øubjects of God's goodne≈øs in early life, to copy after your departed young friend, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daily or weekly exerci≈øe of your hearts in your walk with God. The u≈øual pleas again≈øt it are, a barrenne≈øs of mind, great depravity of heart, many mi≈øcarriages in life, little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; and, were you to write, it would di≈øtre≈øs your own mind to read it; and ≈øhould it fall into other hands, they mu≈øt needs judge unfavourably of you: but let me tell you, if your hearts are right with God, if you de≈øire to perfect holine≈øs in his fear, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and happily with him, your recording the≈øe evils will tend to humble you in the du≈øt, ≈øerve as beacons, or way-marks, to your future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and lead you to admire the exceeding riches of God's ≈øparing, pardoning goodne≈øs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. If you wait until you are free from

irregular thoughts, ri≈øing corruptions, fiery temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and enjoy only the ≈øweet uninterrupted vi≈øion of the Lamb, your diary would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different to any I have hitherto ≈øeen or heard of; and, in my opinion, ≈øuch perfect ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øedne≈øs is the portion of tho≈øe only who have dropt their mortal clay, are free from ≈øin, out of the reach of Satan's fiery darts, and landed ≈øafe in immortal bli≈øs! Still, as it is the chri≈øtian's privilege <hi>to walk in the light of God's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> P≈øm. lxxxix. 15. and, now and then, to ≈øet under the ≈øhadow of the tree of life, ≈øhake its branches by faith, and <hi>find its fruit ≈øweet unto their ta≈øte,</hi> Sol.
