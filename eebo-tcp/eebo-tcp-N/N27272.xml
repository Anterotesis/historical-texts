            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I HAVE choſen theſe words, as they are ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the laſt accents of our departed young brother, C. HAZZARD, and as they equally aſſiſt me with a deſirable ſubject for my preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good</hi> is a term applied, in our text, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to us ſome idea of the underived, ſelf-exiſtent excellence of JEHOVAH; conſtituting his infinite bleſſedneſs, and forming the never-failing ſpring of happineſs to all in heaven, and to all on earth. Who can eſtimate the providential goodneſs of our GOD to men?—<hi>The whole earth is full of his goodneſs.</hi> Pſm. xxxiii. 5.—Like the rays of the meridian ſun, it diffuſes natural light and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036356_0005_10091E35CA4BCDA0"/>
bleſſedneſs to every part of humanity. The air we breathe, the food we eat, the raiment we wear; every perſonal and ſocial enjoyment flows from the hand of our beneficent Creator! "<hi>Thou crowneſt the year with thy goodneſs; and thy paths drop fatneſs. They drop upon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the wilderneſs; and the little hills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice on every ſide. The paſtures are clothed with flocks; the vallies alſo are covered over with corn: they ſhout for joy, they alſo ſing.</hi>" Pſm. lxv. But how great are "<hi>the riches of God's goodneſs</hi>" in the REDEMPTION of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, wretched man, through the ineſtimably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious PERSON, RIGHTEOUSNESS, ATONE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, and INTERCESSION of JESUS CHRIST, who, in his DIVINITY, is co-equal, in eſſential and underived <hi>goodneſs,</hi> with the FATHER;— in his HUMANITY, is the excellence of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature as firſt formed in Paradiſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>very good,</hi>—and is alſo the MESSIAH, the CHANNEL through which all ſpiritual good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, grace, mercy, and glory flow to periſhing man!—<hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which covers all our crimes; regenerates our depraved nature; ſupplies us in all the exigencies of our life, and ſhall make us victorious in the territories of death;—it ſhall turn a final period to all our evils, and crown
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036356_0006_10091E374CE5B648"/>
us with felicity, as eternal and unchangeable as its own nature. <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works to the children of men!</hi> Pſm. cvii.</p>
            <p>From theſe general reflections on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our God, as we are now met to pay our laſt tribute of reſpect to the memory of the youngeſt brother in our church, I ſhall attempt to addreſs you—</p>
            <p n="1">I. On the goodneſs of God in the converſion of youth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Name thoſe who are bound to give thanks unto the Lord for ſuch expreſſions of his favour.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Illuſtrate the ſubject, by reciting to you ſome memoirs of the converſion and experience of the youth whom God hath removed from us by death. May my preſent effort be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch a communication of God's ſpecial goodneſs, that vain youth may remember their Creator; and, each advanced to mature age, may praiſe the Lord for thoſe inſtances of Divine beneficence, which, in cloſe ſucceſſion, have followed us through all our fleeting days!</p>
            <p n="1">I. By the <hi>converſion of youth</hi> I do not mean that moral reformation which is frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a religious education; by cultivation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036356_0007_10091E39C9330AA0"/>
from purſuing the round of arts; or, from the example of the beſt of men; although each of theſe is valuable, and highly to be eſteemed: Neither do I believe <hi>converſion</hi> to be effected by the application of any external religious rite whatever; <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but</hi> OF GOD. John i. 13. Mere civilized nature, is unregenerated nature ſtill. The converſion of a ſinner is founded upon the regeneration of the ſoul by the God of all grace; a work which is perfect in its nature, and never fails to turn the ſinner out of himſelf, from all vain and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous confidence, to the knowledge and ſenſible enjoyment of God through the croſs of Jeſus, iſſuing in the glory of its Almighty Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 3. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of converſion ariſes from the carnal mind being enmity againſt God; the ſoul, dead in ſin, having no hope, and without God in the world, and, of courſe, incompetent to enjoy an holy God in bliſsful eternity. Therefore our Lord hath ſaid, <hi>except a man be born again he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036356_0008_10091E3B947219B0"/>
ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> John iii. 3. The youth who is the ſubject of God's converting goodneſs, is quickened in his ſoul; turns from darkneſs to light, from the power of ſatan to the living God: he feels, hears, ſees, taſtes, loves objects, the very reverſe with which he was converſant before; and thus he differs from his former ſelf, in his approach before God, and as he is in his temper and conduct before mankind. It is neceſſary for me to ſay, that this work of converſion is not the mending or repairing of old corrupt nature, but is the free gift of <hi>a new heart,</hi> (Ezek. xxxvi. 26.) called <hi>the new man,</hi> (Col. iii. 10.) <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> (1 Peter iii. 4.) and which lives in conſtant op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the corrupt body of ſin, the fleſh luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the ſpirit; and this inceſſant conflict forms the chriſtian warfare till death ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cloſe the ſcene. No man can lay claim to vital chriſtianity without knowing ſomething of this experience; and thoſe who really do ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly confeſs, <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> Eph. ii. 10. And although this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of grace may be oppoſed or obſcured by ſin, by devils, or by men; yet, we may ſay, <hi>I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036356_0009_10091E3EF2EE2D70"/>
know that whatſoever God doeth it ſhall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men ſhould fear before him,</hi> (Ecc. iii. 14.) elſe it would not be a good work of a good God! <hi>The Lord giveth grace and glory,</hi> (Pſm. lxxxiv. 11.) and <hi>whom he juſtifieth, them he alſo glorifieth.</hi> Rom. viii. 30. Happy youth, in whoſe breaſt God hath begun this good work! Whenever our eyes behold ſuch, we may, with rapture, exclaim, in the ſpirit of our text—<hi>Praiſe ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may be more ſenſibly impreſſed with the goodneſs of God in the converſion of youth, let us—</p>
            <p n="1">1. Bring more fully to our recollection the condition of man in his fallen ſtate, as accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn by the pencil of truth in the ſacred ſcriptures. <hi>The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.</hi> Gen. viii. 21. <hi>He goeth aſtray from the womb, ſpeaking lies.</hi> Pſm. lviii. 3. And a very little acquaintance with human nature will convince us, that <hi>childhood and youth are vanity.</hi> Ecc. xi. 10. The breaſt of youth is replete with the ſeeds of corruption; their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions too often form fit fuel for the fire of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036356_0010_10091E425CA7CCD8"/>
ſeldom failing to produce extreme ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in old age. Suffer me to ſay, my young friends, the caſe, more or leſs, is your own;— theſe ſcriptures form your picture, drawn by your Creator's hand, whether you perceive your likeneſs or not. O that God may be gracious to you this day; open your underſtanding to know yourſelves, that you may ſeek for happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone in his pardoning goodneſs! Perhaps there never was a period when youths were more diſſipated than the preſent. Look around our city! How many young perſons, inſtead of purſuing the paths of virtue, roll in luxury, and ruſh into every avenue to vice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though dwarfs in general knowledge, they not only turn their backs with cool indifference upon the public worſhip of God,<note n="*" place="bottom">I have been converſant with the riſing generation for many years, and in different climes, and I have generally remarked, that a wilful neglect of the <hi>Lord's Day</hi> has been the avenue to unnumbered vices. The day, by them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for worſhip, has been a ſnare to unite them with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated companions; and inſenſibly to create in them the baneful habits of indolence, pride, and extravagance: theſe never failing to bring on thoſe diſhoneſt practices which are the diſgrace of youth, the grief of their connections, and the injury of ſociety. Many brought to public ruin, have, to my knowledge, dated their calamities from this evil. What then ſhall be ſaid of thoſe parents, and maſters of apprentices, who not only indulge their youth in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> but ſet them the fatal example? To me, that perſon who ſets looſe by the LORD's DAY, gives little proof of his veneration of the LORD OF THE DAY, let him call himſelf a Chriſtian of whatever denomination he may.</note> but grow ſomewhat
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036356_0011_10091E43DE97C980"/>
like champions in the cauſe of infidelity. In ſuch a ſtate how many live! and in ſuch a ſtate, alas! how many have been cut down by the late peſtilence, as Job expreſſes it, <hi>while their bones were full of the ſins of their youth!</hi> Job xx. 11. That God ſhould ſtop ſuch thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs youths in their career of ſin; pluck them as brands from the burning; ſave them from going down to the pit of deſtruction, and crown them with his ſmiles, is certainly an high expreſſion of <hi>the riches of his goodneſs,</hi> (Rom. ii. 4.) and fails not to make the moſt delightful impreſſion upon every pious mind! O how highly honored are ſome, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to God's glory and ſervice in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of youth, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſes upon ſo very few, whoſe grey hairs bend them to the tomb. Some ſuch inſtance of God's converting youth are left on record in the BIBLE, to perpetuate the memorial of God's goodneſs, and

to encourage the tender breaſt who pants for the Saviour's love. JOSIAH, born of king Amon, who was a wicked prince, did evil in the ſight of the Lord, eſtabliſhed idolatry in Iſrael, and whoſe court could by no means be thought favourable to cultivate piety in youth; yet, out of this black ſink of corruption God's goodneſs draws young <hi>Joſiah.</hi> While in the eighth year of his age, while he was yet young, Joſiah began to ſeek God; and, in his twelfth year, he ſo encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the vile idolatry of his nation, that he broke down their altars, burned their groves, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their images, and eſtabliſhed the worſhip of that gracious God, who had ſo diſtinguiſhed him by his goodneſs in early life. 2 Kings xviii. SAUL of TARSUS, a tent maker, yet of a liberal education, received at the feet of Gamaliel, when a young man, was exceedingly mad with rage againſt Chriſt and his followers; and, to feaſt his eyes on dying Stephen, he took charge of the murderer's clothes, while they perpetrated the horrid deed. Acts vii. 58. Yet this young man was not too far off for grace to bring nigh; and of him was formed one of the moſt noble champions in the cauſe of God; eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>all things but dung and droſs for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his

Lord.</hi> Such aſtoniſhing changes doth God's converting goodneſs produce in the ſoul of man, whether young or old.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By penetrating the breaſt of the pious youth, we ſhall find that rich aſſemblage of ſpiritual excellence which ennobles the ſoul, and far her magnifies the exceeding riches of God's goodneſs in his converſion. In converſion God leaves not the youth as he found him. The goodneſs of the Lord is communicative; <hi>my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be ſatisfied with my goodneſs, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Jer. xxxi. 14. The youthful breaſt, once the ſeat of reigning corruption, unbelief, luſt, pride, malice, and every abomination which is offenſive to God, injurious to ſociety, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to drown the ſoul in perdition, is now, by the regenerating grace of God, <hi>full of goodneſs.</hi> Rom. xv. 14. Faith, truth, hope, love, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy, peace, benevolence—every ſacred fruit he derives from Chriſt, worthy of God, beneficial to ſociety, and moſt admirably gratifying to his own ſoul! every ſpiritual bleſſing, in its nature and tendency, forming an abſolute contraſt to his native depravity! His pleaſures are rational, ſpiritual, divine, ennobling the ſoul, and raiſing it from its ſinful, fallen ſtate. A conſciouſneſs of the divine preſence, as his FATHER; his union
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036356_0014_10091E4C8FBA88F8"/>
with CHRIST, in the grandeur of his perſon, in the completeneſs of his ſalvation, and in the treaſures of his grace: theſe form the ſolid baſis on which his happineſs is founded, ariſing ſtill higher and ſublime, as he advances to the verge of an endleſs ſtate. The poſſeſſion of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prompts his ſoul in ſecret and in public communion with God, in the meditation of his heart, and in the exerciſes of his lips. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the proſperity of ZION creates rapture in his breaſt; and to ſpend one day in her courts, is to him infinitely better than a thouſand elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The LAW of his Saviour is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him than an abundance of gold and ſilver; regulating his thoughts and actions in every department of life. In his purſuit after KNOWLEDGE, grace ennobles the ſubjects of SCIENCE; inceſſantly enriching his mind with the moſt exalted ideas of the majeſty of God in his works of providence and redemption. Thus, his ſtudies being <hi>after Chriſt,</hi> inſtead of the ſtudent being ſpoiled through philoſophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and after the rudiments of the world, he is rendered more virtuous in himſelf, and more beneficial to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Col. ii. 8. If the ſentiment of Ovid be juſt, that
<q>to have learned the liberal arts
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036356_0015_10091E4E12682498"/>
thoroughly, ſoftens the manners, and operates as an excellent corrector of ill-nature, envy, and anger,</q>
we may certainly ſay this, and infinitely more, of the converted youth, who, through the goodneſs of God, hallows ſcience at the foot of the croſs! Such, with inconceivable pleaſure, may exclaim with Milton—
<q>
                  <l>—How charming I divine philoſophy!</l>
                  <l>Not harſh, and crabbed, as dull fools ſuppoſe,</l>
                  <l>But muſical, as is Apollo's lute,</l>
                  <l>And a perpetual feaſt of nectard ſweets,</l>
                  <l>Where no crude ſurfeit reigns.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The magnanimity of the converted youth to combat the ILLS of life, on principles of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honor, is a farther proof of God's good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards him. According to his years, his juvenile experience may not be very extenſive; yet, he learns ſomething of human nature from <hi>the plague of his own heart,</hi> (1. Kings viii. 38.)—more from obſervations on the calamities of thoſe around him—greater ſtill from the BIBLE, which not only informs him that <hi>man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upward,</hi> (Job v. 7) but preſents him with a general hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of affliction in its variety of ſources, proceſs and periods, as incident to the righteous and to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036356_0016_10091E4F980BAF78"/>
the wicked. This knowledge aſſiſts the youth to realize the path he may be deſigned to tread; and while too many others, ariſing into public life, place their expectations for ſucceſs on the merit of their parents, the promiſes of their friends, or on their own acquirement, he learns, <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, then to put any confidence in man.</hi> Pſm. cxviii. 8. That Saviour who hath delivered his ſoul from death, he firmly believes will preſerve his feet from falling, that he may walk before God in the light of the living. Pſm. lvi. 13. And he far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concludes, that as God hath graciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his ſoul unto himſelf, and hath promiſed an eternal weight of glory beyond the vale of death, ſo he will certainly take charge of him through time, ſupply his wants out of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his goodneſs, and make every ill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his real advantage. Rom. viii. 28. From this rational, ſpiritual eſtimate, he ſets off on the arduous journey of life. Happy youth! O that our eyes beheld many ſuch in this day of vanity! Come, ye youths, fond of truſting in uncertain riches, and whoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is placed upon your boſom friends, learn the uncertainty of each, and taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious! Your poſſeſſions may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036356_0017_10089634C91D09D0"/>
fail, your friends may forſake you, your life may fade as ſudden as <hi>Hazzard</hi>'s, at the very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your day. Seek ſubſtantial happineſs alone in that Saviour who is <hi>a friend that ſticketh cloſer than a brother</hi>; and who, for your encouragement, hath ſaid, <hi>thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Prov. viii. 17.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The laſt inſtance I ſhall name in which the goodneſs of God appears in the converſion of youth, is a capacity and an opportunity to GLORIFY GOD, which is ſeldom poſſeſſed by decrepid age. In early life the memory is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, the imagination lively, and the animal ſpirits more vigorous, and leſs clogged with cares, than at advanced age; and when theſe powers are employed on celeſtial objects, they appear in their true luſtre, and iſſue in the manifeſtation of the glory of the Lord!

Now alſo, when I am old and grey-headed, O God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me not, until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</hi> Pſm. lxxi. 17, 18. Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy's knowledge of God and the ſcriptures, from his youth, enabled him to ſhine as a ſtar among the Churches of Chriſt. 2. Tim. iii. 15. Paul, the converted youth, lived to be <hi>Paul the aged</hi>; (Philem. ix.) and the ſervices of his life ſhow the goodneſs of God towards him, the opportunities he had of glorifying God, and of being uſeful to thouſands. Indulging reflections on the dangers of God's goodneſs in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of youth, I have frequently thought they were, probably, to ripen the ſoul for immediate tranſmiſſion to glory; which has been the caſe with an infinite number of converted youth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides our young brother Hazzard—Or, a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to ſhow the all ſufficiency of <hi>grace,</hi> in ſupporting the ſoul under a long life of ſuffering, as thoſe in the parable of the labourers called at the third hour, bore the heat and burden of the day, and honored their maſter by a ſucceſſion of ſervices—Or, that the perſon converted in early life ſhould, from the fountain of his own

experience, be rendered particularly uſeful to the riſing generation; which has been the employ of many whom God hath early called to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful work of the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Thus, whether we reflect on the converſion of youth from the corrupt maſs of nature—the ſublime treaſures of grace communicated to his ſoul—his boldneſs to combat the ills of life—or his opportunity to honor God and promote the welfare of his fellow creatures,—in each, in all of them, THE GOODNESS OF GOD ſhines with admirable luſtre, and demands our moſt exalted praiſe!</p>
            <p n="2">II. To name thoſe PERSONS who are more immediately bound to give thanks for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of youth, was to form the next part of my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Of theſe, you will undoubtedly expect me to name their PARENTS. For parents, as the fruit of their own bodies, to deliver a child into the world, whether for good or ill, proſperity or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, honor or diſhonor, heaven or hell, is of infinitely greater moment than is generally conſidered. Senſible parents, however, look with the moſt tender compaſſion upon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, believing them to be ſubjects of depravity and guilt, <hi>ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> and <hi>conceived in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036356_0020_10091E5AA14DD160"/>
ſin</hi>; conſequently they need pardoning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting grace from the Author of their being, without which their final end cannot be peace: for the Lord, therefore, to meet the children of ſuch parents, to mark them as his own, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them with his ſmiles, muſt afford them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely higher pleaſures than an ability to beſtow upon them the wealth of nations, and calls forth their grateful praiſe to God, for the greatneſs of his goodneſs. <hi>A fooliſh ſon is a grief to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bitterneſs to her that bear him; but whoſe loveth wiſdom, rejoiceth his father.</hi> Prov. xvii. 25. xxix. 3. Such pleaſures, the widow of the late Alderman HAZZARD enjoyed, when the Lord converted the ſoul of her ſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, and enabled him to chooſe the path of truth. This mitigated the ſorrows of her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood, and aided her aged ſteps down the hill of life; and, probably, ſhe had anticipated her <hi>Charles</hi>'s gentle hand ſhould wipe away her laſt cold tear in death! But, alas! her ſky is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; the prop on which ſhe leaned is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; her ſon, in the zenith of his bloom, is arreſted by the putrid hand of peſtilence, and now moulders in the duſt! Weep, ye fond pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents! weep for her who, having ſat many a dark year forlorn, now mourns like Nain's widow,

the loſs of her only ſon! Luke vii. 13. Yet, ſhe ſorrows not as thoſe that have no hope; though parental tears bedew the turfed grave, her heart, with ſecret joy, adores the Lord, who gave and had a right to take away. Enough, her ſon ſleeps in Jeſus and though removed from her preſence to expire at a diſtant village,<note n="*" place="bottom">York-town, near Peekſkill.</note> her ſinking nature is relieved by the gladſome news—</p>

            <p>YOUTHS, who are the happy ſubjects of God's converting goodneſs, are alive to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the ſame grace they behold conferred upon others, and need little invitation to praiſe the Lord. Connections formed in early life are generally laſting, and frequently yield inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible benefits; but when ſuch union is founded upon a mutual enjoyment of the love of Chriſt, it yields additional ſweets. The pious youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices to ſee <hi>any</hi> enriched with converting grace; but when this favour is beſtowed upon thoſe with whom he walked the paths of education, or to whom he ſtands related by ties of nature, theſe give an higher reliſh to chriſtian fellowſhip,

and bind their ſouls in heavenly chains, which neither time, ſorrow, diſtance, nor death can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtroy.

Probably there are ſome young perſons preſent who were in chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian intimacy with our departed young brother, and with whom you received your early educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You rejoiced at his converſion;—his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſurrender of himſelf to God is yet in your remembrance;—his regular attendance on the worſhip of God was your example and your pleaſure; and the very ſolemn manner in which he ſat in tears at the table of his Lord, has left an abiding impreſſion upon your ſouls. To part with him ſo early; for him to be carried away by the putrid ſtream of peſtilence, at the very period when he was ariſing into uſefulneſs; muſt create painful ſenſations in your breaſt. Let us, however, learn ſubmiſſion. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved

far away from thoſe ſins and ſnares to which you are left expoſed; and now he reſts ſecure beneath his Saviour's ſmiles, and drinks large draughts of bliſs from the fountain head! You, too, may ſoon paſs the vale of death. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the departure of your young companion, as a ſtimulus to urge your way in the paths of God; maintain your profeſſion with honor, ſeek more earneſtly a Saviour's precious love, guard more firmly againſt youthful follies, and keep your heaven in view!</p>

            <p>If parents, and pious youth, are bound to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the divine goodneſs for early converſion, the MINISTERS and CHURCHES of Chriſt are
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036356_0024_10091E64CFA3F7A0"/>
infinitely more ſo; for they are, or ought to be, more immediately concerned for the ſalvation of men, and for the growing empire of the King of Grace. It is confeſſed, that the hopes of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a very conſiderable degree, are built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the riſing generation; and, in proportion to their virtues and acquiſitions, its proſperity is preſerved and increaſed. Infinitely more ſo, the viſible church of Chriſt look to converted youth for a ſucceſſion of members; nor can they poſſeſs greater evidence of the Lord being in the midſt of them, than by the effuſions of his Spirit upon their ſons and their daughters. Theſe converted youths are hoped to bear the ark of the cauſe of God, and to ſpread the banner of his truth, when our heads recline upon the lap of earth. It was for this that David ſo patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally addreſſed Solomon his ſon; and Paul ſo importunately wrote to his beloved Timothy. And for this it is that Zion pleads the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that moſt ineſtimable promiſe: <hi>Inſtead of thy fathers ſhall be thy children, whom thou mayeſt make princes in all the earth; therefore ſhall the people praiſe thee for ever and ever.</hi> Pſm. xlv. 16, 17.

            <p>If Miniſters and Churches unite in praiſing God for his goodneſs in the converſion of youth, why ſhould we think ANGELS to be ſilent on ſuch memorable occaſions?

I therefore preſume to believe, that as often as divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs converts a ſinner, young or old, the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing event is immediately known in the courts above. Thus, all in heaven, as well as all the redeemed on earth, unite to praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs in the converſion of youth!

            <p>I THINK it my duty to write the dealings of God with my ſoul ever ſince I can remember, but not to be <hi>publiſhed</hi> while I live. I hope, by God's grace, to keep a <hi>Journal,</hi> that it may encourage me the more to look to him as my Lord and my God; and that I may ſee the many dangers I have been in, and the Lord's hand in conducting me through this wide wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>The firſt that I can remember of any thing, was at the death of my father; being, at that time, ſeven years old. I then often thought how could there be a God! I uſed to hear the miniſter ſay, "All men were ſinners, and God would puniſh them for their ſins." Still I thought that there was no God; that I ſhould not die, becauſe I was but a little child, and ſhould live to be a man; all children are good, and I am no ſinner. Theſe thoughts, common to many children, attended me from month to month. As I grew older, I was more conſcious; I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

forget the convictions I had at times when I went to bed, on reflecting what I had done the day paſt, that I would not be ſo wicked, and that I would do better on the morrow; for I now began to think there was a God, and I knew I did offend him. My mother often told me there was a God, and the neceſſity of his grace; but no ſooner was I out with boys, than all was forgotten; and, by the help of the wicked one, I was ruſhing head-long to deſtruction as faſt as time could carry me. At ſchool, when twelve years old, I would feel the weight of ſin, and have thoſe ſerious reflections, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced tears from my eyes; and when the boys aſked me the cauſe of my weeping, I would ſay, I was ſick. My tutor frequently cloſed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the ſchool, on a Saturday, with a moral lecture from the ſcriptures, which, I muſt own, was of great uſe to me, particularly on the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Joſiah</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">Should the Author be ſpared, and Providence favour his wiſhes; he purpoſes to publiſh twelve of thoſe moral and entertaining Lectures, for the benefit of Youth.</note> and when he would tell us of the conſequence of ſwearing, gaming, lying, diſobedience to parents, Sabbath-breaking, &amp;c. &amp;c. it often cut me to the very heart; however,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036356_0030_10091E7489DBCDC0"/>
theſe impreſſions ſoon wore away. By certain dreams, and by the report of a comet having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, my convictions were increaſed, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan moſt earneſtly to ſeek the Lord. I told my mind to one of my ſchool-fellows, and we both gave ourſelves up to prayer and good converſation, and our outward conduct was not as before, in roving and in breaking the Sabbath. If any two could have merited any thing of God by our works, ſurely we ſhould have done it; and we went on in this phariſaic way for ſome months. But the more I prayed and heard, the worſe I grew; and I told my friend, that I could not tell what was the matter, nor what to do; 'till, at laſt, Providence was pleaſed to direct my way to my tutor for advice; and, after ſeveral viſits, I was enabled to lay my mind open to him, and thus, by inquiring of Zion's watchman, I have been directed to the gates of Zion with my face thitherward</p>

            <p>WHEN the Lord was firſt pleaſed to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my mind, I went under great diſtreſs, whether the Lord would hear my cries and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications; for I thought that the Lord had kept me as the apple of his eye ſo many years, while I had been provoking his moſt holy Majeſty, who, in juſtice to me a ſinner, might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me to everlaſting miſery. If he had, it would have been juſt; for I felt myſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his law. My mind was ſo diſtreſſed, that I was afraid to approach the throne of grace. I recollected many precious promiſes which I had heard and read; ſuch as, <hi>I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Prov. xviii. 7. <hi>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe coſt out</hi> John vi. 37. By theſe promiſes I was led to prayer, and all my heart's deſire was, none but Chriſt! none but Chriſt! He was all I wanted,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036356_0032_10091E78865BC308"/>
that he might clothe me with the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his righteouſneſs, for I felt I was naked, and could do nothing of myſelf without Chriſt. After this, the Lord enabled me to ſay, <hi>I have found him whom my ſoul loveth.</hi> Sol. Song ii. 4. This was he for whom I was ſeeking, and he was to me the pearl of great price!</p>
            <p>I once was much diſtreſſed, whether I was in the right way of life or no; and it entered my mind, that I had heard people ſay, that ſome only fancied religion, and profeſſed to be chriſtians, when they knew no more of its goodneſs than a dumb beaſt. I thought I alſo was only making a profeſſion; but, how ſhould I know it? I went to prayer, ſelf-examination, and reading the ſcriptures. By theſe I found I was in the right way. When I came to conſider a little, I found that it never could be fancy that gave me ſuch a ſenſe of my guilty conſcience, nor in the power of man to make me feel what I did; the Lord it was, and glory be to his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>By reading the ſcriptures, I found many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes for poor guilty wretches to come to Chriſt, and to caſt their burdens at the croſs; for he ſaid, Matt. xi. 28 and 30. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036356_0033_10091E7C0F7D35C0"/>
and I will give you reſt. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me: for I am meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart: and ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls. For my yoke is eaſy, and my burden is light.</hi> Iſaiah i. 18, 19. gave me great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to preſs forward: <hi>Come now, and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow; though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wool.</hi> Precious promiſe this! It made me rejoice to think, that Chriſt gave ſuch an invitation to ſinners; and although my ſins were of a crimſon dye, I was led to ſee, that the Lord was able to pardon them, ſet me free, and give me to enjoy him for ever! One text which gave me encouragement to fly to Chriſt for refuge was, Rev. xxii. 17. <hi>The ſpirit and the bride ſay, Come. And let him that heareth ſay, Come. And let him that is a thirſt, Come. And whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> This promiſe was to me valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for I think that I had ſuch a deſire for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Chriſt, that nothing elſe in this world would have ſatiſfied me.</p>
            <p>Some time after theſe enjoyments, I was brought very low on a bed of ſickneſs; a moſt
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036356_0034_10091E7D9231A760"/>
painful diſorder; but all the pain to me was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for I felt the privilege of a father to go to. I often ſaid, the phyſician can do me no good—none but Chriſt! I could ſay with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.</hi> Pſm. xxiii. 4. I was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in prayer; I felt happy in having a Chriſt to pray to; I enjoyed ſuch a nearneſs to him, that I often wiſhed to be with him; but I ſaid, not my will, but thine be done. Favoured with a viſit from my tutor in this ſickneſs, he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to read the 12th of Iſaiah, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verſe. <hi>Behold God is my ſalvation, I will truſt, and not be afraid, for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah is my ſtrength and my ſong, he alſo is become my ſalvation.</hi> Theſe very words were the deſire of my heart, and were my meditation day and night. I truſted in him, and he was my ſtrength and my ſong. By this ſickneſs, I was led to ſee that the Lord could call me when he pleaſed. There was one thing which made me to rejoice; it was, that I had fought the Lord when he called—not as Felix ſaid, "Go thy way; when I have a more convenient ſeaſon, I will call for thee." Acts xxiv. 25. If I had
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036356_0035_10091E8008F03158"/>
ſaid as Felix, I think I ſhould have been miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable forever: but the Lord was pleaſed that it ſhould not be ſo; he hath brought me thus far, and I can ſay with Abraham, <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped me.</hi> I have had many doubts and fears, whether I was the Lord's or no; but now I have an humble hope, through the blood of Jeſus, that I have an intereſt in him; not for any worthineſs in me, but through his blood, which he ſhed for ſinners upon the croſs; and thus I think, that the Lord has made a happy change in my ſoul through his grace. I hope, that while I live in this world of affliction, I may fulfil all his will which he hath revealed for his redeemed.</p>

            <p>LORD's-DAY: aroſe in the morning with the preſence of the Lord, and was very happy in prayer, earneſtly deſiring a bleſſing upon the day. I found the morning much mixed with the world, and a tempting devil ſtriving to interrupt me. Had ſome particular croſſes in the world; and my mind was perplexed until afternoon, when the Lord was pleaſed to give me a ſight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as my Saviour, and that he was as able to keep me as he had kept good <hi>king Joſiah,</hi> who was only twelve years old when the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched his ſoul with grace, and made his heart tender and noble in his cauſe; trampling under
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036356_0037_10091E86A6BB9E70"/>
foot all places of idolatry, and building up the houſe of the Lord. 2 Kings xviii. Hearing of theſe wonders of the Lord, made me to rejoice and ſay—why me! why me! Becauſe thou haſt redeemed me, O Lord, my God! I felt nothing in me but what was contrary to him who loved me, and gave himſelf for me; but, of a truth, I deſired to be gathered to my grave in peace. At the ſupper of the Lord I found much nearneſs to him, and could rejoice and bleſs him for the rich proviſion he hath provided for his gueſt! O that I might live more honorably to my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſtand more ſtedfaſt in the truth, that I may ſhow I am not of the world!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dec.</hi> 18. The morning began with prayer, and ended ſo, yet with much coldneſs. O that I had ſpent my time better! I would rather be in the uttermoſt parts of the earth, than to live ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. I might have heard the word of God; but no, ſays ſatan; no, ſays my wicked heart, there is hearing enough—the weather is cold— better ſtay at home. O my ſoul! where art thou? Going back into the world? Art thou ſlighting the worſhip and the promiſes of thy God? God forbid! And may the God of all grace and glory grant, that I may not be left to
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036356_0038_10091E8971E58770"/>
myſelf, to go where others go, and find no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort there! Thou who knoweſt my heart, and trieſt my reins, grant that I may enjoy thee more ſenſibly, and experience thy love more upon my heart, that, in this luke-warm ſtate of chriſtians, I may ſhine forth thy glory. Forbid, gracious God, that this year ſhould drop its curtain without a bleſſing for me; ſooner let me ceaſe to be, than to live without thy preſence and bleſſing upon me, and the church to which I belong!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 4, 1797. Enjoyed more of the preſence of God the paſt week than I have done for many weeks paſt. How happy is it for a chriſtian to feel ſenſibly the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt, who has cancelled <hi>all</hi> his guilt! O what a good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is he! He hateth putting away; he loves his people with an everlaſting love; my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, my portion! He is juſt ſuch a Saviour as I need; filthy as I am, he loveth me! Why? Becauſe he hath redeemed me. I felt moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, at his table, how unworthy I was to eat of his <hi>bread,</hi> and to drink of his <hi>wine</hi>; but it was my privilege ſo to do. Keep me Lord, and I ſhall be kept.</p>
            <p>28th. Enjoyed but little comfort in Chriſt. I ſeem to have gone aſtray; but ſtill deſire to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036356_0039_10091E8AF59ADEB0"/>
find the path that leads to everlaſting happineſs. O may the love of God be ſhed abroad in my heart by faith! On attending Mr. Warner's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, I enjoyed much ſatisfaction; it ſeemed as if the Lord was there indeed: may he grant that it may be the birth-place of many ſouls, and their numbers greatly increaſe!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 12. Enjoyed more comfort in hearing the word of God explained than for ſome time before; and I bleſs God that I can ſay, that I have not deceived myſelf, for the foundation is ſure, it is ſtronger than a rock. O how good is it, now and then, for the chriſtian to come at <hi>meal-time,</hi> like <hi>Ruth!</hi> Ruth ii. 14. Chriſt is ſolid food for the ſoul. May God grant that I may come often at meal-time! I have found it to be better than gold; it ſatisfieth the ſoul, and maketh it fat and flouriſhing. O that I could always be in the happy enjoyment of this! it is what my ſoul delighteth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 1ſt. The paſt week I have experienced the ſevereſt trials I ever underwent, inward and outward. Well might Job ſay, <hi>Why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth thou me, ſeeing the root of the matter is found in me.</hi> Job. xix. 28. A ſermon on theſe words from our miniſter ſuited my caſe well. I bleſs God for the affliction, for its iſſue
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:036356_0040_10091E8DAFF90950"/>
was good; it led me to prayer every time I had a ſpare moment to go and pour out my complaint before him and pray, that the affliction may be always rather than not enjoy the divine preſence; and I deſire to give God the glory, that it made my communion with Jeſus the ſweeter. This Sabbath did not appear in vain; for I felt the love of God ſhed abroad in my heart. O that I might be always kept in ſuch an humble ſtate!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7th. Where am I? Yet out of hell! a ſpared monument of mercy. Where haſt thou been wandering? Call to mind the paſt week. How has my time been employed? Have I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely forgot the Lord, who <hi>loveth at all times!</hi> to forget him who never forgot me, even on the croſs, when it would have been thought his pains were too great to think on me? Me! How then is it poſſible I ſhould forget <hi>my Jeſus!</hi> O, no! I would now come unto thee; I do feel the wickedneſs of my heart in departing from thee. Now, bleſſed Jeſus, make me nigh by thy blood! I determined not to enter the houſe of the Lord until he had manifeſted his love to me. I was going out; I entered my clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet again, and there wreſtled with God for a bleſſing, and that I might experience more hope and love in Chriſt's death; and before I got off
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036356_0041_10091E911AE9E098"/>
my knees, I felt my mind more compoſed, and I thought, that "praying breath ſhall not be ſpent in vain." In the evening ſervice, I felt much comfort indeed, and I think it is truly ſaid, <hi>and the king came in to ſee his gueſt.</hi> Matt. xxii. 11. I ſaw him whom my ſoul loveth; and I was very much affected in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's ſupper, to think he had done ſo much for me, and I love him ſo little, and deny him ſo often: I truſt it was a time of love. Here, Lord, take my heart juſt as it is; waſh it in thy precious blood, and it ſhall be clean; and ſo let me walk in the world that I may prove thy <hi>young diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 23. How happy is my ſoul after having taken its repoſe in the boſom of Jeſus; how happy, no tongue can expreſs! Glory to God, that he hath called me by his grace! O how pleaſant is it to walk in his ways, and to be kept as the apple of his eye! I feel ſenſibly for poor ſinners. O that I might, if it be God's will, be the means, through grace, of perſuading men of the <hi>terrors of the Lord!</hi> I have felt a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for ſetting apart as much time as poſſible for <hi>ſtudy,</hi> that if the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to call me to the <hi>miniſtry,</hi> that I may be a uſeful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Jeſus Chriſt; that I might only preach <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:036356_0042_10091E929D5FBAC8"/>
               <hi>March</hi> 18, 1798. On review of the week paſt, I muſt ſay that I have enjoyed much prayer, nor have I been ſo near to my God for two months part. O how good is it to be found in the Lord's ways! This afternoon, how ſweet the diſcourſe! and may God grant that it may be the means of bringing ſome ſoul <hi>to ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs!</hi> Glory be to thee, O God, that thou haſt taught me in any meaſure to ſeek thy face, and may many more ſeek thee in their youth!</p>
            <p>31ſt. I felt myſelf very happy laſt week, in attending Mr. Warner's ſociety for prayer; and may God grant that all ſuch meetings may be bleſſed for the eſtabliſhing many in the way! Many youths attend; the Lord bliſs them, and grant them many ſpiritual bleſſings! This morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O how was my heart drawn out in prayer to Jeſus for a bleſſing upon my <hi>ſoul,</hi> my <hi>miniſter,</hi> and the <hi>church!</hi> In approaching the table of the Lord, I realized the comfort and love there is in living near to God. Grant me grace to keep the vows I have made to teſtify my love to thee, by walking in thy ways, for thou Lord art my only hope and joy!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 16th. This morning I was more earneſt
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036356_0043_10091E9510423370"/>
in prayer than for the week paſt, and I truſt it was in faith, believing the Lord would ſend a bleſſing to my ſoul, and give me ſtrength to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in his ways. The paſt week has not been ſpent in ſo much meditation as I now could wiſh; yet, it is my mercy, <hi>my Lord</hi> is the ſame; and may I never be aſhamed to ſtand bold for the cauſe of my Lord and Maſter! Lord bleſs the youth that come among us. Haſt thou no heart to call? Why didſt thou teach me? Even becauſe thou wouldeſt; then Lord do thou call ſome dear youth to thyſelf, and all the glory ſhall be thine!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 12. Found much ſatisfaction in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>truth</hi> preached this day. O that I had an heart of gratitude to thee, O God, who art the only portion of my ſoul! Let me ſee my title clear to manſions in the ſky! I am <hi>a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of hope,</hi> and thou haſt taken me from the terrible pit and miry clay. Glory to thee for this rich grace towards me! This day was a good day to me, in writing the firſt part of my life. O God, I would wiſh thee to chuſe my <hi>life</hi>—the path—the <hi>ſituation</hi> in life—the <hi>death</hi>— truſting only in my Saviour's <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> for acceptance before thee.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>July</hi> 29th. What muſt I ſay? am I cold, or warm, or hot in religion? Have I lived the paſt week as a chriſtian? Does not this day tell me I am out of the road or not? My ſoul, haſt thou not often been engaged in private prayer on the Lord's-day, and felt thy dependance on God? Glory to God! there is one day in ſeven, which, by the aid of thy Spirit, I can bring to mind the paſt week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5th. Senſibly I feel a craving deſire for the welfare of Zion, and to do her all the good I can. Loſt ſome of the privileges the paſt week, otherwiſe my mind has been much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and happy in the enjoyment of my Lord. I could not forget that I was to meet him at his own table on the evening, Lord's-day; and now <hi>I have</hi> commemorated his dying love to me! <hi>Remember me! Remember me!</hi> This is my duty; and ſo far as I have been enabled, by his Spirit, I have remembered his dying words. O my ſoul! Realize what the Saviour hath done! Conſider the aggravations of thy ſins, which cauſed thy Saviour's ſorrow: his tears, his groans, and his burden! I felt happy at the table in having ſuch a Chriſt to go to.</p>
            <p>☞ This was his laſt communion ſeaſon on earth.</p>

               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:036356_0045_10091E9A1872E170"/>On Friday, September 14th, when the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence raged in this city, CHARLES HAZZARD made a viſit to his pious aunt at York-town, near Peek's-kill. On the Saturday evening he was remarkably cheerful, and told his aunt, that he propoſed to ſpend the next day, being Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, in private, for meditation and prayer; but, before the morning light, he was violently ſeized by the fever, and deſired to have little ſaid to him, but to enjoy his meditations. His aunt, anxious to know the ſtate of his ſoul, aſked him certain queſtions; to which he replied, "I am compoſed and reſigned, and the Lord is too good to me!" His diſorder grew ſo violently malignant, and created that intenſe ſtupor, that he was unable to ſay any thing more, or give any token of his ſtate of mind, and ſhortly put a period to his mortal life, aged eighteen years and ſix months.</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>FROM the papers of CHARLES HAZZARD, now read, you who are acquainted with the ſcriptures, and with the power of God in the converſion of man, are to form your own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the reality of his perſonal religion, and the hope of his now poſſeſſing eternal bliſs. It is not my province, neither is it my wiſh, "to canonize the dead;" yet, from my perſonal knowledge of the youth, I preſume, in chriſtian charity, to believe there was hope in his end. It ſenſibly impreſſes my breaſt, that God ſhould have preſerved my life, as a ſhattered tree in the garden of the church ſo many years, and amidſt ſo many ſevere ſtorms of affliction, while many youths of grace within the circle of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, whoſe branches were covered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſſoms, and whoſe fruit, in all probability, might have proved a rich benefit to ſociety, ſhould be cut down by death before my eyes! <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:036356_0047_10091E9FF1604A10"/>I feel a ſecret joy, that ſuch of my young friends were preſerved, by the arm of my God, from falling into the ſtrong tide of corruption and error, making ſhipwreck of faith, and of a good conſcience, as thouſands of others have done; but were bleſſed with <hi>an abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the ſatisfaction derived from peruſing the diary of CHARLES HAZZARD, you muſt be convinced of the propriety of thoſe who fear God, keeping memorials of his goodneſs to them in the ſeveral viciſſitudes of their journey through life. This is one way, by which, <hi>in the ages to come, God ſhews the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards them through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Eph. ii. 7. The advantages of this practice are great to ourſelves and to others. <hi>As in water face anſwereth to face, ſo the heart of man to man.</hi> Prov. xxvii. 19. And, in a diary, reading ſuch a diverſity of thoughts, temptations, ſufferings, hopes, fears, pleaſures, pains, expreſſed by thoſe whom we believe to be the ſubjects of redeeming mercy, we are led to examine ourſelves, derive comfort from a ſimilarity of caſe, and thus, <hi>though faint,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036356_0048_10091EA17495F1D0"/>
yet purſuing.</hi> Should your lives be prolonged to old age, you will find that ſuch a Journal will form a volume, in your own eſtimation, next in value to the Bible; and the peruſal of it will enable you, with Moſes, to <hi>remember all the way in which the Lord your God led you in this wilderneſs, to prove you.</hi> Deut. viii. 2. I cannot, therefore, too much urge you, who are ſubjects of God's goodneſs in early life, to copy after your departed young friend, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the daily or weekly exerciſe of your hearts in your walk with God. The uſual pleas againſt it are, a barrenneſs of mind, great depravity of heart, many miſcarriages in life, little commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; and, were you to write, it would diſtreſs your own mind to read it; and ſhould it fall into other hands, they muſt needs judge unfavourably of you: but let me tell you, if your hearts are right with God, if you deſire to perfect holineſs in his fear, and to walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and happily with him, your recording theſe evils will tend to humble you in the duſt, ſerve as beacons, or way-marks, to your future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and lead you to admire the exceeding riches of God's ſparing, pardoning goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. If you wait until you are free from
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036356_0049_10091EA4287CA790"/>
irregular thoughts, riſing corruptions, fiery temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and enjoy only the ſweet uninterrupted viſion of the Lamb, your diary would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely different to any I have hitherto ſeen or heard of; and, in my opinion, ſuch perfect bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs is the portion of thoſe only who have dropt their mortal clay, are free from ſin, out of the reach of Satan's fiery darts, and landed ſafe in immortal bliſs! Still, as it is the chriſtian's privilege <hi>to walk in the light of God's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> Pſm. lxxxix. 15. and, now and then, to ſet under the ſhadow of the tree of life, ſhake its branches by faith, and <hi>find its fruit ſweet unto their taſte,</hi> Sol. Song ii. 3. ſuch ſeaſons of mercy are worth recording; and, when ſet in oppoſition to the black ground of our own unworthineſs, they may be eſteemed as precious jewels, ſhining with infinite brilliancy! Such ſeaſons, likewiſe, never fail to ſtimulate our ſouls in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>If now and then a ſmile from Chriſt be ſweet, that's quickly gone,</l>

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:036356_0050_10091EA795BF9C98"/>The AGED of this aſſembly have, no doubt, liſtened with ſome attention to what has been ſaid concerning the youth of eighteen, lately tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from us, by death, to immortality. You, my aged ſires, in the mean time, have exerciſed ſome ſerious thoughts on yourſelves; reflected in what manner your youthful days were ſpent; and, notwithſtanding, God hath lengthened your lives to fifty,—to three ſcore years and ten; whether you have experienced the bleſſedneſs of God's converting goodneſs, and poſſeſs an hope full of immortality and glory. Were a diſcourſe to be pronounced on your future death, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your preſent ſtate of ſenſibility, do you think there would be juſt grounds to ſay an hundredth part in favour of your ſalvation, as hath been juſtly ſaid of our departed youth? or, may the 22d chapter of Jeremiah and 21ſt verſe be directed as a keen arrow to your breaſt? <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy proſperity, but thou ſaidſt, I will not hear: this hath been thy manner from thy youth, and thou obeyedſt not my voice, ſaith the Lord.</hi> If ſo; if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of providence have been beſtowed upon you in vain; if the dictates of your conſcience have been cruſhed; if the declaration of God's
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036356_0051_10091EA917BC0108"/>
word, the death of friends, and your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated calamities, have left no ſalutary impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon you; painful muſt be the reflection! To have ſtood all your long day, <hi>idle,</hi> Matt. xx. yet a buſy man—a man of buſineſs; but one ſtep between you and death, and not one ſtep nearer to the paradiſe of bliſs! May conſcious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, aided by the death of our young friend, be the means, under God, of conveying thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to your mind, unfelt by you before; and though paſſed on to your <hi>eleventh hour,</hi> may you partake of thoſe virtues which flow from the croſs, and leave a laſting teſtimony of your enjoyment of a complete ſalvation!</p>
            <p>What can I advance to thoſe youth, who were in intimacy with their departed young friend, and who are far from treading the ſame religious path; or, are ſure of ſo peaceful an end? Were it poſſible for him, though high in the climes of bliſs, to direct his voice to you in this aſſembly, would not ſimilar to theſe be the accents of his lips:—</p>
            <q>
               <p>DEAREST YOUTH!</p>
               <p>With whom I once partook of nature's clay, and mingled with the mortal throng below,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036356_0052_10091EAB8AE064B0"/>
Then I often wept, while tears could flow, and poured forth my ardent prayer for you; yes, for you, whoſe eager ſteps purſued vain pleaſure's hopes and aims, turning your giddy eyes and hearts away from a Saviour's charms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all the glories of the heavenly world! Thus employed, when arrows, dipt in peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial poiſon, from death's well-ſtrung bow, flew around, and ſmote both young and old: I felt the ſmart, and, by the mandate of my God, dropt my mortal fleſh, and fled away to know the powers of the world immortal. Now know I the pangs of death! I felt that tremendous ſtroke, which inſtant ſevers the immortal ſoul from its kindred clay: The gulph of death,— the judgment ſeat,—the horror of guilty ſouls beneath the pain of puniſhment,—the bliſs of heaven!—At theſe, I often ſaw the libertine to laugh, and you, with cool indifference, to turn away. Theſe are no fictitious ſcenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no airy phantoms here; all are real, vaſt, and as ſolemn as a diſembodied ſoul can penetrate, or a holy, righteous God has power to diſplay! Tremble then, O my ſtill loved youth, whom I left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, expoſed to every ſnare, and unprepared for your final change! Soon muſt you follow me;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036356_0053_10091EAF11838D10"/>
and, ſudden as the lightning flaſh, plunge into the abyſs of death, from whence there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. <hi>The land of darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death; a land of darkneſs, as darkneſs itſelf; and of the ſhadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkneſs.</hi> Job viii. 21, 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. To paſs this vale, without the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning blood of Chriſt, every pang that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can receive, every dart which Satan can diſcharge, every terror which offended juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can command, muſt ceaſe upon your vitals, and attend you down the deeper pit of black deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair! I eſcaped alone by that lovely SAVIOUR's arm, which you diſdain. While with you, on the earthly ball, JESUS became my SHEPHERD and my FRIEND; he gathered me from my evil courſe; he bore me on his breaſt amidſt my greateſt foes, and taught me to believe, that when the doors of death ſhould wide unfold for me, no evil ſhould I fear; calm and compoſed I ſhould walk along the vale of death; his rod and ſtaff ſhould be my ſtay, and his delightful ſmiles poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs my ſoul. Pſm. xxiii. 4. I proved his word more firm than adamantine rock; his preſence was my ſtay; the terrors of ghaſtly death va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and that common foe became my friendly
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036356_0054_10091EB1899E6ED0"/>
convoy to my SAVIOUR's arms! Now <hi>I ſee</hi> HIM <hi>as he is</hi>; my ſoul is abſorbed beneath his ſmiles;—I love—I praiſe—I adore! Angels aſſiſt my lays. Patriarchs, prophets, apoſtles, martyrs; the innumerable multitude of redeemed ſouls of every nation, language, kindred and tongue, unite in glorious viſion, and in endleſs praiſe to GOD, and the once ſlaughtered Lamb, now in the midſt of his auguſt throne, and who makes his glories all their own! May ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending angel on the church below, wing his way, and bear to me the happy news of your converſion, to the Lord of life! Stand ſtill— think of me ſaved from the depths of hell—think of ghaſtly death, of heaven, and of endleſs woe! Then learn IMMANUEL's power to ſave; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear to his celeſtial voice, which, when it calls in mercy, ſpeaks an heaven of ſolid bliſs into a youthful ſoul. Then, O then, I'll wait the happy time, when death ſhall cut your cord of life, and let you fly, to embrace my Saviour and my God; claſp you again to this my glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breaſt, to join in pleaſure, and in praiſe, and to part no more!</p>
