            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIN brings miÅ¿ery with and after it. Had man maintained his primitive rectitude, trouble, Å¿orrow and death would never have been found among the race of Adam. Ever Å¿ince the defection of the firÅ¿t human pair from God, there has been a Å¿trange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ity in mankind, to diÅ¿pute his authority and find fault with his adminiÅ¿tration. Such conduct is highly diÅ¿honorable, affronting and provoking to the Deity. He is pleaÅ¿ed frequently to animadvert upon it in this world, and Å¿ometimes, in a manner very alarming: And will not fail to make all, who perÅ¿iÅ¿t in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing him, to feel, Å¿ooner or later, the direful effects of his righteous vindictive reÅ¿entment. <hi>Wo,</hi> Å¿aith he in the text, <hi>unto him that Å¿triveth with his Maker.</hi> In diÅ¿courÅ¿ing on which I propoÅ¿e,</p>

FIRST, To Å¿hew <hi>when</hi> men may be Å¿aid to <hi>Å¿trive with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, To conÅ¿ider the great guilt and danger of <hi>Å¿triving with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, To apply the Å¿ubject to the preÅ¿ent very Å¿olemn and awful occaÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I am to Å¿hew <hi>when</hi> men may be Å¿aid to <hi>Å¿trive with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS I Å¿hall do in Å¿everal particulars. And,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Men <hi>Å¿trive with God</hi> when they refuÅ¿e to Å¿ubmit to him as their <hi>Law giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING made them he has an abÅ¿olute propriety in them, and an indiÅ¿putable right to enact Å¿uch laws for the direction of their conduct as Å¿eemeth good to him.</p>
            <p>HAPPY it is for us, that this Being, on whom we depend for exiÅ¿tence, and who has a Å¿overeign autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us, is poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of all perfection; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may be certain, that it never was, and never will be his pleaÅ¿ure to ordain rules for the obÅ¿ervance of any of his creatures, which have not their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in infinite goodneÅ¿s directed by conÅ¿ummate wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>ALL the laws the Supreme Being hath promulgated, and to which he requires our Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion, both by the voice of reaÅ¿on and revelation, are adapted to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and plainly calculated to advance and Å¿ecure our beÅ¿t welfare, as well as his glory. Indeed, Å¿hould the Deity require our obedient regard to a poÅ¿itive precept, the utility of which we could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018009_0005_0FA460E30CFB0750"/>
we Å¿hould be indiÅ¿penÅ¿ably obliged to yield a ready Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to it, not doubting of the wiÅ¿dom and goodneÅ¿s of his deÅ¿ign therein. His right to give law to us being founded in his abÅ¿olute propriety in us, we are bound to obey his precepts from a regard to his authority, excluÅ¿ive of any conÅ¿ideration of Å¿uitableneÅ¿s in the precepts themÅ¿elves to promote our own felicity. NevertheleÅ¿s, whenever Å¿uch Å¿uitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s is apparent in any of his laws, it affords an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional argument for our compliance with them.</p>
            <p>IN every allowed inÅ¿tance of diÅ¿obedience we prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deny the authority of God over us, and contend with him for dominion.</p>
            <p>No partial regard to his commandments is Å¿ufficient to Å¿ave us from the imputation of <hi>Å¿triving with him.</hi> St. James Å¿ays, <hi>Whoever Å¿hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> chap. ii. v. 10. WhoÅ¿oever allowedly and habitually violates any one of the laws of God is guilty of a wicked contempt of his Å¿overeignty, and does not obey him in any inÅ¿tance from a proper affection to him and his government. The language of the practice of every perÅ¿on of Å¿uch a character is, That he will not have God to rule over himâthat he is his own, and will pay no higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the laws of the Deity than is conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the gratification of his own irregular and vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. Men <hi>Å¿trive with God,</hi> when they find fault with the diÅ¿penÅ¿ations of his grace.</p>
            <p>THE Father of mankind, in his abundant wiÅ¿dom, goodneÅ¿s and mercy, has contrived a method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them from the ruins of the apoÅ¿tacy to his favour and happineÅ¿s. <hi>At Å¿undry times and in divers
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018009_0006_0FA460E49010D2D0"/>
manners</hi> has he made diÅ¿coveries of his mind and will relating to this plan of grace. In the fulneÅ¿s of time he Å¿ent his only begotten Son into the world to perfect what was wanting in preceeding revelations, and to exhibit to men a clear and full account of all thoÅ¿e things reÅ¿pecting their Å¿alvation, with which, in this Å¿tate of probation, infinite wiÅ¿dom Å¿aw fit to make them acquainted.</p>
            <p>THE atteÅ¿tations given to the revelation contained in the Å¿acred Å¿criptures of the Old and New TeÅ¿tament are ample, illuÅ¿trious, and worthy of God. Every Å¿erious, unprejudiced enquirer after truth Å¿oon feels their force, and is conÅ¿trained to acknowledge the divinity of the religion taught in the Bible.</p>
            <p>THAT any Å¿hould find fault with a Å¿cheme of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Å¿o benevolentâÅ¿o pureâÅ¿o honorable to God, and advantageous to menâÅ¿o admirably Å¿upported by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as well as internal evidence, is an argument of great blindneÅ¿s and obÅ¿tinacy.</p>
            <p>To creatures in our circumÅ¿tances of guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, who Å¿tand in abÅ¿olute need of a diÅ¿penÅ¿ation of grace, how welcome ought Å¿uch a diÅ¿penÅ¿ation to be! How worthy of the moÅ¿t grateful acceptation of <hi>all</hi> men is the <hi>ChriÅ¿tian</hi> revelation!</p>
            <p>No man, who rejects this revelation, either upon the Å¿uppoÅ¿ition that it is needleÅ¿s, or on account of any difficulties with which Å¿ome of its doctrines are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, difficulties incomprehenÅ¿ible by our limited under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tandings; or becauÅ¿e of the corruptions of its profeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors; no man, who oppoÅ¿es or treats it with neglect and contempt, on any account whatever, can excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate himÅ¿elf from the charge of Å¿triving with God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:018009_0007_0FA460E4ECF05D30"/>
To Å¿uppoÅ¿e Å¿upernatural revelation needleÅ¿s, implies, either a <hi>denial</hi> of a criminal departure in man from the Å¿tate of rectitude in which he was originally placed by God; or preÅ¿umption, that the uncovenanted good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and mercy of God oblige him to pardon and receive into favour the guilty: Both of which are <hi>inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent</hi> with the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reject the GoÅ¿pel, on account of <hi>myÅ¿teries</hi> with which Å¿ome of it's doctrines are attended, is highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaÅ¿onable, unleÅ¿s it be reaÅ¿onable to reject <hi>all</hi> religion on the Å¿ame account. The religion of <hi>nature</hi> is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulties as incomprehenÅ¿ible by us as any of the myÅ¿teries of the ChriÅ¿tian religion. Yes, if once it be admitted, that we can have no Å¿atisfactory evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of any thing we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, we muÅ¿t then commence univerÅ¿al Å¿cepticks, and doubt of the truth even of our own exiÅ¿tence, the manner of which is wholly unaccountable to us.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>corruptions</hi> of profeÅ¿Å¿ed ChriÅ¿tians, they are, indeed, a humbling conÅ¿ideration; but theÅ¿e corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ChriÅ¿tian religion is not accountable for. It every where diÅ¿countenances and condemns them; and of all religions, that ever appeared in the world, is the beÅ¿t calculated to diÅ¿courage vice, profanenÅ¿s and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality; and to promote the cauÅ¿e of piety, virtue and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s. It gives the moÅ¿t pure and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the cleareÅ¿t and fulleÅ¿t inÅ¿tructions and directions reÅ¿pecting our temper and behaviour towards God, mankind and ourÅ¿elves, and enforces them with the moÅ¿t weighty, pungent and effectual arguments and motives; arguments and motives Å¿uperior to any that could have entered the human mind, without a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Heaven. And "notwithÅ¿tanding the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions Å¿o complained of in the ChriÅ¿tian world, it is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018009_0008_0FA460E569911D00"/>
undeniable, that what there is of knowledge and true religion among men, is principally where ChriÅ¿tianity is profeÅ¿Å¿ed."</p>
            <p>To reject this religion, <hi>wherein God hath abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us in all wiÅ¿dom</hi> and goodneÅ¿s, is to fight againÅ¿t him in the moÅ¿t criminal and dangerous manner.</p>
            <p>MANY profeÅ¿Å¿ed ChriÅ¿tians <hi>virtually</hi> find fault with the goÅ¿pel diÅ¿penÅ¿ation.</p>
            <p>THE doctrines of ChriÅ¿tianity are truly humiliatingâwell calculated to bring down the pride of apoÅ¿tate men. Sinners, as we are taught in the book of inÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are <hi>juÅ¿tified freely by God's grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t: whom God hath Å¿et forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s for the remiÅ¿Å¿ion of Å¿ins; that he might be juÅ¿t and the juÅ¿tifier of him that believeth in JeÅ¿us</hi>

2. MEN <hi>Å¿trive with God</hi> in afflictions that are brought upon them, when they are Å¿ullen under them.</p>
            <p>A mournful Å¿enÅ¿e of afflictions is allowable, if not commendable. Such is the conÅ¿titution of man, and Å¿uch the deÅ¿ire of happineÅ¿s implanted in the human breaÅ¿t by our great Creator, that what "oppoÅ¿es this deÅ¿ire, or appears to have that tendency," will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of diÅ¿agreeable Å¿enÅ¿ations, and affect us with grief. Not to be thus affected in a degree Å¿omewhat correÅ¿pondent to the adverÅ¿ity with which we are viÅ¿ited, would argue a deviation from the regular Å¿tate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>A due Å¿enÅ¿ibility with reÅ¿pect to afflictions renders them a proper means of promoting important moral purpoÅ¿es in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>BUT, there is a wide difference between a <hi>mournful Å¿enÅ¿e</hi> of misfortunes, and <hi>Å¿ullenneÅ¿s</hi> under them: The <hi>former</hi> is Å¿uitable to the "law of our creation," and may be a powerful means of introducing into the Å¿oul that <hi>Godly Å¿orrow,</hi> which <hi>worketh repentance to Å¿alvation not to be repented of:</hi> Whereas the <hi>latter</hi> is a <hi>Å¿orrow</hi> that <hi>worketh death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Å¿uffer grief Å¿o far to exceed its real cauÅ¿e as to bear no proportion to it;âto refuÅ¿e to be comforted; to give place to melancholy Å¿o far as to become unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the neceÅ¿Å¿ary duties of life,âfor the thankful enjoyment of the remaining bleÅ¿Å¿ings of goodneÅ¿s,âfor entertaining worthy thoughts of God, and juÅ¿t and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Å¿entiments with reÅ¿pect to our fellow-creatures; this is abÅ¿olutely wrong: It is an implicit denial of the juÅ¿tice, the wiÅ¿dom, the goodneÅ¿s of Providence.</p>

3. THEY <hi>Å¿trive with God</hi> in afflictions, when, inÅ¿tead of improving them to good purpoÅ¿e, they grow no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but wax worÅ¿e under them.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> Did we not refuÅ¿e to be drawn <hi>with the cords of love, and the bands of a man,</hi> he would not take harÅ¿h methods with us. By our obÅ¿tinacy and perverÅ¿eneÅ¿s we "conÅ¿train him, and almoÅ¿t force him againÅ¿t his inclination" to treat us with Å¿everity.</p>
            <p>"AND yet, when he comes to take this courÅ¿e with us, he Å¿till, like a kind and tender hearted father, aims at our benefit and advantage. He deÅ¿igns kindneÅ¿s to the Å¿ons of men by all thoÅ¿e judgments which do not kill them, and cut them off from the opportunity and poÅ¿Å¿ibility of improving them. If he Å¿ends evils upon us, it is that thereby he may do us Å¿ome greater good: If he afflicts us, it is not becauÅ¿e it is pleaÅ¿ant to him to deal harÅ¿hly with us, but becauÅ¿e it is profitable and neceÅ¿Å¿ary for us to be Å¿o dealt with: And if at any time he imbitter our lives by miÅ¿eries and Å¿ufferings, it is becauÅ¿e he is loth to Å¿ee us periÅ¿h in pleaÅ¿ant ways, and chuÅ¿eth rather to be Å¿omewhat Å¿evere towards us, than Å¿uffer us to be utterly undone."</p>
            <p>AFFLICTIONS have a natural tendency to bring men to conÅ¿ideration, and, in the hand of providence, are a moÅ¿t powerful means of repentance. Elihu repreÅ¿ents their good effects upon Å¿inners in Å¿uch language as this, <hi>If,</hi> Å¿ays he, <hi>they be bound in fetters, and held in cords of affliction; then God Å¿heweth them their work, and their tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ions that they have exceeded. He openeth alÅ¿o their ear to diÅ¿cipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job, xxxvi. 8, 9, 10,</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS being the deÅ¿ign and tendency of afflictions, <hi>Å¿urely it is meet to be Å¿aid unto God,</hi> by every one who is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018009_0014_0FA460E9F2416AE0"/>
brought into circumÅ¿tances of adverÅ¿ity, <hi>I have born chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ement, I will not offend any more. That which I Å¿ee not teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxxiv. 31, 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>DAVID, upon whom they had their genuine effects, acknowledged, and Å¿aid, <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are right, and that in faithfulneÅ¿s thou haÅ¿t afflicted me. It is good for me that I have been afflicted. Before I was afflicted I went aÅ¿tray; but now have I kept thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, to pay no attention to the voice of Providence in afflictions, to conduct under them like Pharaoh, who as God multiplied his judgments upon him, <hi>Å¿inned yet more, and hardened his heart,</hi> is to Å¿trive with God, as if Å¿inners were reÅ¿olved that he Å¿hould not have the maÅ¿tery.</p>
            <p>PERSONS of Å¿uch a character have great reaÅ¿on to fear, leÅ¿t God Å¿hould <hi>let them alone,</hi> leÅ¿t he Å¿hould give them over to judicial <hi>blindneÅ¿s of mind, and hardneÅ¿s of heart,</hi> and leave them, without check or controul, to <hi>treaÅ¿ure up unto themÅ¿elves wrath againÅ¿t the day of wrath.</hi> I proceed,</p>

            </p>
            <p>THIS I will endeavour, briefly, by conÅ¿idering that they, who Å¿trive with their Maker, are guilty of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing their rightful Lord and Sovereign, who alone can make them happy, in thoÅ¿e methods he is graciouÅ¿ly pleaÅ¿ed to take for the promotion of that benevolent purpoÅ¿e, and are continually liable to be expoÅ¿ed to his vindictive diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, and will finally be made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his eternal vengeance, if they perÅ¿iÅ¿t in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ing his compaÅ¿Å¿ionate efforts to Å¿ave them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿hing.</p>

1. THEY are guilty of oppoÅ¿ing their Å¿upreme Lord and Sovereign in thoÅ¿e methods he is graciouÅ¿ly pleaÅ¿ed to take for the promotion of their beÅ¿t happineÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>As our lawgiver God may well be conÅ¿idered as our benefactor. We need directions for the regulation of our temper and behaviour. Being formed with capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for moral government, we cannot be happy without well ordered actions and inclinations. Such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the divine commands that <hi>in keeping them there is great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A GRAND deÅ¿ign of the diÅ¿penÅ¿ations of his grace is, to rectify the diÅ¿orders into which we have run by our diÅ¿regard to his holy law,âto reduce us to Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to his governmentâto Å¿ettle and eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h in our Å¿ouls that <hi>kingdom,</hi> which conÅ¿iÅ¿ts in <hi>righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and peace, and joy in the Holy GhoÅ¿t.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH this benevolent deÅ¿ign all God's providential dealings with us truly harmonize.âThis being the caÅ¿e; What baÅ¿eneÅ¿s! What ingratitude! What folly is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Å¿in of Å¿triving with him! In oppoÅ¿ing him we oppoÅ¿e our own moÅ¿t important intereÅ¿t. Sad beyond expreÅ¿Å¿ion would be our caÅ¿e Å¿hould God leave us under the power of a carnal mind. Sin carries much of its own puniÅ¿hment with it: The confuÅ¿ion and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order into which it plunges the Å¿oul are very fearful.</p>
            <p>GREATLY alarming is their condition who contend with God: They are chargeable with the guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning his infinite MajeÅ¿ty, vilifying his wiÅ¿dom, diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging his juÅ¿tice, abuÅ¿ing his goodneÅ¿s and defying his power, as if they were Å¿tronger than he. His pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not endure forever. His Å¿pirit will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Å¿trive with man. Which brings me to Å¿ay,</p>

            <p>WE are abÅ¿olutely in his hands. It is not for want of power to puniÅ¿h that he bears with any who treat him with indignity.

THE very Å¿hocking and execrable deeds perpetrated laÅ¿t WedneÅ¿day morning by a man in this Å¿ociety have led me to the obÅ¿ervations in this diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>THAT a perÅ¿on, favoured with ChriÅ¿tian light and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who appeared to be an affectionate huÅ¿band, and a tender, fond parent, Å¿hould, with deliberation and in cool blood, maÅ¿Å¿acre an amiable wife, and four lovely and promiÅ¿ing children, and then take away his own life, is an event Å¿o extraordinary, Å¿urpriÅ¿ing, and unheard of, that we can Å¿carcely believe it a reality, though the corpÅ¿es of the unhappy woman and children, with the moÅ¿t affecting marks of violence upon them, are here preÅ¿ent before our eyes.</p>
            <p>HAD he left no written account of his intentions and views reÅ¿pecting the deÅ¿truction of himÅ¿elf and family, we Å¿hould have been ready to conÅ¿ider it as the effect of a Å¿udden and moÅ¿t vehement frenzy.

On the morning of the Å¿ixth of December I roÅ¿e before the Å¿un, felt calm, and left my wife between Å¿leep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all Å¿ound aÅ¿leep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to Å¿trike or not, but yet thought it a good opportunity. I Å¿tood over them, and aÅ¿ked my God whether it was right or not, now to Å¿trike; but no anÅ¿wer came: nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, there was neither fear, trembling nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that, to look at myÅ¿elf in the glaÅ¿s; but I could diÅ¿cover no alteration in my countenance or feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet poÅ¿tponed it."

that ever appeared in the world.âWhen I conÅ¿ider men as ChriÅ¿tians, I look on them as free agents; I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined both old and new TeÅ¿taments, and muÅ¿t think <hi>that</hi> is their true meaning and intent. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider man as a DeiÅ¿t, or one that does not believe revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think him a perfect machine, and that he can do nothing, but as he is operated upon by Å¿ome Å¿uperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erâI have renounced all the popular religions in the world, and mean to die a proper DeiÅ¿t. I really think that there never was any thing done wrong in the world, but believe that all is right;âthat we are all impell'd to Å¿ay and act, every thing that we do Å¿ay and act.âThat a tyrant king, or two or three fierce republicans deluging three quarters of the world in bloodâthat my killing my familyâthat a man's deÅ¿troying a neÅ¿t of waÅ¿ps, or a fly, is as much directed by the hand of heaven as the making this whole world wasâAnd if this is the caÅ¿e there is no Å¿uch thing as Å¿in."</p>
            <p>THUS he frankly owns, that he had apoÅ¿tatized from the ChriÅ¿tian religion and embraced the principles of deiÅ¿m and fataliÅ¿m,âthat he believed men to be meer machines, and God the author of all their actions in Å¿uch a Å¿enÅ¿e as to exclude the poÅ¿Å¿ibility of Å¿in from the world. The idea of future puniÅ¿hment he alÅ¿o rejects, as inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the goodneÅ¿s of God, though he Å¿ays, "I know by experience there is no want of hells in this Å¿tate of things." And Å¿eems to be full in the opinion that he and his Å¿hall be happy in the future world whether he be right or not in rejecting the ChriÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation.</p>
            <p>THESE principles appear to have had a main influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in reconciling him to actions which have a Å¿elf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident criminality in them, and which every man's mind, at firÅ¿t view, cannot but abhor and condemn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018009_0020_0FA460F1DA31F690"/>
PRIDE, impatience, and cowardice firÅ¿t led him to think of deÅ¿troying himÅ¿elf and family, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated powerfully in bringing him to determine upon it. He had a high opinion of his intellectual abilities; and was uneaÅ¿y with the meanneÅ¿s of his perÅ¿onal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and Å¿lenderneÅ¿s of his fortune. He writes, "My perÅ¿on is Å¿mall and mean to look on, and my circumÅ¿tances were always rather narrow; which were great diÅ¿advantages in this world: But I have great reaÅ¿on to think that my Å¿oul is above the common mould.âThere are but few men capable of deiÅ¿m; they are when found like a diamond among a million of pebbles."</p>
            <p>HE murmured and complained of Providence in the following language: "I was determined not to haÅ¿ten the matter" (of deÅ¿troying himÅ¿elf and family) "but kept hoping that yet Providence would turn up Å¿ome thing to prevent it, if the intent were wrong: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of that every circumÅ¿tance, from the greateÅ¿t to the Å¿malleÅ¿t trifle, during the whole of that term" (i. e. three years) "and long before, only tended to convince me that the utmoÅ¿t malevolence of fortune was, and is, againÅ¿t me, on earth. I have born the "Å¿tings and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of outrageous fortune" long enough; and "by oppoÅ¿ing I can only end them."</p>
            <p>BEING too haughty to Å¿ubmit to the humbling diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ations of Providence, and not having fortitude and courage enough to encounter and Å¿uÅ¿tain the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies ariÅ¿ing from Å¿traitened circumÅ¿tances, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>cowardly</hi> thought of flying from them and taking Å¿anctuary in the unknown world: But the guilt and danger of Å¿uch conduct, upon Å¿uppoÅ¿ition of the truth of the Å¿acred Å¿criptures, were to apparent to Å¿uffer him to reÅ¿olve upon it, before he had brought himÅ¿elf
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018009_0021_0FA460F239EE0C30"/>
to diÅ¿believe and reject them. And to render it Å¿till leÅ¿s hazardous in his view he gave into the fataliÅ¿tic Å¿cheme, judging God to be Å¿o far the author of all the actions of men as to allow them no other agency than that of meer machines; and upon this HypotheÅ¿is concluded that there is no Å¿in. In which he is doubtleÅ¿s more conÅ¿iÅ¿tent than thoÅ¿e who admit the Å¿ame hypotheÅ¿is, and yet hold that men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their conduct.</p>
            <p>BUT even Å¿uch a view of the actions of men, added to his profeÅ¿Å¿ed diÅ¿belief of the Revelation of the Bible and future puniÅ¿hment, was not Å¿ufficient fully to Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy him with reÅ¿pect to his Å¿afety in perpretating deeds Å¿o unnatural and atrocious; and therefore he called in the aid of fanaticiÅ¿m and Å¿uperÅ¿tition.</p>
            <p>IN one of his letters he Å¿ays, "You may believe the hand of heaven is in this matter. I uÅ¿ed to be a great enemy to Å¿uperÅ¿tition: But, however it is, I have lately had Å¿undry intimations, I really think, from God to convince me that I am right; but theÅ¿e I Å¿hall not deÅ¿cribe.âI mentioned before, that my wife had a dream concerning this affair," (which in another pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, dated November 18, he relates in theÅ¿e words: "YeÅ¿terday morning Å¿he told me her dreamâthat Å¿he thought I had wrote many papers, and was earneÅ¿tly concerned about herâthat theÅ¿e papers were Å¿potted with bloodâthat Å¿he alÅ¿o Å¿aw a man wound himÅ¿elf paÅ¿t recovery; and blood guggle (as Å¿he expreÅ¿Å¿ed it) from different parts of his body. Poor woman! She little thought that the greater part of that dream would be realized within three daysâBut I am unappalled and think the hand of heaven is really with us.") "She has Å¿ince had two moreâone of them, That Å¿he was Å¿uddenly Å¿eized, and liable to great puniÅ¿hmentâthat it
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018009_0022_0FA460F2EA60B970"/>
created great confuÅ¿ion; but Å¿he afterwards got free and was happy. From her excellence of heart I have no doubt but this will be the caÅ¿e with her. On the thankÅ¿giving night Å¿he dreamed that her three daughters all lay dead, and they even froze in that Å¿ituation; and even yet I am little affected. O my God, wonderful indeed are thy works; in the higheÅ¿t wiÅ¿dom haÅ¿t thou contrived them all! All muÅ¿t be right, or I am har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened indeed.âSome of theÅ¿e will be called the Å¿ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geÅ¿tions of the devil: But men may rely upon it, that I have ever truÅ¿ted in a much higher power; and 'tis he alone that now directs me and Å¿upports me."</p>
            <p>IN another letter, Å¿peaking of the intended maÅ¿Å¿acre of himÅ¿elf and family, he Å¿ays: "In fine clear days, when I am moÅ¿t chearful, and in a morning when I firÅ¿t wake, free from any diÅ¿turbance, I Å¿eem to be convinced in a Å¿teady, calm and reaÅ¿onable way, that it is appointed for me to do itâthat it is my duty and that it muÅ¿t be done. That it is God himÅ¿elf that prompts and directs me, in all my reflections and circumÅ¿pection, I really believe. But if it Å¿hould at laÅ¿t prove <hi>Mr.</hi> Devil, or any other evil Å¿pirit, all that I can Å¿ay about it is, that I was born a very unlucky fellow."</p>
            <p>DREADFUL deluÅ¿ion! Strange inconÅ¿iÅ¿tencies! Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaÅ¿phemy! How Å¿urprizing is it, that a man, who rejects the infallible evidences in favour of the divinity of the ChriÅ¿tian religion, a religion which he allows to be <hi>moÅ¿t benevolent,</hi> and with whom it Å¿eems to be a maxim, that God never makes an extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himÅ¿elf to man while upon earth, Å¿hould pretend, and be confident, that He has given him Å¿undry inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that he is <hi>right</hi> in forming, and taking meaÅ¿ures to carry into execution, deÅ¿igns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the light of nature as <hi>abÅ¿olutely wrong,</hi>

               <hi>whoÅ¿e conÅ¿cience is not Å¿eared as with a hot iron,</hi> can think of without abhorrence! How Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that one, who ranked himÅ¿elf among the few Å¿ublime geniuÅ¿es, who only, as he Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deiÅ¿m, that is, of withÅ¿tanding the force of the mighty evidence in Å¿upport of the divine authority of the Bible, Å¿hould produce his wife's dreams and his own feelings at her narration of them as a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the hand of heaven was with him! Such dreams, related in the manner we may Å¿uppoÅ¿e they were by her, had a natural tendency to move the tender paÅ¿Å¿ions, and give a check to his pernicious deÅ¿igns. This he Å¿eemed to be aware of, and conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his being <hi>unaffected</hi> and <hi>unappalled</hi> as owing either to Å¿upernatural divine help and Å¿upport, or to his own hardneÅ¿s; the <hi>latter</hi> he would not admit: How aÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hing that he could imagine it to be the <hi>former!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT why do I Å¿ay aÅ¿toniÅ¿hing? Can any thing be Å¿o in one, who, in an enlightened age, Å¿o far Å¿ets himÅ¿elf againÅ¿t God as to reject a revelation attended with all the evidence, both internal and external, of it's divine original, that the nature of the thing will admit?</p>

THE horrid deeds perpetrated by this man under the influence of Å¿uch principles, are a more effectual confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoÅ¿e principles, than any it is in the power of language to produce.</p>
            <p>The terrible judgment of heaven in permitting one, who prided himÅ¿elf in the character of a deiÅ¿t and fataliÅ¿t, to be carried by his error to Å¿o dreadful a length as with deliberation and diÅ¿paÅ¿Å¿ion to murder himÅ¿elf and his whole family, I am ready to think, will, wherever it is known, Å¿trike terror into the minds of all who glory in Å¿uch a character, if any thing will produce Å¿uch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Å¿hort of the coming of the Judge of the world in flaming fire, to take vengeance on his enemies.</p>
            <p>IF any dare avow Å¿uch principles after they have been acted out in this moÅ¿t awful manner, and we have Å¿uch Å¿hocking evidence of their miÅ¿chievous and fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they ought to be treated as perÅ¿ons moÅ¿t dangerous to Å¿ociety.</p>
            <p>How greatly to be dreaded are all who embrace Å¿uch principles?</p>
            <p>How unfit are Å¿uch perÅ¿ons to be intruÅ¿ted either with private or public important affairs, whatever their accompliÅ¿hments may be in other reÅ¿pects?</p>
            <p>How unÅ¿afe muÅ¿t a woman, or family be in the hands of a man under the influence of Å¿uch principles? His affection, his fondneÅ¿s for them inÅ¿tead of being their Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity may prove the very occaÅ¿ion of their deÅ¿truction. This was the caÅ¿e with the unhappy woman and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whoÅ¿e remains are here before us.</p>
            <p>IT is a very threatning aÅ¿pect upon us that there are Å¿o many in this land, a land greatly diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect

            <p>BUT if Å¿uch bold oppoÅ¿ers of God are become Å¿o far judicially blinded, that the things of their peace Å¿hall be forever hidden from their eyes; yet it is hoped that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are not fixed in looÅ¿e principles, though often guilty of thinking and Å¿peaking lightly of the doctrines of ChriÅ¿tianity, will take the alarm, and beware <hi>leÅ¿t they be hardened through the deceitfulneÅ¿s of Å¿in,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL who are impatient under adverÅ¿e providences, being diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to murmur and complain, and take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful methods for relief, have great reaÅ¿on to tremble.</p>

            <p>IT becomes us as men, and eÅ¿pecially as ChriÅ¿tians, to endure afflictions with humility, patience and fortitude, and learn in whatÅ¿oever Å¿tate we are therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>HAD the unhappy man, who choÅ¿e to deÅ¿troy himÅ¿elf and family rather than live in a Å¿tyle below what he vainly imagined became a perÅ¿on of his conÅ¿equence, been contented with food and raiment which he had, and might have procuredâhad he been humbleâhad he not diÅ¿truÅ¿ted God, he might have been among the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Å¿eaÅ¿on of probation lengthened out; but

            <p>THAT he Å¿hould be Å¿uffered to manage his helliÅ¿h purpoÅ¿es with Å¿uch Å¿ecrecy for Å¿o long a time, and at laÅ¿t put them into execution unÅ¿uÅ¿pected, is one of the deep things of God which calls for humiliation.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS not Å¿trange that reports various and contradictory Å¿hould have circulated on Å¿o intereÅ¿ting and terrible a Å¿ubject as that of a man's conÅ¿igning to the grave himÅ¿elf and family in a moment of apparent eaÅ¿e and tranquility. The agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind which muÅ¿t be the conÅ¿equence of being near Å¿uch a Å¿cene of horror, will Å¿ufficiently apologize for not anÅ¿wering your requeÅ¿t for the particulars e'er this. Our ignorance of the hiÅ¿tory of this man at firÅ¿t precluded a poÅ¿Å¿ibility of giving you Å¿atisfaction on this head. Perhaps no one in this town had more favorable opportunities of obtaining the particulars of his hiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet, could never induce him to mention a Å¿ingle Å¿yllable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have aÅ¿ked him directly would have been rude when he evidently meant to be Å¿ilent on theÅ¿e Å¿ubjects. My conjecture was, that he was the natural Å¿on of Å¿ome gentleman in England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the Court. Since his deceaÅ¿e have been able to learn from undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authority, that he was born in the county of EÅ¿Å¿ex, in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage not very far from London. As to his buÅ¿ineÅ¿s in youth am Å¿till left in the dark, but find he has once mentioned to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Å¿ome little incidents which happened to him while in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his father, and that he very early became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a club in London who were DeiÅ¿ts, where 'tis probable he received the firÅ¿t rudiments in thoÅ¿e principles. While in England, where he left a mother and Å¿iÅ¿ter, he had a fair cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for integrity and honeÅ¿ty. In the year 1755 he went out to the iÅ¿land of Barbadoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold, <abbr>EÅ¿q</abbr>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018009_0029_0FA460FA96674E48"/>
Governor of that iÅ¿land, where he tarried Å¿ix years, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, purchaÅ¿ed Å¿ome merchandize, and from thence came to New-York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this State, from thence to Derby, and then to Fairfield, where he married and dwelt Å¿ome years.âBy this time he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, with which he removed to this town, about ten years Å¿ince, where he reÅ¿ided until his death. His buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was that of retailing, he formerly credited his goods, but Å¿ince his reÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this town he has refuÅ¿ed to give any credit, intending to keep his property within his own reach, believing it always Å¿ecure while his eye was upon it. While here he added conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his Å¿tock, none of which he ever veÅ¿ted in real eÅ¿tate; the Continental currency taught him that wealth could take to itÅ¿elf wings and fly away: NotwithÅ¿tanding all his vigilance.</p>
            <p>When the war commenced he had on hand a very handÅ¿ome aÅ¿Å¿ortment of Goods for a country Å¿tore, which he Å¿old for the currency of the country, without any advance in the price<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would Å¿oon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, reÅ¿olving not to part with it until it Å¿hould be in as good demand as when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him. His expectations from this quarter daily leÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, finally loÅ¿t all hope, and was thrown into a Å¿tate little better than diÅ¿pair, as appears from his writtings; he adopted a plan of the moÅ¿t rigid family oeconomy, but Å¿till kept up the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the laÅ¿t entertained his friend with his uÅ¿ual decent hoÅ¿pitality, although nothing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart; his writings Å¿hew clearly that he was determined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this Å¿ubject he expreÅ¿Å¿es himÅ¿elf in the following extraordinary manner: "If a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable accident into poverty, and then Å¿ubmits to be laughed at, deÅ¿piÅ¿ed and trampled on, by a Å¿et of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the Å¿un; I Å¿ay, if Å¿uch a man Å¿ubmits, he muÅ¿t become meaner than meanneÅ¿s itÅ¿elf, and I Å¿incerely wiÅ¿h he might have ten years added to his natural life to puniÅ¿h him for his folly."</p>
            <p>He fixed upon the night Å¿ucceeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpoÅ¿e, and procured a Å¿upper of oyÅ¿ters, of which the family eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as follows: "I have prepared a noble Å¿upper of oyÅ¿ters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die." After Å¿upper he Å¿ent the maid with a Å¿tudied errand to a friend's houÅ¿e at Å¿ome diÅ¿tance, directing her to Å¿tay until Å¿he

obtained an anÅ¿wer to an inÅ¿ignificant letter he wrote his friend intending Å¿he Å¿hould not return that eveningâÅ¿he did however return, perhaps her return diÅ¿concerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he carried his piÅ¿tols to a Å¿mith for repair; it may be, the ill condition of his piÅ¿tols might be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reaÅ¿on for the delay.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 10th of December Å¿ome perÅ¿ons were with him at his houÅ¿e, to whom he appeared as chearful and Å¿erene as uÅ¿ual; he attended to the little affairs of his family as if nothing uncommon was in contemplation. The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as uÅ¿ual for their Å¿tay; whether he Å¿lept that night is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid Å¿lept in one chamber; in the grey of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to ariÅ¿e gently without diÅ¿turbing the children; when Å¿he came down Å¿tairs he gave her a line to the family phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ician, who lived at the diÅ¿tance of a quarter of a mile, ordered her to carry it immediately, at the Å¿ame time declaring that Mrs. Beadle had been ill all night, and directing her to Å¿tay until the phyÅ¿ician Å¿hould come with her; this he repeated Å¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times with a degree of ardor. There is much reaÅ¿on to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had murdered Mrs. Beadle before he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving the houÅ¿e he immediately proceeded to execute his purpoÅ¿e on the children and himÅ¿elf. It appears he had for Å¿ome time before, carried to his bed Å¿ide every night an ax and a carving knife; he Å¿mote his wife and each of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the ax on the Å¿ide of the head as they lay Å¿leeping in their beds; the woman had two wounds in the head, the Å¿cull of each of them was fractured; he then with the carving knife cut their throats from ear to ear; the woman and little boy were drawn partly over the Å¿ide of their beds, as if to prevent the bedding from being beÅ¿meared with blood; the three daughters were taken from the bed and laid upon the floor Å¿ide by Å¿ide, like three lambs, before their throats were cut; they were covered with a blanket, and the woman's face with an handkerchief. He then proceeded to the lower floor of the houÅ¿e, leaving marks of his footÅ¿teps in blood on the Å¿tairs, carrying with him the ax and knife, the latter he laid upon the table in the room where he was found, reeking with the blood of his family. Perhaps he had thoughts he might uÅ¿e it againÅ¿t himÅ¿elf if his piÅ¿tols Å¿hould fail; it appears he then Å¿eated himÅ¿elf in a WindÅ¿or chair, with his arms Å¿upported by the arms of the chair; he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the muzles of the piÅ¿tols into his two ears and fired them at the Å¿ame inÅ¿tant: the balls went through the head in tranÅ¿verÅ¿e directions. Although the neighbours were very near and Å¿ome
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018009_0031_0FA460FDDE107110"/>
of them awake, none heard the report of the piÅ¿tols. The capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal facts of the maÅ¿Å¿acre you have Å¿een in the public papers; a minute detail was too horrible to be given at firÅ¿t, until the mind (eÅ¿pecially of the relatives of the unhappy woman) had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it by a Å¿ummary narrative, and even now 'tis enough to give feelings to apathy itÅ¿elf to relate the horrid tale.</p>
            <p>The line to the phyÅ¿ician obÅ¿curely announced the intentions of the man; the houÅ¿e was Å¿oon opened, but alas too late! The bodies were pale and motionleÅ¿s, Å¿wimming in their blood, their faces white as mountain Å¿now, yet life Å¿eemed to tremble on their lips; deÅ¿cription can do no more than Å¿aintly ape and trifle with the real figure.</p>
            <p>Such a tragical Å¿cene filled every mind with the deepeÅ¿t diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treÅ¿s; nature recoiled and was on the rack with diÅ¿torting paÅ¿Å¿ions; the moÅ¿t poignant Å¿orrow and tender pity for the lady and her innocent babes, who were the hapleÅ¿s victims of the brutal, Å¿tudied cruelty of an huÅ¿band and father, in whoÅ¿e em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces they expected to find Å¿ecurity, melted every heart.âShock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of pride and falÅ¿e notions about religion.</p>
            <p>To paint the firÅ¿t tranÅ¿ports this affecting Å¿cene produced, when the houÅ¿e was opened, is beyond my reach.âMultitudes of all ages and Å¿exes were drawn together by the Å¿ad tale.âThe very in moÅ¿t Å¿ouls of the beholders were wounded at the Å¿ight, and torn bycontending paÅ¿Å¿ions: Silent grief, with marks of aÅ¿toniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were Å¿ucceeded by furious indignation againÅ¿t the author of the affecting Å¿pectacle, which vented itÅ¿elf in incoherent excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.âSome old Å¿oldiers accidentally paÅ¿Å¿ing thro' the town that morning, on their way from camp to viÅ¿it their friends, led by curioÅ¿ity turned in, to view the Å¿ad remains; on Å¿ight of the woman and her tender offspring, notwithÅ¿tanding all their firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, the tender Å¿ympathetic tear Å¿tealing gently down their furrowed cheeks, betrayed the anguiÅ¿h of their hearts; on being Å¿hewed the body of the Å¿acrificer they pauÅ¿ed a moment, then muttering forth an oath or two of execration, with their eyes fixed on the ground in Å¿ilent Å¿orrow, they Å¿lowly went their way. So awful and terrible a diÅ¿aÅ¿ter wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighbourhood; nature itÅ¿elf Å¿eemed ruÅ¿tled, and refuÅ¿ed the kindly aid of balmy Å¿leep for a time.</p>
            <p>Near the cloÅ¿e of the day on the 12th of December, the bodies being Å¿till unburied, the people, who had collected in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, grew almoÅ¿t frantic with rage, and in a manner demanded the body of the murderer; the law being Å¿ilent on the Å¿ubject, it was difficult to determine where decency required the body Å¿hould be placed, many propoÅ¿ed it Å¿hould be in an ignominious manner where four roads met, without any coffin or inÅ¿ignia of reÅ¿pect, and perforated by a Å¿take. Upon which a queÅ¿tion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018009_0032_0FA460FF6E39C168"/>
aroÅ¿e, where that place could be found which might be unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the neighbourhoodâbut no one would conÅ¿ent it Å¿hould be near his houÅ¿e or land. After Å¿ome conÅ¿ultation it was thought beÅ¿t to place it on the bank of the river between high and low water mark; the body was handed out of the window and bound with cords on a fled, with the cloaths on as it was found, and the bloody knife tied on his breaÅ¿t, without coffin or box, and the horÅ¿e he uÅ¿ually rode was made faÅ¿t to the Å¿ledâthe horÅ¿e, unaccumÅ¿tomed to the draught, proceeded with great unÅ¿teadineÅ¿s, Å¿ometimes running full Å¿peed, then Å¿top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, followed by a multitude, until arriving at the water's edge, the body was tumbled into a hole dug for the purpoÅ¿e, like the carcaÅ¿e of a beaÅ¿t. Not many days after there appeared an uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s in Å¿undry perÅ¿ons at placing the body Å¿o near a ferry much frequented; Å¿ome threatnings were given out that the body Å¿hould be taken up and a Å¿econd time expoÅ¿ed to view. It was thought prudent it Å¿hould be removed, and Å¿ecretly depoÅ¿it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Å¿ome obÅ¿cure Å¿pot, it was accordingly removed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t Å¿ecrecy; notwithÅ¿tanding which Å¿ome children acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diÅ¿covered the place, and the early freÅ¿hes partly waÅ¿hed up the body, and it has had a Å¿econd remove to a place where it is hoped mankind will have no further vexation with it.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of December the bodies of the murdered were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a manner much unlike that of the unnatural murderer.âThe remains of the children were borne by a Å¿uitable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of equal age, attended with a Å¿ad proceÅ¿Å¿ion of youths of the town, all bathed in tears; Å¿ide by Å¿ide the hapleÅ¿s woman's corpÅ¿e was carried in Å¿olemn proceÅ¿Å¿ion to the pariÅ¿h church yard, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a great concourÅ¿e, who with affectionate concern and every token of reÅ¿pect were anxious to expreÅ¿s their heart-felt Å¿orrow in performing the laÅ¿t mournful duties.</p>
            <p>The perÅ¿on of Mr. Beadle was Å¿mall, his features Å¿triking and full of expreÅ¿Å¿ion, with the aÅ¿pect of fierceneÅ¿s and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his mind was contemplative, when once he had formed an opinion, was remarkably tenacious; as a merchant or trader, he was eÅ¿teemed a man of Å¿trict honor and integrity, and would not deÅ¿cend to any low or mean artifice to advance his fortune. He was turned of 52 years of age when he died.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Beadle was born at Plymouth, in MaÅ¿Å¿achuÅ¿etts, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable parentsâa comely perÅ¿on, of good addreÅ¿s, well bred, unuÅ¿ually Å¿erene, Å¿incere, unaffected and Å¿enÅ¿ible; died in the middle of life, aged 32 years.</p>
            <p>The children (the eldeÅ¿t of which was a Å¿on, aged 12 years, the other three, daughters, the youngeÅ¿t aged 6 years) were Å¿uch as cheared the hearts of their parents, who were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fond of diÅ¿playing their little virtues and excellencies,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018009_0033_0FA46100B109E0F8"/>
and Å¿eemed to anticipate a continuance of growing parental Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; alas, like early tender buds nipped by untimely froÅ¿ts, they did but begin to live!</p>
            <p>It is more than probable, this man had for months paÅ¿t deÅ¿ired that Å¿ome or all of his children might be taken out of the world by accident; be removed all means of Å¿ecurity from a well near his houÅ¿e, which he was careful heretofore to keep covered. His little boy he often Å¿ent to Å¿wim in the river, and has been heard to chide the child for not venturing further into deep water than his fears would Å¿uffer him. He has at times declared it would give him no pain or uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s to follow his children to the graveâhis acquaintance knew theÅ¿e expreÅ¿Å¿ions could not ariÅ¿e from want of affection or tenderneÅ¿s for his children, but rather imagined him Å¿peaking raÅ¿hly in jeÅ¿t. He ever Å¿poke lightly of death as a bugbear the world cauÅ¿leÅ¿sly feared. It appears from his writings, he at firÅ¿t had doubts whether it was juÅ¿t and reaÅ¿onable for him to deprive his wife of life, and offers againÅ¿t it, only this reaÅ¿on, that he had no hand in bringing her into exiÅ¿tence, and conÅ¿equently had no power over her life.âShe Å¿et out about the firÅ¿t of November on a journey to Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, which he thought was by direction of Heaven to clear him of his doubts and remove her out of the way, at the time the buÅ¿ineÅ¿s was to be done; and his intention was to have executed his deÅ¿ign on himÅ¿elf and children in her abÅ¿ence. She proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further than New-Haven, and by reaÅ¿on of Å¿ome diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, returned ten days earlier than expected; he appeared chagrin'd at her early return, and Å¿oon began to invent Å¿ome juÅ¿tifying reaÅ¿ons for depriving her of life alÅ¿o. He finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it would be unmerciful to leave her behind to languiÅ¿h out a life in miÅ¿ery and wretchedneÅ¿s, which muÅ¿t be the conÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Å¿urprizing death of the reÅ¿t of the family, and that Å¿ince they had Å¿hared the frowns and Å¿miles of fortune to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it would be cruelty to her, to be divided from them in death.</p>
            <p>'Tis very natural for you to aÅ¿k, whether it was poÅ¿Å¿ible a man could be tranÅ¿formed from an affectionate huÅ¿band and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent parent to a Å¿ecret murderer, without Å¿ome previous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, which muÅ¿t have been noticed by the family or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? Yet this was the caÅ¿e in this inÅ¿tance, there was no viÅ¿ible alteration in his conduct. It appears by his writings that he thought he had a right to deprive himÅ¿elf of life and intended to exerciÅ¿e that right if ever he Å¿hould think himÅ¿elf unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the extenÅ¿ion of this right to his children, was very eaÅ¿y. 'Tis probable, the principle had grown up gradually to the laÅ¿t Å¿tage. Since his death I have Å¿een a letter he wrote to a friend as early as 1777, in which he has an expreÅ¿Å¿ion like thisâ"I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018009_0034_0FA4610141F66160"/>
I and my family Å¿hall not live to Å¿ee the end of the war."âIt was then underÅ¿tood to mean nothing more than his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the war would continue a long time, his late conduct has explained it very differentlyâWhether Mrs. Beadle had any fears of his evil intentions or not, is uncertain, that Å¿he had fears Å¿ome great calamity would befal the family is evident, both from what Å¿he Å¿aid, and what he has left in writing.âHe writes on the 18th of November, that on the morning of the 17th Å¿he told him, "She dreamed he had wrote many papers, and was earneÅ¿tly concerned for her, and that thoÅ¿e papers were Å¿potted with blood; and that Å¿he alÅ¿o Å¿aw a man wound himÅ¿elf paÅ¿t recovery and blood guggle (as Å¿he expreÅ¿Å¿ed it) from different parts of his body."âIn another letter, of a later date, he writes as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "I mentioned before that my wife had a dream concerning this affair, Å¿he has Å¿ince had two more, one of them. That Å¿he was Å¿uddenly Å¿eized and liable to great puniÅ¿hment, that it created great confuÅ¿ion, but Å¿he afterwards got free and was happy; from her excellence of heart, I have no doubt but this will be the caÅ¿e with her.âOn the thankÅ¿giving night Å¿he dreamed, that her three daughters all lay dead, and that they even froze in that Å¿ituation; and even yet I am little affected".<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor is Å¿enÅ¿ible that it may be diÅ¿guÅ¿tful to Å¿ome readers to obÅ¿erve theÅ¿e dreams repeated after inÅ¿erting them in the Å¿ermon, but this letter was written before it was known the Å¿ermon would be publiÅ¿hed, and the obÅ¿ervations upon the Å¿ubject being very different, and Å¿ince the Å¿enÅ¿e would not be compleat without a repetition of them he hopes the reader will take no exception thereat.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The afternoon before this terrible execution, Mrs. Beadle walked abroad to viÅ¿it an acquaintance, and it was obÅ¿erved by the lady, Å¿he was uncommonly penÅ¿ive; Å¿he aÅ¿ked the reaÅ¿on, Mrs. Beadle with much concern told her, "She had for months been troubled with frightful and uncommon dreams, and that very morning Å¿he dreamed violence had been offered her family and her children deÅ¿troyed; Å¿he Å¿aid thoÅ¿e dreams wrought on her mind to a very great degree, to divert her thoughts from them Å¿he had walk'd abroad that afternoon; and that Å¿he verily believed Providence had judgments in Å¿tore for their family, which he was about to inflict on them by Å¿ome Å¿weeping Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, or in Å¿ome other awful manner."âMr. Beadle, who, as appears by his writings, was alone privy to his malevolent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, put a very different conÅ¿truction upon her dreams. He doubtleÅ¿s conÅ¿idered them as premonitions from Heaven, and convincing proof to him that his purpoÅ¿e was right, of which he Å¿ays he had Å¿undry intimations he really thought from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, which he does not deÅ¿cribe.</p>
            <p>From whence thoÅ¿e dreams originated it is impoÅ¿Å¿ible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; whether 'the weapons he carried to his bed Å¿ide gave

her uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s and excited a jealouÅ¿y in her mind of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or whether any of his conduct which fell under her obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation might be alarming to her, which might trouble her Å¿leep, no one can tell. She has lately mentioned Å¿undry dreams of a Å¿imilar nature, which Å¿he had near Å¿ix months Å¿ince. Some great and good characters have thought Å¿uch intimations were at times given from on high, to convince mankind of the reality of the inviÅ¿ible worldâto hazard Å¿uch a conjecture in theÅ¿e modern days would perhaps be thought by the learned world a great mark of fanataciÅ¿mâevery man muÅ¿t think for himÅ¿elf, no one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with Å¿atisfactory certainty with reÅ¿pect to the origin and cauÅ¿e of Å¿uch thoughts in Å¿leep, which Å¿o nearly correÅ¿pond with the true Å¿tate of facts. Her laÅ¿t dream penned by him was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly literally verified. Although the weather was Å¿erene and pleaÅ¿ant on the 10th, and near full moon: neither the Å¿un or moon were viÅ¿ible from the time this horrid deed was done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the body of this man was laid beneath the clods, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the horror: when Å¿uddenly the wind blew from the northweÅ¿t, diÅ¿pelled the vapours and diÅ¿covered a cloudleÅ¿s Å¿ky. The air grew cold, and the faces of the other five being opened to view in their coffins, in the front of the meeting-houÅ¿e, the concourÅ¿e was Å¿o great that much time was Å¿pent to give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for all to take a view; the cold Å¿till increaÅ¿ing, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in all probability were Å¿tifned with froÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beadle left Å¿undry letters directed to his acquaintance, and one laboured treatiÅ¿e in juÅ¿tification of his conduct; they contain many inconÅ¿iÅ¿tencies. He profeÅ¿Å¿es himÅ¿elf a DeiÅ¿t, but reprobates AtheiÅ¿m. While in life and proÅ¿perity he claim'd to be a ChriÅ¿tian, and offered two of his children in baptiÅ¿m. Much has been Å¿aid in favour of publiÅ¿hing his writings by thoÅ¿e who have not Å¿een them; thoÅ¿e who have peruÅ¿ed them have doubted the propriety of Å¿uch a meaÅ¿ure; not becauÅ¿e his reaÅ¿onings againÅ¿t revelation were in any degree unanÅ¿werable, but leÅ¿t they might have Å¿ome effect on weak and melancholy minds. He attempts to attack all rulers in Church and State, treats the ChriÅ¿tian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with a great degree of bitterneÅ¿s and bigotry; and yet abÅ¿urdly concludes by Å¿aying, "if it is true he Å¿hall be Å¿aved by it."âHe is very unÅ¿ettled, wavering and inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent in his own beloved Å¿yÅ¿tem of DeiÅ¿m. He flatters his pride by believing it was the height of heroiÅ¿m to dare to die by his own hands, and that the Deity would not willingly puniÅ¿h one, who was impatient to viÅ¿it his God and learn his will from his own mouth, face to face in Å¿ome future world, or worlds (which he thinks may be many) and Å¿eems to think there is as great probability of Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding advantageouÅ¿ly, in removing from one world to another as from one country, or calling to another; and Å¿eeing all men

muÅ¿t be jugged off at laÅ¿t (as he expreÅ¿Å¿es it) he was determined to make the experiment voluntarily which all muÅ¿t do through neceÅ¿Å¿ity. As he was much out of temper with the world, he was unwilling any of his family Å¿hould Å¿tay behind to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its troubles, and Å¿ince 'tis a father's duty to provide for his flock, he choÅ¿e to conÅ¿ign them over to better hands.</p>
            <p>'Tis doubtful whether any hiÅ¿tory of modern times can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an inÅ¿tance of Å¿imilar barbarity, even in the extreme diÅ¿treÅ¿s of war. The ancients encouraged by numbers and example, did in hours of deÅ¿pair deÅ¿troy themÅ¿elves and families, to avoid the Å¿hame of becoming captives to be led in triumph, and the cruelty commonly exerciÅ¿ed in thoÅ¿e barbarous ages.</p>
