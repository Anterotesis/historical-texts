            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SIN brings miſery with and after it. Had man maintained his primitive rectitude, trouble, ſorrow and death would never have been found among the race of Adam. Ever ſince the defection of the firſt human pair from God, there has been a ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity in mankind, to diſpute his authority and find fault with his adminiſtration. Such conduct is highly diſhonorable, affronting and provoking to the Deity. He is pleaſed frequently to animadvert upon it in this world, and ſometimes, in a manner very alarming: And will not fail to make all, who perſiſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him, to feel, ſooner or later, the direful effects of his righteous vindictive reſentment. <hi>Wo,</hi> ſaith he in the text, <hi>unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker.</hi> In diſcourſing on which I propoſe,</p>
            <p>

FIRST, To ſhew <hi>when</hi> men may be ſaid to <hi>ſtrive with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY, To conſider the great guilt and danger of <hi>ſtriving with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY, To apply the ſubject to the preſent very ſolemn and awful occaſion.</p>
            <p>FIRST, I am to ſhew <hi>when</hi> men may be ſaid to <hi>ſtrive with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS I ſhall do in ſeveral particulars. And,</p>
            <p>FIRST, Men <hi>ſtrive with God</hi> when they refuſe to ſubmit to him as their <hi>Law giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING made them he has an abſolute propriety in them, and an indiſputable right to enact ſuch laws for the direction of their conduct as ſeemeth good to him.</p>
            <p>HAPPY it is for us, that this Being, on whom we depend for exiſtence, and who has a ſovereign autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over us, is poſſeſſed of all perfection; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may be certain, that it never was, and never will be his pleaſure to ordain rules for the obſervance of any of his creatures, which have not their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in infinite goodneſs directed by conſummate wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>ALL the laws the Supreme Being hath promulgated, and to which he requires our ſubmiſſion, both by the voice of reaſon and revelation, are adapted to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and plainly calculated to advance and ſecure our beſt welfare, as well as his glory. Indeed, ſhould the Deity require our obedient regard to a poſitive precept, the utility of which we could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018009_0005_0FA460E30CFB0750"/>
we ſhould be indiſpenſably obliged to yield a ready ſubmiſſion to it, not doubting of the wiſdom and goodneſs of his deſign therein. His right to give law to us being founded in his abſolute propriety in us, we are bound to obey his precepts from a regard to his authority, excluſive of any conſideration of ſuitableneſs in the precepts themſelves to promote our own felicity. Nevertheleſs, whenever ſuch ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is apparent in any of his laws, it affords an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional argument for our compliance with them.</p>
            <p>IN every allowed inſtance of diſobedience we prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deny the authority of God over us, and contend with him for dominion.</p>
            <p>No partial regard to his commandments is ſufficient to ſave us from the imputation of <hi>ſtriving with him.</hi> St. James ſays, <hi>Whoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> chap. ii. v. 10. Whoſoever allowedly and habitually violates any one of the laws of God is guilty of a wicked contempt of his ſovereignty, and does not obey him in any inſtance from a proper affection to him and his government. The language of the practice of every perſon of ſuch a character is, That he will not have God to rule over him—that he is his own, and will pay no higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the laws of the Deity than is conſiſtent with the gratification of his own irregular and vicious incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. Men <hi>ſtrive with God,</hi> when they find fault with the diſpenſations of his grace.</p>
            <p>THE Father of mankind, in his abundant wiſdom, goodneſs and mercy, has contrived a method of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them from the ruins of the apoſtacy to his favour and happineſs. <hi>At ſundry times and in divers
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018009_0006_0FA460E49010D2D0"/>
manners</hi> has he made diſcoveries of his mind and will relating to this plan of grace. In the fulneſs of time he ſent his only begotten Son into the world to perfect what was wanting in preceeding revelations, and to exhibit to men a clear and full account of all thoſe things reſpecting their ſalvation, with which, in this ſtate of probation, infinite wiſdom ſaw fit to make them acquainted.</p>
            <p>THE atteſtations given to the revelation contained in the ſacred ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſtament are ample, illuſtrious, and worthy of God. Every ſerious, unprejudiced enquirer after truth ſoon feels their force, and is conſtrained to acknowledge the divinity of the religion taught in the Bible.</p>
            <p>THAT any ſhould find fault with a ſcheme of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo benevolent—ſo pure—ſo honorable to God, and advantageous to men—ſo admirably ſupported by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as well as internal evidence, is an argument of great blindneſs and obſtinacy.</p>
            <p>To creatures in our circumſtances of guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, who ſtand in abſolute need of a diſpenſation of grace, how welcome ought ſuch a diſpenſation to be! How worthy of the moſt grateful acceptation of <hi>all</hi> men is the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> revelation!</p>
            <p>No man, who rejects this revelation, either upon the ſuppoſition that it is needleſs, or on account of any difficulties with which ſome of its doctrines are attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, difficulties incomprehenſible by our limited under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings; or becauſe of the corruptions of its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; no man, who oppoſes or treats it with neglect and contempt, on any account whatever, can excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate himſelf from the charge of ſtriving with God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:018009_0007_0FA460E4ECF05D30"/>
To ſuppoſe ſupernatural revelation needleſs, implies, either a <hi>denial</hi> of a criminal departure in man from the ſtate of rectitude in which he was originally placed by God; or preſumption, that the uncovenanted good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God oblige him to pardon and receive into favour the guilty: Both of which are <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reject the Goſpel, on account of <hi>myſteries</hi> with which ſome of it's doctrines are attended, is highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, unleſs it be reaſonable to reject <hi>all</hi> religion on the ſame account. The religion of <hi>nature</hi> is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulties as incomprehenſible by us as any of the myſteries of the Chriſtian religion. Yes, if once it be admitted, that we can have no ſatisfactory evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of any thing we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, we muſt then commence univerſal ſcepticks, and doubt of the truth even of our own exiſtence, the manner of which is wholly unaccountable to us.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>corruptions</hi> of profeſſed Chriſtians, they are, indeed, a humbling conſideration; but theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Chriſtian religion is not accountable for. It every where diſcountenances and condemns them; and of all religions, that ever appeared in the world, is the beſt calculated to diſcourage vice, profanenſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality; and to promote the cauſe of piety, virtue and righteouſneſs. It gives the moſt pure and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the cleareſt and fulleſt inſtructions and directions reſpecting our temper and behaviour towards God, mankind and ourſelves, and enforces them with the moſt weighty, pungent and effectual arguments and motives; arguments and motives ſuperior to any that could have entered the human mind, without a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Heaven. And "notwithſtanding the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ſo complained of in the Chriſtian world, it is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018009_0008_0FA460E569911D00"/>
undeniable, that what there is of knowledge and true religion among men, is principally where Chriſtianity is profeſſed."</p>
            <p>To reject this religion, <hi>wherein God hath abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us in all wiſdom</hi> and goodneſs, is to fight againſt him in the moſt criminal and dangerous manner.</p>
            <p>MANY profeſſed Chriſtians <hi>virtually</hi> find fault with the goſpel diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>THE doctrines of Chriſtianity are truly humiliating—well calculated to bring down the pride of apoſtate men. Sinners, as we are taught in the book of inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are <hi>juſtified freely by God's grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins; that he might be juſt and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 24, 25, 26.</note>. This being God's method of juſtifying ſinners, whoſoever does not duly attend to it, but, like a ſelf-ſufficient Phariſee, <hi>goes about to eſtabliſh</hi> his <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> is guilty of ſtriving with his Maker, and attempting to force his way to heaven without <hi>ſubmitting</hi> himſelf <hi>to the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE is another ſort of men, who <hi>virtually</hi> find fault with the diſpenſation of grace by <hi>ſitting ſtill,</hi> and endeavouring nothing of a religious nature, becauſe of themſelves they can do nothing ſpiritually good.</p>
            <p>THE great God is ſovereign in the beſtowment of his favors; and for wiſe reaſons may ſee fit, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſuddenly to ſtop ſinners in their career of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and communicate to them, at once and unſought, the ſpecial renewing and ſanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit: But, ſince this is not his ordinary way

of dealing with thoſe whom he is graciouſly pleaſed to bring into a ſaving acquaintance with, and peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to himſelf—ſince he has given no particular ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners any encouragement that he will <hi>pour out his ſpirit upon them,</hi> unleſs they endeavour to <hi>turn at</hi> his <hi>reproof</hi>—unleſs they <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate</hi>—unleſs they <hi>labor for the meat which endureth unto everlaſting life;</hi>—unleſs they attend to the calls and invitations of the goſpel, cheriſh the good motions he is wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to all in common, who are favoured with the goſpel, and make ſome proper improvement of the means of grace; I ſay, ſince this is the caſe, every one who fits ſtill, or rather goes on in a courſe of ſin, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and deſpiſing the means of grace, faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, with an expectation of being renewed and made happy by the irreſiſtable grace of God, is juſtly chargeable with the ſin of oppoſing the glorious method of pardon, grace and ſalvation, publiſhed in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>OTHERS virtually find fault with the diſpenſation of the goſpel, by depending on ſuch a faith in the blood of Chriſt, for pardon and life everlaſting, as does not <hi>work by love, purify the heart</hi> and <hi>overcome the world.</hi> Whilſt they profeſs to own him as a Prieſt, they prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deny him as a King; and may juſtly be ranked with thoſe who refuſe to yield ſubmiſſion to God as their Law-giver.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, Men <hi>ſtrive with God</hi> when they are uneaſy with his ordering and diſpoſing of their circumſtances in a temporal view. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN they are diſcontented with the original conſtitution of things with reſpect to themſelves—ſuch as the figure of their bodies, the natural powers of their minds, the quality of their parents and relatives, and the infirmities of human nature.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:018009_0010_0FA460E6E4594858"/>
To complain of ſuch things, is as wicked and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous, in any of the human ſpecies, as to be uneaſy, becauſe they were not created angels and ranked with the higheſt order of them. <hi>Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why hoſt thou made me thus? Shall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands?</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY ſtrive with him in afflictions with which they are threatened or viſited.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN they uſe unlawful methods to prevent, ſupport themſelves under, or remove them.</p>
            <p>IT is natural to all threatened with calamity, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with trouble, to enquire how they may avoid it, or obtain ſupport under, or deliverance out of it. But by thoſe who have a proper regard for God an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful way of attaining help and deliverance is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as no way.</p>
            <p>IT is much better to ſuffer natural evil, than to do moral evil that good may come.</p>
            <p>WHEN there is no regular way of deliverance from affliction, it is evidently the will of God, that we ſhould bear it, patiently, for the preſent, and quietly wait till he ſhall pleaſe to remove it, or open a door for our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. In ſuch a caſe, to refuſe to receive correction—to take irregular courſes for the purpoſe of mitigating our ſorrows, or to fly out of the world in order to get rid of adverſity, is a daring oppoſition to God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays great want of manly fortitude and bravery.</p>

moſt trying calamities: But his anſwer was ſuch, as will forever do him honor, as a man, and a ſubject of the divine providential government. He ſaid unto her, "Thou ſpeakeſt as one of the fooliſh women ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>How mean and unmanly, in compariſon of Job's, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of that gloomy race of mortals, who have recourſe to the inſtruments of death under any ſevere affliction, who launch out into another world, weary of the pleaſures, or impatient under the pains of this? Who without underſtanding the value of life, or the true ends of living, contemptuouſly return back to God the preſent, which he has made, as if, what he, the author of every good gift, had beſtowed, was a trifle not worth the keeping? Their friends may view with weeping eyes, and even an unrelenting crowd with ſome concern, a <hi>mangled</hi> and <hi>disfigured carcaſe:</hi> But men of larger views will extend their reflections farther, and lament the miſeries of a <hi>wounded Spirit,</hi> which has ruſhed unprepared into the preſence of an incenſed Deity. A ghaſtly <hi>corpſe</hi> will give <hi>them</hi> the leaſt touches of compaſſion: But to conſider the caſe of a <hi>ſoul,</hi> that has done a fact which leaves no room for repentance, that has plunged it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an abyſs of endleſs miſery; to conſider that a new light is probably let in upon the unbodied mind, a light more ſharp, powerful and piercing, than even that inſtrument, which diſſolved the vital union, and divorced the ſoul from the body;—this is what will make the deepeſt impreſſions upon any <hi>thinking</hi> ſpectator God has joined ſoul and body together And <hi>what he has joined together, let no man,</hi> unauthoriſed by him, <hi>put aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> To commit ſelf-murder is an abſolute defiance, or a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate diſbelief of his providence. It is to diſmiſs <hi>ourſelves</hi> from this ſtate of probation, before God thinks fit to diſmiſs us: It is in effect to tell him, we will not patiently endure the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he wiſely inflicts.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo holy Job: He conſidered, that he, who ſent him into the world, alone knew when he had fulfilled thoſe ends for which he ſent him: That he alone therefore was a competent judge. when he was to be diſcharged from any further ſervice here, and to be admitted to a better ſtate. <hi>All my appointed time,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will I wait, till my change come.</hi>

2. MEN <hi>ſtrive with God</hi> in afflictions that are brought upon them, when they are ſullen under them.</p>
            <p>A mournful ſenſe of afflictions is allowable, if not commendable. Such is the conſtitution of man, and ſuch the deſire of happineſs implanted in the human breaſt by our great Creator, that what "oppoſes this deſire, or appears to have that tendency," will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of diſagreeable ſenſations, and affect us with grief. Not to be thus affected in a degree ſomewhat correſpondent to the adverſity with which we are viſited, would argue a deviation from the regular ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>A due ſenſibility with reſpect to afflictions renders them a proper means of promoting important moral purpoſes in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>BUT, there is a wide difference between a <hi>mournful ſenſe</hi> of misfortunes, and <hi>ſullenneſs</hi> under them: The <hi>former</hi> is ſuitable to the "law of our creation," and may be a powerful means of introducing into the ſoul that <hi>Godly ſorrow,</hi> which <hi>worketh repentance to ſalvation not to be repented of:</hi> Whereas the <hi>latter</hi> is a <hi>ſorrow</hi> that <hi>worketh death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſuffer grief ſo far to exceed its real cauſe as to bear no proportion to it;—to refuſe to be comforted; to give place to melancholy ſo far as to become unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the neceſſary duties of life,—for the thankful enjoyment of the remaining bleſſings of goodneſs,—for entertaining worthy thoughts of God, and juſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent ſentiments with reſpect to our fellow-creatures; this is abſolutely wrong: It is an implicit denial of the juſtice, the wiſdom, the goodneſs of Providence.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:018009_0013_0FA460E9345AC178"/>
3. THEY <hi>ſtrive with God</hi> in afflictions, when, inſtead of improving them to good purpoſe, they grow no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but wax worſe under them.</p>
            <p>GOD <hi>doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> Did we not refuſe to be drawn <hi>with the cords of love, and the bands of a man,</hi> he would not take harſh methods with us. By our obſtinacy and perverſeneſs we "conſtrain him, and almoſt force him againſt his inclination" to treat us with ſeverity.</p>
            <p>"AND yet, when he comes to take this courſe with us, he ſtill, like a kind and tender hearted father, aims at our benefit and advantage. He deſigns kindneſs to the ſons of men by all thoſe judgments which do not kill them, and cut them off from the opportunity and poſſibility of improving them. If he ſends evils upon us, it is that thereby he may do us ſome greater good: If he afflicts us, it is not becauſe it is pleaſant to him to deal harſhly with us, but becauſe it is profitable and neceſſary for us to be ſo dealt with: And if at any time he imbitter our lives by miſeries and ſufferings, it is becauſe he is loth to ſee us periſh in pleaſant ways, and chuſeth rather to be ſomewhat ſevere towards us, than ſuffer us to be utterly undone."</p>
            <p>AFFLICTIONS have a natural tendency to bring men to conſideration, and, in the hand of providence, are a moſt powerful means of repentance. Elihu repreſents their good effects upon ſinners in ſuch language as this, <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they be bound in fetters, and held in cords of affliction; then God ſheweth them their work, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that they have exceeded. He openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job, xxxvi. 8, 9, 10,</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS being the deſign and tendency of afflictions, <hi>ſurely it is meet to be ſaid unto God,</hi> by every one who is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018009_0014_0FA460E9F2416AE0"/>
brought into circumſtances of adverſity, <hi>I have born chaſtiſement, I will not offend any more. That which I ſee not teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxxiv. 31, 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>DAVID, upon whom they had their genuine effects, acknowledged, and ſaid, <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are right, and that in faithfulneſs thou haſt afflicted me. It is good for me that I have been afflicted. Before I was afflicted I went aſtray; but now have I kept thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT, to pay no attention to the voice of Providence in afflictions, to conduct under them like Pharaoh, who as God multiplied his judgments upon him, <hi>ſinned yet more, and hardened his heart,</hi> is to ſtrive with God, as if ſinners were reſolved that he ſhould not have the maſtery.</p>
            <p>PERSONS of ſuch a character have great reaſon to fear, leſt God ſhould <hi>let them alone,</hi> leſt he ſhould give them over to judicial <hi>blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart,</hi> and leave them, without check or controul, to <hi>treaſure up unto themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> I proceed,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, To ſhew the great guilt and danger of <hi>ſtriving with</hi> God, our <hi>Maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS I will endeavour, briefly, by conſidering that they, who ſtrive with their Maker, are guilty of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their rightful Lord and Sovereign, who alone can make them happy, in thoſe methods he is graciouſly pleaſed to take for the promotion of that benevolent purpoſe, and are continually liable to be expoſed to his vindictive diſpleaſure, and will finally be made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of his eternal vengeance, if they perſiſt in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his compaſſionate efforts to ſave them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018009_0015_0FA460EAC5B75548"/>
1. THEY are guilty of oppoſing their ſupreme Lord and Sovereign in thoſe methods he is graciouſly pleaſed to take for the promotion of their beſt happineſs.</p>
            <p>As our lawgiver God may well be conſidered as our benefactor. We need directions for the regulation of our temper and behaviour. Being formed with capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for moral government, we cannot be happy without well ordered actions and inclinations. Such is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the divine commands that <hi>in keeping them there is great reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A GRAND deſign of the diſpenſations of his grace is, to rectify the diſorders into which we have run by our diſregard to his holy law,—to reduce us to ſubmiſſion to his government—to ſettle and eſtabliſh in our ſouls that <hi>kingdom,</hi> which conſiſts in <hi>righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH this benevolent deſign all God's providential dealings with us truly harmonize.—This being the caſe; What baſeneſs! What ingratitude! What folly is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſin of ſtriving with him! In oppoſing him we oppoſe our own moſt important intereſt. Sad beyond expreſſion would be our caſe ſhould God leave us under the power of a carnal mind. Sin carries much of its own puniſhment with it: The confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order into which it plunges the ſoul are very fearful.</p>
            <p>GREATLY alarming is their condition who contend with God: They are chargeable with the guilt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning his infinite Majeſty, vilifying his wiſdom, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging his juſtice, abuſing his goodneſs and defying his power, as if they were ſtronger than he. His pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will not endure forever. His ſpirit will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrive with man. Which brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:018009_0016_0FA460EC47F5A8A0"/>
2. THAT all who ſtrive with God are continually li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be made examples of his vindictive diſpleaſure, and will finally be monuments of his eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, if they perſiſt in oppoſing his compaſſionate efforts to ſave them from periſhing.</p>
            <p>WE are abſolutely in his hands. It is not for want of power to puniſh that he bears with any who treat him with indignity. Whenever he pleaſes, he can <hi>eaſe himſelf of his adverſaries, and avenge himſelf of his enemies</hi>—he can pour out upon them the vials of his hot diſpleaſure, which will make them curſe their folly in riſing up againſt and contending with him.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Wo</hi> denounced by him no one can eſcape, who continues to oppoſe his adminiſtration. There is an appointed "day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, when he will render to every man according to his deeds: To them, who by patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honor and immortality, eternal life: but unto them that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; indignation and wrath; tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doeth evil".<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. ii 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> At that great and terrible day "the Lord Jeſus," by whom God will judge the world, "ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power"<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. i. 7, 8, 9.</note>. It remains for me,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, To make an application of the ſubject to the preſent very ſolemn and awful occaſion.</p>
            <p>

THE very ſhocking and execrable deeds perpetrated laſt Wedneſday morning by a man in this ſociety have led me to the obſervations in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>THAT a perſon, favoured with Chriſtian light and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, who appeared to be an affectionate huſband, and a tender, fond parent, ſhould, with deliberation and in cool blood, maſſacre an amiable wife, and four lovely and promiſing children, and then take away his own life, is an event ſo extraordinary, ſurpriſing, and unheard of, that we can ſcarcely believe it a reality, though the corpſes of the unhappy woman and children, with the moſt affecting marks of violence upon them, are here preſent before our eyes.</p>
            <p>HAD he left no written account of his intentions and views reſpecting the deſtruction of himſelf and family, we ſhould have been ready to conſider it as the effect of a ſudden and moſt vehement frenzy. But by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he appears to have had it in contemplation for three years.</p>
            <p>THE time he firſt fixed upon for carrying into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution his horrid and deteſtable purpoſe was the 18th of laſt month. Not long before this he writes thus: "I mean to cloſe the eyes of ſix perſons thro' perfect humanity, and the moſt endearing fondneſs and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for mortal father never felt more of theſe tender ties than myſelf.—How I ſhall really perform the taſk I have undertaken I know not 'till the moment arrives; But I believe I ſhall perform it as deliberately, and as ſteadily as I would go to ſupper, or to bed."</p>
            <p>IN one of the laſt letters he wrote, there is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage: "Any man that undertakes any great affair, and at the ſame time thinks, ought to be very deliberate indeed; and think and reflect again and again.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018009_0018_0FA460EDEF3F4E70"/>
On the morning of the ſixth of December I roſe before the ſun, felt calm, and left my wife between ſleep and wake, went into the room where my infants lay, found them all ſound aſleep; the means of death were with me, but I had not before determined whether to ſtrike or not, but yet thought it a good opportunity. I ſtood over them, and aſked my God whether it was right or not, now to ſtrike; but no anſwer came: nor I believe ever does to man while on earth. I then examined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, there was neither fear, trembling nor horror about me. I then went into a chamber next to that, to look at myſelf in the glaſs; but I could diſcover no alteration in my countenance or feelings: this is true as God reigns, but for further trial I yet poſtponed it." And when the fatal morning was come it does not appear by any one circumſtance, but that he ſet himſelf about and went thro' the abominable work of murdering his wife, four children and himſelf, with as much ſteadineſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and firmneſs as he ſuppoſed he ſhould.</p>
            <p>What a monſter of a man was this! What were his principles that could lead him into ſuch deteſtable and more than ſavage conduct? Surely it concerns us to know that we may guard againſt and avoid them as moſt pernicious to individuals and ſocieties. Theſe he has left a written account of.</p>
            <p>SPEAKING of the Chriſtian religion he ſays, "It is a moſt benevolent ſyſtem, and would produce grand effects, if it was really believed and univerſally practiſed. I firmly believed it for many years; but my adherence to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts when every one elſe forſook them, has been my bane on earth: But never mind that, if it is really true I ſhall be ſaved by it yet. And now I muſt generouſly own, that I have as many doubts about the truth of that, as I have about the truth of any other ſcheme of religion,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018009_0019_0FA460F0D2BA47F0"/>
that ever appeared in the world.—When I conſider men as Chriſtians, I look on them as free agents; I have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined both old and new Teſtaments, and muſt think <hi>that</hi> is their true meaning and intent. But when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider man as a Deiſt, or one that does not believe revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I think him a perfect machine, and that he can do nothing, but as he is operated upon by ſome ſuperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—I have renounced all the popular religions in the world, and mean to die a proper Deiſt. I really think that there never was any thing done wrong in the world, but believe that all is right;—that we are all impell'd to ſay and act, every thing that we do ſay and act.—That a tyrant king, or two or three fierce republicans deluging three quarters of the world in blood—that my killing my family—that a man's deſtroying a neſt of waſps, or a fly, is as much directed by the hand of heaven as the making this whole world was—And if this is the caſe there is no ſuch thing as ſin."</p>
            <p>THUS he frankly owns, that he had apoſtatized from the Chriſtian religion and embraced the principles of deiſm and fataliſm,—that he believed men to be meer machines, and God the author of all their actions in ſuch a ſenſe as to exclude the poſſibility of ſin from the world. The idea of future puniſhment he alſo rejects, as inconſiſtent with the goodneſs of God, though he ſays, "I know by experience there is no want of hells in this ſtate of things." And ſeems to be full in the opinion that he and his ſhall be happy in the future world whether he be right or not in rejecting the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian revelation.</p>
            <p>THESE principles appear to have had a main influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in reconciling him to actions which have a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident criminality in them, and which every man's mind, at firſt view, cannot but abhor and condemn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018009_0020_0FA460F1DA31F690"/>
PRIDE, impatience, and cowardice firſt led him to think of deſtroying himſelf and family, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated powerfully in bringing him to determine upon it. He had a high opinion of his intellectual abilities; and was uneaſy with the meanneſs of his perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſlenderneſs of his fortune. He writes, "My perſon is ſmall and mean to look on, and my circumſtances were always rather narrow; which were great diſadvantages in this world: But I have great reaſon to think that my ſoul is above the common mould.—There are but few men capable of deiſm; they are when found like a diamond among a million of pebbles."</p>
            <p>HE murmured and complained of Providence in the following language: "I was determined not to haſten the matter" (of deſtroying himſelf and family) "but kept hoping that yet Providence would turn up ſome thing to prevent it, if the intent were wrong: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that every circumſtance, from the greateſt to the ſmalleſt trifle, during the whole of that term" (i. e. three years) "and long before, only tended to convince me that the utmoſt malevolence of fortune was, and is, againſt me, on earth. I have born the "ſtings and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of outrageous fortune" long enough; and "by oppoſing I can only end them."</p>
            <p>BEING too haughty to ſubmit to the humbling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence, and not having fortitude and courage enough to encounter and ſuſtain the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies ariſing from ſtraitened circumſtances, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>cowardly</hi> thought of flying from them and taking ſanctuary in the unknown world: But the guilt and danger of ſuch conduct, upon ſuppoſition of the truth of the ſacred ſcriptures, were to apparent to ſuffer him to reſolve upon it, before he had brought himſelf
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018009_0021_0FA460F239EE0C30"/>
to diſbelieve and reject them. And to render it ſtill leſs hazardous in his view he gave into the fataliſtic ſcheme, judging God to be ſo far the author of all the actions of men as to allow them no other agency than that of meer machines; and upon this Hypotheſis concluded that there is no ſin. In which he is doubtleſs more conſiſtent than thoſe who admit the ſame hypotheſis, and yet hold that men are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for their conduct.</p>
            <p>BUT even ſuch a view of the actions of men, added to his profeſſed diſbelief of the Revelation of the Bible and future puniſhment, was not ſufficient fully to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy him with reſpect to his ſafety in perpretating deeds ſo unnatural and atrocious; and therefore he called in the aid of fanaticiſm and ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>IN one of his letters he ſays, "You may believe the hand of heaven is in this matter. I uſed to be a great enemy to ſuperſtition: But, however it is, I have lately had ſundry intimations, I really think, from God to convince me that I am right; but theſe I ſhall not deſcribe.—I mentioned before, that my wife had a dream concerning this affair," (which in another pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, dated November 18, he relates in theſe words: "Yeſterday morning ſhe told me her dream—that ſhe thought I had wrote many papers, and was earneſtly concerned about her—that theſe papers were ſpotted with blood—that ſhe alſo ſaw a man wound himſelf paſt recovery; and blood guggle (as ſhe expreſſed it) from different parts of his body. Poor woman! She little thought that the greater part of that dream would be realized within three days—But I am unappalled and think the hand of heaven is really with us.") "She has ſince had two more—one of them, That ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized, and liable to great puniſhment—that it
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018009_0022_0FA460F2EA60B970"/>
created great confuſion; but ſhe afterwards got free and was happy. From her excellence of heart I have no doubt but this will be the caſe with her. On the thankſgiving night ſhe dreamed that her three daughters all lay dead, and they even froze in that ſituation; and even yet I am little affected. O my God, wonderful indeed are thy works; in the higheſt wiſdom haſt thou contrived them all! All muſt be right, or I am har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened indeed.—Some of theſe will be called the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the devil: But men may rely upon it, that I have ever truſted in a much higher power; and 'tis he alone that now directs me and ſupports me."</p>
            <p>IN another letter, ſpeaking of the intended maſſacre of himſelf and family, he ſays: "In fine clear days, when I am moſt chearful, and in a morning when I firſt wake, free from any diſturbance, I ſeem to be convinced in a ſteady, calm and reaſonable way, that it is appointed for me to do it—that it is my duty and that it muſt be done. That it is God himſelf that prompts and directs me, in all my reflections and circumſpection, I really believe. But if it ſhould at laſt prove <hi>Mr.</hi> Devil, or any other evil ſpirit, all that I can ſay about it is, that I was born a very unlucky fellow."</p>
            <p>DREADFUL deluſion! Strange inconſiſtencies! Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaſphemy! How ſurprizing is it, that a man, who rejects the infallible evidences in favour of the divinity of the Chriſtian religion, a religion which he allows to be <hi>moſt benevolent,</hi> and with whom it ſeems to be a maxim, that God never makes an extraordinary revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf to man while upon earth, ſhould pretend, and be confident, that He has given him ſundry inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that he is <hi>right</hi> in forming, and taking meaſures to carry into execution, deſigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the light of nature as <hi>abſolutely wrong,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:018009_0023_0FA460F3C813DF00"/>
and which no man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>whoſe conſcience is not ſeared as with a hot iron,</hi> can think of without abhorrence! How ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, that one, who ranked himſelf among the few ſublime geniuſes, who only, as he ſuppoſed, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of deiſm, that is, of withſtanding the force of the mighty evidence in ſupport of the divine authority of the Bible, ſhould produce his wife's dreams and his own feelings at her narration of them as a convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the hand of heaven was with him! Such dreams, related in the manner we may ſuppoſe they were by her, had a natural tendency to move the tender paſſions, and give a check to his pernicious deſigns. This he ſeemed to be aware of, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his being <hi>unaffected</hi> and <hi>unappalled</hi> as owing either to ſupernatural divine help and ſupport, or to his own hardneſs; the <hi>latter</hi> he would not admit: How aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing that he could imagine it to be the <hi>former!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT why do I ſay aſtoniſhing? Can any thing be ſo in one, who, in an enlightened age, ſo far ſets himſelf againſt God as to reject a revelation attended with all the evidence, both internal and external, of it's divine original, that the nature of the thing will admit?</p>
            <p>CAN any thing be ſurpriſing in one, who in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the light of reaſon, and his own conſciouſneſs of human liberty and free agency, conſiders man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as perfect machines, and God as the efficient cauſe of all the actions of wicked men?</p>
            <p>CAN we ſuppoſe any opinion too abſurd to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch an one—any inconſiſtency too glaring for him to be guilty of?</p>
            <p>CAN we ſuppoſe it ſtrange, that ſuch an one ſhould be given over by God to <hi>ſtrong deluſion, that he ſhould believe a lie, that he might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs?</hi>
            </p>

THE horrid deeds perpetrated by this man under the influence of ſuch principles, are a more effectual confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe principles, than any it is in the power of language to produce.</p>
            <p>The terrible judgment of heaven in permitting one, who prided himſelf in the character of a deiſt and fataliſt, to be carried by his error to ſo dreadful a length as with deliberation and diſpaſſion to murder himſelf and his whole family, I am ready to think, will, wherever it is known, ſtrike terror into the minds of all who glory in ſuch a character, if any thing will produce ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhort of the coming of the Judge of the world in flaming fire, to take vengeance on his enemies.</p>
            <p>IF any dare avow ſuch principles after they have been acted out in this moſt awful manner, and we have ſuch ſhocking evidence of their miſchievous and fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they ought to be treated as perſons moſt dangerous to ſociety.</p>
            <p>How greatly to be dreaded are all who embrace ſuch principles?</p>
            <p>How unfit are ſuch perſons to be intruſted either with private or public important affairs, whatever their accompliſhments may be in other reſpects?</p>
            <p>How unſafe muſt a woman, or family be in the hands of a man under the influence of ſuch principles? His affection, his fondneſs for them inſtead of being their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity may prove the very occaſion of their deſtruction. This was the caſe with the unhappy woman and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whoſe remains are here before us.</p>
            <p>IT is a very threatning aſpect upon us that there are ſo many in this land, a land greatly diſtinguiſhed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018009_0025_0FA460F522167C78"/>
of religious light and liberty, who ſcoff at and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule the glorious goſpel of the bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>O THAT all, who thus ſtrive with their Maker and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, might be awakened by his voice, which cries with ſuch terrible accents in this event, and alarmed with a ſenſe of their guilt and danger.</p>
            <p>BUT if ſuch bold oppoſers of God are become ſo far judicially blinded, that the things of their peace ſhall be forever hidden from their eyes; yet it is hoped that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are not fixed in looſe principles, though often guilty of thinking and ſpeaking lightly of the doctrines of Chriſtianity, will take the alarm, and beware <hi>leſt they be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL who are impatient under adverſe providences, being diſpoſed to murmur and complain, and take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful methods for relief, have great reaſon to tremble.</p>
            <p>BY thus ſtriving againſt God they diſhonor and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to anger. Should he leave them to themſelves they would purſue meaſures that would end in their eternal ruin.</p>
            <p>IT becomes us as men, and eſpecially as Chriſtians, to endure afflictions with humility, patience and fortitude, and learn in whatſoever ſtate we are therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>HAD the unhappy man, who choſe to deſtroy himſelf and family rather than live in a ſtyle below what he vainly imagined became a perſon of his conſequence, been contented with food and raiment which he had, and might have procured—had he been humble—had he not diſtruſted God, he might have been among the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his ſeaſon of probation lengthened out; but
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018009_0026_0FA460F8310BFC08"/>
giving way to pride and impatience he was permitted to commit crimes of great magnitude, the laſt of which he could have no opportunity to repent of, and his account is ſealed up to the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>THAT he ſhould be ſuffered to manage his helliſh purpoſes with ſuch ſecrecy for ſo long a time, and at laſt put them into execution unſuſpected, is one of the deep things of God which calls for humiliation.</p>
            <p>—WE we are now come together to ſolemnize the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rites of the victims who fell a ſacrifice to a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's and father's dreadful error, and to lament their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſingular fate. They have no relatives preſent to mourn for them. The countenances and tears of this large aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly make it manifeſt that every one is affected with grief, and diſpoſed to bewail their untimely, ſudden and ſhocking death.</p>
            <p>WHILST we weep for the very unfortunate woman and children who are not—let us think with tender ſympathy of her aged ſurviving mother and other near relatives at a diſtance, and pray for them—that they may be prepared for evil tidings—that their hearts may be fixed truſting in the Lord, and that they may have all that divine ſupport and conſolation which ſuch a very ſingular trial and affliction may call for.</p>
            <p>To draw to a cloſe—</p>
            <p>LET us all lay it to heart, that <hi>it is appointed to all men once to die, but after this is the judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE day and manner of our death we know not. Our times are in the hand of God. It is of the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance that we make our peace with him before it be too late. The awful event which has brought together ſuch a concourſe of people, at this time, is a moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018009_0027_0FA460F921187D08"/>
and alarming evidence of the dreadful depravity of human nature and the great danger of ſtriving with our Maker.</p>
            <p>IT is aſtoniſhing to think what crimes the human mind is capable of when left to itſelf. Did not God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in righteous judgment take off his reſtraint from ſinners, we ſhould not believe it poſſible for them to riſe to ſuch a pitch of inhumanity and wickedneſs as ſome have done.</p>
            <p>LET us be afraid to <hi>ſtrive with our Maker</hi> and oppoſe him in any way whatever. None <hi>ever hardened themſelves againſt him and proſpered.</hi> Wherein any of us have ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with him may we be engaged to do ſo no more; but be ſolicitous heartily to ſubmit to his laws, which are all <hi>holy, juſt and good—</hi> thankfully to receive the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his grace—humbly acquieſce in his afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence and cheerfully comply with the kind deſigns of it.</p>
            <p>AND may the Lord be pleaſed to pour out his ſpirit upon us all, and bring every thought, inclination and deſire of our ſouls into a compleat ſubjection to his will, that we <hi>way be found of him in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs</hi> at the great day of his appearing.</p>

            <head>A LETTER from a Gentleman in We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield, to his Friend, containing a Narrative of the Life of William Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (ſo far as it is known) and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Maſſacre of himſelf and Family.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS not ſtrange that reports various and contradictory ſhould have circulated on ſo intereſting and terrible a ſubject as that of a man's conſigning to the grave himſelf and family in a moment of apparent eaſe and tranquility. The agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind which muſt be the conſequence of being near ſuch a ſcene of horror, will ſufficiently apologize for not anſwering your requeſt for the particulars e'er this. Our ignorance of the hiſtory of this man at firſt precluded a poſſibility of giving you ſatisfaction on this head. Perhaps no one in this town had more favorable opportunities of obtaining the particulars of his hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: yet, could never induce him to mention a ſingle ſyllable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his age, parentage, or early occupation. To have aſked him directly would have been rude when he evidently meant to be ſilent on theſe ſubjects. My conjecture was, that he was the natural ſon of ſome gentleman in England, and that he had been brought up in or near London, and had been about the Court. Since his deceaſe have been able to learn from undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed authority, that he was born in the county of Eſſex, in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage not very far from London. As to his buſineſs in youth am ſtill left in the dark, but find he has once mentioned to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſome little incidents which happened to him while in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with his father, and that he very early became acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a club in London who were Deiſts, where 'tis probable he received the firſt rudiments in thoſe principles. While in England, where he left a mother and ſiſter, he had a fair cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for integrity and honeſty. In the year 1755 he went out to the iſland of Barbadoes, in the family of Charles Pinfold, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018009_0029_0FA460FA96674E48"/>
Governor of that iſland, where he tarried ſix years, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to England, purchaſed ſome merchandize, and from thence came to New-York in the year 1762, and immediately removed to Stratford in this State, from thence to Derby, and then to Fairfield, where he married and dwelt ſome years.—By this time he had acquired about twelve hundred pounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, with which he removed to this town, about ten years ſince, where he reſided until his death. His buſineſs was that of retailing, he formerly credited his goods, but ſince his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in this town he has refuſed to give any credit, intending to keep his property within his own reach, believing it always ſecure while his eye was upon it. While here he added conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his ſtock, none of which he ever veſted in real eſtate; the Continental currency taught him that wealth could take to itſelf wings and fly away: Notwithſtanding all his vigilance.</p>
            <p>When the war commenced he had on hand a very handſome aſſortment of Goods for a country ſtore, which he ſold for the currency of the country, without any advance in the price<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the money he laid by, waiting and expecting the time would ſoon arrive when he might therewith replace his goods, reſolving not to part with it until it ſhould be in as good demand as when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him. His expectations from this quarter daily leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, finally loſt all hope, and was thrown into a ſtate little better than diſpair, as appears from his writtings; he adopted a plan of the moſt rigid family oeconomy, but ſtill kept up the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of his former affluence, and ever to the laſt entertained his friend with his uſual decent hoſpitality, although nothing appeared in his outward deportment, which evinced the uncommon pride of his heart; his writings ſhew clearly that he was determined not to bear the mortification of being thought by his friends poor and dependent. On this ſubject he expreſſes himſelf in the following extraordinary manner: "If a man, who has once lived well, meant well and done well, falls by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable accident into poverty, and then ſubmits to be laughed at, deſpiſed and trampled on, by a ſet of mean wretches as far below him as the moon is below the ſun; I ſay, if ſuch a man ſubmits, he muſt become meaner than meanneſs itſelf, and I ſincerely wiſh he might have ten years added to his natural life to puniſh him for his folly."</p>
            <p>He fixed upon the night ſucceeding the 18th of November for the execution of his nefarious purpoſe, and procured a ſupper of oyſters, of which the family eat very plentifully; that evening he writes as follows: "I have prepared a noble ſupper of oyſters, that my flock and I may eat and drink together, thank God and die." After ſupper he ſent the maid with a ſtudied errand to a friend's houſe at ſome diſtance, directing her to ſtay until ſhe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018009_0030_0FA460FB29006A08"/>
obtained an anſwer to an inſignificant letter he wrote his friend intending ſhe ſhould not return that evening—ſhe did however return, perhaps her return diſconcerted him and prevented him for that time. The next day he carried his piſtols to a ſmith for repair; it may be, the ill condition of his piſtols might be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reaſon for the delay.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the 10th of December ſome perſons were with him at his houſe, to whom he appeared as chearful and ſerene as uſual; he attended to the little affairs of his family as if nothing uncommon was in contemplation. The company left him about nine o'clock in the evening, when he was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent as uſual for their ſtay; whether he ſlept that night is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but it is believed he went to bed. The children and maid ſlept in one chamber; in the grey of the morning of the 11th of December he went to their bed chamber, awaked the maid and ordered her to ariſe gently without diſturbing the children; when ſhe came down ſtairs he gave her a line to the family phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who lived at the diſtance of a quarter of a mile, ordered her to carry it immediately, at the ſame time declaring that Mrs. Beadle had been ill all night, and directing her to ſtay until the phyſician ſhould come with her; this he repeated ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times with a degree of ardor. There is much reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he had murdered Mrs. Beadle before he awaked the maid. Upon the maid's leaving the houſe he immediately proceeded to execute his purpoſe on the children and himſelf. It appears he had for ſome time before, carried to his bed ſide every night an ax and a carving knife; he ſmote his wife and each of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with the ax on the ſide of the head as they lay ſleeping in their beds; the woman had two wounds in the head, the ſcull of each of them was fractured; he then with the carving knife cut their throats from ear to ear; the woman and little boy were drawn partly over the ſide of their beds, as if to prevent the bedding from being beſmeared with blood; the three daughters were taken from the bed and laid upon the floor ſide by ſide, like three lambs, before their throats were cut; they were covered with a blanket, and the woman's face with an handkerchief. He then proceeded to the lower floor of the houſe, leaving marks of his footſteps in blood on the ſtairs, carrying with him the ax and knife, the latter he laid upon the table in the room where he was found, reeking with the blood of his family. Perhaps he had thoughts he might uſe it againſt himſelf if his piſtols ſhould fail; it appears he then ſeated himſelf in a Windſor chair, with his arms ſupported by the arms of the chair; he fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the muzles of the piſtols into his two ears and fired them at the ſame inſtant: the balls went through the head in tranſverſe directions. Although the neighbours were very near and ſome
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018009_0031_0FA460FDDE107110"/>
of them awake, none heard the report of the piſtols. The capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal facts of the maſſacre you have ſeen in the public papers; a minute detail was too horrible to be given at firſt, until the mind (eſpecially of the relatives of the unhappy woman) had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it by a ſummary narrative, and even now 'tis enough to give feelings to apathy itſelf to relate the horrid tale.</p>
            <p>The line to the phyſician obſcurely announced the intentions of the man; the houſe was ſoon opened, but alas too late! The bodies were pale and motionleſs, ſwimming in their blood, their faces white as mountain ſnow, yet life ſeemed to tremble on their lips; deſcription can do no more than ſaintly ape and trifle with the real figure.</p>
            <p>Such a tragical ſcene filled every mind with the deepeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; nature recoiled and was on the rack with diſtorting paſſions; the moſt poignant ſorrow and tender pity for the lady and her innocent babes, who were the hapleſs victims of the brutal, ſtudied cruelty of an huſband and father, in whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces they expected to find ſecurity, melted every heart.—Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effects of pride and falſe notions about religion.</p>
            <p>To paint the firſt tranſports this affecting ſcene produced, when the houſe was opened, is beyond my reach.—Multitudes of all ages and ſexes were drawn together by the ſad tale.—The very in moſt ſouls of the beholders were wounded at the ſight, and torn bycontending paſſions: Silent grief, with marks of aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were ſucceeded by furious indignation againſt the author of the affecting ſpectacle, which vented itſelf in incoherent excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.—Some old ſoldiers accidentally paſſing thro' the town that morning, on their way from camp to viſit their friends, led by curioſity turned in, to view the ſad remains; on ſight of the woman and her tender offspring, notwithſtanding all their firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the tender ſympathetic tear ſtealing gently down their furrowed cheeks, betrayed the anguiſh of their hearts; on being ſhewed the body of the ſacrificer they pauſed a moment, then muttering forth an oath or two of execration, with their eyes fixed on the ground in ſilent ſorrow, they ſlowly went their way. So awful and terrible a diſaſter wrought wonderfully on the minds of the neighbourhood; nature itſelf ſeemed ruſtled, and refuſed the kindly aid of balmy ſleep for a time.</p>
            <p>Near the cloſe of the day on the 12th of December, the bodies being ſtill unburied, the people, who had collected in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, grew almoſt frantic with rage, and in a manner demanded the body of the murderer; the law being ſilent on the ſubject, it was difficult to determine where decency required the body ſhould be placed, many propoſed it ſhould be in an ignominious manner where four roads met, without any coffin or inſignia of reſpect, and perforated by a ſtake. Upon which a queſtion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018009_0032_0FA460FF6E39C168"/>
aroſe, where that place could be found which might be unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the neighbourhood—but no one would conſent it ſhould be near his houſe or land. After ſome conſultation it was thought beſt to place it on the bank of the river between high and low water mark; the body was handed out of the window and bound with cords on a fled, with the cloaths on as it was found, and the bloody knife tied on his breaſt, without coffin or box, and the horſe he uſually rode was made faſt to the ſled—the horſe, unaccumſtomed to the draught, proceeded with great unſteadineſs, ſometimes running full ſpeed, then ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, followed by a multitude, until arriving at the water's edge, the body was tumbled into a hole dug for the purpoſe, like the carcaſe of a beaſt. Not many days after there appeared an uneaſineſs in ſundry perſons at placing the body ſo near a ferry much frequented; ſome threatnings were given out that the body ſhould be taken up and a ſecond time expoſed to view. It was thought prudent it ſhould be removed, and ſecretly depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome obſcure ſpot, it was accordingly removed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſecrecy; notwithſtanding which ſome children acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſcovered the place, and the early freſhes partly waſhed up the body, and it has had a ſecond remove to a place where it is hoped mankind will have no further vexation with it.</p>
            <p>On the 13th of December the bodies of the murdered were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a manner much unlike that of the unnatural murderer.—The remains of the children were borne by a ſuitable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of equal age, attended with a ſad proceſſion of youths of the town, all bathed in tears; ſide by ſide the hapleſs woman's corpſe was carried in ſolemn proceſſion to the pariſh church yard, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a great concourſe, who with affectionate concern and every token of reſpect were anxious to expreſs their heart-felt ſorrow in performing the laſt mournful duties.</p>
            <p>The perſon of Mr. Beadle was ſmall, his features ſtriking and full of expreſſion, with the aſpect of fierceneſs and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; his mind was contemplative, when once he had formed an opinion, was remarkably tenacious; as a merchant or trader, he was eſteemed a man of ſtrict honor and integrity, and would not deſcend to any low or mean artifice to advance his fortune. He was turned of 52 years of age when he died.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Beadle was born at Plymouth, in Maſſachuſetts, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable parents—a comely perſon, of good addreſs, well bred, unuſually ſerene, ſincere, unaffected and ſenſible; died in the middle of life, aged 32 years.</p>
            <p>The children (the eldeſt of which was a ſon, aged 12 years, the other three, daughters, the youngeſt aged 6 years) were ſuch as cheared the hearts of their parents, who were uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fond of diſplaying their little virtues and excellencies,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018009_0033_0FA46100B109E0F8"/>
and ſeemed to anticipate a continuance of growing parental ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; alas, like early tender buds nipped by untimely froſts, they did but begin to live!</p>
            <p>It is more than probable, this man had for months paſt deſired that ſome or all of his children might be taken out of the world by accident; be removed all means of ſecurity from a well near his houſe, which he was careful heretofore to keep covered. His little boy he often ſent to ſwim in the river, and has been heard to chide the child for not venturing further into deep water than his fears would ſuffer him. He has at times declared it would give him no pain or uneaſineſs to follow his children to the grave—his acquaintance knew theſe expreſſions could not ariſe from want of affection or tenderneſs for his children, but rather imagined him ſpeaking raſhly in jeſt. He ever ſpoke lightly of death as a bugbear the world cauſleſsly feared. It appears from his writings, he at firſt had doubts whether it was juſt and reaſonable for him to deprive his wife of life, and offers againſt it, only this reaſon, that he had no hand in bringing her into exiſtence, and conſequently had no power over her life.—She ſet out about the firſt of November on a journey to Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, which he thought was by direction of Heaven to clear him of his doubts and remove her out of the way, at the time the buſineſs was to be done; and his intention was to have executed his deſign on himſelf and children in her abſence. She proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further than New-Haven, and by reaſon of ſome diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, returned ten days earlier than expected; he appeared chagrin'd at her early return, and ſoon began to invent ſome juſtifying reaſons for depriving her of life alſo. He finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it would be unmerciful to leave her behind to languiſh out a life in miſery and wretchedneſs, which muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſurprizing death of the reſt of the family, and that ſince they had ſhared the frowns and ſmiles of fortune to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it would be cruelty to her, to be divided from them in death.</p>
            <p>'Tis very natural for you to aſk, whether it was poſſible a man could be tranſformed from an affectionate huſband and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent parent to a ſecret murderer, without ſome previous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, which muſt have been noticed by the family or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? Yet this was the caſe in this inſtance, there was no viſible alteration in his conduct. It appears by his writings that he thought he had a right to deprive himſelf of life and intended to exerciſe that right if ever he ſhould think himſelf unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the extenſion of this right to his children, was very eaſy. 'Tis probable, the principle had grown up gradually to the laſt ſtage. Since his death I have ſeen a letter he wrote to a friend as early as 1777, in which he has an expreſſion like this—"I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018009_0034_0FA4610141F66160"/>
I and my family ſhall not live to ſee the end of the war."—It was then underſtood to mean nothing more than his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the war would continue a long time, his late conduct has explained it very differently—Whether Mrs. Beadle had any fears of his evil intentions or not, is uncertain, that ſhe had fears ſome great calamity would befal the family is evident, both from what ſhe ſaid, and what he has left in writing.—He writes on the 18th of November, that on the morning of the 17th ſhe told him, "She dreamed he had wrote many papers, and was earneſtly concerned for her, and that thoſe papers were ſpotted with blood; and that ſhe alſo ſaw a man wound himſelf paſt recovery and blood guggle (as ſhe expreſſed it) from different parts of his body."—In another letter, of a later date, he writes as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "I mentioned before that my wife had a dream concerning this affair, ſhe has ſince had two more, one of them. That ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized and liable to great puniſhment, that it created great confuſion, but ſhe afterwards got free and was happy; from her excellence of heart, I have no doubt but this will be the caſe with her.—On the thankſgiving night ſhe dreamed, that her three daughters all lay dead, and that they even froze in that ſituation; and even yet I am little affected".<note n="*" place="bottom">The Editor is ſenſible that it may be diſguſtful to ſome readers to obſerve theſe dreams repeated after inſerting them in the ſermon, but this letter was written before it was known the ſermon would be publiſhed, and the obſervations upon the ſubject being very different, and ſince the ſenſe would not be compleat without a repetition of them he hopes the reader will take no exception thereat.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The afternoon before this terrible execution, Mrs. Beadle walked abroad to viſit an acquaintance, and it was obſerved by the lady, ſhe was uncommonly penſive; ſhe aſked the reaſon, Mrs. Beadle with much concern told her, "She had for months been troubled with frightful and uncommon dreams, and that very morning ſhe dreamed violence had been offered her family and her children deſtroyed; ſhe ſaid thoſe dreams wrought on her mind to a very great degree, to divert her thoughts from them ſhe had walk'd abroad that afternoon; and that ſhe verily believed Providence had judgments in ſtore for their family, which he was about to inflict on them by ſome ſweeping ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or in ſome other awful manner."—Mr. Beadle, who, as appears by his writings, was alone privy to his malevolent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, put a very different conſtruction upon her dreams. He doubtleſs conſidered them as premonitions from Heaven, and convincing proof to him that his purpoſe was right, of which he ſays he had ſundry intimations he really thought from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he does not deſcribe.</p>
            <p>From whence thoſe dreams originated it is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; whether 'the weapons he carried to his bed ſide gave
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018009_0035_0FA46102D2B6F848"/>
her uneaſineſs and excited a jealouſy in her mind of his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or whether any of his conduct which fell under her obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation might be alarming to her, which might trouble her ſleep, no one can tell. She has lately mentioned ſundry dreams of a ſimilar nature, which ſhe had near ſix months ſince. Some great and good characters have thought ſuch intimations were at times given from on high, to convince mankind of the reality of the inviſible world—to hazard ſuch a conjecture in theſe modern days would perhaps be thought by the learned world a great mark of fanataciſm—every man muſt think for himſelf, no one can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with ſatisfactory certainty with reſpect to the origin and cauſe of ſuch thoughts in ſleep, which ſo nearly correſpond with the true ſtate of facts. Her laſt dream penned by him was near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly literally verified. Although the weather was ſerene and pleaſant on the 10th, and near full moon: neither the ſun or moon were viſible from the time this horrid deed was done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the body of this man was laid beneath the clods, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the horror: when ſuddenly the wind blew from the northweſt, diſpelled the vapours and diſcovered a cloudleſs ſky. The air grew cold, and the faces of the other five being opened to view in their coffins, in the front of the meeting-houſe, the concourſe was ſo great that much time was ſpent to give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for all to take a view; the cold ſtill increaſing, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in all probability were ſtifned with froſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Beadle left ſundry letters directed to his acquaintance, and one laboured treatiſe in juſtification of his conduct; they contain many inconſiſtencies. He profeſſes himſelf a Deiſt, but reprobates Atheiſm. While in life and proſperity he claim'd to be a Chriſtian, and offered two of his children in baptiſm. Much has been ſaid in favour of publiſhing his writings by thoſe who have not ſeen them; thoſe who have peruſed them have doubted the propriety of ſuch a meaſure; not becauſe his reaſonings againſt revelation were in any degree unanſwerable, but leſt they might have ſome effect on weak and melancholy minds. He attempts to attack all rulers in Church and State, treats the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with a great degree of bitterneſs and bigotry; and yet abſurdly concludes by ſaying, "if it is true he ſhall be ſaved by it."—He is very unſettled, wavering and inconſiſtent in his own beloved ſyſtem of Deiſm. He flatters his pride by believing it was the height of heroiſm to dare to die by his own hands, and that the Deity would not willingly puniſh one, who was impatient to viſit his God and learn his will from his own mouth, face to face in ſome future world, or worlds (which he thinks may be many) and ſeems to think there is as great probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding advantageouſly, in removing from one world to another as from one country, or calling to another; and ſeeing all men

muſt be jugged off at laſt (as he expreſſes it) he was determined to make the experiment voluntarily which all muſt do through neceſſity. As he was much out of temper with the world, he was unwilling any of his family ſhould ſtay behind to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its troubles, and ſince 'tis a father's duty to provide for his flock, he choſe to conſign them over to better hands.</p>
            <p>'Tis doubtful whether any hiſtory of modern times can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford an inſtance of ſimilar barbarity, even in the extreme diſtreſs of war. The ancients encouraged by numbers and example, did in hours of deſpair deſtroy themſelves and families, to avoid the ſhame of becoming captives to be led in triumph, and the cruelty commonly exerciſed in thoſe barbarous ages.</p>
