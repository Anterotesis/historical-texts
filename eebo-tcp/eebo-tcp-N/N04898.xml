            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>And what ſhall I more ſay? For the Time would fail me to tell of</hi> Gideon, <hi>and of</hi> Barak, <hi>and of</hi> Sampſon, <hi>and of</hi> Jepthah, <hi>of</hi> David <hi>alſo—who thro' Faith ſubdued Kingdoms—waxed valiant in Fight, turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.—</hi>

            <p>THE inſpired Author of this Epiſtle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the 38th Verſe of the preceeding Chapter, cited that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Paſſage of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> in this gives an Account of the Nature, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Uſefulneſs and Excellency of Faith, and ſhews of what eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it was to the ancient Saints, famous in the Book of God.</p>

It was this, that animated their Obedience; carried them through the heavieſt Trials; overcame the greateſt Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties; and made them more than Conquerors over their moſt formidable Enemies. It was this, that made <hi>the Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as David,</hi> and the Strong as <hi>the Angel of the Lord.</hi> It was this, that enabled <hi>Martyrs</hi> patiently and joyfully to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the utmoſt Cruelty of their Perſecutors, and the moſt <hi>warlike valiant Soldiers</hi> to exceed themſelves, and do Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders againſt their Enemies.</p>
            <p>Of theſe laſt Feats of Faith the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the Text. He mentions by Name, ſeveral <hi>Heroes</hi> renowned in the Church of God in their Day, for their Valour and Victories over the Enemies of God's People. The Hiſtory of their Exploits is preſerved in the ſacred Records, and was written for our Learning and Admonition; as we learn from the Uſe the Apoſtle makes of it in this Place. In ſetting down their Names, he obſerves not the Order of Story, aiming only at mentioning their ſignal Acts of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>In the Story we find them all, except <hi>Barak,</hi> eminent for their Fortitude. <hi>Gideon</hi> was ſaluted by the Angel, as <hi>a mighty Man of Valour</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Judg. vi. 12.</note> And tho' <hi>Barak,</hi> at the Time when God called him, and put him into Commiſſion of <hi>General</hi> of the Army againſt the Enemies of his People, diſcovered ſomething of a timerous Spirit; yet doubtleſs he was well known to be a Man of good Courage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God choſe him for that important Truſt and Service.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xvi. 18.</note>.</p>
            <p>Theſe heroic Men in their Wars againſt the Enemies of their People, uſed their beſt Policy, and acted their natural Courage: They fought valiantly, and play'd the Men for their God, and for the Cities of their God; and they gain'd compleat Victories. Their martial Atchievements, <hi>humane Reaſon</hi> may be ready to aſcribe to their ſuperiour Courage and Conduct; and to look no higher: But the Apoſtle takes not the leaſt Notice of them, but aſcribes them to their <hi>Faith only.</hi> It was their Faith gave them Courage, and procured them Succeſs. Their Strength of Body, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Mind, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilitary Skill were <hi>natural Cauſes</hi> of their Succeſs: But theſe alone would never have enabled them to do ſuch great Exploits upon their Enemies, who poſſibly might equal them in all the natural and acquired Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Soldiers; and far overmatch them in the Number, Strength and Artillery of their Armies. It was their Faith that differenced them from their Enemies: This gave them the Advantage; and was more and better to them, than Troops of Horſes, Chariots of Iron, and all other Inſtruments of War were to their Enemies: This encouraged their Hearts and ſtrengthened their Hands: Made them valorous and victorious: This gave the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Stroke to their other military Qualifications, and was the Crown of all. This inſpired them with Courage and Reſolution, made them undaunted at the Approach of Enemies, intripid in the moſt bloody Scenes of War, and <hi>valiant in Fight:</hi> This crowned their valiant Attempts with Succeſs, <hi>turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens,</hi> thoſe that were Aliens to their Common-Wealth, and Enemies to their Religion: And this enabled them to make proper Advantage of their Victories, <hi>to ſubdue Kingdoms under them,</hi> and make them tributary.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:006128_0006_1027F00129AEDE30"/>
The proud Hearts of Men are prone to take the Glory of their Courage and Succeſs to themſelves, as if they had given themſelves their Courage, and by the Might of their Hand alone had gotten them Victory: But the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> attributes it wholly to their Faith, to ſhew that it was all of God: That the <hi>wiſe Man ſhould not glory in his Wiſdom, nor the mighty Man in his Might</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. ix. 23.</note>; But that <hi>he that glorieth ſhould glory in the Lord</hi>

            <p>Theſe Perſons here ſpoken of, were all of them Leaders of Armies, except <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who had the Force of an Army in himſelf: And we find they were as famous for their Faith, as for their Proweſs. Doubtleſs they had many Soldiers in their Armies that had Faith as well as they; which gave <hi>them</hi> the ſame valorous martial Spirit that their Leaders had; and enabled them, in their Places, to act as valiantly in Battle, as their Leaders did in their's. <q>Believing and praying Commanders, at the Head of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and praying Armies, have been ſo owned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of God, that nothing can ſtand before them.</q>

            <p>The <hi>Obſervation</hi> from the Words, by divine Leave and Help to be ſpoken to, may be this, <abbr>

            <p>It is a Day of War and Trouble in the Land.—When Enemies unjuſtly riſe up againſt us, and do all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they can, it is lawful and a Duty to take up Arms, and ſtand in our own Defence; yea, and to go forth to War againſt them. <hi>Good Soldiers,</hi> under God, are our Defence and Safety.—But what ſhall the People of God do for <hi>good Soldiers?</hi> What Method muſt be taken to make our Men ſuch?—They who have the Honour to bear a Commiſſion in the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſhould doubtleſs take
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006128_0007_1027F002DDF89798"/>
Pains to furniſh themſelves with a good Knowledge in military Affairs, and then, ſhould be faithful in training their Companies; ſhould make a Buſineſs of teaching their Men the right Uſe of the Gun and Sword, and whatever elſe is neceſſary for them to be acquainted with: And they ſhould ſee to it, that their Soldiers under Arms, keep good Order, and attend to their Duty.—But when Men have perfected themſelves in this Knowledge, they will be far from being good Soldiers, if they have not <hi>good Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi> This is abſolutely neceſſary to make a Soldier. If a Man had a Body as bulky as <hi>Goliah'</hi>s, a Head as wife as <hi>Solomon'</hi>s, and an Arm as ſtrong as <hi>Sampſon'</hi>s, but a Heart like a <hi>Hare,</hi> Could this Man make a Soldier? What avail the large and branchy Horns of the <hi>Stagg,</hi> ſince he ſtarts and runs at the Bark of a Dog? <hi>A Coward is no Soldier:</hi> He cannot keep Poſſeſſion of his Soul, nor find his Hands, nor uſe his Arms, in the Time of Battle and Danger.</p>
            <p>Men have invented and uſe a Variety of artificial Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to inſpire themſelves and one another with Courage: The Beat of Drums, the Blaſt of Trumpets, and Shouting for the Battle; theſe may ſomewhat rouſe the Spirits, and breed a Kind of <hi>brutal</hi> Courage, a wild and mad Fury, like that of the <hi>War-Horſe;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Job. xxxix. 21,—</note> 
               <hi>who faith among the Trumpets, Ha, ha, goeth on to meet the armed Men, mocketh at Fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth back from the Sword; ſwalloweth the Ground with Fierceneſs and Rage,</hi> and ruſhes into the Battle. This is falſe Courage, purely a mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Buſineſs: It hurries Men on precipitately into the Mouth of Danger, without Thought or Wit, Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Conduct; and often leaves them when they have the greateſt Need. It degenerates into Fear and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe. It is a ſudden Fluſh of the Spirits, which quickly goes off, like the <hi>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot,</hi> makes a great Noiſe and Blaze, but is ſoon over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006128_0008_1027F007FA2456A0"/>
               <hi>True Valour,</hi> or Fortitude, is an excellent Vertue, the Mean between Temerity and Timerouſneſs; as the Poet ſays,
<q>
                  <l>—Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</l>
                  <l>Of mounting Spirits, and fermenting Blood;</l>
                  <l>Lodg'd in the Soul with Virtue over-rul'd,</l>
                  <l>Inflam'd by Reaſon, and by Reaſon cool'd.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Addiſon's</hi> Campaign.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It will not fooliſhly and needleſly run upon the Point of the Sword, or Muzzel of the Gun; nor will it thro' Fear neglect a Duty, nor quit a Poſt becauſe of Danger. True Courage makes the Soldier patient in Labours, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in Fight, compos'd in the utmoſt Confuſion of Battle; bold and intrepid in the midſt of Enemies. The Thunder of the Captains, Claſhing of Swords, Roaring of Cannon, Shouts of Enemies, Groans of Friends, Clouds of Duſt and Smoke, all the Terrors of War, do not in the leaſt diſcourage him. The truly couragious Man will not preſumptuouſly throw away his Life, nor ſneekingly ſave it: He neither wiſhes for Death, nor fears it.</p>
            <p>This manly rational Temper of Mind is not the Effect of Noiſe and Sounds only. Martial Inſtruments of Muſic may well be uſed: The <hi>Drum</hi> and <hi>Trumpet</hi> naturally tend to fire the Soul, work upon animal Nature, and breed a Kind of Courage; but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid in another Caſe, <hi>I ſhew you a more excellent Way</hi>

            <p>True Courage will make Soldiers bold and daring, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with the beſt Courage, moſt ſolid and laſting; ſuch a Courage as will make them undaunted, not fearing the Force of their Adverſaries; no, tho' they be like the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> of old, <hi>a bitter and haſty Nation, terrible and dreadful, of a fierce Countenance and hard Language.</hi> This will enable them to ſtand the Shock of Armies, and drive

home upon the Foe; and the more fierce and furious their Enemies are, the more will their Faith whet up their Courage, add Vigour to their Minds, and Strength to their Arms. This is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> that <hi>is better than Strength,</hi> yea <hi>than Weapons of War.</hi>

            <p>And Faith gives the beſt Aſſurance of <hi>Succeſs.</hi> Succeſs goes a great Way in eſtabliſhing and aggrandizing the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier's Character. Succeſs indeed is not always a certain Evidence of the beſt Soldier. A moſt expert and valiant General, with an Army better diſciplin'd, equip'd and poſted, and conſiſting of more ſturdy, reſolute and bold Men, thro' ſome unforeſeen Accident, ſome unexpected Turn of Providence, the Change of the Wind and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may thro' their too great Boldneſs, and purſuing the Enemy too far, looſe the Day: <hi>The Race is not</hi> always <hi>to the Swiſt, nor the Battle to the Strong; but Time and Chance happens to all.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. ix. 11.</note> There is a ſecret, powerful, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence, that determineth Events, quite croſs to the natural Tendency of Things, and the rational Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Men. But true Faith gives Soldiers the beſt Reaſon to hope they ſhall be proſper'd in all their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their Enemies; and that the Event of the Battle, at leaſt of the War, will be in their Favour.</p>
            <p>Now that Faith makes the beſt Soldiers the moſt valiant and ſucceſsful, we learn from the <hi>Heroes</hi> in the Text. By reading the Hiſtory of their Wars, we find that they behaved valiantly in Fight; and that their Valour was crowned with Succeſs. They fought with Armies vaſtly ſuperiour to their own, in Reſpect of Numbers and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Accoutrements; and yet their Enemies were not able to ſtand before them: Yea, <hi>Kings did flee away apace.</hi> From the Blood of the Slain, from the Fat of the Mighty, their Bow turned not back, nor did their Sword return

            </p>
            <p>And ſo it was in <hi>After-times,</hi> when the Faith of God's People was ſtrong and lively. What and how many nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

It was their Faith in God that gave them this Spirit, Courage and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>If we come down to <hi>later Times,</hi> we ſhall find Faith animating the Hearts of Chriſtian Soldiers in the ſame Manner, and crowning them with Succeſs. In the Hiſtory of the Perſecutions and Wars of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Fox'</hi>s Acts and Monuments.</note>, a godly People, and full of Faith, we ſee how valiantly they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves from their Enemies, tho' they were but few in Number, and poorly furniſhed with Weapons of War; nay, and not only defended themſelves, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Times drove their numerous and enraged Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. It was their Faith in God that made them thus valiant and victorious. They were good Soldiers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> valiant for the Truth; and God gave them a Spirit and Courage that all their Enemies were not able to withſtand.</p>
            <p>Should we come down to the <hi>Days and Wars of our Fore-fathers in this Country,</hi> we ſhall ſee the ſame Fruits of Faith? They were a holy praying Generation; Men of ſtrong Faith, and eminent Piety: And their Faith gave them Courage againſt their numerous ſalvage Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and help'd them to the ſignal Victories they gain'd over them. We may ſay of them as <hi>David</hi> did of his Anceſtors: <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee: They truſted and thou didſt deliver them. They cried unto thee and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

They truſted in thee and were not confounded</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xxii. 4, 5.</note>. Nay, ſo far from it, that they waxed valiant in Fight, and turned to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</p>
            <p>And what was it made our Officers and Soldiers ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and victorious in the Siege of <hi>Louiſbourg,</hi> that ſtrong and almoſt impregnable Fortreſs? Was it not Faith? Were not many good Men, Men of Faith and Prayer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it? Doubtleſs it would be a Wrong to their Faith, not to attribute their Courage and Succeſs to that.</p>
            <p>A ſmall Army with great Faith, will do more than a great Army without Faith, tho' it have all neceſſary and convenient Weapons of War. This we have an Inſtance of in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ancient renowned Believer; he with his Houſhold Troops, <hi>three hundred and eighteen Men,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Victory over <hi>four Kings,</hi> who juſt before had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt <hi>five Kings</hi>

            <p>But <hi>what is this Faith that inſpires Soldiers with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Courage, and crowns them with ſuch Succeſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not a vain preſumptuous Confidence, a groundleſs enthuſiaſtic Perſwaſion, ariſing in the Mind from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening Conceit of our own Goodneſs, and of our peculiar Intereſt in the ſpecial Love of God: It is not any ſudden unaccountable Impreſſion and Impulſe upon the Mind, that God will infallibly defend us, and deſtroy our Enemies. It is no proud vapouring Imagination, nor Satanic Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—No:</p>
            <p>This Faith is a rational Thing: A divine Principle wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a firm and undoubted Belief of the Being and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God</hi>

This Way more eſpecially the Faith of <hi>Jephthah</hi> wro't. <hi>I have not finned againſt thee,</hi> ſaid he to his Enemies, <hi>but thou doſt me Wrong to War againſt me: The Lord the Judge be Judge this Day between the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and the Children of</hi> Ammon<note n="‖" place="bottom">Judg. xi. 27.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a hearty Reliance upon the Promiſes of God</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 13.</note>: A Belief that God is ſincere in making them, is able to make them good<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 19.</note>, and will not ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail. The Faith of <hi>Gideon, Barak</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> had a more ſpecial Reference to the Promiſes God made them. God promiſed <hi>Barak,</hi> that he would deliver <hi>Siſera</hi> and his Army into his Hand<note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. iv. 7.</note>; and <hi>Gideon,</hi> that <hi>he would ſurely be with him, and that he ſhould ſmite the</hi> Midianites <hi>as one Man</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. vi. 16.</note>. And <hi>David</hi> had many Promiſes made to him, that God would be with him and proſper him.

            <p>
               <hi>It is a fiducial Dependance upon God as our God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Whence is it that Faith hath this Vertue and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to inſpire Solders with the beſt Courage, and aſſure them of Succeſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is partly from the Divine Sovereignty.</hi> Faith is a Grace that moſt honours God: It is a Dependence upon him alone; a practical and profeſſed Acknowledgment of our own Inſufficiency, and of his Power and Goodneſs, that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006128_0014_1027F017726A20C0"/>
he is willing and able to help his People. <hi>This</hi> is pleaſing to God, and from his ſovereign Goodneſs he gives his People the Comfort of that which gives him Honour. Having by his Spirit ſtirred up the Faith of his Servants, he doth by the ſame Spirit ſtir up their Courage. After <hi>Jophthah'</hi>s believing Appeal to God as Judge, it is ſaid, <hi>Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Judg. xi. 29.</note>: A martial Spirit, a Spirit that did in an uncommon Manner fire him with Courage and Zeal againſt the Enemies of the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. God delights in the Faith of his People, and from his ſovereign rich Goodneſs, will not let it go unrewarded. <hi>When a Man's Ways pleaſe the Lord,</hi> and this Way of Faith always doth, <hi>He maketh his Enemies to be at Peace with him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 7.</note>, or yield to him, or fall before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is partly from the Nature of Faith. Faith poſſeſſes the Soul with a ſacred Dread of this great God;</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Context Ver. 7.</note> a Reverence of his Majeſty and Greatneſs; a Fear of doing any Thing unworthy of him, unbecoming our Relation to him, and diſpleaſing to his Holineſs: It makes us careful to obſerve his Laws, follow the Steps of Providence, and yield to the Motions of his Spirit. It repreſents God to the Soul, in the Glory of his Perfections and Operations; and cauſes us to <hi>ſactify the Lord of Hoſts, and to make him our Fear, and our Dread</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. viii. 12, 13.</note>: And when we do this <hi>we ſhall not fear nor be afraid of Man.</hi> A Soul poſſeſs'd with a holy Fear of God, is elevated above the ſlaviſh Fear of Man. As the Light of the Sun extinguiſhes the Light of a Candle, yea of the brighteſt Stars; ſo doth the Fear of God drive out the undue Fear of Men, the higheſt and greateſt. They that fear God, will not fear them that can kill the Body, and after that can do no more, unleſs abuſe and diſgrace the Carcaſs. The Fear of Man is weakening to the Body and Mind, preys upon the Spirits, and makes cowardly; but the Fear of God has a quite contrary Effect, <hi>The

Righteous is bold as a Lion</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii. 1.</note>; nothing can terrify them. The fierceſt Enemies, moſt cruel Threatnings, and Death it ſelf in the moſt frightful Forms, no Ways diſmay them. A notable Inſtance of this we have in the <hi>three jewiſh Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies:</hi> They would not be frightned from their God and their Duty, by the ſtern Looks, furious Threats, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Furnace of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that Terror of the Mighty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith repreſents the Enemies of God's People in a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Light.</hi> Unbelief and carnal Fear are apt to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify them. As, They are ſo numerous, ſo expert in their Diſcipline, ſo well furniſh'd with all Kinds of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and withal, as they are ſuch mighty Men, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; and we, compared with them, are few in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, poor and unprovided, have no Might nor Strength. But Faith gives God's People quite another View and Account of them, diminiſhes them as much as Senſe and Unbelief magnified them. The unbelieving <hi>Spies</hi> made Report of the Inhabitants of <hi>Canaan,</hi> That <hi>all the People that they ſaw in it were Men of great Stature: And there they ſaw the Giants the Sons of</hi> Anak, <hi>and that they were in their own Sight as Graſhoppers, and ſuch in their Sight</hi> too<note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb. xiii. 32, 33.</note>: Little, weak, contemptible Inſects. But the Faith of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> two of that Number of Spies, beheld them in a quite different Light; made no Account of them, and reported of them as not at all to be fear'd: <hi>They are Bread for us</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. xiv. 9.</note>, ſay they: Not <hi>Corn,</hi> that will take ſome Time and Trouble to prepare it for Food: But <hi>Bread,</hi> ground, made up, bak'd, ready to eat: They are ſet before us, rather to be fed upon, than to be fought with. Where Faith thus leſſens Enemies, it will raiſe and keep up the Soldiers Courage in fighting with them. Whatever mighty Shews their Enemies make, how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable ſoever they appear in Battle-array, and how loud and threatening ſoever their Words may be, Faith ſhews
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006128_0016_1027F01E331CABC8"/>
them, That <hi>they are Men and not God, and their Horſes Fleſh and not Spirit;</hi> weak and mortal Creatures. Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating an Enemy breeds Diſcouragement, damps the Spirits, and awakens Fear: But ſeeing them by the Eyes of Faith diminiſhed to almoſt nothing, ſtrengthens the feeble Knees, raiſes up the Hands that hang down, and recovers the fainting Spirits.</p>
            <p>Carnal Soldiers many times make Uſe of ſomething like this to to fortify their Minds, and keep up their Spirits. They endeavour to think meanly of their Enemies, and they ſpeak contemptibly of them, as having neither Skill nor Valour; But Faith does this moſt ſatifyingly to the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith excites a mighty Spirit of Prayer.</hi> Faith and Prayer ever go together; and the ſtronger Faith is, the more fervent is Prayer. Believing Soldiers know they can call in the Help of God, when Things are come to the laſt Extremity, and are in ſuch a deſperate Situation, that vain is the Help of Man. And they hope, that the God who hears Prayers, and delights in the Prayers of Faith, will ſome Way appear for them, open ſome Way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape, and preſerve them from the Rage and Cruelty of their Enemies. Believing Soldiers can wreſtle with God, at the ſame Time they are combating with Men: They can ſhoot up their Prayers to God in the Heavens, while they are diſcharging their Shot upon the Enemy in the Field. This is a mighty Support to their Spirits, and begets in them a holy Confidence in God; in that they know, that where God gives a Spirit of Prayer, he is not wont to deny his People the Mercy they have pray'd unto him for. They know, that fervent believing Prayer can do more and greater Execution than Guns and Swords. <hi>Theſe</hi> have Power with God, and prevail: And rather than the Enemy ſhould prevail againſt an Army of Prayers, God will bow the Heavens and come down, fly upon the Wings of the Wind for their Help; muſter up the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006128_0017_1027F01FC2084380"/>
Militia of Heaven, diſcharge his Artillery upon their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, thunder in the Heavens, ſhoot out his Lightnings, and ſend down Hailſtones, and the great Rain of his Strength. Oh what Courage muſt this give praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soldiers, who have a God of infinite Power and Goodneſs to cry unto in their Diſtreſſes! a God with whom <hi>inwrought fervent Prayers avail much;</hi> and who <hi>never ſaid to the Seed of</hi> praying wreſtling Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain.</hi>

               <hi>Faith engages and realizes the gracious Preſence of God with his fighting People.</hi> It <hi>engages</hi> the Preſence of God with them. God has promiſed his People to be with them in their Difficulties and Dangers. Faith lays hold of the Promiſe, and pleads it with God: And while the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul doth this, God will not leave him nor forſake him. By Faith in the Promiſe, the Believer has a faſt Hold upon God, and God will not rend away from him. <hi>The Lord is with his People,</hi> in a Way of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>while they are with him,</hi> in the Way of Faith and Duty<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Chron. xv. 2.</note>.—And Faith <hi>realizes</hi> the gracious Preſence of God with them: That he goes forth with their Armies, accompanies them in the Field of Battle, beholds the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Force and Rage of their Enemies, and <hi>their</hi> Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Dependance upon him. And beſides, <hi>Faith</hi> realizes, that God is not preſent with them only as an unconcern'd Spectator, but ſtands ready to help them in all that they need, and call upon him for: To guide their Counſels, cover their Heads, direct their Shot, ſtrengthen their Hearts and Hands, and fight for them by his Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

            <p>The Preſence of God with his People was always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a ſufficient Reaſon for fortifying their Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Enemies.

               <hi>Faith ſees the Glory of God much intereſted in the Wars of his People:</hi> And this fires them with Zeal and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. God's Glory lies nearer the Hearts of his People, than any of their own Intereſts; and they will venture harder to ſecure, defend, and vindicate that, than any Thing of their own. In this Caſe they will not' count their Lives dear to them, nor love them to the Death.</p>
            <p>One Thing that very much contributes to lead Soldiers on to gallant and brave Actions in Fight, is <hi>the Honour of their King and Country:</hi> For the Honour of their Prince, they will behave with the utmoſt Reſolution and Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Surely the Honour of God will as much ſway with the believing Soldier, in fighting the Lord's Battles. Should the Enemy prevail, what would God do for his great Name? What would the blaſphemous <hi>AEgyptians</hi> ſay? And therefore to prevent their blaſphemous Reproaches, the Chriſtian Soldier is willing to jeopard his Life, and ſpend his Blood. It is not ſo much for the Honour of his <hi>King</hi> (tho' this is dear to him) as of his GOD, that he fights. It is the Cauſe of God, and Religion, and his People, he is fighting for: And the Tho't of this adds Vigour to his Spirit, and Force to his Arms. It was the Senſe of this that ſtirred up <hi>David's</hi> Spirit, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden'd him to enter the Liſts with enormous <hi>Goliah: He defied the Armies of the living God</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. xvii. 36.</note>; and thereby vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <hi>defied the living God,</hi> Iſrael'<hi>s God, the God of Armies. David's</hi> Zeal for God's Glory armed him with Reſolution to undertake the Fight, and his Faith bro't him off a Conqueror.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith commits the Body and Soul, and all their Concerns into the Hands of God.</hi> It puts over all that we are and have unto God, for him to look after, take Care of, and diſpoſe of, juſt as he pleaſes. It is the Property and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Faith, to devolve all our Cares and Concerns
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006128_0020_1027F0298A67C1E0"/>
upon God; to caſt our Burdens on him, and commit the Keeping of our Souls to him. And Faith knows that God's Hands are ſafe, powerful, and merciful Hands: That he is able to keep what we have committed to him. Now what has that Soldier to fear, who hath lodged all that he hath in ſuch glorious Hands? He knows his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies can have no Power againſt him, except it be given them from above: That not an Hair of his Head can fall to the Ground, much leſs a Drop of his Blood, or his Life, without the Will of his heavenly Father: And that God will give them no more Power againſt him, than ſhall be moſt for his Glory. He knows God can ſuſtain him under the greateſt Burdens, deliver him in the moſt imminent Dangers, and preſerve him untouch'd, unhurt in the midſt of Swords, Shot and Deaths. Such a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soldier hath nothing to terrify him, nothing to be careful about; but to keep in the Way of Duty, and leave the Event to God. He can addreſs his Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and urge them on to the Fight, as <hi>Joah</hi> that famous General in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did; <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God: And the Lord do that which ſeemeſh him good</hi>

               <hi>Faith calls freſh to Mind, and feeds upon, the wonderful Appearances of God for his People in Times paſt, againſt their Enemies;</hi> and takes Courage from thence, with Reſpect to preſent Engagements: And more eſpecially doth it thus, when the People of God are bro't into the ſame Mounts of Difficulty, Diſtreſs, and Danger that God's People were in in former Generations.

It is ſaid, <hi>Thou breakeſt the Heads of Leviathan in Pieces, and gaveſt him to be Meet to the People inhabiting the

They fed their Souls with the Sweetneſs of this Mercy. <q>This Providence was meat to their Faith and Hope, to ſupport and comfort them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the other Difficulties, they were likely to meet with in the Wilderneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Carnal old Soldiers are wont to keep up their Courage, by recounting how many Wars they have ſerved in; how many Battles they have fought; what Dangers they have been in; what Wounds they have received; what narrow Eſcapes they have made with their Lives; and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Victories they have won: The Remembrance of theſe Things inſpires them with freſh Courage. But the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Faith upon God's Works of Power and Mercy for his People, will do it much better. How mightily will this embolden the Soldier's Spirit, when his Faith aſſures him, that <hi>this God of Salvation</hi> is the ſame God that ever he was; that his Arm is not ſhortned, nor his Love abated. Oh, to believe, that as God hath delivered his People, and doth ſtill deliver them, he will yet deliver them.—Once more,</p>
            <p>Finally;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith looks to the Glory and Bleſſedneſs of the unſeen eternal World;</hi> and this adminiſters Courage. <hi>Faith is the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Things not ſeen</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Context Ver. 1.</note>: It gives a realizing preſentiating View of another World, and of the great Good that is laid up for Believers there: And it begets a good Hope of coming to the Enjoyment of it, whenever God ſhall call out of this World; yea, and ſometimes it enables the Chriſtian to ſee his Title to it: It riſes up to <hi>the Riches of the full Aſſurance of Faith and Hope.</hi> The Chriſtian thus rais'd in the Actings of Faith and Hope, has nothing to terrify him: He can with the greateſt Preſence of Mind, and unſhaken Fortitude of Soul, ruſh into the midſt of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and Danger, when Duty calls him. Death is no
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:006128_0022_1027F02DB79C9280"/>
Terror to him. When there is nothing but Blood and Death around him, his Heart is undaunted, becauſe his Faith ſhews him a Crown of Life and Glory reſerved in the Heavens for him.</p>
            <p>Carnal Soldiers look for only ſome temporal Reward, a Garland of Flowers, a little higher Poſt, a more honourable Commiſſion; or to enrich themſelves with the Spoil of the Enemy, or, if they fall in Battle, to have it ſaid of them, <hi>They died in the Bed of Honour.</hi> Theſe are ſorry trifling Conſiderations, and yet they ſerve mightily to embolden them in Fight. But ſurely, if Soldiers will make ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventrous and deſperate Puſhes on the Enemy, only for a <hi>corruptible Crown,</hi> the Honour that comes from Men; the Chriſtian Soldier's Faith will urge him on to do ſo, for an <hi>Incorruptible.</hi> He that by Faith knows, that if he looſes his Life on Earth, fighting the Cauſe of God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhall win a Crown in Heaven, <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> will not <hi>count his Life dear to him.</hi> He that fights, and keeps Heaven in his Eye, will not want Courage. This Faith, which has render'd <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> patient and joyful in the midſt of Flames, will make Soldiers ſo in the moſt dreadful Scenes of War.</p>
            <p>Thus Faith gives Soldiers the beſt Courage. And as I ſaid before, the more lively and ſtrong the Actings of Faith are, the more and better is the Courage.</p>
            <p>And Faith makes <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> Soldiers too. We find it ſo in the many Inſtances upon ſacred Record. God's People always won the Day when they fought in Faith.—They who are the beſt, moſt ſkilful and courageous Generals, and have been very ſucceſsful, yet ſometimes meet with a Diſcomfiture, looſe the Day, and quit the Field: But Faith ever prevails. This calls in, and engages God and his Providence to fight for his People. And tho' God do not now <hi>miraculouſly</hi> interpoſe for his People, yet he ſo orders Matters in Providence, as to accompliſh Succeſs for them,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006128_0023_1027F0302E485BB0"/>
as ſurely, as if it was bro't about by apparent Miracles. The Finger of God is very viſible in it; the Arm of the Lord is made bare; his almighty Power diſcovered, to the Admiration and Joy of his own People, and to the Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Ruin of their Enemies. God ſo orders Things in Providence, that at the very Inſtant of Time, when his People ſtand in need of Help from him, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: And tho' it be not purely <hi>a miraculous Interpoſition</hi> of Providence, it is a very <hi>extraordinary</hi> and remarkable one; and was to them according to their Faith: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, that he would appear for them, but in which Way they knew not: And when; as to all outward Means they could look to, all Hope periſhed, then <hi>in the Mount it has been ſeen.</hi> It were eaſy to produce many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to prove this, were it needful.—Was it not by this ſignal Interpoſition of Providence, in Anſwer to Faith and Prayer, that God in former Times delivered the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Nation</hi> from the <hi>Spaniſh Invaſion?</hi> Was it not from the ſpecial Appearances of God for his People of <hi>New-England,</hi> by cauſing <hi>ſtrong Winds to fulfil his Word,</hi> and by ſending waſting Sickneſs among them, that we were of very late Time delivered from the <hi>French Fleet</hi> that came into theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Seas, with Orders to make all deſolate that they could come at? And was it not the ſignal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God that ſucceeded our Siege of <hi>Louiſbourgh;</hi> wonderfully changing the uſual Courſe of the Winter, both <hi>here,</hi> in preparing for it, and <hi>there,</hi> in fighting againſt it, 'till it was ſurrendred, and <hi>not a Day longer.</hi> This Succeſs and Salvation God gave his People in Anſwer to their Faith and Prayer. God never diſappoints the well-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, well regulated, and well-experienced Faith of his People.</p>

the Day of Battle and War.</hi> God hath theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to bring in the Day of Battle and War: With them he fights againſt ſinful Men. And, as Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> notes upon the Place, <q>Sometimes they come ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to ſerve the Purpoſes of Providence, in God's fighting for his People, and againſt their Enemies, that one would think, they were laid up as Magazines or Stores of Arms, and Ammunition, and Proviſion againſt the Time of Trouble, and the Day of Battle.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Faith is a prevailing Thing with God: It takes hold of God's Strength, and like <hi>Jacob,</hi> if I may be allow'd the Expreſſion, <q>Cloſes in with God, and refuſes to let him go without a Bleſſing, a Deliverance from <hi>Eſau,</hi> an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Enemy.</q> Indeed Faith will obtain almoſt every Thing from God.

            <p>Soldiers of this Stamp think <hi>Religion</hi> makes Men <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:</hi> That a Man will never make a gallant, brave, bold Fellow in the Army, 'till he has thrown off all Veneration for the <hi>Deity,</hi> and all Regard to <hi>Religion:</hi> That he will never dare to look his Enemies in the Face, unleſs he be ſo horridly impious as to fly in the Face of his Maker; nor to ſtorm a City, or enter a Breach, 'till he ſtorm Heaven itſelf, with his horrid Imprecations, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Oaths.

Without this you cannot hope, upon any <hi>Scripture</hi> Grounds, to do any thing againſt them, to Purpoſe; nay, you have Reaſon to fear, whether God will not ſend his Terrors into you, and cauſe your <hi>Hearts to be moved, as the Trees of the Wood are moved by the mighty Wind;</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and confounded in your Counſels, toſt and ſhaken out of the Poſſeſſion of your Souls.</p>
            <p>Oh then, <hi>Have Faith in God.</hi> Believe his Word, and ye ſhall be eſtabliſhed: Settle your Hearts in the Belief of his governing Providence: That he who concerns himſelf in the leaſt Things that befall a <hi>Perſon,</hi> is much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the great Affairs of <hi>his People,</hi> where Religion, and the Intereſts of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Kingdom, are much depending.

To believe and know, that you are called of God, and have his gracious Preſence with you, his glorious Perfections to ſhield you, his Providence to guard you, his Spirit to lead you, and his Angels to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp about you; Oh, how would this elevate your Spirits, and invigorate your Minds. You might then ſing in thoſe Strains of Faith; <hi>God is in the midſt of us, we ſhall not be moved: God ſhall help us, and that right early: The Lord of Hoſts is with us; the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>is our Refuge: He break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Bow, and cutteth the Spear in ſunder: He burneth the Chariot in the Fire</hi>

But becauſe the Sword devours one as well as another, and a good Man, full of Faith and of the Holy Ghoſt, may fall in Battle; conſider, if he doth, he not only dies in the <hi>Bed of Honour,</hi> as Men call it; but he <hi>dies in Peace,</hi> as godly <hi>Joſiah</hi> did, who was ſlain in Battle. He is only ſent to Heaven an eaſier Way, than by languiſhing Sickneſs; and a little ſooner than, it ſeems, he otherwiſe might have been. He enters into Peace, and wings away to that World, where God makes Peace in his high Places, where Love reigns in every Breaſt, where he ſhall no more hear the confuſed Noiſe of the Warriour, nor ſee Garments roll'd in Blood. His Warfare is accompliſh'd: He puts off his Harneſs, lays by his Gun and Sword, and Soldier's Apparel and Apparatus, is cloathed in a white Robe, and a Palm is put into his Hand. Yea, he is gone to that bleſſed World, where he finds himſelf out of the Reach of his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath no Occaſion to combat with them any more.</p>
            <p>See now the Excellency and Uſefulneſs of Faith, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging the Wars of the Lord. What <hi>David</hi> ſaid of the Sword of <hi>Goliah, There is none like it</hi>

Our Enemies have Swords, Guns, and Hatchets, as well as we: They have been trained up to fight in their Way, as well as we in our's; and are as dextrous in it. Yea and they invocate their Gods and Saints to help them, and depend upon their Help. And ſhall not <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Soldiers do one Thing more than they?

            <p>Faith alters the Nature and Property of Death, and ſhews the Believer, that it is a Privilege and Favour to him, and acts the Part of a Friend; delivers him from all the Snares and Sorrows, Temptations and Miſeries of this Life, and introduces him into the Joy, the Glory, and the Bleſſedneſs of the next.

            <p>Thus doth Faith make the Chriſtian more than a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror over this laſt Enemy.

Where a Sinner is really awakened to know his true State, to feel the Guilt of Sin in his Conſcience, and to have a Proſpect of where is he going, and muſt take up his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Abode, Horror takes hold of him. Oh, the ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Dolours and Anguiſh of his Soul! To him Death is dreadful indeed. He cannot live, and he dares not die. Oh, the <hi>earneſt Cries</hi> he now ſends up to the God of his Life, for a little longer Time, for a Space for Repentance! Oh, the <hi>ſolemn Promiſes</hi> he makes of living better for Time to come, if God will ſpare his Life.—He dies in the utmoſt Diſtreſs and Agony of Soul, fill'd with a <hi>fearful Looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, to devour him.</hi> But <hi>mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace</hi>
