            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Indictment being Read, the Kings Advocate Moved the Court, That the Prisoners at the Bar should immediately plead Guilty or not Guilty, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that the Statute so directed, and likewise the Civil Law. But <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> for himself &amp; the rest of the Prisoners at the Bar, prayed the Court, That they might have the benefit of Council, before they pleaded, that so they might be well advised what to do. Which request the Court was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Grant. Then they moved, That Mr. <hi>Auchmuty</hi> should be of Council for them; to which the Court Agreed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002003_0006_0FBA8484A53767A0"/>
Mr. <hi>Auchmuty</hi> being admitted, offered some Pleas to the Jurisdiction of the Court: And after a short hearing, the following Questions were propounded by the Prosecutors for the King, and submitted to the Courts Determination.</p>
            <p>
               <abbr>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether the Prisoners shall have liberty allowed them to plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Jurisdiction of this Court?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether the Prisoners Pleas against the Courts Jurisdiction (if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be made) shall come on before they plead Guilty or not Guilty? And both the said Questions were Voted in the Affirmative.</p>
            <p>Then it was alledged and pretended in behalf of the Prisoners, That the Commission of the late Queen <hi>Anne</hi> was of no force after Her Majesty's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: And so the Court had no Power to act by vertue of the said Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, It having dyed with the Queen: And several Authorities in the Law were Cited and Insisted upon by the Prisoners Council to Maintain his Pleas and Allegations.</p>
            <p>To which it was answered, That the Proclamation of His present Majesty King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> for Continuing Officers, and the subsequent Commission, and the Instructions from the Crown lately Transmitted to the Governour, referring to the Pirates was a sufficient justification of the Authority of the Court to proceed, act, adjudg and determine in all things according to the Powers and Authorities of the above-mentioned Act, which was still in full force; and that the cases which had been Cited, were not to the purpose; and thereupon the following Question was humbly referred to the Courts judgment. <abbr>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this Court hath a sufficient proper Jurisdiction &amp; Trial of the Prisoners at the Bar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which the Court Declared their Opinion in the Affirmative, <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then all the Prisoners held up their hands again at the Bar, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pleaded, Not Guilty, Except <hi>John Shuan</hi> a French-man, who made known to the Court, That he did not understand English, and therefore was ignorant of what he was charged with in the Indictment. And thereupon Mr. <hi>Peter Lucy</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> Merchant (being a person of good Credit) was Sworn Interpreter between the Court and the said <hi>Shuan;</hi> and then by the Courts direction the said <hi>Lucy</hi> informed the said <hi>John Shuan</hi> in his own Language of the several Articles Alledged against him in the said Indictment, and then he held up his hand at the Bar and pleaded, Not Guilty.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners having severally pleaded to the Indictment, desired Copies thereof, and a further day to prepare for their Trial.</p>
            <p>The Court accordingly Ordered the Register without delay to serve the Prisoners with Seven several Copies of the Indictment, with the Names of the Kings Witnesses annexed: And also to issue out Citations to the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to appear at the next Adjournment. And then the Prisoners were sent back to Goal, and the Court was Adjourned to <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 22d. day of <hi>October,</hi> Instant, at Nine of the Clock <hi>Ante Meridiem.</hi>

            <p>No Objection being made, by or in behalf of the Prisoners why their Trial should not proceed immediately: the Indictment was again Read.</p>
            <p>The Kings Advocate observed to the Prisoners now at the Bar, That if they had any thing to say or alledge against the Indictment, It was then their proper time to do it. And there-upon their Procurator urged that one <hi>Thomas Davis</hi> a Prisoner in <hi>Boston</hi> Goal might be brought into Court, and allowed to give Evidence in behalf of the Prisoners; And to that end pray'd that their Trial might be deferred till the said <hi>Davis</hi> could be had to give Evidence for them. Which Motion was rejected by the Court, upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authorities urged by the Advocate Gen. shewing, That the said <hi>Davis</hi> could not lawfully be admitted a Witness for the Prisoners, he being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of, and tho' not Indicted, yet in Custody for the same Crimes which they stand charged with. And so the Court Resolved to proceed to the Trial of the Prisoners at the Bar without further delay; And then their Procurator Resigned that Trust. Where-upon the Advocate Gen, made a Speech to the Court, to the following Effect.</p>

                        <p>THe Prisoners at the Bar stand Arraigned for sundry Acts of Piracy, Robbery and Felony by them committed at the time and place, and in manner set forth in the Articles of their Indictment, to which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002003_0008_0FBA8487716DA020"/>
they have severally pleaded <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> It is therefore my duty, in order to convict them of the heinous crimes, they are charged with, to shew first, that the facts laid in the Indictment amount to Piracy, Robbery and Felony; and secondly, that they are all and each of them guilty of these facts; And if it shal plainly appear to your Excellency &amp; the Honourable, His Majesty's Commissioners now in Court Assembled, that both these points are proved by the strongest and most convincing Evidence, that a case of this Nature can admit of, I doubt not, but from a deep and awful sense of Your duty to God and the King, and a zealous just concern for the common rights and interest of Mankind, the safety of His Majesty's good Subjects in these remote parts, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Security of their Trade, the Reputation of this Colony, and the honour of your Excellency's wise and happy Administration, You will Unanimously concur in Attainting &amp; Condemning them to suffer the Punishment, which the Law requires, and their crimes most justly deserve.</p>

                        <p>And therefore he can claim the Protection of no Prince, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of no Country, the benefit of no Law; He is denied common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the very rights of Nature, with whom no Faith, Promise nor Oath is to be observed, nor is he to be otherwise dealt with, than a a wild &amp; savage Beast, which every Man may lawfully destroy. <hi>Quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe adversus Latrones,</hi> &amp;c <note n="(c)" place="margin">Justin. <hi>Lib.</hi> 18.</note> i. e. <hi>All persons by the right they have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Mankind in general may and ought to draw the Sword against Robbers, with whom Men can have no Society nor Security.

And to finish the hateful character of this Monster, He is perhaps the only Criminal on Earth, whose crime cannot be absolutely pardoned, nor his punishment remitted by any Prince or State whatever. For as a Pirate is equally an Enemy and dangerous to all Societies, the bonds, which are to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them from violence and injury, being by him slighted &amp; broken, every Power has equally a right to insist upon Reparation and his being Punished. It is true, Princes are not answerable by the Laws of Nations for Spoils and Robberies committed by their Subjects on those of other Princes, unless they knew and consented to the same, but they are expressly obliged by these Laws, and generally by their own Treaties, to punish or deliver up to be punished such Offenders, and their neglect or refusal will justify a declaration of War, whereof many instances are to be met with in History. <note n="(d)" place="margin">Grot.

                        <p>Now as Piracy is in its self a complication of Treason, Oppression, Murder, Assassination, Robbery and Theft, so it denotes the Crime to be perpetrated on the High Sea, or some part thereof, whereby it becomes more Atrocious,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>First,</hi> Because it is done in remote and Solitary Places, where the weak and Defenceless can expect no Assistance nor Relief; and where these ravenous Beasts of Prey may ravage undisturb'd, hardned in their Wickedness with hopes of Impunity, and of being Concealed for ever from the Eyes and Hands of avenging Justice. One of the most aggravating Circumstances, that attend a Crime, is the facility of it's being committed, that is, where the Malefactor cannot easily be prevented nor discovered. Thus by the Law of GOD Theft in the Field was more grievously Punished, than Theft in a House. <note n="(e)" place="margin">Exod. 22. 1. 9.</note>

                        <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Circumstance, which blackens exceedingly and augments a Pirates Guilt, is the Danger, wherewith every State or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is threatned from the Combinations, Conspiracies and Confederacies of Profligate and Desperate Wretches, united by no other tie (for what other can there be among such?) than a mutual Consent to extinguish first Humanity in themselves, and to Prey promiscuously on all others. <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                        <p>But I need not go far to find out instances of this kind. It was but the other day we saw and felt with horrour the formidable power of such confederated Villains, who increasing in Strength in proportion to the number of their Crimes, &amp; by every repeated act of cruelty being inabled to commit a greater, dared at last not only to infest our Coasts, seize our Ships, &amp; put a full stop to our Commerce, but to enter our Harbours, and if Providence had not raised the Winds &amp; Waves for our deliverance, who can say, but these vile Remains of that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Crew, reserved in a wonderful manner for Publick Justice, that others may be amended and deter'd by their example, might have been now giving Laws to those, from whom they expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their doom.</p>
                        <p>Having offered to your Excellency this short and imperfect view of the Nature and Effects of Piracy in General, I beg leave in the next Place to observe briefly from the Principles of the Civil Law, which is appointed to rule and direct the proceedings of this Honourable Court, what Acts do necessarily infer the guilt and penalty of that Crime.</p>

Their own Confessions, emitted before your Excellency, open a dreadful scene of Depredations, Robberies and barbarous Cruelties, exercised by them before they came on this Coast, where, to fill up the measure of their Guilt, they committed the Crimes, for which they are now Indicted, Namely, That on the 26th of <hi>April</hi> last they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and with Force and Arms entered a Vessel belonging to His Majesty's Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having subdued the Master and his Crew and made themselves Masters of the Vessel and Cargo, they forced the Master with five of his hands (there being in all eight on Board) to abandon his Vessel and to go on board the Piratical Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> where soon after they perished in the Shipwreck. And in this respect, tho' the Prisoners are not charged with Murder in the Articles of their Indictment, yet I may justly affirm on the best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in Law, that they are truly Murtherers. <hi>Nibil interest, Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat quis, an cansane Mortis prabeat</hi>

               </abbr> a large Ship and a Snow, between <hi>Nantucket</hi> Shoals &amp; St. Georges Banks, which came up with the Pink in the Morning, with the Kings Ensign and Pendant flying; the large Ship was found to be the <hi>Whido,</hi> whereof <hi>Samuel Bellamy</hi> a Pirate was Commander, Who ordered the Pink to strike her Colours, and then hoisted out their Boat, and sent the Seven Prisoners, now at the Bar, on board the said Pink, all Armed with Musquets, Pistols and Cutlashes, except <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas South</hi> and <hi>John Shuan.</hi> And further the Deponent, Declares &amp; saith, That the said <hi>Thomas South,</hi> soon after he came on board, Declared to him the Deponent his Intention to make his escape from the <hi>Whido,</hi> as soon as he could, but <hi>Shuan</hi> was very forward <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> active on board the Pink, altho' he had no Weapon with him.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Thomas Baker</hi> went to the said Capt. <hi>Crumpstey</hi> with his Sword drawn, and ordered him to go on board the said Ship with all his Papers, and five of his hands, who were forced to obey, and accordingly Rowed on board the said Ship <hi>Whido</hi> in the Boat, while the Seven Pirates now at the Bar tarryed on board the Pink with the Deponent, and <hi>Alexander Mackconachy</hi> &amp; <hi>James Dunavan.</hi> And in a little time after several more Men came from the Ship on board the Pink for some Wine, but finding it difficult to be come at, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own Ship, with a small quantity of Wine and some Cloaths which belonged to the Ships Company. And soon after the Boat was again hoisted into the Ship, from whence he hail'd the Pink and gave orders to the Prisoners now at the Bar (who had forcibly taken Command of her) to Steer North-West and by North; Who answered, They would, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly followed that Course, till about Four of the Clock in the afternoon, when the Ship and the Snow, which last was also taken and made a Prize of by Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> and the Pink lay too, it being very thick, foggy Weather. And presently after the Snow came under the Ships Stern, and told Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> They had made discovery of Land. Wherefore he ordered the Pink to Steer away North, which the Prisoners did; And when Night came on the Ship put out a Light a-Stern, as well as the Snow and the Pink: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a Sloop from <hi>Virginia</hi> surprized and taken by Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> the same day; and then all of them made Sail again.</p>
            <p>The Deponent further saith, That Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> Commanded the said <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Van Vorst</hi> and Company on board the Pink to make more haste: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>John Brown</hi> Swore, That he would carry Sail till she carryed her Masts away. That when the Deponent &amp; <hi>Mackconachy</hi> were Prisoners, <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> told <hi>Mackconachy,</hi> That if he would not find Liquor he would break

The Prisoners at the Bar Drank plentifully of the Wine on board the Pink that day they took her; went to the Helm by turns and had the government of the Pink; and some of them ordered the Deponent to help to reef the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail, and do other services; She proved Leaky, so all hands were forced to Pump hard, and therefore they Damn'd the Vessel and wished they had never seen her.</p>
            <p>The Prisoners <hi>Van Vorst, Baker</hi> and <hi>Brown</hi> with the Deponent, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two Watches, and about Ten a Clock at Night the Weather grew so thick, it Lightned and Rained hard, and was so very dark that the Pinks Company could not see the Shoar till they were among the Breakers: When the Deponent was at Helm, and had lost sight of the Pirate Ship, Snow and Sloop, and discerning that they were among the Breakers; they were about to trim the Head sail, but before they could do it the Pink run a-shore, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Slutts-bush,</hi> so called, to the South-ward of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> between Ten and Eleven a Clock at Night, about which time the Prisoners at the Bar or some of them (being fearful as the Deponent supposed lest they should be Apprehended on Shoar) Cryed out saying, For God's sake let us go down into the Hould &amp; Die together. And the whole pinks Company tarry'd on Board her all that Night: And in their Distress the Prisoners ask'd the Deponent to Read to them the Common-Prayer Book, which he did about an Hour; And at break of Day they found the shoar-side of the Pink dry, so all of them jumpt out upon an Island, where they tarryed till about Ten a Clock, and eat Sweetmeats and other things taken out of a Chest, which <hi>Quintor</hi> and <hi>Shuan</hi> broke open, and drank of the Wines which came out of the Pink: About which time two Men, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>John Cole</hi> and <hi>William Smith</hi> came over to the Island in a Cannoe, and carry'd the Pinks Company to the Main Land; and then <hi>Mackconachy</hi> discovered the Pirates, so that they were Apprehended by Warrant from Mr. Justice <hi>Doan</hi> at <hi>Eastham,</hi> from whence they were brought to <hi>Boston</hi> Goal. The Deponent further saith, That while they were on the Island, <hi>Brown</hi> and others would have him call himself Captain of the Pink, and give out that the Pirates on Board were his Men: and after the Prisoners had got on the Main Land they talked in divers Languages, and were in a great hurry to go to <hi>Rhode-Island</hi> the better to make their Escape, as the Deponent imagines.</p>
            <p>J<hi>Ames Dunavan</hi> Mariner, late belonging to the Pink <hi>Mary Anne,</hi> and Brother-in-Law to Captain <hi>Crumpstey</hi> late Master thereof saith, That the said Pink belonged to <hi>Ireland,</hi> was Owned by the Subjects of the King of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and was Taken on the 26<hi>th</hi> Day of <hi>April</hi> last past, under <hi>English</hi> Colours by <hi>Samuel Bellamy</hi> Commander of the Pirate Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> That <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> and the rest of the Prisoners at the Bar came on Board the Pink Armed, and had their Pistols Charged with Powder and Ball, except <hi>Thomas South</hi> and <hi>John Shuan,</hi> and Ordered the Captain, with Five Hands more to go on Board the Ship with his Papers: And that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners at the Bar steer'd the Pink after <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Ship, as he gave Orders. That they drank plentifully of the Wines on Board; That <hi>Thomas South'</hi>s Behaviour in the Pink was civil and peaceable. The Deponent further saith, That he heard <hi>John Baker</hi> threaten to shoot <hi>Mackconachy,</hi> Cook of the Pink, thro' the head, because he steer'd to the windward of his Course; and said moreover, That he would make no more to shoot him, than he would a Dog; and that he should never go on shoar to tell his Story. That one of the Prisoners asked the Deponent what he thought they were? To which

               <hi>Baker,</hi> who stood by, said, That the King had given them a Commission to make their Fortune, and they were sworn to do it. After the Pink was cast on shoar, they said, They were in as bad a condition then as before.</p>
            <p>A<hi>Lexander Mackconachy,</hi> late Cook of the Pink <hi>Mary Anne</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> saith, That on the 26th day of <hi>April</hi> last past, in the course of their Voyage from <hi>Nantasket</hi> to <hi>New-York,</hi> they were taken by a Pirate Ship called the <hi>Whido,</hi> Commanded by Capt. <hi>Samuel Bellamy,</hi> That all the Prisoners at the Bar came on Board the said Pink armed, except <hi>Thomas South</hi> and <hi>John Shuan,</hi> and made themselves Masters of the Pink; and that <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> ordered the Captain to go on board the Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> with his Papers and five of his hands. The Deponent further saith, That the Pink was cast away opposite to an Island, called <hi>Slutts-bush;</hi> and after the Prisoners were carryed to the Main Land they looked very sorrowful, and made all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable speed in order to escape from the hands of Justice. That <hi>Thomas South</hi> behaved himself Civily. That <hi>Thomas Baker</hi> cut down the Fore-mast &amp; Mizen-mast of the pink when she run on shoar.</p>
            <p>J<hi>Ohn Brett</hi> Mariner, Testifyeth and saith, That in the Month of <hi>June</hi> 1716. he was taken by two Pirate Sloops, one Commanded by Capt. <hi>Samuel Bellamy,</hi> and the other by Capt. <hi>Labous;</hi> They Damn'd the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and bid him bring his Liquor on board; they carryed him to the Island of <hi>Pynes,</hi> and he was detained a Prisoner by them there Eighteen days; During which time <hi>John Brown</hi> was as active on board the Pirate Sloop as the rest of the Company: He told a Prisoner then on board, that he would <hi>hide</hi> him in the Hold, and hinder him from complaining against him, or telling his Story.</p>
            <p>T<hi>Homas Checkley</hi> Mariner saith, That he knows <hi>John Shuan</hi> the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the Bar, That he belonged to the Tanner Frigot one <hi>John Stouer</hi> Master, and sometime in <hi>March</hi> last the said Ship or Frigot was taken in the prosecution of her Voyage from <hi>pettyguavus</hi> to <hi>Old France,</hi> by Capt. <hi>Samuel Bellamy</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Lebous,</hi> they pretended to be <hi>Robbin Hoods Men.</hi> That <hi>Shuan</hi> declared himself to be now a Pirate, and went up and unrigged the Main top-mast by order of the Pirates, who at that time forced no Body to go with them; and said they would take no Body against their Wills.</p>
            <p>M<hi>Oses Norman</hi> says, That he knows <hi>Thomas Brown,</hi> and saw him in company with the Pirates belonging to Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> &amp; Monsieur <hi>Labous</hi> when the Deponent was taken with Capt. <hi>Brett</hi> in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1716. That he was carryed to the Isle of <hi>Pynes,</hi> and kept Prisoner Seventeen or Eighteen days, during all which time the said <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> was very active on board of Capt. <hi>Labous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J<hi>Ohn Cole</hi> saith, That on the Twenty-seventh day of <hi>April</hi> last he saw the Prisoners now at the Bar, in <hi>Eastham</hi> soon after they were cast on shore, That they tarryed a short time at his house, and look'd very much dejected and cast down; they enquired the way to <hi>Rhode-Island,</hi> and made great haste from his house, tho' he asked them to tarry and refresh themselves.</p>

            <p>After the afore-named Witnesses were examined, the Court in favour of the Prisoners by giving them time to make their Defence, Adjourned till three a Clock <hi>Post Meridiem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court met about that time, and the Prisoners were sent for &amp; brought again to the Bar.

               <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> alledged, That he was forced by Capt. <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to do what he did, and would have made known his intentions to make his escape from the Pirates unto the Mate of the said Pink, but that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the Mates discourse that he inclined to be a Pirate himself; and therefore he did not discover his Mind to the Mate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Brown</hi> pretended himself also to be a forced Man, but produced no Evidence to make it appear to the Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas South</hi> alledged, That he belonged to a Bristol Ship, whereof one <hi>James Williams</hi> was Master; That he was taken by Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> and forced to carry with him, otherwise was threatned to be put upon a desolate Island, where there was nothing to support him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Baker</hi> saith, That he and <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> were both taken out of one Vessel; That he attempted to make his escape at Spanish Town, and the Governour of that Place seemed to favour his design, till Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> and his Company sent the Governour word that they would burn &amp; destroy the Town, if that the said <hi>Baker,</hi> and those that concealed themselves with him were not delivered up. And afterwards he would have made his escape at Crab Island, but was hindred by four of Capt. <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hendrick Quintor</hi> saith, That he was taken by Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Labous,</hi> and they had agreed to let him go to the Coast of <hi>Crocus</hi> in the French Vessel which they took him in, but the Commander thereof soon after dyed, and so Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> would not permit him to proceed the said Voyage, and he was unavoidably forced to continue among the Pirates.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Cornelius Hoof</hi> declares and saith, That he was taken by Capt. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> in a Vessel whereof <hi>John Cornelius</hi> was Master, That the said <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Company Swore they would kill him unless he would joyn with them in their Unlawful Designs.</p>

               <hi>John Shuan</hi> by his Interpreter saith, That he was sick at the time when Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> took him, and went on board the Pirate Vessel at the Instance of Capt. <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Doctor, who advised him to stay with him till his Cure. And that when he went on board the Pink <hi>Mary Anne</hi> he did not carry any Arms with him; and that he hoped by going on board the Pink he should the sooner make his escape from the Pirates, for that he had a better way of getting his living than by Pirating.</p>

THE Evidences for the King being fully heard, and also the Pleas &amp; Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations made by the Prisoners at the Bar; His Majesty's Attorney General in a very handsome and learned Speech summed up the Evidence, and made his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the whole; and after him the Advocate General having resumed the Articles of Indictment, the Depositions of Witnesses, and the Prisoners defences, observed to the Court, That their pretence of being forced out of the respective Ships and Vessels, they belonged to, by <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Labous,</hi> if it was true, can never excuse their Guilt, Since no case of Necessity can justify a direct violation of the Divine and Moral Law, and give one the liberty of <hi>Sinning,</hi> whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions may be allowed from Laws purely Possitive, and humane establishments: But on the contrary, that they acted freely and by their own choice, is most plain and obvious, for when they had the fairest opportunity, that could have happen'd, to make their escape, if they had intended it, by means of the Weather, Wind and nearness of the Shoar, they were obstinately resolved rather to hazard the Vessel and their Lives, than lose company with the <hi>Whido.</hi> That <hi>Shuan</hi> and <hi>Souths</hi> going on board the Pink unarmed, is not material, nor does that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance extenuate the Crime in the least; if the rest had gone without Arms, as they might with security enough, considering their Number, and the weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those, they had to deal with, and that the Pink then lay under <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s command, Can any Person imagine they would have been less criminal? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose one or two Ruffians having no Arms meet a Man in the High-way, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of threatnings and force, give him good Words, and at the same time put their hands in his Pockets and rob him of his Money, Are they not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Robbers because they did not draw a Sword or Pistol? The guilt is incurred by possessing the Innocent Persons mind with such just apprehensions and dread of extream danger, as to determine him to avoid a greater evil by exposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a less one, that is to save his Life by delivering up his goods. That it appears evidently by the Deposition of <hi>Checkley,</hi> that <hi>Shuan</hi> at the time they both belonged to one Vessel voluntarily joyned the Pirates, and the three first Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses declare, That he acted his part on board the Pink with as much forwardness as the rest. That as to <hi>Souths</hi> inoffensive behaviour on board, and his inclination to make his escape, it shews the presure of his guilt, but does not take off the weight in the eye of the Law. He was a part of the Crew, marked in the Watch Roll, intituled to a share of the booty, and imployed in such interprizes, as none but experienced and accomplished Villains could have been trusted with, and tho' at last perhaps he might not seem so active as the rest, yet his very presence on board the Pink involved him in the same crime, and <hi>Facinus, quos inquinat, AEquat.</hi> Besides, it being proved by the Oaths of some of the Witnesses, That <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Labous</hi> did not press any body (nor indeed is it credible they would) and there being no reason to doubt of his listing himself amongst those, with whom we found him, his Repentance may save his Soul, but cannot except him from the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to his crime: It being a Maxim both in Law and Morality, <hi>That an involuntary act taking its rise from an act that is voluntary, is likewise accounted vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</hi> And as it hath ever been the glory of our August Monarchs to suppress Piracies by force &amp; wholesome Laws, whilst other Nations have to their perpetual disgrace called Pirates to their assistance, and admitted them to a share of the Plunder. As the English Trade is in the utmost danger at present in <hi>America</hi> from the prodigious Number of Ships exercised in Piracies, and as Providence hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preserved us by destroying their Capital Ship with her Numerous Crew, and hath no less wonderfully delivered into the hands of Publick Justice, the Prisoners at the Bar, to teach others by their Exemplary Punishment to abhor the barbarous and inhumane practices, which have been fully proved against them, and whereof they stand convicted. He humbly moved His Excellency and the Honourable the Commissioners to proceed to pass Sentence of Death upon all and each of them, they being all equally Guilty; and concluded with saying, That to shew the least Pity in matters of this Kind, where the Proofs are so full and Pregnant, and not the least presumption in favour of the Prisoners, would be the greatest cruelty. <hi>Unnum Pietatis genus, in hac re esse crudelem.</hi>

The Court was Cleared, and the Evidences and Pleadings there upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Prisoners, with their Defences, having been duly considered, and the Question put with respect to each of the Prisoners severally, <hi>Guilty or not Guilty.</hi> The Court Voted <hi>Simon Van Vorst, John Brown, Thomas Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Hendrick Quintor, Peter Cornelius Hoof,</hi> and <hi>John Shuan, Guilty</hi> of Piracy, Robbery, and Felony, according to the Indictment. But forasmuch as <hi>Thomas South</hi> at the time when the Pink <hi>Mary Anne</hi> was taken, went on board her without Arms in a Peaceable manner; and manifested and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto <hi>Fitz Gyrald</hi> the Mate of the Pink when she was in sight of the Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> and there was no sufficient grounds to hope for his escape, That he was taken from on board of a Jamaica Vessel and compelled utterly against his Will to joyn with the Pirates; And that he was fully resolved to leave them the first opportunity that should afterwards present, and his Behaviour and Carriage towards the Mate being always Civil and Kind; The Court were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And nothing being offered, more than what was said upon their Trial, by any of them, except <hi>John Brown;</hi> who pleaded the benefit of Clergy, which was denyed him, being contrary to Law; The President Pronounced the Decree of the Court against the said <hi>Simon Van Vorst, John Brown, Thomas Baker, Hendrick Quintor, Peter Cornelius Hoof,</hi> and <hi>John Shuan</hi> in the words following. <abbr>

            <p>Then the Kings Evidences were called into Court, and no objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them being made by the Prisoner.</p>
            <p>O<hi>Wen Morris</hi> Mariner was first Examined upon Oath, Who Solemnly Testifyed &amp; Declared, That he knew the Prisoner at the Bar, That he belonged to the Ship St. <hi>Michael</hi> whereof <hi>James Williams</hi> was Master; And in the Month of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1716. they left <hi>Bristol</hi> bound to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Decemb.</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the said Ship was taken by two Pirate Sloops, one commanded by Capt. <hi>Sam Bellamy,</hi> &amp; the other by <hi>Loues Lebous,</hi> about Twenty Leagues off <hi>Sabria,</hi> That they gave the said <hi>Williams</hi> his Ship and detained the Prisoner because he was a Carpenter &amp; a Single Man, together with Three others of the Ships company. And further the Deponent saith, That the Prisoner was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go with <hi>Bellamy,</hi> and prevailed with him by reason of his Intreaties to promise that he should be discharged in the next Vessel that was taken: And afterwards the Deponent was again taken in the Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Prince</hi> by the said Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> who was then commander of the Ship <hi>Sultania,</hi> taken from Capt. <hi>Richards,</hi> as the Deponent understood, and then he saw the Prisoner aboard the said Ship; at which time the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reminded the said <hi>Bellamy</hi> of his promise: when he asked him, If he was willing to go, He answered, Yes: and then the said Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> replied, If the company would consent he should go: And thereupon he asked his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, If they were willing to let <hi>Davis</hi> the Carpenter go? Who expressed

themselves in a Violent manner, saying, <hi>No, Damn him,</hi> they would first shoot him or whip him to Death at the Mast.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas South</hi> Mariner, lately taken by Capt. <hi>Samuel Bellamy</hi> in the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Ship <hi>Whido</hi> cast away upon this Coast, and discharged upon his Trial, was admitted an Evidence, and being accordingly Sworn, saith, That the said <hi>Bellamy</hi> while he was in command of the said Ship <hi>Whido,</hi> took a Scotch Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel off the Capes of <hi>Virginia</hi> last Spring, Cut down her Masts &amp; sunk her: That he heard the said <hi>Thomas Davis</hi> went on board her; but did not see him. That this Deponent thought it not prudent to be too farmiliar with the Prisoner, because it might tend to create a jealousy in the pirates; that the Deponent and the Prisoner (whom they suspected, because he was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Man) would run away together. The Deponent saith further, That Capt <hi>James Williams</hi> commander of the Ship St. <hi>Michael</hi> (whose Carpenter the Prisoner was) Intreated the said Capt <hi>Bellamy</hi> when he took him to let the Prisoner go. But the Ships company would by no means consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by reason he was a Carpenter; and Swore that they would shoot him before they would let him go from them.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>John Brett</hi> Mariner Sworn, saith, That he was taken by Capt. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Bellamy,</hi> before the Ship <hi>Sultana</hi> was taken from Capt. <hi>Richards,</hi> and then it was the Custom among the Pirates to force no Persons, but those that remained with them were Volunteers.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Thomas Fox</hi> Sworn, saith, That he was taken by the Pirates in <hi>July</hi> last, and robbed, and they Questioned him, Whether any thing was done to the Pirates in <hi>Boston</hi> Goal: The Deponent answered, He knew nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. And in particular a Dutch-man belonging to the Pirates, asked him about his confort a Dutch man in <hi>Boston</hi> Prison; and said, That if the Prisoners suffered they would Kill every body they took belonging to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seth Smith</hi> Prison-keeper in <hi>Boston</hi> Sworn, saith, That when the Prisoner at the Bar was first brought to Goal, his illness hindred their talking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but sometime after as they were discoursing, the Deponent observed to the Prisoner, That if he would be ingenuous &amp; make a confession, he might save his Life, and be a good Evidence against the other Pirates in Prison. To which the Prisoner made answer, That he was abused by several of the Pirates that were Drowned, and was glad he had got from them, but knew nothing against the rest of the Pirates in Prison.</p>
            <p>Then the Kings Council moved the Court that Capt. <hi>Thomas Glyn,</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for Debt upon Execution, might be brought into Court to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on His Majesty's behalf in this Trial: Whereupon the Court direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sheriffs, who have the keeping of His Majesty's Goal, to bring the said <hi>Glyn</hi> into Court.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Isaac Morris</hi> Sworn, saith, That on the 14th of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1716. he was taken by the Pirates, but knows nothing of Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> or his Accomplices.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Thomas Glyn</hi> being brought into Court by the Sheriffs, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated upon Oath, saith, That he never knew the Prisoner till he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Goal for Piracy, that he frequently afterwards conversed with him, but knew nothing against him.</p>
            <p>After which the Prisoner was desired by the President to speak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Who said, That he was Carpenter of the Ship St <hi>Michael</hi> whereof <hi>James Williams</hi> was Capt. and Sailed out of <hi>Bristol</hi> in <hi>Great Britain</hi> in the Month of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1716. bound for <hi>Jamaica;</hi> and in <hi>Decemb.</hi> following the Ship was taken about Twenty Leagues off <hi>Sabria</hi> by two Pirate Sloops commanded by Capt <hi>Samuel Bellamy,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Lebous,</hi> who carryed the Ships com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the Island of <hi>Blanco</hi> where they were detained till the Ninth day of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002003_0022_0FBA84A378B355C8"/>
               <hi>January</hi> last, when he and fourteen other Prisoners were put on board the <hi>Sultan</hi> Galley, then under the said <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s command who had taken her from Capt. <hi>John Richards:</hi> And afterwards took another Ship called the <hi>Whido,</hi> in which Ship to his great grief &amp; sorrow, he was forced to come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Coast, where she was cast-away: And he with one <hi>John Julian</hi> only escaped Drowning He further saith, That he was no way active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Pirates, only as he was compelled by them.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>John Valentine</hi> the Procurator in Defence of the Prisoner obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Court, That if he believed the Prisoner to be guilty of the crimes, for which he was Indicted, he should not appear on his behalf: That he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped this Honourable Court upon consideration that there was little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing said, much less proved against the Prisoner, they would acquit him as being Innocent, for that in all Capital crimes there must be down-right Proofs and plentiful Evidence to take away a Mans Life, and then he made the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks on the Evidences. <abbr>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Owen Morris</hi> Testifyed, That the Prisoner at the Bar was forced and constrained against his Will to continue with the said Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> and his company. And it appears by the Oath of <hi>Thomas South</hi> as well as by <hi>Morris,</hi> That the Prisoner desired Capt. <hi>Bellamy</hi> to release him upon his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another Vessel according to his Promise, but his company would not consent thereto; And altho' <hi>South</hi> says, that he believes the Prisoner was on board the Scotch Vessel when her Masts were cut down, yet the Prisoner ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denies it, and <hi>Souths</hi> belief was grounded upon hear-say.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Bretts</hi> Evidence serves only to inform the Court that the Pirates did not Press Men before the Prisoner was taken, but it is well proved, That when they took the Prisoner they compelled him to be among them, to his great sorrow and grief.</p>
            <p>The Evidence of <hi>Thomas Glyn</hi> avails nothing, and if the Prisoner had been never so Guilty, his confession made in Prison, shall not be taken as Evidence against him on the Trial. And whereas the prisoner stands charged in the Indictment with Accumulative crimes; the Procurator in Defence was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to say, <hi>That in the Trial of my Lord</hi> Strafford <hi>his Attainder was reversed because he was Indicted upon Accumulative Crimes,</hi> which is contrary to Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Oliver Noyes</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> was Sworn, and Declared, That he heard Capt. <hi>Richards</hi> say, That when he was taken by Capt. <hi>Bellamy,</hi> the Prisoner at the Bar was very desirous to be released &amp; cryed, giving out that he was undone by being detained among them. And one of the Pirates hearing him lament his sad condition, said, <hi>Damn him, He was a Presbyterian Dog, and should fight for King</hi> James, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Osgood</hi> Mariner Sworn, saith, That he well knew the Prisoner, That he was a Sober, Honest Man, of good Conversation <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>John French</hi> Sworn, saith, That he has known the Prisoner above a Year &amp; an half being frequently with him at <hi>Bristol,</hi> and in <hi>Antegoa,</hi> that he had a good Character, and was reputed an Honest Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>John Corney</hi> Sworn, saith, That he knew the Prisoner at <hi>Antegoa,</hi> when he was Carpenter to Capt. <hi>Moor,</hi> and never heard any harm of him.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Samuel Shrimpton</hi> lately Arrived here from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> Sworn, saith, That he heard one of <hi>Davis'</hi>s company say, That <hi>Davis</hi> the Prisoner was a forced Man, and he would Swear it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Valentine</hi> moved, That an Affidavit under the firm Seal of a Notary Publick in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and in favour of the Prisoner should be read in open Court, but his Motion was rejected, being contrary to Act of Parliament, which directs that all Evidences respecting Pirates shall be given into Court <hi>Viva Voce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002003_0023_0FBA84A4D4D47D30"/>
The President asked the Prisoner, What he had to say for himself: The Prisoner answered, He was not on board of the Scotch Ship that was sunk as was reported; and that he humbly conceived the Evidence produced in order to his condemnation sufficiently proved his Innocence: That his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney had fully spoke his Mind &amp; Sentiments, and therefore he should not trouble this Honourable Court any longer in his Defence, or to that purpose.</p>
            <p>THE Evidence on both sides being closed, the Advocate General reduced the whole under the following Heads. That the Indictment consisted chiefly of two parts. The first charges the Prisoner with Piracy committed by him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> last, in the Windward passage on an English Ship na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Whido;</hi> the second with another Piracy about a Month after on a Scotch Vessel off the Capes of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the first, <hi>Morris</hi> Depones, that when he was taken with Capt. <hi>Prince</hi> in the <hi>Whido</hi> he saw the Prisoner on Board the Piratical Ship <hi>Sultana,</hi> and heard <hi>Bellamy</hi> ask him, if he was willing to go, which necessarily proves that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner at that time was under no confiement, but one of the Crew, otherwise no such question could have been put to him. This he himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges and in his Confession <note n="(a)" place="margin">v. Append.</note> further declares, that tho' at first the old Pirates were a little shy of the new ones, and it seems not without good reason, they being only 80 in number to 130, yet in a short time the <hi>New Men</hi> being sworn to be faithful, and not to cheat the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to the Value of a <hi>Piece of Eight,</hi> they all consulted and acted together with great unanimity, and no distinction was made between <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New.</hi> Capt. <hi>Brett,</hi> who was likewise taken by <hi>Bellamy</hi> expressly says, that it was not the Pirates custom to Force any Person, and that such as were amongst them were Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers. And whatever Sentiments the Prisoner might entertain of his Companions, it is plain from Capt. <hi>Fawke's</hi> Evidence that they had a very tender concern for <hi>him.</hi> Had he been really affected with so much <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>sorrow</hi> as he pretends, it was not impossible for him to have made his Escape at some of the Places where he touched before he came on this Coast, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>Blanco,</hi> the <hi>Spanish Main, Testages</hi> and <hi>Long-Island;</hi> but it is not so much as suggested, that ever he attempted it, nor is it to be presumed as matters stood; the spoil was not yet divided, and it is obvious he expected to receive his share <note n="(b)" place="margin">V. Ap.</note>.</p>
            <p>To the second, <hi>South</hi> declares, that <hi>Bellamy</hi> took the Vessel cut down her Masts and afterwards sunk her, that the Deponent being Sick at that time was told by <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s Crew, and does believe, that the Prisoner went on Board the Vessel: And further saith, that the Pirates could not be prevail'd with to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Prisoner because he was a Carpenter. The truth is, <hi>Bellamy</hi> sent the Prisoner and another Carpenter on Board, who by his Order cut away the Masts and bored a hole in the bottom of the Vessel, and so destroyed her. This was a piece of work properly belonging to Carpenters, and it was for performing such Services the Prisoner made himself so acceptable and necessary to his Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To take off the weight of this Evidence it is said, that it is only <hi>Hear say,</hi> but the Court will consider that the Deponents belief, as it is grounded on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Reports of 120 Persons, to whom the Fact must needs have been notoriously known, is no less certain, than if he had seen the Fact committed. But admiting the Prisoner not to be directly concerned in sinking the Vessel, yet it is clear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction, that he was on board the <hi>Whido,</hi> and one of the Crew, that surprized and took her, and consequently Guilty of Piracy; the other Facts laid in the Indictment being only circumstances, which help to give light to the discovery of his Crimes.</p>
            <p>For the manner of proof required in capital Crimes, especially such as are Atrocious, as in the present case, He referred the Court (in answer to what was alledged on that point in behalf of the Prisoner) to the Authorities produced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, adding, that if the Crimes did appear by the Qualifications and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as they were libelled, to be made out by undoubted presumptions, altho' every circumstance be not proved by two direct Witnesses, the same ought to be held for <hi>Clear &amp; Plain Evidence.</hi> And as to the Exception touching Accumulative Crimes, no reply seem'd needful, it being founded on a palpable Mistake, as if <hi>Accumulative probation</hi> and <hi>Accumulative Crimes</hi> were the same.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002003_0024_0FBA84A63B868298"/>
He observed in the last place, that the only plausible Argument offered in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Prisoner was his being taken and detained by Force, which he could not possibly withstand, and since <hi>Necessity has no Law,</hi> and every Man is carried on with an irresistible Ardour to any means of preserving himself, some perhaps might believe him innocent, as not being answerable for the Crimes, which for his own safety he was obliged to commit; therefore to prevent any mistake that might happen concerning this important Point, he Pray'd His Excellency and the Honourable Bench to consider,</p>
            <p>That Force can never justify nor excuse an Action, that is contrary to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>Moral Law,</hi> for as it cannot be committed without expressing indirectly at least some contempt for the supreme Legislator, it would be the highth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to think that these Laws can admit any exception of <hi>Cases of Necessity. A Man</hi> [says the very Heathen <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cic. ad Attic.

            <p>The Substance of the Examinations of John Brown, &amp;c. Taken by Order of His Excellency the GOVERNOUR, on Monday the 6th of May, 1717.</p>
            <p>J<hi>Ohn Brown</hi> being interrogated saith, That he was born in the Island of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> is 25 Years old, and Unmarried. About a Year ago he belonged to a Ship Commanded by Capt. <hi>Kingston,</hi> which in her Voyage with Logwood to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was taken to the Leeward of the <hi>Havana</hi> by two Piratical Sloops, one Commanded by <hi>Hornygold</hi> and the other by a Frenchman called <hi>Labous,</hi> each ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 70 Men on Board. The Pirates kept the Ship about 8 or 10 Days and then having taken out of her what they thought proper delivered her back to some of the Men, who belonged to her <hi>Labous</hi> kept the Examinate on board his Sloop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4 Months, the English Sloop under <hi>Hornygolds</hi> command keeping company with them all that time. Off Cape <hi>Corante</hi> they took two Spanish Briganteens without any resistance laden with Cocoa from <hi>Maraca.</hi> The Spaniards not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to the Pirates demand about the ransom were put a-shore and their Briganteens burn'd. They Sailed next to the Isle of <hi>Pines,</hi> where meeting with 3 or 4 English Sloops empty, they made use of them in cleaning their own, and gave them back. From thence they Sailed to <hi>Hispaniola</hi> in the latter end of <hi>May,</hi> where they tarryed about 3 Months. The Examinate then left <hi>Labous</hi> and went on board the Sloop Commanded formerly by <hi>Hornygold,</hi> at that time by one <hi>Bellamy,</hi> who upon a difference arising amongst the English Pirates because <hi>Hornygold</hi> refused to take and plunder English Vessels, was chosen by a great Majority their Captain &amp; <hi>Hornygold</hi> departed with 26 hands in a prize Sloop, <hi>Bellamy</hi> having then on Board about <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Men, most of them English <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Labous</hi> sailed to the <hi>Virgin</hi> Islands, and took several small Fishing Boats and off St <hi>Croix</hi> a French Ship laden with Flower and Fish from <hi>Canada,</hi> and having taken out some of the Flower gave back the Ship. Plying to the Windward the Morning they made <hi>Saba</hi> they spy'd 2 Ships, which they chased and came up with, one was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Richards,</hi> the other by Capt. <hi>Tosor</hi> both bound to the <hi>Bay.</hi> Having plundered the Ships and taken out some Young Men they dismist the rest &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>T<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sor's</hi> Ship, and made a Man of War of <hi>Richard'</hi>s, which they put under the Command of <hi>Bellamy,</hi> and appointed <hi>Paul Williams</hi> Captain of their Sloop. Next Day they took a Bristol Ship, Commanded by <hi>James Williams</hi> from <hi>Ireland</hi> laden with Provisions, and having taken out what Provisions they wanted and 2 or 3 of the Crew, let her go. They parted with their French consort at the Island of <hi>Blanco</hi> and stood away with their Ship and Sloop to the Windward passage, where in the latter end of <hi>February</hi> last they met with Capt. <hi>Lawrence Prince</hi> in a Ship of 300 Ton called the <hi>Whido</hi> with 18 Guns mounted, and 50 Men bound from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>London</hi> laden with Sugar, Indigo, Jesuits Bark and some Silver and Gold, and having given chase 3 Days took him without any other resistance than his firing two chase Guns at their Sloop, &amp; came to an Anchor at <hi>Long Island. Bellamy'</hi>s crew and <hi>Williams'</hi>s consisted then of 120 Men. They gave the Ship ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Capt. <hi>Richards</hi> to Capt. <hi>Prince,</hi> and loaded her with as much of the best and finest goods as She could carry, and gave Capt. <hi>Prince</hi> above Twenty Pounds in Silver and Gold to bear his charges. They took 8 or 10 Men belonging to Capt. <hi>Prince,</hi> the Boatswain and two more were forced, the rest being Volunteers. Off <hi>Pettiguavis</hi> they took an English Ship hired by the <hi>French</hi> laden with Sugar and <hi>I</hi>ndigo, and having taken out what they had occasion for, and some of the Map, dismist her. Then they stood away for the <hi>Capes</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> being 130 Men in company, and having lost sight of their Sloop the Day before they made the Land, they cruised ten Days according to agreement between <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> in which time they seized 3 Ships and one Snow, two of them from <hi>Scotland,</hi> one from <hi>Bristol,</hi> and the fourth a Scotch Ship from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with a little Rum and Sugar on Board, so leaky that the Men refused to proceed farther. The Pirates sunk her. Having lost the Sloop they kept the Snow, which was taken from one <hi>Montgomery,</hi> being about 100 Ton and manned her with 18 hands, which with her

own Crew made up the number of 28 Men; the other 2 Ships were discharged being first plundered. They made the best of their way for <hi>Cape Cod</hi> intending to clean their Ship at <hi>Green Island</hi> (having one. <hi>

He further saith, that there were about 50 Men forced, over whom the Pirates kept a watchful eye, and no Man was suffered to write a word, but what was Nailed up to the Mast. The names of the forced Men were put in the watch Bill and fared as others, they might have had what Money they wanted from the Quarter Master, who kept a Book for that purpose, but this Examinate took only Cloaths. It was the common report in their Ship, that they had about 20000 <hi>Pounds</hi> in Gold and Silver. That <hi>Peter Ho<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ff</hi> was once whip'd for attempting to Run-away, and that he and every one of the other Prisoners were forced to Join the Pirates</p>
            <p>T<hi>Homas Baker</hi> being Examined saith, That he was Born in <hi>Flushing,</hi> Aged 29 Years, by Trade a Taylor, and sometimes went to Sea, and sometimes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Trade ashore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he was taken with 9 more in a little Boat coming from <hi>Cape Francois,</hi> by <hi>Bellamy</hi> and <hi>Labous,</hi> but they were sent away being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Men. This Examinate was never sworn as the rest were. Being on Board of <hi>Lebous</hi> he asked leave to go on Board of <hi>Bellamy,</hi> that he might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of getting away, and accordingly he went, but found that <hi>Bellamy</hi> would not discharge him, on the contrary threatned to set him ashore on a <hi>Moroon</hi> Island if he would not be easy. When they took <hi>Richards, Tosor</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> they spread a large black Flag, with a Death's Head and Bones a-cross, and gave chase to Captain <hi>Prince</hi> under the same Colours. They had on Board 20000 or 30000 <hi>Pounds,</hi> and the Quarter Master declared to the Company, that if any Man wanted Money he might have it. The Examinate came on Board the Pink which was taken off <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> Armed. The reason why he and the other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners did not discover themselves to the Government when they first came ashore was because they expected to get to <hi>Boston</hi> and there Ship themselves as Sailors. In all other particulars he agrees with what is above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THomas Davis</hi> Examined saith, He was born in <hi>Carmarthenshire</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> Aged Two &amp; twenty Years, is by Trade a Ship wright, and has used the Sea these five Years. He Sail'd from <hi>Bristol</hi> with Capt. <hi>Williams,</hi> and was taken on the 19th of <hi>December</hi> last, by <hi>

               </hi> 9 leagues to the Leeward of <hi>Blanco,</hi> and in <hi>January</hi> he joyned <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s company. When the company was called together to <hi>Consuls,</hi> and each Man to give his Vote, they would not allow the forced Men to have a Vote. There were One hundred and thirty forced Men in all, and Eighty of the Old company; and this Examinate being a forced Man had no opportunity to discover his Mind. From <hi>Blance</hi> they Sail'd to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Main and water'd there, and from thence to a <hi>Moroon</hi> Island called <hi>Testegos,</hi> where they fitted up a Ship and Sloop of their own. All the New Men were Sworn to be true and not to cheat the company to the value of a piece of Eight. That when they chased the <hi>Whido</hi> they thought they had lost her, but came up with her the third day. Capt. <hi>Prince</hi> was treated civily. What Money they got in the <hi>Whido</hi> was not shared. Seven or eight of the <hi>Whido'</hi>s Crew joyned them. That their design in coming on this Coast was to get Provisions: That three of the Vessels, they look off the <hi>Capes</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the fourth to <hi>Bredhampston,</hi> and when a Prize was taken the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill was called over, and Men put on board as they stood named in the Bill, and no more imposed on the forced Men than the Volunteers, they being all alike. The same day the <hi>Whido</hi> was lost, they took a Sloop coming from <hi>Virginia.</hi> The Ship being at an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, they cut their Cables and ran a shoar, in a quarter of an hour after the Ship struck, the Main-mast was carried by the board, and in the Morning She was beat to pieces. About Sixteen Prisoners drown'd, <hi>Crumpstey</hi> Master of the Pink being one, and One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty-four in all. The riches on board were laid together in one heap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PEter Hooff</hi> declares, That he was born in <hi>Sweden,</hi> is about 34 Years old, and left his Country 18 Years ago. He Sail'd for the most part with the Dutch on the Coast of <hi>Portobello,</hi> and has been with the Pirates fourteen Months<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he was taken by <hi>Bellamy</hi> in a <hi>Persaga,</hi> he belong'd to a Ship whereof one <hi>Cornelison</hi> was Master: Three Weeks after he was taken they went to <hi>Portobello</hi> in a French Sloop with 60 Men on board; then stood for the <hi>Havana,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cuba,</hi> where they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> met with a Pink, an English-man Master, and took out some Powder and Shot, and some Men. A difference arising amongst them about taking Prisoners; Some being for one Nation and some for another; and having at that time Two Sloops

and about 100 Men, <hi>Hornygold</hi> parted from them in One of the Sloops, and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> and <hi>Labous</hi> kept company together. They turned to the Windward from the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Pines</hi> to look out for a Ship of Force. The Money taken in the <hi>Whido,</hi> which was reported to Amount to 20000 or 30000 Pounds, was counted over in the Cabin, and put up in bags, Fifty Pounds to every Man's share, there being 180 Men on Board. No Married Men were forced. Their Money was kept in Chests between Decks without any guard, but none was to take any without the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Masters leave.</p>

               </gap> Two Months and an half ago he was taken by <hi>Bellamy</hi> in an English Ship coming from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> commanded by an English-man, and a French-man, bound from <hi>Pettiguavis</hi> to <hi>Rochel,</hi> with Sugar. This Examinate knows nothing of the Scotch Vessel's being sunk. When <hi>Crumpstey'</hi>s Pink was taken on this Coast, He desired <hi>Bellamy</hi> to give him leave to go on board her, but could not obtain it, by reason he had not taken up Arms, yet afterwards <hi>Bellamy</hi> let him go. He further declares, That he never was upon the List as the rest were: That in the Ship he belong'd to the Pirates found 5000 Liyres, and on board of <hi>Bellamy'</hi>s there was a great quantity of Silver and Gold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon Van Vorst</hi> declares, That he was born in the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> aged 24 Years. That he went from <hi>New-York</hi> to St. <hi>Thomas'</hi>s, and from thence to <hi>Cape Francois,</hi> where he staid three Months, and came from thence in <hi>October</hi> last in a Boat with Captain <hi>Simsons</hi> Men, who were Prisoners there, and standing over to <hi>Cape Nicholas</hi> they spy'd two Sail, which came pretty near them, and firing a Gun brought them on board, three were dismist, being Married. The Examinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <hi>Labous</hi> to let him goe on board of <hi>Bellamy,</hi> and accordingly he went, <hi>Bellamy</hi> told him he must be easy until they could find Volunteers, or he would put him a shoar on some <hi>Moroon</hi> Island. Next day they took a Sloop coming from <hi>Cape Francois,</hi> and soon after a French Ship, out of which they took <hi>Claret</hi> and Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They cleaned at St. <hi>Croix,</hi> where 3 of their Men Ran away, and one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought back was severely whipped. Plying to Windward for what they could get they took <hi>Richards, Tosor</hi> and a <hi>Bristol</hi> Ship laden with Beef. He further declares, That he saw many of <hi>Williams'</hi>s, <hi>Tosor'</hi>s and <hi>Richards'</hi>s Men Cry &amp; express their Grief upon their being compelled to go with <hi>Bellamy.</hi> After the <hi>Whido</hi> was taken they gave <hi>Richards'</hi>s Ship to Capt. <hi>Prince</hi> and put as great a quantity of Goods on Board, as he desired. They took 10 or 12 of <hi>Prince's</hi> Men of whom the Boatswain and 2 or 3 more were forced. The Examinate went on Board <hi> Crumpsty's </hi> Pink Armed with a Gun and Pistol, and he and the other 6, who were with him were all equal as to the commanding part, being in course according to the list or Watch Bill.</p>
