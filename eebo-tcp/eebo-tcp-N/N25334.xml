            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OF THE CHOLERA.</head>
            <p>THE chief ſymptoms in this diſeaſe are a vomiting and purging concurring together, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alternating with one another. And the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations both upwards and downwards are manifeſtly mixed with bile.</p>
            <p>From this laſt circumſtance the diſeaſe appears to depend upon an increaſed ſecretion of bile, and its copious effuſion into the alimentary canal.</p>
            <p>This effuſion of bile irritates, and excites the motions abovementioned.</p>
            <p>When the diſeaſe begins with violence the ſpaſmodic contractions of the inteſtines are ſoon communicated to the abdominal muſcles, and very frequently to thoſe of the limbs. In this manner the diſeaſe frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes rapidly in violence, till the ſtrength of the patient is greatly and often ſuddenly exhauſted, while a coldneſs of the extremities, cold ſweats, and faintings coming on, an end is put to the patient's life, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the courſe of one day.</p>
            <p>In other caſes the diſeaſe is leſs violent, continues for a day or two, and then ceaſes by degrees; though ſuch recoveries ſeldom happen without the aſſiſtance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>
            <p>In many caſes of young children a diarrhoea returns after the vomiting has ceaſed, and after continuing to harraſs the patient for many weeks, proves fatal.</p>
            <p>The attack of this diſeaſe is not preceded or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with febrile ſymptoms, and though during its courſe, both the pulſe and reſpiration are frequent and irregular, yet theſe ſymptoms are generally ſo en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

removed by the remedies that relieve the ſpaſmodic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections peculiar to the diſeaſe, as to leave no ground for ſuppoſing that it had been accompanied by, or was connected with that aſſemblage of ſymptoms which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignate fever.</p>
            <p>Dr. Sydenham conſidered the appearances of the Cholera in England to be confined to the month of Auguſt, and obſerves, that in proportion to the heat of the air, the violence of the diſeaſe was greater.</p>
            <p>In Philadelphia it is moſt prevalent in the month of July, but caſes frequently occur in June and Auguſt.</p>
            <p>From theſe circumſtances, and from the facts ſtated by Tropical writers, it appears evident that this diſeaſe is the effect of a warmer atmoſphere inducing a defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of vigour in the ſeveral functions of the human body, and eſpecially in the functions of the liver, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, a preternatural ſecretion and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bile is readily induced by the remote cauſes.</p>
            <p>The chief of the remote cauſes of this diſeaſe appears to be a ſudden change in the temperature of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, for it is always moſt prevalent, when after extreme hot and dry weather, a fall of rain has cooled the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</p>
            <p>In ſome caſes after the heat of the ſeaſon has given the prediſpoſition, the diſeaſe is induced by eating too freely of crude vegetables, and ſuch ſubſtances as are of difficult digeſtion.</p>
            <p>Emetics of the draſtic kind are very apt to induce this diſeaſe when employed during the hot ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Though the effuſion of bile into the alimentary canal generally gives riſe to the diſeaſe at firſt, it often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after the bile is completely evacuated, owing to the debility and exquiſite irritability, firſt induced by its irritation. This is ſimilar to what happens after taking an over doſe of Tartar emetic; the vomiting often continuing after every particle of the emetic which firſt excited it, has been evacuated.</p>
            <p>The pores of the ſkin being relaxed and enlarged by the ſummers' heat, and accommodated to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed quantity of perſpirable matter, which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined thither and exhaled, any plethora occaſioned
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033591_0003_0FF795E112975A88"/>
by a diminution, or ſuppreſſion of that diſcharge, muſt load thoſe Viſcera in the abdomen whoſe ordinary ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions are moſt languid at that time. The conſequence of this dertermination is, a diſtention of the veſſels of the abdominal viſcera, and of courſe irritation and pain, and this irritation and pain, occaſion an increaſe of the internal ſecretion, and among the reſt, that of the bile.—</p>
            <p>The bile, and the pancreatic fluid, as well as the gaſtric fluid, appear to be more acrid in this diſeaſe than in a ſtate of health, at leaſt experiments prove this to be the caſe with the gaſtric fluid; hence the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe, or of any other acrid ſubſtance to the debilitated and irritable fibres of the ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, occaſion thoſe enormous and irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their fibres, which have been deſcribed.</p>
            <p>Theſe contractions ſometimes exhibit an appearance of increaſed power, as well as of action, but this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is falacious, otherwiſe ſedative or debililating and not ſtimulating remedies would afford relief.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>REMEDIES.</head>
               <p>IN every caſe of Cholera, the bilious and other acrid matters ſhould be immediately diluted, and carried off by large and frequent draughts or camomile tea or warm water, and where the patient will ſubmit to them by injections of the ſame.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this is accompliſhed, or ſooner, if the ſpaſms have begun to affect the limbs, recourſe ſhould be had to the internal uſe of opium, which ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in a liquid form by the mouth, if the ſtomach will retain it. To an adult, thirty drops ſhould be given in a table ſpoonfull of ſimple peppermint, or cinnamon water, and repeated every hour if retained on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, till the evacuations and ſpaſms ceaſe, but if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, it ſhould be repeated immediately, after every evacuation. The laudanum ſhould be proportioned to the patients age and vigor; to a child from one month to a year, from one to ſix drops will be proper.</p>
               <p>To render the laudanum more certainly effectual: every means ſhould be employed to reſtore the determination
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033591_0004_0FF795E2BA55E238"/>
to the ſurface. For this purpoſe, when practicable, the patient ſhould be immerſed in the warm bath, but where that is impracticable, flannel clothes wrung out of hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be applied to his ſtomach, abdomen and limbs, as hot as he can conveniently bear, and the application of theſe flannel cloths ſhould be repeated as often as they become cool.</p>
               <p>Theſe failing, from eighty to an hundred drops of Laudanum ſhould be thrown up the bowels, in a gliſter of chicken broth, rice gruel, or camomile, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel-ſeed tea, or any other ſimple liquid, moderately warm, and ſhould be repeated every two hours, or after every evacuation, till the ſymptoms ceaſe.</p>
               <p>If the diſeaſe ſhould continue, notwithſtanding the judicious application of the remedies which have been directed; Bliſtering plaſters, or ſinapiſms ſhould be applied to the ſtomach and inſide of the legs, and the whole of the ſpine rubbed with muſtard, mixed with the ſpirits of ſal vol. ammon. or a mixture of the oil of cloves and volatile ſpirits; and the patient ſhould lie between heated blankets, the doors and windows of his chamber being open, for the benefit of pure air.</p>
               <p>When the ſtomach rejects opium in a liquid form, one grain of ſolid opium may be adminiſtered every hour, or after every evacuation, to an adult; and a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity, with any agreeable preſerve and aromatic tea to an infant.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes double flannel cloths ſprinkled with warm ſpiced brandy, or a mixture of oil of cloves, volatile ſpirits and brandy, applied to the ſtomach and bowels, and a common heated flat or ſmoothing iron paſſed over the flannels have afforded ſpeedy relief.</p>

               <p>This diſeaſe is very liable to return the day following, unleſs prevented by having recourſe to preventitives: I therefore make it a rule to exhibit ten or fifteen drops of laud. liquid in ſome agreeable draughts every twelve hours, for three or four days after the evacuations have ceaſed</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:033591_0005_0FF795E61FE4F678"/>At the ſame time the patient ſhould take a decoction or infuſion of Columbo root, with the addition of a few drops of lavender compound, or a little old brandy four or five times a day, to reſtore ſtrength and eaſe to the ſtomach and inteſtines.</p>
               <p>The lighteſt and moſt grateful food, ſhould be taken in a ſmall quantity, at a time.</p>
               <p>In general, adult patients ſoon recover perfectly from this diſeaſe, if managed agreeably to the preceeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; but in infants and young children, the diarr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahoea, with occaſional vomiting, is very apt to continue obſtinate for a great length of time, and in general, proves more fatal to them, than any other diſeaſe to which they are liable.</p>
               <p>The bilious diarrhoea of children, ſhall therefore be the ſubject of the next chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Bilious Diarrhoea of INFANTS, and young CHILDREN.</head>
               <p>THIS diſeaſe is much more prevalent in populous cities, than in villages or farm houſes of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and like the Cholera, of which it is frequently the conſquence, is confined to the ſummer and autumnal ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It is moſt frequent and violent, during thoſe ſeaſons immediately after a ſudden change of the wind, to a colder quarter, and eſpecially after rain, which gives a ſudden coolneſs to the air. This diſeaſe is confined principally to infants at the breaſt and thoſe under two years of age: it ſeldom occurs violently, or proves fatal, after this tender age.</p>
               <p>In Philadelphia, more children are annually deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this diſeaſe, than by all the others to which they ſubject.</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe either returns after the ſuſpenſion of the Cholera, or comes on ſuddenly after expoſure to cold,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033591_0006_0FF795E89A3B5118"/>
generally in the night, and is diſtinguiſhed from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diarrhoea, by the ſeverity of the griping, and the bilious coloured ſtools, accompanied with a frequent inclination to puke, particularly a little before the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has an evacuation by ſtool, or at the time of ſuch evacuation.</p>
               <p>It may alſo be diſtinguiſhed from the Diarrhoea ariſing from teething by the pulſe, condition of the ſkin, the ſtrength of the patient, and the aſpect of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. In the latter, theſe differ very little from their natural ſtate, for ſeveral days after the commencement of the diſeaſe, whereas in the bilious Diarrhoeaa, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in moſt caſes, is evident from the commencement. The pulſe is weak, low, quick and ſoft, the ſkin pale, cold and dry, or cold and moiſt, eſpecially on the limbs —the eyes dull, and the countenance contracted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and liſtleſs.</p>
               <p>The internal heat and thirſt are great—the fleſh grows daily more relaxed, ſoft and emaciated, the thirſt increaſes, the appetite fails; every kind of food is loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and refuſed; no drink but cold water acceptable, and that thrown up ſoon after it is taken. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſeaſe, all the enumerated ſymptoms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, in ſome gradually, in others more rapidly. In the worſt and moſt obſtinate caſes, unleſs early relieved, the ſtools become daily more copious, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways more frequent, and have a cadaverous ſcent, the debility increaſes, every thing taken into the ſtomach paſſes through the bowels undigeſted or but little altered from its natural ſtate; the thirſt becomes inſatiable, the feet ſwell and become oedematous, the belly ſwells and grows hard, the mouth becomes affected with ſuperficial white eruptions and ulcerations, which impedes the ſwallowing; a lethargy enſues, the ſkin appears livid, and often ſpotted, and the patient dies.</p>
               <p>The duration, as well as violence of this diſeaſe, is very various, ſome recovering in three or four days, others lingering for as many months, and recovering after being reduced to perfect ſkeletons; ſome die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the firſt week, others after lingering ſix or ſeven, and ſome ſtill longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033591_0007_0FF795EA2ADFE420"/>As this diſeaſe depends upon ſimilar cauſes, only ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in a leſs degree, as the Cholera, that is upon too great a determination to the liver and inteſtines, and a want of tone in the extreme veſſels, on the external ſurface of the body, and a general ſtate of debility in the circulating organs, and is occaſioned by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of debilitating powers; it is obvious that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of cure, and the remedies employed, ſhould be the ſame as thoſe employed in the cure of Cholera, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differing in degree, or the proportion in which they are applied, at a time when the patient is in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate of vigour.</p>
               <p>An increaſed periſtaltic motion of the inteſtines, may be conſidered as always the chief part in the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe of dirrahoea, and the diſeaſe, is diverſified by the different cauſes which produce this encreaſed motion.</p>
               <p>But in the ſpecies under conſideration, viz. that in which bile predominates in the evacuations, the increaſed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtaltic motion is occaſioned and continued by the bile, effuſed into, and irritating the inteſtines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>If the diarrrhoea becomes ſuſpended by theſe means, mild tonics ſhould be admineſtered to prevent its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. For this purpoſe the Columbo root, either in ſubſtance or infuſion, is in high eſtimation, and is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally found to reſt better on the patients ſtomach, than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033591_0009_0FF795EF65A16C40"/>
the Peruvian bark. From five to ten grains of the powder mixed with a draught of ſimple peppermint wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or cinnamon water may be given to an infant at the breaſt, and repeated four or five times a-day.</p>
               <p>If the child refuſes to take it in powder, it may either be triturated with water in a mortar and ſtrained through linen, or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij of the bruiſed root may be infuſed in eight ounces of boiling water, and from <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij to ℥ſs of the ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed liquor may be taken ſeveral times in the courſe of a day.</p>
               <p>When the Columbo can not be exhibited, or if it fails of ſucceſs—The compound tincture of the bark, or the tincture of gum kino may be ſubſtituted, and a little of the common chalk julep, rendered cordial with vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſpirits, peppermint and laudanum, occaſionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed.</p>
               <p>When the debility is great, laudanum ſhould always be given in very ſmall doſes, and at conſiderable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. From neglecting this circumſtance, numbers have been rendered worſe inſtead of better by its uſe.</p>
               <p>To render the recited remedies more effectual, the warm bath either general or partial, ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and the patient's ſtomach and abdomen rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with ſpiced-brandy, or a compoſition conſiſting of Sp: Vin.

               <p>When the child's countenance appears pale, ſhrunk and depreſſed, reſembling one extremely fatigued, a declenſion of ſtrength is always indicated. If to theſe circumſtances, the ſtools are copious, watery and green, preceded by reſtleſsneſs, toſſing of the limbs, rolling the head, and retching to puke, the caſe is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and alarming. Under theſe circumſtances two or three drops of laudanum ſhould be added to every doſe of the chalk julep, with a due proportion of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile aromatic ſpirits, or eſſential oil, and given every hour till it affords evident relief, and afterwards once in ſix or eight hours till all danger of a return ceaſes,

which will generally be the caſe before the end of the third day. The patient ſhould then be removed out of the hot and impure air of the city, till the ſeaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes cooler.—Unleſs this is complied with, a relapſe is always to be apprehended, ſo long as the cauſes which originally produced the diſeaſe, continue to exiſt.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we might with as much reaſon expect to cure inflamed eyes occaſioned by a ſmoky room, without a change of circumſtances, or ſituation, as to cure the bilious diarrhoea, ſo long as the heat and impurity of the air, which gave origin to the diſeaſe continue to operate.</p>

and covered with flannel; and if the nights and mornings are conſiderably cooler than the reſt of the day, which is generally the caſe after the middle of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, worſted ſtockings or a flannel petticoat long enough to cover the feet, ſhould be worn conſtantly. Small bliſtering plaſters applied to the limbs, and repeated occaſionally, frequently afford relie, not only to the fever, but to the diarrhoea.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the diarrhoea and thirſt ceaſe, the cold bath, either by way of ſhower or immerſion, ſhould be employed regularly once a-day at leaſt.</p>
               <p>When the bath can not be conveniently applied in either of the ways juſt mentioned, the whole body may be walked by means of a thick linen cloth, dipt in cold water and brandy, and wiped dry after each waſhing with a warm napkin; this occaſions a glow on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and in ſome meaſure, ſupplies the place of exerciſe.</p>
               <p>By the uſe of the bath, a proper regulation of diet, and frequent exerciſe in the open air, a relapſe may be generally prevented during the extreme heats of July and Auguſt; but for farther ſecurity, as the ſeaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and the nights and mornings become cold, while the middle of the days continue diſtreſſingly hot, it will be proper to let the infant wear a flannel ſhirt, as well as a long flannel petticoat or worſted ſtockings. Flannel from its texture repels moiſture, and has the property of retaining heat, whereas linen being ſmooth and compact, ſuffers it to eſcape immediately: hence flannel cloathing preſerves the warmth on the ſurface, and thereby prevents morbid determination to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal viſcera.</p>
               <p>Caſes of diarrhoea often occur during the hot ſeaſon, that are not bilious, particularly in June and July. In theſe caſes, the alvine evacuations are generally mixed with more or leſs mucus; the griping, though more ſevere is attended with leſs ſickneſs, and leſs thirſt, and the countenance is always more animated, and the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in general more vigorous.—Children whoſe gums are inflamed by teething, are moſt frequently affected with a diarrhoea of this kind; and my obſervations give me reaſon to believe, that the effects of teething, inſtead
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033591_0012_0FF795F6AC019C18"/>
of being the cauſe of the bilious diarrhoea, is always a preventative, except the inflammation which the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the teeth occaſion, before they paſs through the gum be ſo great as to bring on indirect debility.</p>
               <p>When therefore the gums begin to appear ſwelled and red in caſes of bilious diarrhoea, it may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a favourable circumſtance.—From this circumſtance it is very probable, that mercurial frictions would be beneficial in caſes of bilious diarrhoea, by inducing a ſimilar ſwelling and inflammation, and a general phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtic diatheſis.</p>
               <p>To promote the cure of the diarrhoea mucoſa which if not cauſed, is often aggravated by the irritation and pain of teething; thoſe parts of the gums where the teeth are ready to protrude, ſhould be cut acroſs with a ſcalpel ſufficiently deep to prevent any farther irritation from the edge of the tooth.</p>
               <p>The irritation and pain occaſioned by teething, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally renders the ſtomach liable to be diſordered by every thing the infant takes. When this ſtate of the ſtomach is attended with thin watery ſtools, and no fever, laudanum proportioned to the age of the patient is the moſt certain remedy; but when frequent incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to puke is accompanied, or followed by mucous ſtools, and ſymptoms of more or leſs fever, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the following method of treatment to be the moſt efficacious.</p>
