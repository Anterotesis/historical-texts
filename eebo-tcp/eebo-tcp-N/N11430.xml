            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Why, between you and I and the poſt, Mr. <hi>Puff,</hi> I believe, you, when you would be a repreſentative, and <hi>Trim</hi> the barber, when he would get and keep good cuſtom, act upon much the ſame principles with ninety nine in a hundred of the moſt flaming patriotic ſons of liberty. Intereſt is the word! But I claim the excluſive right of preaching myſelf, only in my own ſhop; every where elſe, I had much rather be a hearer of my good miniſter, Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi>; therefore you muſt excuſe me from entering the liſts here, unleſs it be now and then a word or ſo, by way of marginal note; and upon the word of an honeſt ſhaver, or trimmer, or, call me what you pleaſe, I'd ſhave and trim you all round for nothing, if I could but hear you ſettle intelligibly, what is a whig, and what a tory; what is conſtitution, and what are charter rights and privileges—what is the obedience due from an American Engliſhman, to the King and parliament of Great-Britain, and what are our grievances; for by the mother that bore me, and by the father (if I ever had one) who begot me, I do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly affirm, friend <hi>Brim,</hi> that notwithſtanding all I have heard, and the ſtill greater, all I have preached upon this ſubject, I am ignorant of the eſſential difference (if there is any) between a true whig and an honeſt tory.

But to proceed— In conſidering this queſtion of the right of parliament to make laws to bind us, I ſhall obſerve the diſtinction made by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Dickinſon, Mr. Wilkes, Mr. Otis, and all other advocates for the rights of the Colonies, between legiſlation and taxation—they ſay there muſt neceſſarily be a ſupreme power, lodg'd ſomewhere, of governing and regulating the trade of the Colonies; and this is in the King, Lords and Commons of Great-Britain, but that this does not extend to internal taxes, tho' it includes the right of laying duties on ſuch articles of trade, as they allow us to import, if we chooſe to import them—-and upon this diſtinction was founded our oppoſition to the unhappy ſtamp-act—we then acknowledged the authority of parliament, in it's full extent, excepting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the matter of internal taxation; tho' it is very true, we have ſince been daily growing wiſer and wiſer, 'till at length, we openly avow principles of abſolute independency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deny that the parliament of Great-Britain have any more

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of this new doctrine is, that our charter is a compact between the king and our anceſtors, by which the ſole power of legiſlation is given for ever to our general aſſembly. And in anſwer to this it is ſaid, that it never was in the power of the king to put any Britiſh ſubjects out of the juriſdiction of parliament, and therefore, if he had given ſuch a charter, it would be void; but it is ſaid further, that it is not true in fact; for that no ſuch grant of a ſupreme, independant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable power of legiſlation is, or over was contained in the charter. Now, if ſuch a power be convey'd by the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is either expreſſed or implied—that it is not expreſſed is too clear to be deny'd—and therefore it muſt be implied, or it is not convey'd by the charter, but is merely imaginary. This is a queſtion of the higheſt importance to every man who has got a head, or any property to ſave or to loſe; for the principle, if wrong, leads directly to treaſon and rebellion; to which we are haſtening with a rapidity which I greatly fear, will ſoon plunge us headlong in irretrievable ruin, unleſs we are ſtopt in our career. In order to a right underſtanding of this important matter, it is neceſſary to go back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the caſe ſtood before, at, and ever ſince the time of our receiving the charter:—And from this view we ſhall alſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In 1603, under the reign of King Charles the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, was paſſed An act for the encouragement of trade—in which is this very remarkable clauſe—"And in regard his Majeſty's plantations beyond the ſeas are inhabited and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by his ſubjects of this kingdom of England; for the maintaining a greater correſpondence and kindneſs between them, and keeping them in a firmer dependance upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employment and increaſe of Engliſh ſhipping and ſeamen, vent of Engliſh woollen and other manufactures and commodities, rendering the navigation to and from the ſame, more ſafe and cheap, and making this kingdom a ſtaple, not only of the commodities of thoſe plantations, but alſo of the commodities of other countries and places, for the ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; and it being the uſage of other nations to keep their plantation-trade to themſelves:" &amp;c. Our charter was granted by King William and Queen Mary, in 1692, which impowers the general-court to make laws, "ſo as the ſame be not repugnant or contrary to the laws of the realm of England." And in 1696, during the ſame glorious reign, an act of parliament was made extending all the acts of trade to the Colonies, and requiring all governors and commanders in chief, "to take a ſolemn oath to do their utmoſt, that all the clauſes, matters and things contained in that and former acts of parliament, relating to the colonies and plantations be punctually and <hi>bona fide</hi> obſerved."

Now, when we conſider this claim, openly and repeatedly made, before, at, and immediately after, the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and accepting of the charter, if the charter can be view'd in the light of a compact, is not this evidently one eſſential article of the agreement, on our part, namely, that we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſubmit to the juriſdiction of parliament? It is plain we accepted the charter under this condition. How then can this, with the leaſt colour of truth, be called a new claim? Eſpecially, when this right of parliament, has not only been thus amply claimed, but has been all along exerciſed, in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtances, and without any oppoſition, denial or queſtion on our part—and this I find to be the caſe in fact—for, from the time of our charter, in every reign, acts of parliament have been continually making, impoſing duties, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the trade, manufactures and internal government and police of this and the other colonies;—thus, duties have been impoſed and paid upon ſugar, rum, molaſſes, coffee, wines, &amp;c. and on the other hand, bounties and premiums have been granted on various articles; the trade of hatters, and the manufacture of iron, by ſlitting mills, has been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and reſtrained—wool prohibited from being water-born —the poſt-office erected—the rates of coin eſtabliſhed—the cutting of pine trees prohibited—lands made liable to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of debts—the ſtatute of wills extended to the colonies— the paper current reſtrained—indented ſervants impowered to inliſt—troops raiſed here made ſubject to the articles of war —acts of aſſembly made void—and in divers other inſtances has this ſupreme right of parliament been exerciſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in, continually, without interruption, from the uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Oliver Cromwell to the reign of George the third.</p>

               <p>But the grievance complained of lies here. This act laying the three penny duty on tea, expreſsly mentions, among other purpoſes, the raiſing a revenue: This, ſay we, is taking money out of our pockets without our conſent; and it is argued, that if they may do it in this trifling inſtance, they may do it in all others; and will go on till they leave us nothing. Upon which I would obſerve, in the firſt place, that it is not true, that this is taking money out of our pockets without our conſent; becauſe we are not compell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to buy; and if we will buy, the ſmall pittance which we pay for the duty, we pay with our own conſent, as much as we do any money which we pay for any commodity we buy. The ſame might as well be ſaid, when we buy a quart of rum, or a dram, for when we pay for it, we pay our proportion of the duty laid by act of parliament on molaſſes: This we have done a long time, and never found out that it was a grievance, or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014455_0016_0F92915E9F9E67F8"/>
that we were thereby made <hi>ſlaves</hi>—but the conſequence is falſe and abſurd; for it can never follow, that becauſe we ſubmit to a <hi>reaſonable</hi> law, therefore we muſt be called to ſubmit to the moſt tyrannical, unjuſt and unreaſonable laws. And what is the danger from this law, any more than from other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue laws to which we have ſo long ſubmitted? Thoſe laws have all along, in fact, raiſed a revenue; and becauſe this is mentioned in the act, can this poſſibly alter the caſe? Yes, ſay our patriots, this is claiming a right to tax us; but I deny it; for as I have clearly ſhewn, this is no other claim than has been made, exerciſed and ſubmitted to, for more than a century: It is eſſentially different from taxing us; for a tax is raiſed by compulſion, whether we will or no; but this is a regulation of trade, by which, though it may raiſe a revenue, and is deſigned for this purpoſe, yet no man can be compelled to pay any part of it; and if he does, it is his own voluntary act, as much as when he chooſes to drink wine or rum, rather than cyder, or to wear Engliſh cloth, rather than homeſpun; and they are doing no ſervice to their country, who thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly place tax acts and revenue laws upon the ſame footing and infer a right of taxation, from a right of legiſlation in other reſpects. But further, the tea act, as it is called, was made in the ſeventh year of the preſent reign; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, which I took a copy of, runs thus: "Whereas it is expedient, that a revenue ſhould be raiſed in your Majeſty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate proviſion for defraying the charge of the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the ſupport of civil government in ſuch provinces where it ſhall be found neceſſary, and towards further defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expences of defending, protecting and ſecuring the ſaid dominions."—Now it is generally ſuppoſed, that this expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, in the colonies, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new and unprecedented; but to ſhew that this is a miſtake, I will read you a copy of the preamble to an act, paſſed in the fourth year of this reign, which is thus, "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is expedient, that new proviſions and regulations ſhould be eſtabliſhed for improving the revenue of this kingdom, and for extending and ſecuring the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and your Majeſty's dominions in America, which by the peace have been ſo happily enlarged: And whereas it is juſt and neceſſary that a revenue be raiſed in your Majeſty's ſaid dominions in America, for defraying the expences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, proteſting and ſecuring the ſame," &amp;c. and then the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014455_0017_0F929175AB771EF8"/>
act goes on to lay duties on ſugars, wines, Eaſt-India goods, &amp;c. imported from Great-Britain, &amp;c. This act has been, and ſtill is, ſubmitted to, without the leaſt complaint. Now I ſhould be glad to know, what difference there is between theſe two preambles, ſo far as reſpects the matter of raiſing a revenue.</p>

               <p>Nay, ſo long ago as the year 1670, in an act made for regulating the plantation trade, one reaſon expreſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, is that otherwiſe "the trade of them would, in a great meaſure be diverted from England, and carried elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and his Majeſty's cuſtoms and revenues much leſſened." In ſhort, every revenue act is, in the nature of it, an act for raiſing a revenue, whether it be ſo expreſſed or not; and it is trifling, at this time of day, to ſtart an objection, which does not carry the force even of a quibble. If it be ſaid, that the money raiſed by this act is miſapplied, becauſe our civil offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are paid out of it; I anſwer, this is a diſtinct matter: The monies raiſed by this, and all other revenue acts, are, and, for more than a century, have been, paid into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Exchequer; and if, when there, inſtead of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied towards eaſing Britiſh ſubjects in their taxes, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are now applied for our eaſe, by paying the ſalaries of our Governor, Judges, &amp;c. which, otherwiſe, we muſt pay by an internal tax on our polls and eſtates, it ſeems as if we could have no reaſon to complain of this as a grievance: However, even though the money when raiſed was never ſo groſly miſapplied, it would by no means affect the legality and conſtitutional right of raiſing it; theſe are matters quite diſtinct and independent of each other.</p>

is now confirmed by Parliament, and this is all—now it is plain, they are entitled to the enjoyment of their religion, according to the full extent and meaning of this agreement, or their country ought to be reſtored to them—and if the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment intended to comply with their terms of capitulation, ought they not to give them the fulleſt aſſurance of it, by confirming them by an act? Surely, if Parliament is to be blamed for any thing, it ſhould ſeem to be rather, that they have not quieted the minds of the Canadians, by giving them this aſſurance before—for we muſt remember, that their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is as dear to them, as ours is to us, and they have the ſame right to worſhip God, in the way they think right, that we claim for ourſelves—they have prejudices of education to biaſs them, as we have; and they have their own natural under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and their prieſts to guide them as we have; and they have an equal right with us to the benefit of the goſpel rule, "Do to others as ye would they ſhould do unto you." And we ſhould do well to remember that, "with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we mete, it ſhall be meaſured unto us again."—In ſhort, the only principles upon which Parliament can be arraigned in this inſtance, are entirely deſtructive of all liberty of conſcience; and in point of common juſtice, and the faith of nations, they can be found fault with, only upon the malevolent, unjuſt, diabolical poſition, which, God forbid Proteſtants ſhould ever adopt, that no faith is ever to be kept with hereticks.—As to the danger ariſing to our religion, from this act, it is a mere bugbear, raiſed to diſturb weak minds: for nothing can be more egregiouſly abſurd than to infer, that becauſe the King and Parliament from the plain dictates of juſtice and humanity have complied with their moſt ſolemn treaty made by their General, and upon the faith of which, an extenſive country has been ſurrendered to them, that therefore the King intends to violate his coronation oath, and break thro' the condition upon which he holds his crown; and that the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, collected from all parts of England, are joining in this impolitic, iniquitous, fooliſh deſign.—Let us turn the tables, and make the preſent caſe of the Canadians, our own. Suppoſe the King of France had conquered New-England, at the time the King of England conquer'd Canada, and we had capitulated upon condition, that we ſhould enjoy our own religion, and chooſe our own miniſters, as we had done from the firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the country to this time; and the French General had agreed to this, as General Amh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The act of Parliament grants no new liberty; it only confirms what they have enjoyed for eleven or twelve years, ſince the conqueſt, and for a century before; and has Popery ſpread or prevailed in any degree in the other colonies, during that time— or has our religion ſuffered from the prevalency of that of the Roman Catholics in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for many years paſt,—ſurely people muſt feel but little of the power and influence of their religion, who fear any danger ariſing to it, from the bare toleration of any other religion in any other part of the globe. In ſhort, it is plain, beyond a poſſibility of doubt, that this innocent and juſt act of Parliament is greedily catch'd at, by your deceivers, as a lucky prop to a cauſe which has no foundation, but in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and conſequently, is in danger of falling every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—they have perſuaded you, that the two grand objects for which men in ſociety, will fight, if they ever fight, are now at ſtake, viz. religion and property.</p>

to George the Third, muſt be diſtinguiſhed: And however ſpeciouſly the leaders may flatter their blind followers with hopes of ſucceſs in their oppoſition, by publiſhing extracts of letters from England, they may aſſure themſelves there is not the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that parliament will not ſupport their authority, even to the ruin of the preſent generation, in this and all the other colonies, if it can't be eſtabliſhed at a leſs expence: And it is as certain that ſubmiſſion is required only to ſave the honour of government; they never intend to tax us; they don't wiſh to enſlave us; they abhor the thought; they want us to be happy and free; but no, we forſooth, muſt quarrel for a ſhadow, under a moral certainty of loſing the ſubſtance in the conteſt. The people are told by their oracles, that, if they give way now, their chains are rivited, and ſuch kind of trumpery; but, if they would but open their eyes, they might ſee that this is mere deluſion; let them try the experiment of ſubmitting; and if all their grievances are not redreſs'd, they may as well take up the cudgels, one or two, or ten years hence, as now. They will have hands and guns then as well as now; and the deuce is in it, if they don't think their wives, their children, their eſtates and their necks, worth trying to ſave. Some tell them they have been guilty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon already, they have put their hands to the plough, and it's too late to look back.

I think I can perceive, that the eyes of many begin to open; I heartily wiſh they may attain a full view of their danger, before the door of mercy is ſhut. But I aſk pardon, Rev'd Sir, for breaking in upon your diſcourſe, and interrupting it ſo long; the diſtreſſes coming upon my country, through the wicked machinations of mock patriots lie uppermoſt in my mind; and when I enter upon the ſubject, I know not where to ſtop.
