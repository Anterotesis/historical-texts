            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is the Lords as part of his Counsel, Mind and Will: some of the great things of Gods Law lately Preached, now written to you.</p>
            <p>It is mine, as an Instrument (however unworthy) in the composing, then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing, now publishing of the same.</p>
            <p>It is yours, as I was called by you to this work, a Servant to you therein, and as by this presentation it is now made more especially yours.</p>
            <p>As the Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you are most solemnly Commanded; as mine, most humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; as your own, strongly obliged to peruse, understand, receive and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise what is here sent you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> could not think any thing of mine worthy of the publick view; but seeing your selves thought otherwise, and others, whom I honour and reverence were like minded with your selves; I thought meet to submit to persons of better judgements.

If what is here done may (though but in the least degree) promote the work of the Lords house among you, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, I shall attain my End, and be abundantly rewarded for my Labour.</p>

only while there is nothing but Air before them, upon which they may strike while they will without any danger of being stricken again, such may pass for fair Flourishers, but are no Fighters. It is not so with me (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) I have something before me besides Air, and therefore have other work to do then to beat <hi>That.</hi> I have an Enemy before me which I must strike, and strike down too, and that at my utmost peril.</p>
            <p>The Summe is, he commends to them by his own Example, Fighting for their work and Imployment, and by his Negation of <hi>beating the Air</hi> only, he implies and intends the Contrary Affirmative, <hi>viz</hi> that he was thorough, intense and in good earnest about his work, he did not make a show only, then he did do the thing, there was not an outside, an appearance only, then there was the substance, the reality, and as he did, they ought to do also. Hence take up this plain Doctrine.</p>

                  </gap>y, stoutly, strongly, strenuously, is the Duty incumbent upon every Christian.</hi> The Calling and Imployment of a Souldier is that also of a Christian, in which he is to acquit himself strenuously and like a man. He that will be a Christian indeed must be a Christian Souldier and that in deed, in reality, not in show or appearance, he must fight not flourish only, be a Souldier and that in actual Service too, [<hi>So Fight I</hi>] in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Tense, fighting is with every Christian alwayes in the Present Tense. A Christian must engage in a spiritual warfare, and therein he must not be like <hi>one that beats the Air.</hi> No, but he must act the part or do the work of a Souldier, and that in good earnest. He must not be the picture of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, a Fencer, a Stage-player, one that comes on the Stage and for pleasure, sport or in jest only personates a Souldier, when he really is, and means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less, but he must buckle to the Business of Fighting like a man that aims to make work of it. In a word, we need not alter the Terms of the Text. It is the Duty of every Christian to look at and carry himself as a Souldier in the Fight, wherein he is to behave or demean himself not like <hi>one that beats the Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine hath two parts in it, The one, the calling or Imployment of a Christian, <hi>viz.</hi> he is to Fight, the other contains the manner of his doing it, not slightily, but Substantially, not in jest, but in good earnest.</p>

               <p>That this is so, and wherein it is so, will appear if we Consider,</p>

The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> Jud. 9.11. feared losing its sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness if it should accept of promotion over the Trees: I am sure while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for promotion over others, contend to promote our wills and humours above others (and the Text tells us <hi>Prov. 13.10.</hi> that <hi>only by pride comes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>) we lose our peace, our quietness, our sweetness, and sowre our selves, into a frame unpleasing to God and unprofitable to our selves and others, and the Gain will never countervaile the Damage.

               <p n="2">2. A second word of Encouragement which I may add, and that from my Text, is that <hi>Great</hi> is the <hi>Honour</hi> which the Lord puts upon you as <hi>Military persons,</hi> especially in such a <hi>Capacity</hi> as those that do willingly give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Service of God in such <hi>Exercises,</hi> and that not only in that he speaks of the Saints, (<hi>the excellent ones upon Earth</hi>) in your language, but also in that the Lord is often in Scripture calling himself <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> so also <hi>a Man of Warr,</hi> Exod. 15.3. The Son of God also is <hi>Captain-General,</hi> (as <hi>Mediatour</hi>) under his <hi>Father,</hi> see <hi>Psal. 45.1—5.</hi> Besides the most <hi>eminent</hi> of the Saints all along have been Souldiers, (I mean properly so) <hi>Father Abraham</hi> was free of the <hi>Souldiers-Hall,</hi> and had an <hi>Artillery Garden</hi> at his house, <hi>three hundred</hi> and <hi>eighteen</hi> in his <hi>trained Band,</hi> Gen. 14.14. <hi>David</hi> in like manner, <hi>2 Sam. 17.8.</hi> Indeed, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and all the Saints upon Earth are of your <hi>Company,</hi> which is much for your <hi>Honour.</hi> Again, much of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000193_0037_0FA3170D85AF0C30"/>
the Scripture is spent about Souldiers, and Souldiery. How many <hi>Chapters</hi> in Sacred Writ are no other but so many <hi>Lists</hi> of the <hi>Names</hi> of Souldiers that have been in <hi>former Ages,</hi> and how many more are spent in reciting the <hi>noble Exploits</hi> and <hi>valorous Attempts</hi> and <hi>Enterprizes</hi> of Souldiers? Twice over in two several <hi>Chapters,</hi> viz. <hi>2</hi> Sam. 23. and <hi>1 Chron. 11.</hi> are the Names of <hi>Davids</hi> choice, expert Souldiers, called his <hi>Worthies,</hi> set down. Besides a <hi>large Catalogue</hi> of the <hi>mighty men</hi> that helped <hi>David</hi> is exprest, <hi>1 Chron. 12.</hi> the <hi>expert Commanders</hi> and able Souldiers that came in to them, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>great Host</hi> like the <hi>Host of God,</hi> ver 22. Now to have such <hi>frequent</hi> and Honourable mention made of Souldiers in the Word of God, and to have so <hi>considerable</hi> a part of it so spent, is a <hi>great Honour</hi> to Souldiers, and shews the great delight that <hi>the Lord of Hosts</hi> hath in his Souldiery, it tells us that they are persons <hi>whom the Lord delights to Honour,</hi> And Honour is a good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Spurr to a Souldier. Your Imployment is no <hi>base, low, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Imployment,</hi> but one <hi>highly honoured by the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Souldiers, know that the Lord hath put a great deal of <hi>Honour</hi> upon you, for which you are exceedingly beholden to him; carry it <hi>humbly, thankfully,</hi> and <hi>serviceably</hi> toward God under the <hi>Honour</hi> He conferrs upon you. See that you <hi>Honour</hi> him, who thus <hi>honoureth</hi> you. If <hi>God will Honour those that Honour him,</hi> (1 Sam. 2.30.) Then surely those should <hi>honour him whom he honours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third word of Encouragement I shall take from the great use that God hath all along made of <hi>Military men</hi> in his Church. To be useful and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable is an <hi>Honour,</hi> (for the <hi>more serviceable</hi> the <hi>more Honourable</hi>) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be so <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>immediately serviceable</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church,</hi> as Souldiers have been, yea, are, and shall be even to the very last. And this is a further Encouragement. Though properly the Lord needs no help <hi>against the mighty,</hi> yet he uses them, and one Reason is for the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> of them that he uses. Christ may make use of you to be great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in the places where you live. It is a <hi>Blessing</hi> to a people to have <hi>mighty men</hi> and <hi>men of Warr</hi> among them, as appears, because it is a great judgement to have such taken away from them, <hi>Isai. 3.</hi> Be encouraged then, for you are useful, and may be made <hi>great Blessings,</hi> and that is a <hi>blessed thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Great is the Affection that God ha's for such, especially for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The main Scope of the whole that I have spoken may be improved by way of Encouragement, <hi>viz.</hi> that you are both much inlightned about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of, and furthered in the managing of your <hi>General Calling</hi> as Christians by

your being Souldiers. As your Christianity will help your Souldiery, so be sure your Souldiery (if the fault be not your own) will noteably help your Christianity. Every <hi>Training-day</hi> may be a <hi>learning day</hi> to you, while trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you may be working for God and Christ, and for your Souls too. If your Soul-work may go forward amain while you are <hi>exercising</hi> your <hi>Arms,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a <hi>great Encouragement</hi> to them that know they have Souls, and know the worth of them. You that are Souldiers (as I have already hinted) are eminently beholden to God in that he is <hi>full, large,</hi> and <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Truly our going with an Earthly mind about our Earthly work, with a <hi>common-Heart</hi> about our <hi>common Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,</hi> is that which spoils us in it, and makes us lose the <hi>best Good,</hi> even the <hi>spiritual Good</hi> that might be gotten thereby.</p>
               <p>Unto this word of Encouragement, I shall add a few words of Advice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Propose right Ends to your selves in these Exercises.</hi> There are good and useful Ends of them, let those <hi>good Ends</hi> be your Ends. If your Ends are not right, you may be Souldiers but scarce Christians. Now the <hi>Great End</hi> of all our <hi>Vndertakings,</hi> and of this in special, is <hi>the Glory of God. Whatsoever you do, do it to the Glory of God,</hi> (1 Cor. 10.31.) Let the Service of God and his Church be the mark you aim at, the white which you desire and endeavour to hitt, which if you do you shall be sure to get the prize. Had we never read ought of <hi>Ioab</hi> save that one Speech, 2 Sam. 10.12. we should have in Charity accounted him not only a Souldier, (as we say) every Inch of him, but a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man also; However he deserves to be <hi>Chronicled</hi> for it, and <hi>imitated</hi> in it. [<hi>For our people and for the Citties of our God</hi>] Come not into the Field to shew your Bravery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but come to do Service, to learn Skill, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for further Service. Do not Exercise that you may know, or be known to know, but that you may do, and do for the people and Cause of God and Christ, for whom to shed your Blood, is the best way to preserve it, to lay down your Lives, the best way to save them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Then be serious in your work,</hi> as those that have so high an End, and mean to do your utmost to attain that End; If this be your End, then do not go about your work like men <hi>that beat the Air.</hi> I may use the Apostles Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and propose his Example to you, (For your ultimate End in your <hi>particular Calling</hi> is the same with his in his <hi>General Calling</hi> and your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in every Business and in this especially, is to have the same Common End) <hi>so run that you may obtain the prize,</hi> and so labour not as <hi>uncertainly,</hi> and so meet, Exercise, train, (as you call it] <hi>not as those that beat the Air.</hi> God makes use of your Calling as Souldiers to set forth the Calling of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by, a Calling wherein the greatest accurateness, exactness, Care, Skill, Diligence is to be used: then so do your work, so mind your Business, that as

               <p>You called me hither to speak to you a word in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> then, <hi>In the Name of the Lord</hi> I say to you in the words of my Text, again, be not like those <hi>that beat the Air,</hi> and in the words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 9.10. <hi>what ever your Hand findeth to do, do it with your might.</hi>

(which Text though it relates principally to worship, yet it holds by proportion in any thing that is called serving of God.) To supplicate Gods presence, and then to take no Care to do ought worthy of his presence, to desire God to look on, when you have nothing but a <hi>vain Heart,</hi> and a <hi>slighty, heedless Carriage</hi> to shew him, how near this comes to <hi>mocking of God</hi> you may <hi>sadly Consider.</hi> God is <hi>a man of Warr,</hi> and delights to be among such, to deign them his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence when they desire it, but <hi>I</hi> tell you he hath a <hi>Curious</hi> and <hi>skilful eye,</hi> and therefore it becomes you to behave your selves as becomes his presence. I have seen some <hi>Artillery men</hi> as really <hi>serious</hi> when they have been at training as when they have been at prayer, and so to be is very pleasing both to God and man.</p>
               <p>I shall make bold to insist a little upon this Direction; Here is a <hi>Great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> and <hi>many Souldiers</hi> are present from all parts, it may not therefore be amiss and unseasonable to give something by way of <hi>General Direction</hi> unto what is <hi>regular,</hi> and of <hi>Reprehension</hi> to what is otherwise, in this matter now before us.</p>

               <p>But yet for all this, I could not see Cause to preach on that Text, <hi>Isai. 2.4. Beat your Swords into Plow-shares,</hi> &amp;c.

While there is Flesh as well as Spirit in the new man, there will be Warrs within; and while there are carnal men as well as Spiritual in the World there will be Warrs without.

And what an Honour will it be to be called to that work, and dexterous at it when called to it. When <hi>Abraham</hi> was called to follow God in a way of Reformation, &amp; God had in that way blessed him outwardly too, he could not but know that the Enemies about him would envy him not only as Religious, but as prospering outwardly in a Profession of Religion, which might give him just occasion to train up his Family to Military Discipline, as we read, <hi>Gen. 14, 14.</hi> that he might be in a posture ready to receive them if Occasion should be.
