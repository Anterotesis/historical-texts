            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <l>AWAKE, my muſe, and ſeek great WESLEY fled!</l>
            <l>This righteous man is number'd with the dead.</l>
            <l>How ſad and awful is the parting ſtroke,</l>
            <l>Which hath the long ſubſiſting union broke!</l>
            <l>WESLEY is ſet, that bright that ſhining ſtar,</l>
            <l>Which oft conducted ſtrangers from afar,</l>
            <l>To come by faith, and taſte their Saviour's grace,</l>
            <l>And humbly bow their ſouls before his face.</l>
            <l>How long he labour'd in the goſpel field!</l>
            <l>While hundred thouſand ſouls his Miſſion ſeal'd:</l>
            <l>Who heard the goſpel from his willing tongue,</l>
            <l>Upon his lips with fix'd attention hung:</l>
            <l>Heard for their lives, and fled from wrath to come</l>
            <l>And found in Jeſu's arms a welcome home.</l>
            <l>What regularity his life diſplay'd!</l>
            <l>By rule he liv'd; his mind on God was ſtay'd.</l>
            <l>Jeſus he lov'd, his Goſpel he purſu'd,</l>
            <l>And wiſh'd, like him, to be divinely good;</l>
            <l>His temper cultivated in his breaſt,</l>
            <l>He learnt of him, and found the promis'd reſt;</l>
            <l>Thought, ſpoke, and acted like his Lord divine,</l>
            <l>And in the ſight of men his light did ſhine.</l>
            <l>His works of love, known only to the Lord,</l>
            <l>Inſure for him a rich, a large reward:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025048_0003_0FCDAF57870C69B0"/>Ten thouſand acts of gen'rous kindneſs ſhown,</l>
            <l>Have gain'd him honour, glory, and renown.</l>
            <l>Many have done great things, and are approv'd,</l>
            <l>But he excell'd them all, for much he lov'd.</l>
            <l>Long did he move in Wiſdom's pleaſant ways;</l>
            <l>He lov'd and ſought her in his youthful days:</l>
            <l>And to his lateſt years advancing ſtill</l>
            <l>In that bleſt way that leads to Zion's hill,</l>
            <l>He gain'd at laſt the bright, the glorious prize,</l>
            <l>The tree of life, which grows in Paradiſe.</l>
            <l>His life was dedicated to the Lord;</l>
            <l>And more than ſixty years he preach'd his word:</l>
            <l>Some millions heard his ready tongue proclaim</l>
            <l>The wonders of the great Redeemer's name.</l>
            <l>The univerſal Saviour he confeſs'd,</l>
            <l>And ſought to bring mankind to taſte his reſt.</l>
            <l>Proclaim'd abroad "He taſted death for all;"</l>
            <l>And that his grace extenſive, as the fall,</l>
            <l>Is freely given to ev'ry willing mind,</l>
            <l>Who ſeek their Saviour and their God to find:</l>
            <l>That none were reprobated by decree,</l>
            <l>But that God's ſaving grace for all is free.</l>
            <l>He taught mankind their hopes of heaven to place</l>
            <l>Upon the Saviour's merits, and his grace,</l>
            <l>Proclaim'd Repentance, Faith, Hope, Joy, and Love:</l>
            <l>Taught men the way that leads to God above:</l>
            <l>Five words well underſtood will ſhew the way,</l>
            <l>Repent, Believe, Hope, Love, <hi>and then</hi> Obey.</l>
            <l>This was the glorious doctrine which he brought,</l>
            <l>This to the human race he freely taught;</l>
            <l>And this to many thouſand ſouls was bleſt,</l>
            <l>Brought weary wand'rers unto Chriſt for reſt.</l>
            <l>How vaſt, and, oh! how regular his plan,</l>
            <l>For God's great glory, and the good of man!</l>
            <l>How wide, and yet how pow'rful was his ſphere!</l>
            <l>He ſhed his influence far, as well as near.</l>
            <l>His ſermons and his num rous writings ſhin'd,</l>

            <l>Theſe were his choiceſt pleaſures ever high:</l>

            <l>To all whom he had purchas'd for his own.</l>

            <l>Partakers of the Saviour's love and grace:</l>
            <l>He lov'd to ſee them walk in Wiſdom's ways,</l>
            <l>Hold faſt the truth and joyful end their days.</l>
            <l>He ſought by every method in his pow'r</l>
