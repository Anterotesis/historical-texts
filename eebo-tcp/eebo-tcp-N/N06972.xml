            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Letter from the Brethren called <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE are concerned to find, that on both ſides, inſtead of keeping to this ſhort queſtion, Whether the preſent manner of carrying on the war in <hi>Germany</hi> is for the advantage, or diſadvantage, of <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> you make digreſſions which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the queſtion.</p>
            <p>There is much ſolid reaſoning in the <hi>Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations:</hi> But why does the author ſhew ſo much ſpleen againſt the king of <hi>Pruſſia?</hi> Does it affect the queſtion, whether his majeſty was formerly an enemy, or a friend, to the Elector of <hi>Hanover?</hi> Whether he be a religious man, or void of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Or whether he had in his view the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the proteſtant religion, or not, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Theſe things, and many more, are only thrown out to amuſe the reader, or to move the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: At the ſame time we own, that the author ſeems to be a lover of his country; whereas, in moſt of what we have ſeen wrote againſt him, there ſeems to be marks of venality, and a time-ſerving ſpirit.</p>
            <p>It muſt be owned, by every impartial, ſenſible man, that there never was a time when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> arms made ſo great and glorious an appearance as at preſent: And however we don't approve of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons uſing carnal weapons, in private quarrels, yet we think every nation has a right to defend their country, and we rejoice to ſee the good ſucceſs of his majeſty's arms, during the three laſt years, againſt <hi>France</hi>; the only nation that we, and all <hi>Europe,</hi> have reaſon to guard againſt.</p>
            <p>We have now got poſſeſſion of all <hi>North Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> which alone is worth much more than the war has yet coſt us; as it ſecures to us, by the fiſheries there, a perpetual nurſery of ſailors, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008860_0003_102FF92E86F88FA8"/>
deprives <hi>France</hi> of having it in their power to man a fleet; and furniſhes us with an opportunity of ſupplying <hi>Europe</hi> with fiſh, a branch of trade that muſt produce ſome millions of ſpecie yearly. In ſhort, by our ſucceſſes in <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> our trade is ſo greatly increaſed, that it is believed our import of ſpecie is by more than a million greater than it was before the war began.</p>
            <p>As to the war we now carry on in <hi>Germany,</hi> it is plain, to ſupport it, we export upwards of five millions yearly, including the ſubſidy paid to the king of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>; which, we are afraid, is more than we can bear, for any length of time. The computation of the quantity of ſpecie in the nation before the war began, was between twelve and fifteen millions; and ſuppoſing it to be much more, by ſuch an export in a few years, we ſhould be rendered incapable of carrying on our trade, and defending ourſelves. The queſtion then comes to this: Are we ſo much intereſted in the quarrel between the queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the king of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> or in the defence of <hi>Hanover,</hi> as to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves unable to take care of ourſelves? We admire the king of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>'s perſonal great qualities; we know the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to be the moſt perſecuting houſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> of thoſe who are proteſtants; we know what they have done to their proteſtant ſubjects in <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, Moravia,</hi> and in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> when it was theirs; and therefore, as lovers of mankind, and haters of popiſh perſecuting principles, we ſhould think it the duty of this nation to join their proportion with other proteſtant powers, to prevent the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> from having it in their power, by cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the king of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> to treat his proteſtant ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as they have done their own. But if other proteſtant powers won't join with us, and, on the contrary, will throw their weight in the oppoſite ſcale; our attempting this ſingly, would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to do a thing on the continent ſo much
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008860_0004_102FF93021DD6B18"/>
beyond our ſtrength, that it would deſerve the name of madneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſame way of reaſoning will hold, as to our carrying on war againſt <hi>France</hi> on the continent. Had we, in the beginning of this war, not meddled with the quarrel between the queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the king of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> nor detached him from <hi>France,</hi> by engaging him to defend <hi>Hanover,</hi> we ſhould have been free of this intolerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining the army under prince <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>; but it is needleſs now to reflect on what is paſt. We have brought the king of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> into our quarrel; the queſtion is, how to extricate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt for the intereſt and honour of the nation; and tho' it may appear to be a difficult taſk to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do this, we don't think it impracticable, if we lay aſide the thoughts of bringing about a peace, by treating with <hi>France.</hi> If we treat with them, 'tis next to impoſſible, becauſe what they will have in view, is ſingly to recover back from us what we have taken from them, or part of it, as a price for that peace; and no lover of his country can ever approve of giving them back one inch in <hi>North America.</hi> Their deſire is to continue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtations in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to make <hi>Germans</hi> cut one anothers throats.</p>
            <p>On the other hand by endeavouring to bring about a peace between the queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> and the king of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> we ſhall treat with powers, whoſe intereſt it is that we keep our conqueſt, and who muſt wiſh to ſtop the effuſion of <hi>German</hi> blood; as there never can be any danger of our endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make conqueſts on the continent, were we ever ſo rich; whereas the riches and power of <hi>France</hi> muſt always be dangerous to its neighbours.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the queen of <hi>Hungary</hi> deſerves no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from us; but if by ſerving her, we ſerve ourſelves, we ſhould not let reſentment get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the public good, and therefore our buſineſs is to make up matters between the king of <hi>Pruſſia</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008860_0005_102FF93271BC19F8"/>
and queen of <hi>Hungary.</hi> This ſcheme of reconciling the contending powers in <hi>Germany,</hi> or bringing <hi>Ruſſia</hi> into our intereſts, ſeems to be the only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part for <hi>Great Britain</hi> to act on the continent.</p>
            <p>The armies at preſent belonging to <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and the queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> joined to that under prince <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> could in one campaign, by going into the heart of <hi>France,</hi> and by our fleets ravaging their coaſts, and raiſing contributions, force it into any terms of peace that ſhould be propoſed. By this ſcheme, we ſhould extricate ourſelves from a war we are unable to ſupport in the way it is carried on, and at the ſame time effectually reduce the power of <hi>France,</hi> and diſable her for the future from diſturbing the peace of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For hereafter it ought to be a rule with us, not to engage <hi>France</hi> on the continent; they are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſuperiors there, as we are theirs at ſea; and by keeping an army on board our fleets, we are able to aſſiſt our allies on the continent more effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, by attacking the iſlands belonging to <hi>France</hi> and their coaſt, than by ſending troops on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent; and we ſhould, at the ſame time, ſave the export of our money, and the lives of our people.</p>
            <p>It is really ſhameful to ſee how this nation has of late years ſuffered itſelf to be the dupe of <hi>German</hi> princes. In king <hi>William</hi>'s time, we aſſiſted them to preſerve themſelves from the power of <hi>France,</hi> and they thought themſelves much indebted to us, and exerted their utmoſt ſtrength to ſecond our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. But the language of <hi>German</hi> princes of late to us has been this: If you don't pay and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our troops, and likewiſe ſend your own troops to defend us againſt the <hi>French,</hi> who want to cut our throats, we will join with them, and allow them to take <hi>Hanover</hi>; and ſurely, if they can keep us in the humour to pay them for defending their own liberties, and put their own revenues in their pockets, they act wiſely, though not generouſly; but don't we give them cauſe to laugh at us at the ſame time?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008860_0006_102FF933F26AAD60"/>Pray what does <hi>Great Britain</hi> get by keeping <hi>Heſſians, Brunſwickers,</hi> &amp;c. in pay in peace? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for, in caſe of a war, they are unable to defend <hi>Hanover</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> which is the only uſe we have for them; and if they were able, does there ever a ſhilling come from that country to <hi>Great Britain?</hi> It muſt always be our intereſt to aſſiſt <hi>Germany</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> by keeping an army on board our fleets ready to attack them, which muſt oblige them to keep a large army at home to defend their coaſts; but ſending great ſums of money and troops to the continent, to carry on a war againſt <hi>France,</hi> is like a weak man's attacking a ſtrong man, and giving him the choice of the ground to fight on.</p>
            <p>Surely we cannot imagine that <hi>German</hi> princes wiſh to be conquered by <hi>France</hi>; and therefore, if we will appear as their friends, not as their dupes, we will always find them ready to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and thankful for our aſſiſtance. But if they find that our regard to <hi>Hanover</hi> is ſuch, that we will rather take the whole burthen of a war on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent againſt <hi>France,</hi> than ſuffer them to invade it, they will continue to exhauſt this nation of men and money, make us ſlaves to their intereſt, and pick our pockets, as long as we have a ſhilling.</p>
            <p>If his majeſty ſhall think it proper to give <hi>H—r</hi> to a younger branch of the royal family, that would in our opinion, be greatly for the intereſt both of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>H—r,</hi> by taking away a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from <hi>France</hi> for invading it, when at war with us. But as long as the ſame perſon is king of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and elector of <hi>H—r,</hi> we have but one method to take, in caſe of a war with <hi>France,</hi> viz. to let them take it, inſtead of maintaining an army for its defence; and to make repriſals by our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority at ſea.</p>
            <p>There never was a prince ſince <hi>Titus Veſpaſian,</hi> who began his reign with greater marks of love to his ſubjects, love to juſtice, and every aimiable
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008860_0007_102FF937033628A8"/>
quality, than our preſent ſovereign has done. He ſeems reſolved to be ſovereign of the hearts of all his ſubjects, and not the king of a faction. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he has declared he won't allow his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to meddle in elections, either by making uſe of his name, or the public money, to procure votes; by which he will have a true repreſentation of his people in parliament, inſtead of a packt meeting, the child of corruption and venality. This muſt make him adored by his ſubjects, and prevent any wicked man about his perſon from having it in his power to make his ſovereign his dupe, by making him believe that he only meant to employ the public money, and his ſovereign's name, to ſerve him; whereas his real intention is, to get his own creatures and dependents choſen, in order to make himſelf the director of his maſters actions; by which piece of management we have often ſeen a dirty ſlave of a miniſter carry an election againſt men of worth and family; and the ſovereign made believe that the man of worth was his enemy, becauſe his love to his country made him refuſe being a ſlave to the baſe, corrupt intentions of that miniſter.</p>
            <p>To conclude, what obligations is the nation under to her royal highneſs, and thoſe employed by her, about the perſon of his majeſty, in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der years, for inſtilling ſuch principles into his mind, which, in all probability, will enable him to make it not only the happieſt, but the greateſt nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> by the deſtruction of corruption, and encouraging public virtue!</p>
