            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Noble Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> under the Inſpirations of God, is in the Chapter, and Context now before us, as well as elſewhere, employed as the <hi>Herald,</hi> by whom theſe <hi>Excellent Things</hi> which the Lord will do, are ſo Proclaimed, as to be <hi>known in all the Earth.</hi> Theſe <hi>Excellent Things</hi> are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited under the Term of, <hi>Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> But then, that the <hi>Conſolations</hi> may be deſcribed as <hi>exceeding Comfortable,</hi> there is a Metaphor uſed, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Tenderneſs of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> beyond all Expreſſion. Our moſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious GOD, is pleaſed variouſly to expreſs His <hi>Love</hi> to His People, and His <hi>Care</hi> of them: He has <hi>uſed Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes</hi> for it, and this in a moſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Variety. Among theſe, <hi>Herein God commendeth His Love to us,</hi> that He not only aſſures us, Pſal. CIII.13. <hi>Like as a Father pittieth his Children, ſo the Lord pitties them that fear Him:</hi> He alſo gives us this Aſſurance, <hi>As a Mother Comforteth her Children, ſo will I Comfort them.</hi> Yea, I can tell where the Matter is carried further than ſo; He ſo Endears Himſelf unto His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001693_0004_0FB5296A168559B0"/>Iſa. XLIX.15. <hi>Can a Woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her Sucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have Compaſſion on the Son of her Bowels? Yea, They may forget; yet will not I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee.</hi> Oh! The Endearments of our God! Beyond all the Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Tendereſt <hi>Mother</hi> in the World!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſolations</hi> which the People of God find in Him, are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Firſt, unto thoſe which the Child has from the <hi>Mother,</hi> while in a ſtate of <hi>Infancy:</hi> The <hi>Conſolations</hi> of the Infant, <hi>Sucking at the Breaſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, carried in the Arms, dandled on the Knees of the Mother.</hi> But in the Verſe now before us, the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the <hi>Conſolations</hi> goes on, to thoſe which a <hi>Man</hi> receives from his <hi>Mother.</hi> I have the Original on my ſide, in ſo mending the Tranſlation; <hi>As it is with a MAN whom his Mother Comforteth.</hi> One Reaſon for it may be, Becauſe a <hi>Mother</hi> who ſees a Son grown to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and prove a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and an Uſeful and a Noted <hi>Man,</hi> and one that is to her, as they ſaid unto <hi>Naomi, The Reſtorer of her Life,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001693_0005_0FB5296C585CD100"/>and the Nouriſher of her old Age;</hi> Her Affection to ſuch a Son, will be very Paſſionate, very Rapturous, very Marvellous, nothing will be equal to the Tranſport of it. A <hi>Mother,</hi> when ſhe has in her Sight, a Son that is a Valuable <hi>Man,</hi> and a Rich <hi>Harveſt</hi> of all her painful and anxious <hi>Nurſery,</hi> ſhe places a violent Affection on him; ſuch, that no Tongue is able to utter it! She thinks no <hi>Conſolations</hi> too much for a <hi>Son,</hi> that affords her ſuch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.</hi> They who take Notice of ſuch Things, tell of a Nation in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> above others Remarkable for this Quality in the <hi>Mothers</hi> there, <hi>Prae alijs Matribus mire Filios ſuos Grandevos amant.</hi> However, our God has a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us, which exceeds that of ſuch a <hi>Mother.</hi> There is alſo this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; Our God is concerned for the Welfare of His People, not only in their more <hi>early Days,</hi> but alſo <hi>all their Days. When Iſrael was a Child, then I loved him,</hi> ſays the Lord; yea, and ſo He will in the Riper and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Years of His People. <hi>Having loved thy own, Lord, Thou wilt Love them to
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001693_0005_0FB5296C585CD100"/>the End, and without End!</hi> Particular Saints find it ſo; The <hi>ſeventy firſt Pſalm</hi> contains their Story, and is fulfilled unto them. I have thought of one Reaſon more for it. The Church will be arrived unto <hi>Mans Eſtate,</hi> and and unto <hi>Manly Chriſtianity,</hi> when this Word ſhall be accompliſhed. When the Church is come, <hi>unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> then, then ſhall this have its full Accompliſhment. I will add but this one Remark more; Every Believer on the Son of God, may claim an immediate Share in theſe <hi>Conſolations.</hi> Every <hi>Child</hi> of God, in the <hi>Sufferings of this preſent Time,</hi> has a Claim to theſe more than <hi>Maternal Conſolations,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Glory that is to be Revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My DOCTRINE is now ready for me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Conſolations derived from the moſt Affectionate MOTHER upon Earth, do ſhadow out, and are but a ſhadow of, thoſe with which the Children of God will find their Heavenly Father Comforting of them.</hi>

The Diſpoſition which the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God has to provide for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> of His People, has Two Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, in His <hi>Two Teſtaments;</hi> And in both of them, 'tis Reſembled unto the Proviſion which <hi>Female-Parents</hi> make for their Young ones. Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the more Sublime and Lofty Diſpenſation, wherewith our Lord appeared for the delivering of His People, in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> we read; Deut. XXXII.11. <hi>As an Eagle flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over her Young, hearing them on her Wings, ſo the Lord.</hi> Agreeably to the more Humble and Obſcure Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, wherewith our Lord made His Appearance to deliver His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we read; Matth. XXIII.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered your Children together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings.</hi> There is a Vehemence in the ΣΤΟΡΓΗ, and Paſſion of theſe Animals, to have their Young ones Defended, Befriended, <hi>Comforted.</hi> But that the Diſpoſition in our God for the <hi>Comfort</hi> of His People, may have a yet more lively Emblem given of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001693_0006_0FB5296DD6AC3300"/>it, Behold, an Emblem found for it in the <hi>Rational</hi> World. As it is with a Man <hi>whom his Mother Comforteth!</hi> Our God is more diſpoſed for to <hi>Comfort</hi> us, and has better <hi>Comforts</hi> for us, than the moſt Affectionate <hi>Mother</hi> in the World!</p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt Thing I am to obſerve, is this. There are conſiderable <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> enjoy'd by thoſe <hi>whom their MOTHER Comforteth.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to have a <hi>Mother</hi> Living. He is a barbarous Wretch, and worthy to have his Eyes pulled out in the <hi>Valley of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> who does not count it ſo. Tho' it ſhould be a <hi>Decayed</hi> Mother, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit</hi> Mother, one under all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a <hi>Superannuation,</hi> and one that muſt be entirely ſupported by her <hi>Children,</hi> yet the Preſence of their <hi>Mother</hi> with them, is grateful to them if there be not a Barbarity of Ingratitude in the Children. The Jews have a Proverb among them, That a <hi>Mine of Gold</hi> in an Houſe were not ſo rich a Bleſſing, as the preſence of ſuch a <hi>Mother</hi> there. But then, there are numberleſs <hi>Conſolations</hi> which <hi>good
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0"/>Mothers</hi> give unto their <hi>Children. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> are the <hi>Comforters</hi> of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They are by <hi>Nature</hi> ſo; have a ſtrong Inſtinct of <hi>Nature</hi> for it; are <hi>Naturally</hi> very deſirous to ſee their Children <hi>Comfortable.</hi> They can't bear to ſee their Children in any <hi>uneaſy</hi> Circumſtances. From this <hi>Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> in our <hi>Mothers</hi> to <hi>Comfort</hi> us, how cheerfully do they, while we are yet in our Minority, go thro' many Fatigues, many Troubles, many Self-denials for us? What poor Shifts had we made in our Minority, if we had not had <hi>Mothers</hi> to <hi>Comfort</hi> us? It was required, Deut. XXII.6. <hi>If a Birds Neſt chance to be before thee, and there be a Dam ſitting upon the Young, thou ſhalt not take away the Dam.</hi> A <hi>Dam</hi> is ill ſpared from a <hi>Neſt</hi> of <hi>Young ones.</hi> O Young ones, that have had your <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> continued unto you, until you have been brought up to your Maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Be Thankful;</hi> Be Thankful to a Compaſſionate God, for all the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations</hi> which He has by your <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> beſtow'd upon you. Nothing like an <hi>Own Mother!</hi> If ſhe be yet with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0"/>you, prize her Exceedingly! 'Tis but here and there, that <hi>Mothers-in-Law,</hi> are found <hi>Mothers-in-Love.</hi> Thoſe few that are ſo, are never enough to be commended! And ſtill, as we <hi>grow up,</hi> the Concern of our <hi>Mothers</hi> to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> us does not <hi>grow Cold.</hi> Our <hi>Mothers</hi> continue their Concern to ſee us have all ſorts of <hi>Conſolations,</hi> as long as they continue their Concern to ſee us have all ſorts of <hi>Conſolations,</hi> as long as they continue with us. But then, there are ſome Caſes, wherein the <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> we receive in our <hi>Mothers,</hi> are Aggravated, are Diſtinguiſhed, are Unſpeakable.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Our <hi>Mothers</hi> unſpeakably <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> us, when we have <hi>good Inſtructions</hi> from them. There was a Wiſe Man, whom his <hi>Mother Comforted,</hi> when he could ſay, Prov. IV.3. <hi>I was a Tender and only one in the ſight of my Mother,</hi> and then follow the <hi>Leſſons</hi> from her, that helped him to be what he was. There was another Wiſe Man, whom his <hi>Mother Comforted,</hi> when there was, Prov. XXXI.3. <hi>The Prophecy that his Mother taught him;</hi> and ſhe told him what muſt be done by the <hi>Son of her Vows. Mothers</hi> do ſometimes contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0"/>very much unto the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of their Children; yea, do very much to make them <hi>Wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> The beſt Thing that ſome can be adviſed unto, is, <hi>Forſake not the Law of thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> When our <hi>Mothers</hi> teach us our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and nouriſh our Souls with <hi>the ſincere Milk of the Word</hi> of God, and charge us to do Well, and warn us to ſhun the Paths of the Deſtroyer, We are thoſe that have our <hi>Mothers Comforting</hi> of us.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Our <hi>Mothers</hi> unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>Comfort</hi> us, when we have <hi>good Examples</hi> from them. There was a Miniſter of God, whom his <hi>Mother Comforted,</hi> when it could be ſaid unto him, 2 Tim. I.4. <hi>The Faith which dwelt firſt in thy Mother, I am perſwaded is thee alſo.</hi> As there are Children <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined</hi> by their <hi>Mothers,</hi> when it may be reported of them, as it was of one; 1 King. XXII.52. <hi>He did Evil in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his Mother;</hi> So a Man is one whom his <hi>Mother has Comforted,</hi> when his beſt way to do that which is <hi>Right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> is, to <hi>walk in the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0"/>way of has Mother.</hi> Have we had <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> who have been <hi>Patterns</hi> of Piety, and of <hi>Hobineſs in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</hi> In whom we have ſeen an <hi>Abborrence</hi> of every <hi>Wicked Thing;</hi> a mighty Delight in Converſing with the <hi>Word</hi> of God; Reading over the Bible perhaps <hi>Twice every Year;</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Regard unto the <hi>Religion of the Cloſet?</hi> Yea, with ſuch a Frequency, as no leſs than <hi>ſix Times</hi> in a Day. Such as been very <hi>Humble,</hi> in other Things, as well as their <hi>modeſt Attire;</hi> and very Charitable to the <hi>Poor,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>Doing</hi> for them, or <hi>Grieving</hi> for them? If they had any little <hi>Feminine Weakneſſes,</hi> yet being <hi>Women that feared the Lord,</hi> that Honourable Character the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> made a full Amends for all; and they were <hi>to be praiſed for it.</hi> We are thoſe who have had our <hi>Mothers Comforting</hi> of us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. Our <hi>Mothers</hi> unſpeakably <hi>Comfort</hi> us when they are continually <hi>Praying</hi> for us. There are <hi>Mothers</hi> who can ſay to their Children, as in Gal. IV.19. My <hi>little Children, of whom I Travail in Birth again, until Chriſt be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8"/>formed in you. Mothers</hi> who are always <hi>Travailing</hi> for the Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Children, with <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> full of Agony on their behalf; As <hi>Monica</hi> for her <hi>Auſtin; Mothers</hi> that mention all their Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, with ſuitable Petitions for them, in their daily <hi>Supplications; Mothers</hi> that if their Children are in any Diſtreſs, make their importunate Viſits to Heaven for them, in their fervent <hi>Supplications:</hi> Truly, theſe are <hi>comfortable Mothers.</hi> Perhaps, they have been <hi>Mothers,</hi> that would, very often, very often, ſet apart <hi>whole Days</hi> for <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting</hi> before the Lord. We may be ſure, they Remembred <hi>us</hi> on theſe Days; It may be, we were the <hi>main Articles</hi> of them. There are <hi>Mothers</hi> that lay up a ſtock of <hi>Prayers</hi> for their Children; This is to lay up a ſtock of <hi>Comforts</hi> for them. We read of one, Gen. XXIV.67. <hi>He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted after the Death of his Mother.</hi> When a Devout <hi>Mother</hi> has been for many Years Praying and Weeping to the Lord for the <hi>Bleſſings of Goodneſs</hi> to be multiplied upon their Children,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8"/>they may be <hi>comforted after the Death</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Mother; Comforted</hi> in this Conſideration; <hi>Tho' ſhe be Dead, the Effects and Anſwers of the Prayers that ſhe made before ſhe dyed, may be Living and Laſting with us!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus 'tis, that our <hi>good Mothers</hi> do <hi>Comfort</hi> us. But O Children, How can you do any other then ſtudy to be <hi>Comforts</hi> unto ſuch obliging <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi> When you were firſt Born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they expected, <hi>This ſame ſhall Comfort us.</hi> Oh! Let them not be diſappointed of their Expectations. A <hi>Diſappointment,</hi> which will deſerve and procure, that you who give it, ſhould Periſh Wonderfully! Your <hi>Mothers</hi> even Load you with <hi>Comforts;</hi> and all your <hi>Comforts</hi> are Theirs. Children. Do not you now fill them with <hi>Sorrows;</hi> Oh! Do not bring down their <hi>Gray Hairs</hi> therewith unto the Grave. Be it known unto you; Your Wickedneſs will fill them, and even kill them with <hi>Sorrows.</hi> You read, Prov. X.1. <hi>A Fooliſh Son is the Heavineſs of his Mother.</hi> And, Prov. XVII.25. <hi>A Fooliſh Son is a Bitterneſs to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001693_0010_0FB529761686B940"/>her that bare him.</hi> Very particularly, All Undutiful, All Rebellious, All Contemptuous <hi>Carriage</hi> towards your <hi>Mothers;</hi> Wretches, I tell you, it will be extremely Grievous to them. The Tranſgreſſors of the <hi>fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are called, 1 Tim. I.9. <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Mothery.</hi> If you don't <hi>Honour</hi> your <hi>Mothers,</hi> you <hi>Murder</hi> them. You had beſt beware, laſt you ſo ſee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke your <hi>Mothers,</hi> that they may Pronounce a <hi>Direful Thing</hi> in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh that you give unto them. Some <hi>Direful Thing</hi> will befall you, if it ſhould be ſo. The <hi>Direful Thing</hi> will be dreadfully Executed on you. There are <hi>Executioners</hi> that ſtand always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it! You are worſe than the Thieviſh <hi>Micah,</hi> if the Vengeance of an Irritated <hi>Mother</hi> be nothing with you. I preſs for the Reverſe of this. <hi>Comfort</hi> your <hi>Mothers,</hi> by all poſſible. Demonſtrations of your Affection to them; in ſpeaking to them, in doing for them, all that is <hi>Comfortable. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> them with contriving all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods imaginable to make their whole Condition <hi>Comfortable. Comfort</hi> them,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001693_0010_0FB529761686B940"/>with making them the <hi>Glad</hi> Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſuch a Laudable Behaviour in you, that <hi>their Hearts may Rejoice, even theirs.</hi> Finally, Be of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, That you never can Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the <hi>Conſolations</hi> you have received from your <hi>Mothers;</hi> Be perſwaded, That you never can do ſo much for <hi>their Comfort</hi> as they have done for <hi>yours.</hi> Children, <hi>This is Right!</hi> But perhaps there are ſome of you, whoſe <hi>Mothers</hi> after Thouſands of <hi>Groans</hi> to Heaven for you, yet had not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſeeing you brought home to God before they Died; They had the Pangs of leaving you in your Sins, in your ſinful Impenitency, when they Died. Oh! that the Thoughts of what your <hi>Mothers</hi> underwent for you, may this Day make ſome Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on you! Oh! that you would this Day reſolve, <hi>I will no longer Delay what my Dear Mother Died ſo exceedingly wiſhing to have me brought unto!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But I muſt paſs on to a Second Obſervation. <hi>Temporal Conſolations</hi> muſt not be too long dwelt upon. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> ſhould be the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001693_0011_0FB5297796A24FC0"/>chief of our <hi>Conſolations.</hi> The <hi>beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives,</hi> who Dwell in <hi>Houſes of Clay,</hi> will not long yield us any <hi>Conſolations.</hi> Nor do they ever yield us our <hi>beſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations. Nulli fit Injuria cui Deus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponitur.</hi> It is no Diſgrace caſt upon the moſt affectionate <hi>Mothers,</hi> to ſay, That we have a <hi>better Comforter</hi> than the <hi>Beſt</hi> of them. Yea, if we have not a <hi>better</hi> than them, we ſhall anon find them to be but <hi>miſerable Comforters.</hi> We will draw near now to that <hi>better Comforter,</hi> and make this Remark.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Children</hi> of God will find their Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> gloriouſly <hi>Comforting</hi> of them, with <hi>Conſolations</hi> beyond what the moſt affectionate <hi>Mother</hi> upon Earth can give, or ſo much as wiſh, unto her Children. <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, faith the Lord, ſpeak ye Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to them.</hi> The <hi>comfortable</hi> Things we have now to <hi>ſpeak,</hi> are ſuch as theſe. Our God will <hi>Comfort</hi> His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, His <hi>People</hi> are His <hi>Children;</hi> and therefore He will <hi>Comfort</hi> them. When the good God comes unto the <hi>Comfort</hi> of His Children, 'tis with them, <hi>as with a Man whom his Mother Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:001693_0011_0FB5297796A24FC0"/>In the <hi>Conſolations</hi> which an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate <hi>Mother</hi> affords her Children, there is a little <hi>Shadow</hi> of the <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which the Bleſſed God beſtows upon His. What are the Points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our <hi>Mothers</hi> are willing to <hi>Comfort</hi> us? Firſt, All the <hi>Comforts</hi> that come to us from our <hi>Mothers,</hi> do Originally come from GOD. GOD fonds us our <hi>Comforts</hi> by their kind Hands, that indeed love to bring them to us. This <hi>Kindneſs</hi> in them to us, is alſo from GOD. GOD has planted it in them, touched them with it. GOD will do for us likewiſe all that is done by our <hi>Mothers;</hi> and very <hi>Tranſcendently</hi> ſo. They <hi>Feed us.</hi> Our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> gives us the <hi>Bread of Life.</hi> They <hi>Cloath</hi> us. Our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> gives us the <hi>Garments of Salvation.</hi> They <hi>Guide</hi> us. Our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> leads us in the <hi>way wherein we ſhould go.</hi> They <hi>keep</hi> us out of Harms-way. Our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> does <hi>preſerve us from all Evil.</hi> They confer <hi>Ornaments</hi> upon us. Our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> beautifies us with <hi>Jewels of great Price.</hi> They <hi>Comfort</hi> us, with letting us know, that it is a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001693_0012_0FB529791680A690"/>unto them to ſee us. Our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Father</hi> ſays to us, <hi>Let me ſee thy Face, and hear thy Voice; thy Prayer is my Delight.</hi> Yea, all the <hi>Comforts</hi> that our <hi>Mothers</hi> can <hi>wiſh</hi> for us, are ſuch as our Heavenly <hi>Father</hi> will <hi>give</hi> to us. What they can only <hi>Wiſh,</hi> He will <hi>Do.</hi> I am ſtill too ſhort in my Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; He will <hi>Do</hi> for us, <hi>far Above all that they can Ask or Think for us,</hi> or we for our ſelves! And there is one <hi>Tranſcendency</hi> more in the <hi>Conſolations</hi> of our God. Our <hi>Mothers</hi> will by'nd by leave <hi>Comforting</hi> of us. <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> will put a Period unto their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations.</hi> They are not <hi>ſuffered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue by reaſon of Death.</hi> But our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Father</hi> does never Dye; and His <hi>Conſolations</hi> do ſee no <hi>Death;</hi> but will Abide with us, yea, Increaſe on us, after <hi>Death.</hi> So we read; 2 Theſſ. II.16. <hi>God, even our Father, has lovea us, and given us everlaſting Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us now a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Enquire; What are the <hi>more than Maternal Conſolations,</hi> wherewith God will <hi>Comfort</hi> His choſen People?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001693_0012_0FB529791680A690"/>
Firſt; Each of the Three Perſons in the Eternal GODHEAD, is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and Wondrouſly at Work, to <hi>Comfort</hi> the People of God. Let us take a View of this Matter, and fall into a juſt Aſtoniſhment at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation!</p>
            <p>Firſt. God the <hi>Father</hi> will <hi>Comfort</hi> His People. Our Acknowledgement, our Doxology to the Almighty <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> muſt be that; 2 Cor. I.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulation.</hi> Certainly, we are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> by the Infinite <hi>Father,</hi> when He tells us, That He will be our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will be a Father to you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and my Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> What is the beſt of <hi>Mothers,</hi> weigh'd in the Ballance with ſuch a <hi>Father?</hi> Our <hi>Father</hi> is now the Infinite GOD. But, O ye <hi>Adopted &amp; Comforted</hi> of the Lord, what an <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> have you a Title to? You ſhall come to no leſs a Felicity than this; <hi>To inherit all Things.</hi> Who can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the <hi>Riches of the Glory of that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001693_0013_0FB5297B568935F8"/>Inheritance,</hi> to which the Saints are Entitled? O the <hi>Conſolations,</hi> O the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations,</hi> of ſuch an Incomprehenſible <hi>Inheritance!</hi> My Brethren, God the <hi>Father</hi> informs you, That He has <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you before the Foundation of the World, that you ſhould be Holy and Blameleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him in Love.</hi> God the <hi>Father</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms you, That He hath <hi>ſo loved you, at to give His Only-begotten Son for you, to bring you unto everlaſting Life.</hi> If there be any <hi>Comfort of Love,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis in this <hi>Love!</hi> O Children of God, This is the <hi>Comfort, wherewith we are comforted of God!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. God the <hi>Sow</hi> will <hi>Comfort</hi> His People. If a bright <hi>Angel</hi> were now to Preach among you; he would now thus call upon you; <hi>Behold, I bring you good Tidings of great Joy; To you there is born a Saviour.</hi> And he would not ſtick to add, <hi>Never, never any Comfort came up to this!</hi> The Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rabbi's agreed upon it, That the Name of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be <hi>Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi> or, <hi>The Comforter;</hi> Becauſe 'tis He that is thus called, Lam. I.16. <hi>The Comforter that ſhould relieve my Soul.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001693_0013_0FB5297B568935F8"/>We read of ſuch a Thing as this to be forever taken for granted; <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in Chriſt.</hi> Oh! what a <hi>Comferter</hi> we have in ſuch a <hi>Saviour!</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations</hi> of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who is of God made <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> unto us! No <hi>Mothers</hi> can do ſuch things for us; nor can it <hi>enter into their Hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> all that is in thoſe things. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sinners that have the <hi>Wrath of God abiding</hi> on them, and that are <hi>ſerving diverſe Luſts,</hi> and that are held by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in the <hi>Chains of Death,</hi> and are in the way that leads down to a <hi>Devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire, and Everlaſting Burnings;</hi> Theſe cannot but be <hi>comforted,</hi> when they hear a Bleſſed JESUS calling to them, <hi>Look unto me, and be ye ſaved!</hi> And ſaying, <hi>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out!</hi> My Friends, won't it <hi>Comfort</hi> you, to have a <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> who has offered up a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God for you, and ſupplied you with a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> wherein God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of you? A <hi>Saviour,</hi> who fits on the <hi>Glorious high Throne,</hi> with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the whole World in His
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001693_0014_0FB5297CD76BA2D0"/>Hands, and is reſolved that in the Adminiſtration of His <hi>Providence,</hi> all the Things that befall you, ſhall <hi>work together for your Good.</hi> What ſhall I ſay? A <hi>Saviour,</hi> who is your <hi>Brother</hi> and a <hi>Man</hi> lying in the Boſom of God, and infinitely dearer to God, than all the Works of His Hands? What <hi>Conſolations</hi> are theſe? <hi>O my Soul, Why art not thou even Overwhelmed in theſe Conſolations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. God the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> will <hi>Comfort</hi> His People. 'Tis indeed His <hi>Office</hi> to be their <hi>Comforter.</hi> We read Joh. XV.26. <hi>The Comforter is the Spirit of Truth.</hi> Surely, we cannot but be <hi>comforted,</hi> when we feel our Minds Purified, Rectified, and brought into an Holy <hi>Order,</hi> &amp; an Heavenly <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> and the <hi>Storms</hi> raiſed by our Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Appetites appeaſed, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with the <hi>Peace of God which paſſes all Underſtanding.</hi> We cannot but be <hi>comforted,</hi> when we are ſatisfied, That our <hi>Sins</hi> are <hi>forgiven</hi> to us, and that our <hi>Souls</hi> are bound up in the <hi>Bundle of Life,</hi> and that <hi>Goodneſs and Mercy ſhall follow us all our Days,</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001693_0014_0FB5297CD76BA2D0"/>we ſhall <hi>dwell in the Houſe of the Lord for ever and ever.</hi> None but a God, can give ſuch <hi>Conſolations.</hi> But, <hi>Oh! Holy SPIRIT, Thou art God, and theſe are thy Conſolations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been a little Surpriſing unto me to find, That in ſome of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Writers, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>The Mother. Tertullian</hi> uſes this Denomination for the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> The <hi>Mother,</hi> who is Invocated with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son.</hi> The Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was juſtified by this; That we are <hi>Born of the Holy Spirit.</hi> And it has a notable Coincidence with it; That when the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> comes to take a full Poſſeſſion of the Church, and in doing ſo, has formed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly City; Then is this Prophecy fulfilled; As it <hi>is with a Man whom his Mother comforteth, ſo will I Comfort you.</hi> Then the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God in His Church, will do the part of a <hi>Mother,</hi> in Cheriſhing the Souls of His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>comforting</hi> of them, with God becoming their <hi>exceeding Joy!</hi> A City which is the <hi>Mother of us all,</hi> ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately poſſeſſed by the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001693_0015_0FB5297E56A2EFE8"/>that He becomes in a manner <hi>One</hi> with it; What <hi>Conſolations</hi> will it bring unto us? In the mean time, To be fill'd with the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> is to be always full, full of matchleſs <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations!</hi>

But theſe Things are now waiting for the <hi>Improvement</hi> that we are to make of them.</p>
            <p n="1">I.

            <p>Laſtly.

No doubt, you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, who that <hi>Mother</hi> is, that I now point you to. 'Tis the <hi>Church of the Living God:</hi> The CHURCH, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they generally apply that Paſſage; Cant.

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001693_0020_0FB52988168F5C30"/>made upon you; and require the Duty owing to a <hi>Mother</hi> from you. I ſhow you this Day, A <hi>Faithful Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Aſſociated and Incorporated for the Worſhip of God our Saviour, and I uſe the Language of our Dying JESUS to His Diſciple, <hi>Behold, Thy Mother!</hi> My Neighbour, <hi>Behold, Thy Mother!</hi> You owe no little Duty to ſuch a <hi>Mother in Iſrael!</hi> Children, Come under the Wings of your <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> by joining your ſelves unto the CHURCH that is ready to receive you.

Their beſt Apology is, That they have leſt the ſtate of their Souls, at ſuch <hi>Uncertainties,</hi> that they dare not come to the more <hi>ſpecial and awful Ordinances.</hi> But, Syrs, Is this Excuſable? Suffer me to go on with my Expoſtulation. If every one ſhould be diſpoſed as you are, what would become of your <hi>Mother?</hi> This Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of yours, will Diſtreſs you on a <hi>Death-bed,</hi> I am certain of it, I am certain of it!

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001693_0021_0FB5298A5D24A9B0"/>by Men in <hi>Daily</hi> Expectation of their <hi>Dying Day,</hi> you would be no longer <hi>unprepared</hi> for that commanded Action of, <hi>ſhewing forth the Death of the Lord.</hi> But this I know; That your having left this Duty undone, will be a <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi> unto you in a <hi>dying Hour.</hi> You will then blame your ſelves for it, and Mourn exceedingly, and ſay with a Regret which <hi>who can bear?</hi>—<hi>Oh! That I had made more thorough Work, in that Article of Obedience unto God; my coming to Him in all His Ordinances!</hi>— I wiſh, that I may not ſee this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction too quickly accompliſhed on ſome of my dear Friends, to whom I wiſh as well as to my own Soul; Friends, whom 'tis becauſe I Love them exceedingly, that I now deal ſo Faithfully withal, and from this <hi>public Place of Thunder,</hi> do Repeat the Warnings of God unto them. The Voice of a good Man, is that, 1 Chron. XXIX.3. <hi>I have ſet my Affection on the Houſe of my God.</hi> Syrs, 'Tis your <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> for whom I beſpeak this <hi>good Affection!</hi> But then, if this <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord, is to have the Regards of a

                  <hi>Ye ſhall fear every Man his Mother, I am the Lord your God,</hi> who command it, ſaith the Lord, and will Puniſh you, if you Wrong ſuch a <hi>Mother.</hi>
               </q> No, You muſt Love your <hi>Mother</hi> dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; If you have the <hi>Love of the Father</hi> in you, it will make you do ſo!

            <p>You are ſenſible, That what has obliged me, to Entertain you with theſe Meditations, is, The Death of a Pious, Loving, Tender MOTHER, with whoſe <hi>Comforts,</hi> I have been for more than one and fifty Years fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God.

When I drew the Picture of a <hi>good Mother</hi> above half an Hour ago, you may be ſure, I had ſomebody <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> before me for it; You may be ſure, I could not ſay, <hi>I had never ſeen ſuch an one!</hi> And there ſhall yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Truth in that Prophecy of the <hi>Vertuous Woman;</hi> Prov.

            <p>And Oh!
