            <title>Abraham's humble intercession for Sodom, and the Lord's gracious concessions in answer thereunto: containing sundry meditations upon Gen. XVIII. from ver. XXIII. to the end of the chapter. Wherein many things are spoken of concerning believers drawing near to God, and the efficacy of their prayers; and how they may be princes and prevailers with God, and with what boldness they may come before him, and what ground they may get of him by their prayers, and what sweet communing they have with him. : With sundry other things worthy of our most serious thoughts, helping us to be more spiritual and heavenly, which may prepare us for that everlasting communion and fellowship that we hope to arrive at, and come to in a blessed state of glory by Jesus Christ. / By Samuel Whiting, Pastor of the Church of Christ at Lyn in N.E. ; [Three lines of Scripture texts]</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The sweet Psalmist of Israel, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>Now though all these were</hi> famous Believers, <hi>and so report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by God himself,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>yet above all,</hi> Abraham <hi>is most renowned for his</hi> Faith, Heb. 11. 8,9,10,17,18,19. <hi>and in the Epistles to the</hi> Romans <hi>and</hi> Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>writ: And this piece that is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of these following</hi> Meditations, <hi>holds out no small part of his</hi> Faith, <hi>and</hi> sweet familiarity, <hi>and</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Power <hi>that he had with God in the suits that he put up to him, in behalf of those</hi> Righteous ones <hi>that he thought might be mingled with those</hi> vilest of Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The main drift of the Discourse, is,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To draw near to God in Prayer in a right manner, that a gracious answer may be given in to our Prayers, that so we may not pray in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To discountenance sin, by the destruction that God will bring upon sinners, both here and in another world without Repentance, as we see in <hi>Sodoms</hi> Example.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To bear up the heads and hearts of the Lords Righteous ones, who live among bad Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that they shall not be burned in <hi>their fire,</hi> but be instrumental to save the worst of sinners at least from temporal destruction, as long as they continue with them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To put all Believers upon fervent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Prayer for the worst of men, if any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
<pb facs="unknown:000111_0004_0FA02D1D8CF12BE0"/>
number of Righteous ones be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To stir up the best to see their own vileness, and to be very humble in drawing near to God when we pray to him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To meditate of Christ's being <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> and plead with him to <hi>do right</hi> as being such a Judge, and to consider what our duty is in our several places, that must one day stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Judge.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To besiege and beleaguer the Throne of Grace with suit after suit, and to go away with all we can from God that is so ready to hear Prayer, and to go as far as ever we <hi>can</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> in asking, and to fear to provoke God then especially when we pray to him, and to desire of God that he would not be angry with us, nor with our Prayers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To go about our ordinary Employments when we have been with God, as he allows, taking in such Cautions as are duely to be observed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To be familiar with God, and to commune sweetly with him in Prayer, as he does with us in his gracious Answers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now what help may be afforded to these things by the following</hi> Treatise, <hi>is with the Lord to give, and with his Servants to pray for. A Childe when lifted up upon a Giants shoulders, may be carried far above his own strength; A</hi> withered Hand <hi>may be
<pb facs="unknown:000111_0005_0FA02D1F2EC5C140"/>
stretched out, if Christ say the word:</hi> Weak things <hi>the Lord sometimes chuseth, to bring</hi> mighty things to pass by. <hi>If</hi> the Sword of the Lord and of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon <hi>go together, what may not a little strength do? An Host of three hundred men</hi> that lap water, <hi>with their</hi> Pitchers and Lamps, <hi>what an</hi> Army of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites <hi>may not fall before them? I dare not say any thing of the</hi> Work, <hi>nor of the</hi> success of the Work, <hi>being in Gods hand; onely shall pray, That the blessing of the God of Heaven may go along with it, That Christ may smile upon it: and, as</hi> Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>would stoop so low as to kiss</hi> Paphnutius <hi>his Eye that he could not see with; so; that the Lord Jesus would be pleased to condescend so-far as to give a sweet kiss of favour to this maimed work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had not thought that any thing of mine should ever have seen the light more; but the</hi> short Notes <hi>put forth before, concerning that awfull Subject of</hi> The Last Judgement, <hi>finding acceptance with some of the Saints here, and with some elswhere (though so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>IN these words, to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> we have 1.

Gods <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> that he gave to the several <hi>Petitions</hi> he put up to him in their behalf. 3.

               <p n="1">1. His <hi>desire</hi> that these sinners might be <hi>spared</hi> if it were possible, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Taken from the <hi>strangeness</hi> of the act, <hi>Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</hi> as if he should say, This would be <hi>strange,</hi> Lord, and thou wouldst go out of thy wonted way so to do. The 2. is taken from the <hi>vehemency</hi> of his wish, that such a thing may <hi>never be,</hi> which he repeats twice, <hi>That be far from thee, That be far from thee.</hi> The 3. is taken from his <hi>honour,</hi> as being <hi>Judge of all the earth,</hi> and therefore for his <hi>Name</hi> must needs do right: <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> ver. 25.</p>

                  <hi>Behold, now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes.</hi> 3. By <hi>desiring</hi> the Lord not to be <hi>angry</hi> with him, for being so bold with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. 4.

               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>second part,</hi> scil. <hi>Gods Answer,</hi> we have 1. The <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> of God towards him:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he never <hi>denied</hi> him in any one of his <hi>Requests,</hi> but granted all, from <hi>fifty</hi> to <hi>ten:</hi> So that if there had been but <hi>ten righteous</hi> in the place, it had been spared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In that <hi>Abraham</hi> left off <hi>petitioning,</hi> before the Lord left off <hi>granting;</hi> wherein the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>greatness of his grace</hi> shewed it self. The truth is, we have done sooner in <hi>asking,</hi> then God has in <hi>giving;</hi> our desires are <hi>scant,</hi> when his heart is <hi>large;</hi> our requests are <hi>short,</hi> when his hand is <hi>long,</hi> we might <hi>have</hi> more, could we <hi>ask</hi> more: we spare to <hi>speak,</hi> and therefore we <hi>lose much</hi> of what we might carry away with us from such a <hi>Bountiful Almner</hi> as God is.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>last part</hi> we have 1. Gods <hi>leaving Abraham. 2. Abraham's</hi> departing to <hi>his

                  <p>T<hi>Hat Believers in praying to God, draw near to him.</hi>

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. &amp; 10. 22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart. Draw nigh to God,</hi> 
                     <abbr>viz.</abbr> in prayer of Faith. <hi>He is not far from every one of us,</hi> nor we from him; <hi>for in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 27,28. but then in a special manner we <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when we put up our suits and supplications to him. A Suppliant to a Prince does then <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when he makes his Address, and presents his Suit to him: A Childe <hi>draws near</hi> to his Father, when he comes to ask something of him: So do we to our <hi>Soveraign Prince</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> when we bring our <hi>Petitions</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>For opening of which, let me shew,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is to <hi>draw near to God</hi> when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In what <hi>manner</hi> we are to <hi>draw near</hi> to him, when we make request to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Why</hi> we are thus to <hi>draw near</hi> to him.</p>

                  <p>Quest. 1. <hi>What is it to draw near to God in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Negatively. 2. Affirmatively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000111_0013_0FA02D263800DE48"/>
                     <hi>Negatively.</hi> 1. It is not to <hi>draw near with our lips, when our hearts are far from him,</hi> Isa. 29. 13. or as <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells God, <hi>Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins,</hi> Jer. 12. 2. <hi>The man is as his heart is, Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. If the heart of a man therefore be <hi>far from God</hi> in Prayer, though he be <hi>near with his mouth,</hi> he is not <hi>near God</hi> in the duty. If there be any defect in the chief Wheel of a Clock within, it will not strike right: so if the <hi>heart</hi> be wanting, which is the chief Wheel to set all a going in the duty of Prayer, there will be no right stroke given; there's no <hi>drawing near</hi> to God, when the <hi>heart</hi> is gone: there must be something <hi>within,</hi> else the duty of Prayer is but a dumb idol.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not to <hi>draw near with multitude of words,</hi> as if God made any account of them; he cares not for being loaden with words: they should be <hi>few</hi> when we pray to him, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 7. We may be far from God, when we pour out most words before him. This is not to <hi>draw near</hi> to God, when we word it with him. Wife men will have us speak in way of suit to them in a <hi>few words;</hi> so the wise God. Some Princes have thrown away <hi>long Petitions;</hi> and God as little regards <hi>length of Prayers,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be something else joyned with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not to come with <hi>loud expressions</hi> when
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000111_0014_0FA02D26EABDAE50"/>
we pray before him, Loud crying in the ears of God, is not to <hi>draw near to God:</hi> They are <hi>nearer God,</hi> that silently whisper in his ears, and tell him what they <hi>want,</hi> and what they would <hi>have of him.</hi> They have the Kings ear, not that <hi>call loudest,</hi> but those that <hi>speak softly</hi> to him, as those of the Council and Bed-chamber do: So they are <hi>nearest God,</hi> and have his ear most, that <hi>speak softly</hi> to him in Prayer. Loud cries of Beggars are not heard of men; no more are they <hi>regarded of God,</hi> Isa. 1. 15. A man will say sometimes, <hi>I should have heard thee, if thou hadst not spoken so loud:</hi> what may God then say to loud speaking hypocrites?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not to <hi>speak mournfully</hi> in the ears of God; there are those that are <hi>far from God</hi> that do so. <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 14. the Prophet speaks of those that <hi>howled upon their beds, when they cried not to the Lord with their hearts.</hi> They may be <hi>far from God</hi> that mourn in his ears, as if they were <hi>near</hi> to him. Some are like Stage-players that act the part of <hi>Mourners,</hi> onely when they are before the Lord: these he looks not at as such as <hi>draw near to him.</hi> Even hypocrites may <hi>roar as Bears, and mourn sore as Doves,</hi> Isa. 59. 11. Every mournful Ditty is not good Musick with men; nor beast-like roaring, Melody in the ears of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is not to <hi>seek him when he does afflict them,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000111_0015_0FA02D27A59D5178"/>
Isa. 26. 16. this is to <hi>flatter him with their lips,</hi> rather then to <hi>draw near to him,</hi> Psal. 78. 34,35,36. A Slave that cares not to come near to his Master when he is buffetted and beaten, will fall down before him: A Dog when he is cudgelled will crouch before him that smites him. It is a <hi>forced drawing near</hi> to God, when his hand is lifted up against them; when the Rod and Staff is taken up, then to bow and bend onely, is that that the worst of men will come up to: as we see in <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is not to <hi>pray to him when it is too late,</hi> to seek to him when the date is out. <hi>Many shall seek to enter in,</hi> sayes Christ, (when they come too late) <hi>and shall not be able,</hi> Luke 13. 24. The <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> lost their time, and came too late when <hi>the door was shut,</hi> Mat. 25. 10,11,12. They do not <hi>draw near to God</hi> that miss the season, that slip the opportunity of coming before him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a time when he <hi>may be found,</hi> Isa. 55. 6. and a time when he <hi>will not be found;</hi> there is a time when he is <hi>nigh,</hi> and we may <hi>draw nigh</hi> to him, <hi>ibid.</hi> and there is a time when he is <hi>far off,</hi> and when we <hi>cannot draw near</hi> to him. They that observe not their <hi>time,</hi> lose their <hi>market</hi> among men; and so do they that slack their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, lose this blessed market of trading with God, and drawing near to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Affirmatively.</hi> To <hi>draw wear to God,</hi> is,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="9" facs="unknown:000111_0016_0FA02D286CFD6520"/>
1. To come <hi>in faith</hi> when we pray to him, for that is it that brings us <hi>near</hi> to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. This brings us into the Kings Presence, and lets us have his ear and heart too: <hi>The King hath brought me into his Chambers,</hi> sayes the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. But how? by the <hi>foot of faith</hi> coming to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35. This is the <hi>Eye</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we look upon him, and take our full views of him, and <hi>see his beauty,</hi> Isa. 45. 22. If ever we <hi>draw near to God,</hi> it is by <hi>Faith,</hi> it ushers us and our prayers into his sweet presence. When <hi>faith</hi> is most upon the wing in prayer, then we are ever nearest God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>draw near to God,</hi> is to come in <hi>the Name of Jesus Christ,</hi> and to ask what we pray for, <hi>for his sake.</hi> Heb. 7. 19. <hi>The law made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, whereby we draw nigh to God;</hi> that <hi>better hope</hi> is Jesus Christ: All our Spiritual Sacrifices must be offered upon <hi>this golden Altar;</hi> all our Prayers must be put up in <hi>his Name. By him</hi> (sayes the Apostle) <hi>let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually,</hi> Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 15. He it is that hath the <hi>golden Censer,</hi> and with <hi>his much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense offers it with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Altar which is before the Throne,</hi> Revel. 8. 3. It is by his mediation and intercession that our Prayers come before God, and are accepted. They come to be <hi>sweet odours</hi> by his <hi>incense,</hi> v. 4.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000111_0017_0FA02D2925D21548"/>
and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8. This is to <hi>draw near to God,</hi> to come in Christs Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13,14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him <hi>conscious of our own unworthiness</hi> to sue to him for any thing that we stand in need of, either for our selves or others. They that are Suppliants to Princes, acknowledge their <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness</hi> to come into their Presence, and to put up any <hi>Request</hi> to them. The <hi>Centurion</hi> thought himself not worthy to come to Christ, as well as that he should come <hi>under his roof,</hi> Luke 7. 6,7. and who drew nearer Christ then he? They that <hi>see their unworthiness</hi> to come to pray to God, they of all others <hi>draw nearest to him</hi> when they pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him <hi>sensible of those sins</hi> that we bring into his presence: <hi>Behold, we are before thee in our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes,</hi> sayes that holy man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 15. Such as do <hi>indeed draw near to God,</hi> see their persons <hi>polluted,</hi> their prayers <hi>defiled,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> to need <hi>washing in a fountain open for sin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> spoken of <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. As we are <hi>dust</hi> in our original, so we gather dust and soil daily, and our <hi>best duties</hi> are rolled in dust, our <hi>prayers</hi> full of corruption, and sullied all over with this dust and mire; and every gracious heart sees it, when he <hi>draws nearest</hi> to the Holy One. Blackness and deformity is <hi>seen most</hi> before the

greatest <hi>beauty:</hi> So when we are nearest the <hi>Beauty of Holiness</hi> that is in God, then our black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and deformity is most seen by us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him as <hi>eying his All-sufficiency</hi> to do all we come to ask of him, and more too: <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>To him that is able to do exceeding abundantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all that we can ask or think,</hi> sayes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. It were a great thing to have <hi>all we ask,</hi> but much more to have <hi>all we think;</hi> but to have <hi>above both</hi> our <hi>asking</hi> and <hi>thinking,</hi> and to have <hi>exceeding abundantly</hi> above these, what an All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient God do we come before when we pray to him? And truely, they that do <hi>draw near to him</hi> will <hi>eye him thus,</hi> that he can do every thing, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 2. that there's nothing <hi>too hard</hi> for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 17,27. That if a King on Earth can give a <hi>City</hi> to him that asked but a <hi>peny,</hi> Oh! what cannot the Royal Majesty of Heaven give!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. To <hi>draw near to God</hi> in Prayer, is to come before him as <hi>eying his Willingness</hi> to grant, as well as his <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> and Power to yield to our desires. Psal. 145. 19. <hi>He will fulfil the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</hi> The Leper here fell short<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he believed his <hi>power,</hi> but doubted of his <hi>will, Mat.</hi> 8. 2. but Christ told him of his <hi>will,</hi> as well as his <hi>power,</hi> ver. 3. And indeed this is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000111_0019_0FA02D2AA2102378"/>
an happy thing, to see that there is a <hi>will</hi> in God to give, as well as <hi>power,</hi> for this gives God the glory of his Grace. A Kings grace lies in his Will, an so does Gods.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>In what manner are we to draw near to God in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In <hi>sincerity,</hi> with a true heart. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart.</hi> Truth is the Christian Souldiers girdle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 14. and girds up the heart, and keeps us up close to the duty, that our affections do not dangle and hang loose in Prayer. <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Hear my prayer, O God, that goeth not out of fained lips:</hi> He would be <hi>sincere</hi> when he drew near to God in Prayer. It's no time to be <hi>false</hi> with God, when we come to pray before him. No Prince on Earth would endure a glozing false Suiter; how much less will God endure a <hi>false heart</hi> when we come to sue to him? Hypocrisie is loathsome at all times, but most of all when we come to pray before the Lord. It's the <hi>Worm in the gourd</hi> that eats up the duty: it's the <hi>Rottenness of the Core</hi> that consumes the fruit of all that we expect to come in by our Prayers: it's the <hi>Moth</hi> that corrupts the heart, and spoils the Petition; the <hi>Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilier,</hi> and <hi>Palmer-worm,</hi> and <hi>Canker-worm</hi> that devours all before it. We must be true at <hi>all times,</hi> much more when we fall upon our knees and pray before the Lord.</p>

A pure heart makes a pure prayer: A pure vessel makes the liquor pure; so does the vessel of the heart if pure, make that we pour out before the Lord pure also.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>humility:</hi> Humble ones draw <hi>nearest</hi> unto God, for he is ever <hi>nighest</hi> unto them, <hi>Psa.</hi> 34. 18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. he <hi>dwells</hi> with them. This is <hi>that</hi> that we have Precept and Example for, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>If my people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall humble themselves, and pray,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8,9. They that <hi>draw near to God</hi> must <hi>be afflicted, and mourn.</hi> How humble was holy <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30. 2. how humble was the <hi>Publican</hi> in Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. how humble was the <hi>Prodigal, I am not worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luke 15. 21. An humble heart in Prayer is <hi>Gods delight,</hi> and will act any thing: he will never send these poor ones away empty.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000111_0021_0FA02D2C234D1FE8"/>
4. In <hi>zeal</hi> and fervency: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in Spirit, serving the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> This Sacrifice must be offered up with fire of the Spirits kindling, not of our own: it must not be <hi>strange fire,</hi> as <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1. but holy fire.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Importunately:</hi> Luke 18. 1,2,3,4,5. So <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 5,6,7,8. the Parable of the <hi>unjust Judge</hi> and <hi>poor widow,</hi> and the history of him that came to borrow <hi>three Loaves,</hi> hold it out that we should draw near with <hi>holy importunity,</hi> and <hi>impudency,</hi> as the Greek word signifies, resolving to have no <hi>nay.</hi> So the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> how <hi>importunate</hi> was she; she would not give out, though repulsed often, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. Some suiters will have no <hi>nay,</hi> some beggars will take no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall:</hi> so here, Ambassadors will not be gone, till they have done what they came about. Now <hi>Prayers</hi> are the Souls Ambassadors, that are sent to <hi>Heaven</hi> to negotiate great things with God for us, and they will do what they are sent about. How <hi>impudent,</hi> in an holy wife, was <hi>Jacob,</hi> that said, <hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bless me,</hi> Gen. 32. 26.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Joyfully:</hi> Praying <hi>with joy,</hi> Phil. 1. 4. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> made many Prayers, that were turned into <hi>joyful Praises</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> ere he had done. Trace the <hi>Book of Psalms,</hi> and you shall finde
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000111_0022_0FA02D3AB1E05750"/>
many Prayers by a <hi>Divine Chymistry</hi> turned into <hi>joyful Praises.</hi> Those Prayers that are made in <hi>faith,</hi> have ever <hi>joy</hi> mixed with them. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> are <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> and therefore do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually argue one another: had we more Faith, we should make more joyful Prayers then we do.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Feelingly,</hi> and from the heart: our prayers must be hearty prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 58. <hi>&amp;</hi> 145. They that use their <hi>lips,</hi> and have <hi>wandring hearts,</hi> do not pray in a right manner: God loves no complemental Suiters, but would have the heart given to him; as other wayes, so when we pray to him. There are some <hi>eloquent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,</hi> that will flourish with Rhetorical strains in begging, these speak not <hi>feelingly,</hi> and from the heart, and no wise men will regard such: so do such as pray not with the heart, but flourish it with high strains of speech before the Lord. We must pray <hi>feelingly:</hi> heart-prayers are they that God looks for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. That man is not serious with God in such a serious work as Prayer is, that leaves his heart <hi>behinde him,</hi> when he comes to present his Suits before him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Constantly:</hi> Rom. 12. 12. <hi>Continuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in prayer. Luke</hi> 18. 1. Christ <hi>spake a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to the intent that men, should pray alwayes, and not faint.</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 17. <hi>Pray without ceasing.</hi> The Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as she was <hi>importunate,</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:000111_0023_0FA02D3BE7DF4298"/>
so she was <hi>constant</hi> in Prayer, she held out to the last; so <hi>Jacob. Constancy,</hi> as it <hi>crowns</hi> all other Duties, so in a special manner this of Prayer. Prayer is an holy wrestling, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. with <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 3,4. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. <hi>Strive,</hi> or <hi>wrestle together with me in your prayers for me:</hi> now if a Wrestler should faint, and give out before the victory, he would lose the Crown; so if we hold not out in Prayer, both our labour is in vain, and another will take the Crown from us.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Why are we thus to draw near in Prayer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From our selves. 3. From the Duty it self.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From God:</hi> 1. He hath <hi>commanded us</hi> to draw near to him, he hath given out his <hi>Royal Edict</hi> for it; and when Kings and Princes give out their Royal Edicts, all obey: so here, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. The <hi>Rechabites</hi> obeyed their father in his Commands, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 6. how much more should we obey our Father in this?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>promised</hi> to <hi>draw near to us,</hi> Jam. 48. and who would not have God to draw near to him? His Fellowship is the <hi>best Fellowship</hi> in the world; there's all in <hi>his Communion,</hi> that is in <hi>Father, Friend, Brother, Husband, Lover,</hi> and what else you will, and ten thousand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more, and this may well prevail with us.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:000111_0024_0FA02D3D0D50FB38"/>
3. He hath left us <hi>Examples</hi> in his Word to <hi>imitate,</hi> of sundry that have thus <hi>drawn near</hi> to him; as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and many others, whose faith we are to follow, and whom to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> will be our Crown and Glory. To be beset with such Pearls, and follow such peerless ones, will be a glorious Diadem to our head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>denounceth woe</hi> to such as do it not: <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 1,2. <hi>Woe to her that is filthy and polluted:</hi> Why, what's the matter? Among other things, this is one thing complained of, <hi>she drew not near to her God.</hi> See also <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. Nothing is more loathsome in a wife, then <hi>not to come near her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> and nothing more abominable to God, then for his Spouse <hi>not to draw near to him;</hi> he looks at such as <hi>polluted ones,</hi> and as such as are <hi>turned aside to some adulterous lovers.</hi> Their hearts are gone from him, that draw not near to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From our selves:</hi> 1. We are never <hi>better,</hi> then when we are nearest God, and when we have most communion with him in this Duty: we are in a corner of Heaven, when God and we are in a corner together; as <hi>Peter</hi> said at Christs Transfiguration, <hi>Master, it is good for us to be here,</hi> Mat. 17. 4. so we may say when we are near God, <hi>It is good to be here,</hi> be the place what it will be: Gods Presence makes any place a Paradise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are never <hi>more honoured,</hi> then when we draw near to him. It is an honour to a man to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000111_0025_0FA02D3E5C2E3BC0"/>
be admitted into the Kings Presence at any time, but to be very near him, and often with him, is great honour: what is it then to be near God? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ:</hi> this is greatest honour indeed. See for illustration 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are never nearer <hi>comfort,</hi> then when we are nearest God in this Duty. He is <hi>the God of all comfort,</hi> and therefore when we are near him, we are near comfort, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. What glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beams of <hi>comfort</hi> have been darted into many souls, when they have been darting up their Prayers to heaven, and have been serious with God in the duty? <hi>Heaven</hi> hath been as it were <hi>spened to them.</hi> If ever <hi>comfort</hi> meet us, it is when God and we have been together, when he hath mat with us, and we with him in Prayer. As <hi>Moses face shone</hi> when he had been with God; so our faces shine most with <hi>comfort</hi> when we have been with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 29,30. As the <hi>Nobles of Israel,</hi> by being with God, <hi>saw him, and did eat and drink;</hi> that is, were filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as if they had been at a feast or banquet, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 11. so when we are <hi>near God in this duty,</hi> it is as a banquet of wine to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We finde God very <hi>tender to us,</hi> and passing by failings, and making the best of what we do. There will be <hi>wandering thoughts,</hi> that like <hi>Fowls</hi> will fly upon our Spiritual Sacrifices; but if we
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000111_0026_0FA02D3EED649EE8"/>
endeavour to <hi>drive them away,</hi> as <hi>Abrahams</hi> did those fowls, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 11. God will <hi>accept</hi> the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for Christs sake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. though there be something in the Prayer that hath not been well done, yet if God pass by the failing, and say, <hi>It is well done,</hi> who should finde fault with him? if he be <hi>tender</hi> to us, who can charge him? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a story of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, that coming to bring a cup of Wine to him, it so fell out that he stumbled and fell, and threw down the glass, and spilt the Wine, and sprinkled some of it upon the Kings garments: the King looked angerly upon him, and asked him, <hi>If he had done well in what he did?</hi> the man answered, <hi>If your Majesty think it well done, it is well done. Sayest thou so,</hi> sayes the King, <hi>then I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> say it is well done,</hi> and so pardoned him. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it thus: When we are serving God in Prayer, something comes in that marres and spills the Duty, but if God will pass by the slip, and say, <hi>It is well done,</hi> and accept of it, who hath any thing to say against him? And thus of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace he does, when we would <hi>draw near to him,</hi> and do him <hi>better service,</hi> he knows how to leave the worst, and take the best of our desire, and to make the best of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We shall finde our <hi>drawing near</hi> to God in this Duty, a <hi>Pledge</hi> of our <hi>everlasting communion</hi> with him in another world. Communion with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000111_0027_0FA02D3FCBB34128"/>
God is <hi>Heaven begun,</hi> and it will never cease till it fall into Eternity, as the Rivers do into the Sea. It is true, our Communion with God is <hi>little here,</hi> for what's a little River to the Sea? we are but <hi>now and then,</hi> and but <hi>sometimes,</hi> and but a <hi>little</hi> serious with him; some acquaintance we have, but not much: but there is a time a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when <hi>we shall ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. 17. when we shall <hi>see his face,</hi> Rev. 22. 4. and <hi>be with him where he is.</hi> And this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting happy Communion follows upon our <hi>drawing near to God</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We shall finde, that when we draw near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est unto God we have <hi>most his Image upon us:</hi> for so it is in <hi>Glory,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>We shall be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for we shall see him as he is;</hi> and so it is in <hi>Grace,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. Look as <hi>Moses,</hi> by being with God, brought some of <hi>Heavens beauty</hi> down with him, not onely in his <hi>face,</hi> but also in his <hi>heart,</hi> some of the <hi>bowels of God</hi> toward a sinning people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 31,32. so it is with those that draw near to God in Prayer, the <hi>Image of God</hi> looks fresh upon them, it is to be seen who they have been with, their <hi>Fathers face</hi> is so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously beheld in them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Duty it self:</hi> 1. It is that that Christ Jesus <hi>often exercised</hi> himself in, especially upon <hi>weighty occasions;</hi> yea sometimes spent the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000111_0028_0FA02D4091BFAF98"/>
                     <hi>whole night</hi> in Prayer to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 12. and we need not be ashamed to follow him. Souldiers follow their Leader, Sheep the Shepherds: so here, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27. <hi>They follow me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>that</hi> whereby we become <hi>Princes with God,</hi> Gen. 32. 28. <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 3,4. and who would not <hi>prevail with God,</hi> though he get <hi>an halting</hi> by it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is <hi>that</hi> that makes us <hi>prevail with men, Gen.</hi> 32. 28. If we can but be <hi>Princes with God,</hi> men shall never be too hard for us: <hi>Impotency</hi> shall not overcome where <hi>Omnipotency</hi> yields.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is <hi>that duty</hi> that gains <hi>great things</hi> for us. What is it that may not be obtained by Prayer of Faith? it's a <hi>Key</hi> that opens <hi>all doors;</hi> the <hi>door of Heaven,</hi> Jam. 3. 17,18. the <hi>doors of the Sea,</hi> Exod. 14. Neh. 9. the <hi>doors of the barren womb,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. What <hi>Treasures</hi> are there that Prayer cannot come at, fetch away, and bring in its hand to us?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is <hi>that</hi> that <hi>God delights in,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. Prov. 15. 8. it is a kinde of <hi>harmony,</hi> and <hi>musick,</hi> and <hi>melody</hi> in his ears. Other fathers love to see their children <hi>playing,</hi> but our Father loves to see his children <hi>praying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is <hi>that</hi> that we <hi>begin our spiritual life</hi> with, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and must not cease with us till we come to glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is <hi>that</hi> that will <hi>issue in praises</hi> in another world: our <hi>Requests now,</hi> will be <hi>Songs then.</hi>

We see what <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> God puts upon Believers when they pray to him, <hi>They draw near to him.</hi> It is great honour to draw near to a Princes Throne, to put up a Petition now and then, and to <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>kneel</hi> in his Presence: Oh what <hi>honour</hi> then is it to <hi>draw near to God,</hi> and to come to his Throne to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our Supplications before Him who is <hi>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</hi> all are not so <hi>digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> it is the priviledge of <hi>Believers</hi> onely, they are <hi>they</hi> that have this Kings ear and heart, they may come without <hi>check</hi> or <hi>controll;</hi> it's their honour to be in his Presence, there's no Law to inhibite them from coming, as was sometimes in the great <hi>Persian Monarchs Kingdome,</hi> Esth. 4. 11. they may come <hi>when they will,</hi> and as <hi>often as they will,</hi> this King hath an <hi>ear open,</hi> and an <hi>hand ready</hi> to receive their Petitions that they present to him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14,15. When they come <hi>most frequently,</hi> they are welcome <hi>most cordially;</hi> when they <hi>draw near,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here, they have the honour to <hi>kiss the Kings Hand,</hi> and to come at any time into the Presence-Chamber without reproof. <hi>Such honour have all his Saints,</hi> and so it is with every one that this King <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that Believers are <hi>Favourites</hi> and <hi>Friends</hi> of God, that they <hi>draw near</hi> to God. <hi>Abraham</hi> is thrice in Scripture called <hi>the Friend

of God, 2 Chron.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 23. and when any thing is <hi>often</hi> spoken of, God would have us <hi>minde that.</hi> The truth is, none are such friends of God as Believers; nay, <hi>none</hi> are friends but <hi>they:</hi> To <hi>them</hi> this King holds out the <hi>golden Scepter</hi> of his Grace. There are some that are said to be <hi>near the King,</hi> Jer. 52. 25. and of <hi>Zabud,</hi> that he was <hi>King Solomons friend,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 5. Oh but how <hi>near</hi> are Believers to God, what <hi>friends</hi> are they to him, that may come with their Petitions to him at any time without repulse? No Favourites of Princes have more liberty then <hi>they have,</hi> to come into the Presence of the <hi>greatest Majesty of Heaven. Julius</hi> and <hi>Augustus</hi> had their <hi>Favourites,</hi> and so had <hi>Tiberius</hi> his <hi>Sejanus,</hi> that he did call <hi>Friend,</hi> and would write to him <hi>pro amicitia,</hi> out of the friendship that he bore to him: but none like <hi>Believers</hi> for friendship and favour with God, that can come with such <hi>boldness to his Throne of Grace,</hi> and <hi>draw near</hi> when they pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that God <hi>humbleth himself</hi> above all other Princes in the world, that will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to admit such as we be into his Presence, and to come so near him. It's great <hi>humility</hi> in the great God, to <hi>behold things that are done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to have respect to the service that <hi>Angels</hi> bring before him: but for him to <hi>behold things
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000111_0031_0FA02D42B586CDF8"/>
done on earth,</hi> to look at our <hi>services</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> to regard our <hi>petitions,</hi> and to let us have any room in his <hi>heart,</hi> and our requests to have any admittance to his <hi>Throne:</hi> Oh! <hi>who is like to the Lord that dwelleth on high,</hi> that thus <hi>humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> for our sakes? <hi>Ps.</hi> 113. 5,6. Princes will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>stoop</hi> toward their Subjects, as <hi>David</hi> and others have done, but none like God. Some Princes will scarce be seen once in a year of their Subjects, they take such <hi>State</hi> upon them; but our God and King does not so, we may <hi>draw near to him</hi> when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that by nature we are <hi>far from God,</hi> for it is of faith that we <hi>draw near to him:</hi> by nature we care not for <hi>praying</hi> to him, for it is by grace that we come with our <hi>suits</hi> and <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> to him; we may <hi>thank grace</hi> that ever we get near him. Nature puts us far from God, as East and West are in their distances one from another; as soon may <hi>Arctick</hi> and <hi>Antarctick Poles</hi> meet, as God, and Nature meet together. <hi>Adam</hi> when fallen would never have come at God, but <hi>hid himself</hi> for ever, if God had not sought him and found him out: So it is with all <hi>Adams</hi> Sons, they would shrowd themselves any where, rather then come where God is. Of all such men it is said, <hi>They call not upon God,</hi> Psal. 14. 4. it is from that which is <hi>supernatural</hi> that we <hi>draw near</hi> to him. There is a <hi>Byass</hi> upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000111_0032_0FA02D43A5880070"/>
that carries us far from God, till <hi>another Byass</hi> bends us strongly towards him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see how precious Christ should be to us, for he is that <hi>better hope whereby we draw near to God,</hi> Heb. 7. 19. there's no coming to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but by <hi>him,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. but <hi>through him we have access by one Spirit unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 3. 18. and who then should be <hi>precious</hi> to us, if not he? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. He is the great <hi>Favourite of Heaven,</hi> that brings us all into favour, and brings us <hi>near God,</hi> if ever we get near to him. Favourites of Princes bring others into their Presence: so does <hi>he</hi> bring us into the Presence of God, and makes us and all our Prayers <hi>acceptable,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 15. Oh what a price should we set upon him! He should be <hi>the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He is the <hi>richest Jewel</hi> in the world, the <hi>fairest Flower</hi> in Gods garden, the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in the midst of the Paradise of God; the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>Morning Star,</hi> the <hi>Day-spring from on high,</hi> the <hi>Treasure of Heaven.</hi> in a word, He it is by whom we <hi>draw near to God,</hi> and bring our suits before him to finde <hi>acceptance with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see what a precious grace <hi>Faith</hi> is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. not onely because we <hi>lay hold</hi> upon

The prayer of <hi>faith,</hi> Jam. 5. 15. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that prayer is <hi>no prayer,</hi> that hath not <hi>faith in it,</hi> though never so well beset with compleat and neat flowers of goodly expressions; there do not take with God, it's <hi>faith</hi> that carries all along sweetly in the duty; that's the <hi>sinews</hi> and <hi>strength,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>cream</hi> and <hi>flower,</hi> the <hi>choyce</hi> and <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>marrow</hi> and <hi>fatness</hi> of the duty. Oh how precious should we account of it then, and especially because we draw near to God in prayer by it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use 2. for Terrour</hi> to Unbelievers: They cannot <hi>draw near to God,</hi> nor make any prayer to him to finde <hi>acceptance</hi> with him; they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000111_0034_0FA02D44E8B57E58"/>
without <hi>Christ,</hi> without <hi>faith:</hi> without <hi>Christ</hi> thou wantest <hi>the ladder,</hi> and without <hi>faith</hi> thou wantest <hi>a foot</hi> to come to God by him. No Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer can make a prayer so as to be <hi>accepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation,</hi> that our prayers are so <hi>destitute of faith,</hi> or at least we are of <hi>little faith,</hi> as Christ speaks. When the Sails of a Ship are full, she goes on swiftly; and if our Prayers were filled with <hi>faith,</hi> how swiftly and sweetly would they bring in <hi>Rich Returns</hi> to us? but a <hi>scant wind</hi> spoils the blessed market that we might make. A <hi>little faith</hi> and a <hi>large prayer</hi> does not bring in that we look for, it hinders our drawing near to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use 4: for Exhortation.</hi> 1. To be <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to God that gives us <hi>admittance</hi> into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and <hi>leave</hi> to draw near to him. We would shew our selves <hi>thankefull</hi> for being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earthly Kings Presence, and that we might have any near approach to him, to put up any Petitions of concernment to him: Oh how thankfull should we then be, that the great God will vouchsafe to give us leave to come before him, to put up as many Petitions as we will to him, especially considering <hi>what we are,</hi> and <hi>woat we have been</hi> to him when time was, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. considering also what <hi>great things</hi> they are that we come to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Happiness,</hi> which no Kings on earth can give: we can never be thankfull enough to him for this; Heaven and Earth should be full of our praises for this great favour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>love the Lord Jesus,</hi> by whom we thus <hi>draw near to God,</hi> Heb. 7. 19. Eph. 2. 18. We would for ever <hi>love</hi> that Favourite that brought us into the Kings Presence, and presented our Petitions to him, and got some great thing seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed to us: Oh what <hi>love</hi> then should Christ have from us, that admits us into the Presence of God, and presents our requests, and mediates for us, and sees all done that we desire of him? <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13,14. We can never <hi>love him enough.</hi> As the Prophet said of Gods <hi>Infiniteness,</hi> Isa. 40 16. <hi>Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor all the beasts for a burnt-offering:</hi> so we may say, All the fragrant spices and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of our dearest hearts love are too little, are not sufficient for him that brings us so near the blessed God. And though we cannot come off with so much <hi>love</hi> as he deserves for this, yet let us <hi>do what we can,</hi> and <hi>give him our hearts,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. And as it is with those that love ether men or women, they love the very ground they tread upon: so let it be with us, let us love the ground he treads upon, those places that he comes most to Psal. 26. 8. <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house,</hi> (faith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)

                  <p n="3">3. To <hi>honour</hi> Believers that are so honoured of God, as that they may <hi>draw near</hi> to him. They that are frequently in the Presence-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Kings on earth, as Favourites be, are highly honoured among men: Oh what honour then should we put upon <hi>Believers,</hi> that draw near to the blessed God? They are indeed the <hi>honourable ones,</hi> and the <hi>excellent of the earth,</hi> which we should set our <hi>delight upon,</hi> Psa. 16. 2,3. They are <hi>they</hi> that the King of Heaven <hi>delighteth to honour:</hi> and when an earthly King honoureth any, all his Servants will honour such; so should we <hi>honour those that God honours</hi> by admitting them to <hi>draw near</hi> to him. We should <hi>think</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably of them, <hi>speak</hi> honourably of them, <hi>do</hi> honourably by them, put them in our <hi>hearts,</hi> lay them in our <hi>bosoms,</hi> give them all the honour that's fit for men, and (under God) let them have the <hi>highest room</hi> in our hearts, who have this honour from God, to <hi>draw so near unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To <hi>pray</hi> that when we come before him, we may indeed (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) <hi>draw near</hi> to him.

and our <hi>hearts scatter,</hi> we do but lose our selves, and lose the duty, and all the good we might have by it. Pray therefore for such an heart as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 7. <hi>My heart is fixed, O Lord, my heart is fixed:</hi> we have naturally <hi>unfixed</hi> hearts, <hi>unstable</hi> hearts, such hearts as will give <hi>us</hi> the slip, and give <hi>God</hi> the slip, but if we would indeed draw near to God, we must desire a <hi>fixed heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. To <hi>long</hi> for heaven, where we shall be <hi>near him</hi> indeed. We have, through his grace, some <hi>near approaches</hi> to him, especially when he makes us serious and lively in the duty, even in <hi>this life,</hi> but it is but <hi>a little;</hi> yet whatever it is, it is his mercy that we may come <hi>any whit</hi> near him, as it is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 14. that he shuts us not quite out of his presence: but when we come <hi>in glory,</hi> we shall be near indeed. Oh! how near are the <hi>blessed Angels,</hi> and <hi>blessed Souls</hi> in glory! they have his <hi>ear,</hi> they have his <hi>heart,</hi> they are in his <hi>Presence-Chamber,</hi> in his <hi>bosom,</hi> lye near his very <hi>Soul:</hi> no <hi>nearness</hi> like that which <hi>they</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and <hi>we shall</hi> in a state of glory; and <hi>this</hi> we are to long and breathe for.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Against <hi>loss of Life</hi> here, which is dear to us, and goes near to our hearts; but if we get <hi>near God,</hi> and have more frequent recourse to him by Prayer of faith, his presence that we have enjoyed here, is <hi>more then life.</hi> We must have died where-ever we had been; and if it be our

As <hi>no sinners</hi> were <hi>like us,</hi> so <hi>no God</hi> is <hi>like him,</hi> Mic, 7. 18. How easily and justly might he have destroyed us, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to us according to our deserts? his mercy hath been <hi>great,</hi> that he hath not dealt with us as we have dealt with him, and as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from him.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. We see how much <hi>better</hi> it is to <hi>cut off right hands,</hi> and <hi>right feet,</hi> and to <hi>pluck out right eyes,</hi> sins as dear as these members, rather then to be thus miserably destroyed, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 43—46.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous themselves,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:000111_0063_0FA02D5FE2CB2A60"/>
First, <hi>From God.</hi> I. Though he may <hi>correct,</hi> and forely <hi>afflict</hi> his righteous ones, yet he hath alwayes made a difference between the righteous and the wicked. <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the universal Deluge, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom</hi> was delivered, when they were all burned with fire and brimstone, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. God knows not how to deal <hi>alike</hi> with the one and with the other, but all shall see that the Lord puts a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> as he did of old between the Egyptians and the Israelites, so now between his righteous Servants, and wicked ones, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17,18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>commanded</hi> them to go out from the midst of them that are to be destroyed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. Thus he did to <hi>Lot</hi> in <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19. 17,22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath <hi>promised</hi> to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the righteous and the wicked, in the day when he brings destruction upon them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 28. <hi>Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, for I am with thee, for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee,</hi> &amp;c. and he will make his <hi>promise good.</hi> Men may promise, and break their word, but he will not, <hi>he is faithful that hath promised,</hi> not any thing of it shall fail, <hi>Josh.</hi> 23. 14. I <hi>king</hi> 8. 56.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath <hi>charged</hi> the Executioners of his wrath to <hi>slay utterly old and young</hi> of those that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000111_0064_0FA02D63C4994AB8"/>
he will have destroyed, but <hi>not to come near</hi> any of his righteous that he would have spared, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 9. 6. and he will see to it that they keep their charge; they shall not touch any of them, <hi>not an hair of their heads shall perish.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>loves</hi> the righteous, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146.8. and therefore will not deal with them as with the wicked. There's no man in his right minde will destroy those he loves; how can we think then that the Lord will destroy the <hi>Righteous whom he loves,</hi> with the <hi>Wicked that are an abomination to him?</hi> he will surely put a difference between them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hath <hi>said,</hi> that other <hi>shall discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him not,</hi> Mal. 3. 18. and this could not be, if God should destroy the righteous with the wicked. If we may <hi>discern this,</hi> then surely God makes a <hi>broad difference</hi> betwixt the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous ones themselves.</hi> 1. They are <hi>vexed</hi> for the <hi>unlawful deeds</hi> of the wicked. The word translated <hi>vexed,</hi> is <hi>tormented</hi> in the Greek, and is a Verb that comes of a Noun that signifies <hi>the torment of hell,</hi> as it is in <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 28. The <hi>Sodomites filthy conversation</hi> was like <hi>the torment of hell</hi> to <hi>just Lot,</hi> 2 Per. 2. 7,8. and God delivered him out of their <hi>hellish punishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:000111_0065_0FA02D64D8C17A88"/>
2. They <hi>cry</hi> and <hi>sigh</hi> for the abomination of the wicked they live among, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9,4,5,6. and God will not have them destroyed, but <hi>marked</hi> out to be <hi>spared</hi> in the day of the destruction of the wicked. <hi>Mourners</hi> are Gods <hi>marked ones,</hi> and what destruction <hi>befalls others,</hi> they shall be sure to <hi>escape.</hi> The <hi>Slaughter-weapon</hi> shall not come near such mens doors that <hi>sigh</hi> for sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are a people <hi>near to God,</hi> Psa. 148. 14 and will he destroy them with the wicked? he will never do it. Could any of us have the heart to destroy any that are <hi>near</hi> to us? <hi>How can I endure</hi> (sayes <hi>Esther</hi>) <hi>to see the evil that shall come unto my people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kinred?</hi> Esth. 8. 6. and can God then (think we) endure to see the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of those that are so <hi>near to him?</hi> Surely he cannot do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They do <hi>abominate</hi> and <hi>detest</hi> the wayes of wicked men. <hi>An unjust man is an abomination to the just,</hi> Prov. 29. 27. and how can we then think that God will <hi>destroy the righteous with the wicked,</hi> whose <hi>wickedness</hi> is such an abomination to them? it should not come into our mindes that he will do such a thing as this.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. and will men throw away their <hi>Jewels</hi> among the <hi>Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish?</hi> will they cast away their <hi>precious Pearls</hi> and <hi>Rubies</hi> among the <hi>mire</hi> and <hi>dirt?</hi> will they
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000111_0066_0FA02D65384A0CA8"/>
mix <hi>Diamonds</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> together? Can we then once imagine that God should cast away his <hi>precious ones,</hi> with such as are as <hi>dross</hi> and <hi>dung?</hi> who can think so of the wise God? He may take away the house of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> as <hi>dung,</hi> but <hi>Abijah</hi> his Son, that had <hi>some good things found in him towards the Lord God of Israel,</hi> was not so dealt with, he was a <hi>jewel,</hi> and therefore not buried in the dung, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 10,13.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are his <hi>pleasant Plant,</hi> Isa. 5. 7. <hi>a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vine,</hi> Jer. 2. 21. <hi>fruitful Trees of Righteousness,</hi> Isa. 61. 3. and therefore will have them <hi>spared,</hi> they shall not be cut down as barren and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful ones be. God gave it in charge to <hi>Israel</hi> in time of war, <hi>not to cut down any fruitful Trees,</hi> but those that were <hi>unfruitful,</hi> they were to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,</hi> and to <hi>cut down,</hi> Deut. 20. 19,20. and if he be so tender of <hi>fruitful Trees</hi> in a Field or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, that he would not have them destroyed, then sure he will not cut down his own <hi>choice Plants,</hi> that bring forth pleasant fruits to him.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But is it not said,</hi> Ezek. 21. 3,4. <hi>that</hi> God will cut off the righteous and the wicked; <hi>it seems therefore that the one fares no better then the other, but both are alike in punishment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. They are <hi>both</hi> wrapped up in <hi>temporal punishments</hi> sometimes, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 47. the <hi>green tree</hi> as well as the <hi>dry:</hi> But the righteous are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes delivered from <hi>eternal punishments,</hi> which
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:000111_0067_0FA02D6602998318"/>
the wicked are destroyed with, as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They oftentimes are <hi>delivered</hi> from <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall evils,</hi> which the wicked are destroyed with: as <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they do <hi>suffer</hi> the like temporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is in mercy to them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents some greater evil.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are some righteous <hi>onely in their own eyes,</hi> and in the repute of others, and <hi>they</hi> may well be yoked with the wicked both in <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>eternal punishments:</hi> so that the truth is where it was, That God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked, nor shall the one be alike punished as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use.</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how <hi>good</hi> the Lord is to his <hi>righteous ones,</hi> that doth so mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellously put a difference between them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: they have done enough against him, which hath deserved destruction, and for which he might justly do it, but he <hi>spares them, as a man does his son that serves him,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. He <hi>pities them, as a father does his children,</hi> Psal. 103. 13. He will not <hi>smite them</hi> as he <hi>smites others,</hi> Isa. 27. 7,8. they shall be preserved, when others are destroyed: God will deal <hi>better</hi> with the one then with the other, and they and the other shall see it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what cause of <hi>thankfulness</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous 
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:000111_0068_0FA02D66ADB07CC8"/>
ones have, that they are better <hi>cared for</hi> then others be, for 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. it is God that hath made the difference betwixt them and others, and he must have the glory of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 1. His <hi>grace is magnified</hi> by it, that we and others have any difference made betwixt us. Let us shout forth <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> for this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see the truth of that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Righteousness delivereth from death,</hi> from eternal destruction, and that is the worst destruction that is. The <hi>second death</hi> is the forest death, and that every righteous one is <hi>saved from.</hi> The Serpent may <hi>hiss,</hi> but it cannot <hi>bite,</hi> the <hi>sting</hi> is gone, and therefore the danger is over. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues,</hi> sayes God; and these <hi>plagues</hi> are <hi>killing plagues</hi> to Death, it will never live more, and therefore cannot hurt the righteous.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that the righteous is indeed more <hi>excellent then his neighbour,</hi> Prov. 12. 26. for God puts a great difference between them and others, he will not destroy them with the wicked: they are his <hi>brands</hi> that he will <hi>pluck out of the fire;</hi> his <hi>precious ones,</hi> that he will not cast away with the <hi>dung;</hi> his <hi>gold,</hi> that he will not throw out with the <hi>dross;</hi> his <hi>rare ones,</hi> that he will hang out for glory and beauty, and save from ruine and perdition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that all our <hi>leve is too little</hi> for him
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:000111_0069_0FA02D6776CEC300"/>
that saves us out of the fire, when others are burnt up in it, that frees us from that destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that wicked men fall headlong into. Heart and Soul, and all that is with us, is too little for him; the fullest stream, and strongest current of our affections, the united forces of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est bowels, are not enough for him. Our love in the <hi>fulness</hi> of it, cannot come up in any degree to his; it's not a <hi>drop</hi> to his <hi>Sea,</hi> 'a <hi>beam</hi> to his <hi>Sun,</hi> a <hi>stream</hi> to his <hi>Fountain,</hi> a <hi>bucket</hi> to his <hi>well,</hi> a <hi>spark</hi> to his <hi>Fire:</hi> He is <hi>all love</hi> to us, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 8,16. but Oh how <hi>little</hi> is ours that we express to him!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see what we may <hi>expect,</hi> if <hi>calamitous times</hi> should come, that <hi>it will be well with the righteous,</hi> Isa. 3. 10. there will be a difference made between them and the wicked, yea, though they should <hi>both be killed,</hi> yet a great difference shall be made, they shall not be destroyed with that <hi>great destruction</hi> that the wicked are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed with; they may be <hi>singed,</hi> but not <hi>burnt;</hi> they may be <hi>blacked by their smoke,</hi> but not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed in their sire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour to wicked men:</hi> God will put a <hi>difference</hi> between his righteous ones and them: <hi>Briars</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> shall be <hi>burnt up,</hi> when <hi>fruitful ones</hi> shall be <hi>preserved; dirt</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> shall be <hi>cast out,</hi> when <hi>jewels</hi> shall be <hi>hung out</hi> for glory and beauty, <hi>Roses</hi> and <hi>Lillies</hi> shall

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation to Righteous ones,</hi> that are afraid of being <hi>destroyed with the wicked:</hi> What need they fear, when God makes such a <hi>difference</hi> betwixt them and others? Men make a difference between <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>dross:</hi> much more God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To <hi>exalt Grace,</hi> that puts this difference betwixt <hi>Righteous ones</hi> and <hi>others:</hi> let discriminating Grace be <hi>lifted up,</hi> and <hi>admired,</hi> for that is it that makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that <hi>destruction</hi> is the portion of others, and not of us; let this <hi>crown Grace,</hi> and let us say, <hi>The Kings favour hath done this.</hi> That <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Butler was <hi>restored,</hi> and the Baker <hi>hanged,</hi> when <hi>both had offended their Lord,</hi> it was his <hi>grace</hi> to the one, rather then the other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 21,22.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Lords Providence,</hi> 1. In <hi>permitting</hi> good and bad to be together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 30. <hi>Tares</hi> are permitted to be among the <hi>Wheat</hi> untill the end of the world, which is meant by the <hi>Harvest,</hi> as Christ expounds it; <hi>ver.</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p n="2"> 2. In making his <hi>word as a Draw-net,</hi> which takes up good and bad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 47. so that some good will be among the wicked.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the nature of their Hope:</hi> 1. It is of <hi>things that are not seen,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. so <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> here hoped for that he saw not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is <hi>conjectural,</hi> he puts a <hi>may be,</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure</hi> upon it, and that yields ground for <hi>hope;</hi> it is not <hi>impossible</hi> but such a thing may be.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It <hi>knoweth nothing to the contrary,</hi> and that is some ground of <hi>hope:</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here knew nothing to the contrary, but there might be so many righteous ones in the City.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>From Gods Honour and Glory</hi> 1. From the <hi>glory of his power,</hi> for this <hi>hope</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:000111_0073_0FA02D6AA9EA3980"/>
gives him the glory of that Attribute, that he is <hi>able</hi> to preserve some of his Sheep among so many Wolves, and other beasts of prey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>glory of his Grace:</hi> for this <hi>hope</hi> gives him the glory of that Attribute, in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>undefiled</hi> among so many <hi>polluted ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the <hi>glory of his secret working,</hi> in reserving some to himself which cleave to him in the <hi>worst places;</hi> for this <hi>hope</hi> gives him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this <hi>secret working,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From the <hi>glory of his patience;</hi> for this <hi>hope</hi> gives him the glory of that Attribute, that he <hi>forbears smiting</hi> where there are so many bad, for the <hi>sake</hi> of a very few good among them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see how <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable</hi> godly men be, even of and toward the wickedest places that are. <hi>Sodom</hi> was one of the <hi>vilest places</hi> for wickedness, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> is not <hi>without hope</hi> but that there may be <hi>fifty righteous</hi> persons there; and that under that <hi>heap of chaff</hi> might lye hid so many <hi>corus of Wheat;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that <hi>dunghill of filthiness,</hi> so many <hi>Pearls</hi> and <hi>precious Gems</hi> might be found. Charity is an <hi>hoping Grace,</hi> and loves to go as far this way as may be. Could any good come out of <hi>Sodom? Abraham</hi> does not altogether despair of it; <hi>Peradventure</hi> (sayes he) <hi>there be fifty righteous within the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what <hi>hope</hi> we may have concerning <hi>England,</hi> though there be so many thousands that we could wish were better, yet we cannot but

hope that there are many <hi>fifty hundreds</hi> of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous persons, yea more then does appear in the Christian world any where else, if Travellers have taken their observation right; not that they have any cause to <hi>boast themselves,</hi> but to <hi>exalt Grace:</hi> for who hath made <hi>England</hi> to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from other Nations, that more <hi>Jewels</hi> are found there then elswhere? and what hath that Island that it hath not received?

                  <p n="3">3. We see what <hi>hope</hi> we may have concerning <hi>New-England,</hi> though we do not deserve to be named the same day with our dear Mother, but have cause to hang down our heads, and blush more then any people in the world, in regard of what God hath done for us, and we have done against him; our sins here being of the <hi>first Magnitude,</hi> and far greater then others, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Means and Mercies, Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> that we have enjoyed, but no way so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as the Lord hath expected: yet this let me say, That we have <hi>many fifties</hi> here (to the glory of God be it spoken) and (the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease them a thousand times more, how many soever they be) that are the Lords <hi>Righteous</hi>

                     <hi>ones:</hi> and though there be many <hi>blacker then a coal, viler then the dirt</hi> under their feet, and which may wish that they had never seen <hi>New-England</hi> with their eyes, nor heard what they have heard here with their ears, for whom Hell waits and gapes for every day; yet we have some <hi>rare jewels,</hi> and have had <hi>some rarer,</hi> and <hi>peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> there may be more then we think of, as there were in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time.</p>

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>So does <hi>Abraham</hi> here desire that God would not destroy, but spare <hi>Sodom, if fifty</hi> righteous persons were found in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones themselves. 3. From them that pray for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:000111_0077_0FA02D72DC7700A8"/>
First, <hi>From God:</hi> 1. He is very <hi>ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> Psal.86.5. Neh.9.17. at least so as to remit the punishment. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew this full well, and therefore made bold to <hi>intercede</hi> for wicked <hi>Sodom.</hi> Some men are of that disposition, that they are <hi>easie to be intreated,</hi> and <hi>ready to forgive;</hi> much more God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He will do <hi>much</hi> for those with whom his people have been so journers, and that puts them upon prayer for them. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew, that though <hi>Sodom</hi> was a <hi>vile place,</hi> yet it had suffered <hi>Lot</hi> and his family to dwell there, and therefore prayes the rather for them that they may be spared, at least if there were such a <hi>considerable number</hi> of such as he was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>commands</hi> us to be <hi>kinde</hi> to those that we have dwelt among: <hi>Deut.23.7. Thou shall not abhor an Egyption, because thou wast a stranger in his land:</hi> and if so, he will be much more kinde himself, and that's a ground of godly mens praying for them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>loves the Righteous,</hi> Psal.146.8. and will do <hi>very much</hi> for their sakes, even for a <hi>sinning people;</hi> and that's a ground sufficient for godly ones to pray for them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>kinde to the unthankeful, and to the evil,</hi> Luke 6.35. much more if there be <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ones</hi> amongst them; and therefore have ground to pray for them.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:000111_0078_0FA02D7378BA52D8"/>
He is <hi>willing</hi> to hear to prayers put up to him in faith, <hi>Psal.65.2. Mat. 21.22.</hi> as he was to hear <hi>Abraham</hi> in behalf of <hi>Sodom. [But of that more hereafter, if the Lord will.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous ones themselves.</hi> 1. Their <hi>presence</hi> is delightful to him, and may prevail much for those they live among, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their <hi>prayers</hi> are not lost that are put up for them; they are <hi>accepted,</hi> though they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not for such a sinning people.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>grief</hi> for the sins of such is taken notice of; as <hi>Lots</hi> was for <hi>filthy Sodom,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 7,8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their <hi>tears</hi> that they shed are <hi>bottled</hi> up, <hi>Psal.56.8.</hi> and <hi>booked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Their <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>cries</hi> are observed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Their <hi>pains</hi> they take with them to make them better, is consider of, as <hi>Lots</hi> among the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> Gen. 19. 7,8. Now all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of, what wonder is it that they <hi>plead with God,</hi> that for the sake of such God would not destroy, but spare a wicked place, where <hi>such are</hi> as are in such esteem with God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the petitioners themselves:</hi> 1. They are <hi>friends to God,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.7. Isa. 41.8. Jam. 2.23. and <hi>what</hi> or <hi>whom</hi> may not they prevail for?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="72" facs="unknown:000111_0079_0FA02D7432A2F3A0"/>
2. They are <hi>chosen ones,</hi> Neh.9 7. so was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> and God cannot deny the suits of his <hi>chosen ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their <hi>hearts</hi> are <hi>faithful to God,</hi> Neh.9.8. and such may prevail much for others: their Prayers shall not be lost, but be like <hi>the bowe of</hi> Jonathan <hi>that turned not back,</hi> and <hi>the sword of</hi> Saul <hi>that returned not empty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are in <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> Neh.9.8. and such cannot be <hi>denied,</hi> he cannot say them <hi>Nay</hi> in any thing they sue for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>obedient to God</hi> in difficult com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8,17. and what may not such prevail for?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are men <hi>weaned</hi> from the world, and live and converse much in another world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9,10. Such a man was <hi>Abraham,</hi> and they that are <hi>such,</hi> may get any thing they ask, whoever they be that they make suit for. All which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered, no wonder that they do so desire that <hi>God would not destroy,</hi> but <hi>spare a wicked place,</hi> especially for those <hi>good</hi> that peradventure may be found therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information:</hi> 1. We see that the most <hi>excellent of Saints</hi> bear great good will to the worst of sinners. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that prime Believer, wisheth well to wicked <hi>Sodom,</hi> that it might not be destroyed: and so do now many a precious Saint pray for those that sin worse then even <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:000111_0080_0FA02D74F14868C8"/>
did. For, sins committed <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> exceed <hi>Sodoms wickedness;</hi> they <hi>love those</hi> that <hi>Exit them,</hi> and out of love pray for them. Such will not be brought to <hi>think that they love them,</hi> yet they are many times got into a corner to pray for them, even when they are tearing them with their tongues, and speaking and doing all the evil they can against them. <hi>For my love</hi> (sayes <hi>David</hi>) <hi>they are mine enemies; but I give my self to prayer,</hi> Psal. 109. 4,5. Godly ones are <hi>full of love,</hi> even to their adversaries, and <hi>wish well</hi> to them that wish <hi>no good,</hi> but <hi>evil</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see how <hi>wickedly</hi> they do, that so ill requite the Saints that wish them well, that they are the men that are had in greatest abomination with them, <hi>Prov.</hi>29.27. Publicans will <hi>love those that love them,</hi> Mat.5.46. these therefore are worse then they, who <hi>hate them that love them, and persecute such as pray for them.</hi> Deformed persons hate the greatest beauty: so do these hate those that shew forth the greatest beauty of love to them, in praying for them. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had been in <hi>Sodom,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> was, they would have no more regarded him, then <hi>Lot</hi> was regarded by them. Such <hi>requital</hi> the best of Saints mush meet with, and look for from an evil world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what <hi>love</hi> there is in heaven, if there be so much on earth: Oh! how do the <hi>Saints</hi> love one another there! if while on earth
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000111_0081_0FA02D75D3569F60"/>
they <hi>love their enemies,</hi> what inexpressible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveable love do they shew to their <hi>friends in heaven! Love,</hi> that is <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> will tye perfection to it self, for <hi>perfect</hi> will our love to <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> be. Here are <hi>sparks,</hi> but there our love will be on a <hi>flaming fire;</hi> here are <hi>little points,</hi> but there our love will be in the <hi>full Circumference</hi> of it; here are <hi>atomes</hi> and <hi>motes</hi> of it, but there it will be in the <hi>fulness</hi> of it; here there are but <hi>drops,</hi> but there will be a <hi>Sea</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what <hi>love</hi> there is in God himself, that is <hi>Love it self,</hi> 1 Joh, 4.8. He is the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Spring,</hi> all that is in the Creature flows from him: and this <hi>love</hi> he hath shewn to us, when we were <hi>enemies</hi> to him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. Ours is <hi>little,</hi> but his is <hi>much. Abraham</hi> may wish well to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and a few other Cities more, but Gods love is <hi>infinite,</hi> he loves <hi>the whole world of his Elect,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. It's <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>large;</hi> it's a <hi>Sun,</hi> a <hi>Sea:</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> is not so full of <hi>light,</hi> nor the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>water,</hi> as he is of <hi>Love.</hi> This <hi>Spring</hi> never dries, this <hi>Light</hi> ever shines, this <hi>Sun</hi> never sets, this <hi>Sea</hi> never fails, this <hi>Fire</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goes out, but <hi>warms</hi> our hearts, and will warm them to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see how <hi>precious</hi> righteous ones be in the Lords sight, that Believers dare <hi>for their sakes</hi> desire of God to spare the worst of sinners.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From God the Lord; or from Christ Jesus, for he is this <hi>Lord</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi>

interceded to in behalf of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as Interpreters make account. 2. From the Righteous. 3. From the Wicked.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord Jesus:</hi> 1. He is that <hi>just and righteous one,</hi> Acts 7. 52. and therefore out of justice cannot slay the righteous with the wicked. Just men will make more account of the righteous then of the wicked; how much more the <hi>just Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>loves Righteousness, and hates wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Psal.45.7. and he cannot possibly suffer it, that <hi>the Righteous should be as the Wicked,</hi> or <hi>slay the Righteous with the wicked;</hi> and therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants may wish such a thing as that to be <hi>far from him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>beholds</hi> the righteous with an amiable face, and looks upon them with an eye of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 7. and therefore cannot but put a great difference betwixt the one sort and the other, and cannot put them in the same condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so that the one should be as the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is the <hi>Judge of all the earth;</hi> so the Text: and therefore cannot but do <hi>right. [But of that I must speak more in the next Doctrine, and therefore onely touch upon it now.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is wont to be <hi>merciful</hi> to righteous ones that fear him, and he cannot leave his old wont. This the <hi>Psalmist</hi> pleads, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.132. <hi>Look thou upon me and be merciful to me, as thou</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:000111_0086_0FA02D798109E268"/>
                     <hi>usest to do to those that fear thy Name.</hi> It would not be according to his <hi>custom</hi> and <hi>mont,</hi> it would be otherwise then he useth to do, if he should not be <hi>merciful</hi> to such: and how should he then <hi>slay the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He will render to a man his work, and cause every man to finde according to his wayes, and therefore <hi>humble ones</hi> may earnestly wish it to be <hi>far from him, to slay the Righteous with the wicked.</hi> Job 34. 10,11. So <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks, <hi>Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity: for the work of a man shall be render <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oto him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Righteous:</hi> 1. They are <hi>tender of his Name,</hi> and therefore he cannot but be tender of them, and let the righteous be in better case then the wicked. They are described to be such as <hi>love his Name,</hi> Psal.69.36.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are such as it is <hi>a joy to them to do judgement;</hi> and if so, then much more will the Lord do judgement, and rejoyce so to do: and therefore cannot but put a difference between the righteous and the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are such as are <hi>more excellent</hi> then others be, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. many wayes <hi>more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi> in their <hi>descent,</hi> being <hi>born of God,</hi> Joh.1. 13. in their <hi>honourable Relation,</hi> being <hi>Brethren to Christ,</hi> Joh.20.17. Heb. 2. 11,12. in their <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual food,</hi> which is <hi>Christs flesh</hi> that they feed
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000111_0087_0FA02D7A2C2BD4B0"/>
upon, and his <hi>blood</hi> which they drink of <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55. in their <hi>spiritual clothing,</hi> which is <hi>Christs Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> Isa.61.10. 1 Cor. 1.30. in their <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> having the <hi>Angels to encamp about them, and minister to them,</hi> Psal.34.7. Heb. 1.14. in their <hi>great Inheritance,</hi> Mat.25. 34. Now being all these wayes <hi>more excellent then others,</hi> it must needs be that a difference must be made between them, and that the righteous shall not be as the wicked; and <hi>far be it from the Lord</hi> that it should be otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>they,</hi> and <hi>they onely,</hi> that God hath any <hi>glory by</hi> upon earth: the wicked bring in none to him, but put all the dishonour they can upon him; and <hi>Isa.</hi> 42.8. he is <hi>tender of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and how then should he <hi>slay the Righteous with the wicked?</hi> We may plead it with the Lord as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the Righteous with the Wicked,</hi> or <hi>that the Righteous should be as the Wicked, that be far from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are such as he takes <hi>pleasure in,</hi> Psal. 149.4. and how can this be, if he should <hi>slay the Righteous with the Wicked?</hi> See Cant. 2. 14.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are such as he <hi>meets in a way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> Isa. 64. 5. and if <hi>the Righteous should be as the Wicked,</hi> how could this be? he would rather meet them like an enemy, then in a friendly way, if he should <hi>slay the Righteous with the Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:000111_0088_0FA02D7AE3795C20"/>
Thirdly, <hi>From the Wicked:</hi> 1. They are such as the Lord <hi>abhors,</hi> his very Soul <hi>hates them,</hi> Psal. 11.5. and should not Suppliants then plead with the Lord, that he would put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and his righteous ones? See <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>appointed to wrath, destinated to destruction,</hi> 1 Thess. 5.9. and can the Lord then put no difference between them, but that the one should be as the other? This we should plead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>fear not God,</hi> Psal. 55.19. and how should it be then but that he should put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between those that <hi>fear him,</hi> and <hi>those that fear him not?</hi> God forbid that it should be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are such as <hi>hate the Righteous,</hi> Prov. 29.27. and therefore that the righteous should be as the wicked, we should plead it with the Lord, that it may be <hi>far from him to do after such a manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.10. and that the <hi>Children of God</hi> should be in no <hi>better condition</hi> then the <hi>Children of the Devil,</hi> that we should strongly plead with him; <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are such as whose <hi>sins cry for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> as these <hi>Sodomites</hi> sins did. Now that the righteous and they should share <hi>alike in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> this were hard, and we should plead hard
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000111_0089_0FA02D7BA71664B8"/>
with God, that he would not <hi>do after this manner; That be far from thee,</hi> sayes <hi>Abraham, that be far from thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Suppliants have, and ought to have a <hi>special eye</hi> at the <hi>glory of God</hi> in their supplications that they bring before him. Thus does <hi>Abraham</hi> here, he is very tender of the glory of God, would have no dishonour to reflect upon him, by <hi>slaying the Righteous with the Wicked; That be far from thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>to do after this manner.</hi> Gods glory is <hi>that</hi> that we should aim at in all our holy addresses in Prayer to him, as the <hi>first Petition</hi> in the Lords Prayer holds out to us: that's the <hi>mark</hi> we must shoot at in all we do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. and much more when we come to pray to him, we are to have respect to the <hi>glory of his Name,</hi> and that no reproach may be fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Holy One. His <hi>Name</hi> is worth more then the Lives and Souls of all the men in the world, and infinitely above all created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p n="2">We see that they that <hi>plead most with God</hi> in behalf of others, are most like to <hi>Abraham;</hi> for so did he. Oh how earnest was he in behalf of <hi>Sodom,</hi> that <hi>the Reghteous might not be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wicked!</hi> They that <hi>pray</hi> must <hi>plead,</hi> if they would walk in the steps of <hi>Abraham; That be far from thee,</hi> being twice repeated, shews,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000111_0090_0FA02D7CC22944B8"/>
that (as his) so our Prayers should be <hi>earnest</hi> that we bring before the Lord. <hi>Incense</hi> was not offered without <hi>fire;</hi> nor our Prayers without <hi>fervency,</hi> Jam.5.16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what <hi>true love</hi> godly ones express one towards another. <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>tender love</hi> prayes, that <hi>the Righteous may not be destroyed with the Wicked.</hi> The truth is, there is no <hi>true love,</hi> but an <hi>image onely</hi> of it in other men; but that which is <hi>love is truth,</hi> is onely found among godly ones: They are partakers of the Divine Nature, and therefore shew forth love one to another. <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 Joh.4.8. and where his Image is, as is in all the Saints, there is sweetest love expressed one to another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see wherein <hi>true love</hi> is expressed; it is <hi>evidenced</hi> in our earnest Prayers that we put up one for another. <hi>Abraham</hi> so judged, and therefore <hi>pleads with God</hi> in behalf of those <hi>Righteous ones in Sodom,</hi> that they may not be <hi>destroyed with the wicked.</hi> There's no <hi>true love</hi> like that that is expressed in our fervent Prayers one for another. Prayer is an <hi>holy breathing, Lam.</hi> 3.56. and our love one to another is never breathed forth more, then in our Prayers each for other. They have <hi>a sweet breath,</hi> and their love is sweet that pray most fervently one for another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that they that do not <hi>plead earnestly</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="unknown:000111_0091_0FA02D7D27B20878"/>
in Prayer for <hi>Righteous ones,</hi> are neither heirs of <hi>Abrahams faith</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> to those righteous ones that he earnestly intreated for: there are those that pray flightly and superficially for them, but <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>fervent in spirit</hi> for those he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for; <hi>That be far from thee, That be far from thee, that the Righteous should be as the Wicked.</hi> Hollow, slight, perfunctory Prayers for others, argue that there's neither <hi>faith</hi> nor <hi>love</hi> in such an heart. That fire is <hi>gone out</hi> that the bellows <hi>cannot kindle;</hi> so if the blast of our desires be not <hi>fervent</hi> for others, the fire of <hi>love</hi> is quite put out.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that if we be to be earnest and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in our Prayers for <hi>others,</hi> how fervent are we to be for <hi>our selves,</hi> and for those that are and ought to be as dear as our own Souls? for our own Country, and the Land of our Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Oh how earnest should we be that both <hi>we</hi> and <hi>they</hi> may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and not destroyed, when other <hi>wicked ones</hi> shall not escape! we should <hi>double</hi> our Requests for our selves and them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here does, that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>they</hi> may be preserved from the fire of his indignation. The very Heathens had a love to their Country, and their utmost desires and endeavours were for the preservation of that, as we see in <hi>Tully,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> and others of them. Oh what desires then should Christians have, as for <hi>themselves.</hi>

We cannot be too earnest in our desires for them; <hi>that</hi> that we sue unto God for, is worth the strongest of our affections to be put forth in our Prayers for them: So <hi>Abraham</hi> thought, and so should we.</p>

                  <p>A Judge <hi>judgeth at the time appointed for judgement;</hi> so does Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. and so <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. he speaks of the day when <hi>God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ.</hi> Hence also it is that so frequent mention is made or <hi>the Day of Judgement,</hi> and <hi>the Last day,</hi> Joh. 12. 48. and <hi>the judgement of the great day,</hi> Jude 6.</p>

Quest. 3. <hi>What manner of Judge is he?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <hi>A Righteous Judge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. hence <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.<hi>He shall judge the world in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A Comfortable Judge</hi> to his friends, to those he is a Friend and Saviour to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A Wise Judge:</hi> There are some <hi>wise Judges</hi> upon earth, but none like him. <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wise Judge, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 24—27. but none like him for wisdome, that styles himself <hi>Greater then Solomon.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>A Pitiful Judge:</hi> Some Judges on Earth have been so <hi>pitiful,</hi> as that they never condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any, but they have <hi>wept</hi> over them; but no Judge on earth like him for pity.

                  <p n="3">3. He is <hi>the one Law-giver,</hi> and therefore the whole Scripture is called <hi>The word of Christ, Col.</hi> 3. 16. and being the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> it's meet he should be <hi>Judge</hi> also.</p>

the more righteous he is, the fitter he is to be the Judge.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>the friend of God,</hi> Jam. 2. 23. and had it <hi>revealed</hi> to him, as we reveal much to friends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Lord knew not how to hide other <hi>secrets</hi> from him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17. and therefore not this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an <hi>heavenly-minded</hi> man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 10. that had in his eye a blessed state of glory, and could not but know that there was a <hi>judgement to come,</hi> and that <hi>He it was</hi> that was <hi>the Judge of all the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see the <hi>great dignity</hi> that the Lord Christ is exalted to after his <hi>deep humiliation;</hi> He is the <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> the Father highly honours him. After <hi>sufferings</hi> comes the <hi>greatest dignity,</hi> they usher in glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 26. the Father as a reward of his <hi>deep abasement,</hi> advanceth him to this height of honour, to be <hi>Judge of all the Earth.</hi>

Malefactors fear their Judge; so should all the <hi>guilty ones</hi> of the earth fear this great Judge, and not <hi>onely they,</hi> but <hi>others</hi> also, that expect favour from him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 4.</p>

They are all <hi>the work of his hands,</hi> and he will be a Judge to them all: He will make no difference between <hi>Silks</hi> and <hi>Leather,</hi> between <hi>Cloth of Gold</hi> and the <hi>vilest Raiment.</hi> Men may make difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>great ones</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> but the <hi>Judge of all the Earth</hi> cannot, will not: they must <hi>bow the knee</hi> to him, as well as other <hi>stoop</hi> to him, <hi>kiss</hi> him, and <hi>make obeisance</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that the Patriarks of old did not onely <hi>know</hi> that there was to be a <hi>day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but had <hi>serious thoughts</hi> and <hi>meditations</hi> of it, and knew who the Judge of all the Earth <hi>was.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Enoch the seventh from</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, even in the <hi>beginning of the world</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth of the <hi>End of the world,</hi> and of the <hi>Day of Judgement,</hi> Jude <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. and if they had such <hi>serious thoughts</hi> of that day, how much more
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:000111_0102_0FA02C97C9E0BF60"/>
should we, <hi>upon whom the ends of the world are come?</hi> We are upon the <hi>last hour,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> calls it 1 Joh. 2. 18. and therefore our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>looks,</hi> and <hi>longings,</hi> and <hi>breathings</hi> should be after <hi>that,</hi> and we should <hi>mediate</hi> much of this Judge's <hi>coming.</hi> They that have but <hi>a short time</hi> to think of <hi>a serious matter,</hi> had need to think intensely and seriously of it: so we of the Judges <hi>coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see what <hi>preparation</hi> we should all make to <hi>meet the Judge at his coming.</hi> There is <hi>great preparation</hi> for the coming of other Judges at the <hi>Assize;</hi> Oh how then should <hi>we prepare</hi> for his coming who is <hi>Judge of all the Earth?</hi> especially considering that the <hi>time is short</hi> that is allotted to us. They that have a <hi>great work</hi> to do, and a <hi>very little time</hi> to do it in, had need be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirre themselves: so had we in this <hi>solemn work</hi> of sitting our selves for the coming of this great Judge; we should not let him finde us without our dress, but be in <hi>readiness,</hi> Mat. 24. 44. A <hi>Spouse</hi> prepares for her <hi>Husbands coming;</hi> so should we for <hi>Christs coming.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that all the Earth have need to make <hi>Supplication</hi> to their Judge. All sorts and ranks of men upon earth had need desire, and earnestly intreat that he may be a <hi>merciful</hi> Judge to them; and in this <hi>day of grace,</hi> that they may find grace in his sight.

                     <hi>Reasons of the first Branch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He <hi>cannot but do right,</hi> because he is <hi>a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 8. He is called <hi>the just one,</hi> Acts 7. 52. and just Judges do that which is <hi>right;</hi> how much more he?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because he <hi>loveth Righteousness</hi> in us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. 7. and therefore sure he <hi>cannot but do right</hi> himself. That which we <hi>love,</hi> we put in <hi>practice,</hi> we cannot do contrary to what we love: so it is with Christ, <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> he <hi>loves Righteousness</hi> in us, and therefore cannot do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he loves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>commands</hi> other Judges to <hi>do right,</hi> Deut. 1. 16. <hi>judge righteously between every man and his brother.</hi> So 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6,7. And he that
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:000111_0106_0FA02C9AAA39EBD8"/>
commands other Judges to <hi>do right,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>do right</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>complains</hi> of <hi>wrong dealing,</hi> and of the <hi>proceeding of wrong judgement.</hi> Hab. 1. 4. <hi>The law is slacked, and judgement doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrong judgement proceedeth.</hi> Now if the Lord finde fault himself with wrong dealing, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do wrong himself, but will do right.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>punisheth</hi> those that do <hi>pervert judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and justice.</hi> The <hi>Caldeans</hi> were sent against the <hi>injustice</hi> of the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> and God took vengeance <hi>of them</hi> by them with great severity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 6, 10. Now if the Lord punish iniquity and injustice in men, he must needs, as <hi>Judge of all the Earth,</hi> do right himself.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>with those</hi> that are just Judges, in the righteous judgement that they pass in their Judgement-seats, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6. He is <hi>with them</hi> to <hi>assist</hi> them, to <hi>direct</hi> them, to <hi>protect</hi> them, to <hi>encourage</hi> them, to <hi>uphold</hi> them, to <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> them, to <hi>bless</hi> them: and if so, then he <hi>cannot but do right</hi> himself.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He <hi>respects no persons, takes no gifts,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bribed or <hi>blinded with rewards.</hi> Some Judges <hi>may,</hi> but he <hi>cannot;</hi> some others may <hi>pervert judgement</hi> by such wayes, but he <hi>will not,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 7. and therefore he <hi>cannot but do right.</hi> Let men do wrong, and deal unjustly, and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:000111_0107_0FA02C9B65558A78"/>
do violence; yet this Judge <hi>will not, cannot,</hi> he treads never a step but in the way of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He will bring such to <hi>judgement</hi> at the <hi>great day,</hi> as have done <hi>iniquity</hi> in Judgement-seats. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>I saw under the Sun</hi> (sayes <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>the place of judgement, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity was there: I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose, and for every work.</hi> Now if God will be severe against unrighteous Judges at the last day, how can it be but that as Judge he must <hi>do right</hi> himself?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons of the second Branch,</hi> Why we are to <hi>plead</hi> it with him as he is Judge to <hi>do right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is not meet that his <hi>Name</hi> should have any <hi>dishonour</hi> put upon it, and therefore we are to plead with him to <hi>do right:</hi> for if he could possibly do any iniquity (which he cannot) it would reflect dishonour upon him. <hi>Petit.</hi> 1. in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because if he <hi>did not right,</hi> he could not <hi>judge the world:</hi> it is essential to his Office of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judge, to <hi>do righteously,</hi> Rom. 3. 5, 6. and that we may plead with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because his <hi>honour is exalted</hi> by <hi>doing right.</hi> If <hi>Righteousness exalt a Nation,</hi> then much more <hi>the Judge of all Nations;</hi> and therefore we may well plead it with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:000111_0108_0FA02C9C3B651BD0"/>
4. Because <hi>all mouthes are stopped</hi> when <hi>right is done.</hi> It is so when Judges on earth do right, they that would <hi>cavil,</hi> cannot tell how to do it: So it is when <hi>the Judge of all the Earth does right,</hi> then no man dare open his mouth against him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Because when this Judge doth <hi>right,</hi> there will be <hi>loud acclamations</hi> made. As when a King upon the Throne <hi>judgeth righteously,</hi> all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will sound forth his praise: so when this King judgeth righteously, all will sing aloud his praise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. <hi>throughout.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Because when he doth <hi>right</hi> he will be <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> It is said of <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he did that that was <hi>right</hi> between the two women that contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dead childe,</hi> that <hi>All Israel heard of the judgement that the King had judged, and they feared the King,</hi> 1 Kin. 3. 28. Oh how will then <hi>the Judge of all the Earth,</hi> when he does <hi>right,</hi> be <hi>feared</hi> of all his people? and this we may well plead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> they are to Jesus Christ, that sit on judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seats and do not that which is <hi>right,</hi> but pervert judgement, and no not execute justice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the earth. There are those that will <hi>turn aside the right of the poor,</hi> and <hi>will not help the afflicted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the gate,</hi> but will deal <hi>unrighteously,</hi> when it is in the power of their hand to help and succour helpless ones. The Judge of all the Earth <hi>cannot
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000111_0109_0FA02C9D260B2A90"/>
but do right;</hi> Oh how little then do these resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him? He shines with the <hi>rayes</hi> and <hi>beams</hi> of his Righteousness, but they have not so much as <hi>one beam</hi> of this Sun to shine forth with, but are black and dark all over, and covered with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,</hi> as the sky is covered with thick Clouds and darkness. In stead of <hi>putting on righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and being <hi>clothed with it,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, Job 29. 14. and making <hi>judgement a robe, and a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> they put on <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> and tye it fast as a garment to them. Many such there are in the world, but they have nothing of the Image of Christ upon them; <hi>The Judge of all the Earth cannot but do right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that <hi>this Judge</hi> will cause all unjust Judges to stand before <hi>His</hi> Judgement-seat, and pass a righteous Sentence upon <hi>them.</hi> Though they would <hi>do no right,</hi> yet they shall <hi>have right</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> from him at the <hi>great day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> Then he will reckon with them for all their <hi>cruelty and injustice,</hi> for all the <hi>wrong</hi> that they have done to his poor ones; for all the <hi>tricks</hi> and <hi>querks</hi> that they have devised to put off Law, and Justice, and Equity: then they shall <hi>hear</hi> his righteous Sentence pronounced upon them, and <hi>feel</hi> the stroke of his righteous hand against them. The Judge of all the Earth, <hi>that doth right,</hi> will pay them for all their <hi>wrong</hi> they have done, and the proudest of them shall know it. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:000111_0110_0FA02C9DA257BF80"/>
3. We see what all their <hi>Bribery</hi> will come to that they have <hi>perverted justice</hi> by, and all the <hi>Gifts</hi> they have been <hi>blinded with,</hi> to go out of <hi>the way of Righteousness</hi> with; the Judge of all the Earth, <hi>that doth right,</hi> will reward them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their <hi>works.</hi> Those <hi>Bribes</hi> that they have taken will be <hi>fire</hi> to consume all they leave behinde them, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 34. and kindle <hi>hell fire</hi> by the <hi>breath of God</hi> against them, to consume them to all eternity. <hi>Bribes</hi> are to them, as the <hi>Worm</hi> was to <hi>Jonas'</hi>s <hi>gourd,</hi> that <hi>smote it, and withered it;</hi> they <hi>smite</hi> and <hi>wither</hi> their Estates, Names, Families, Bodies and Souls, and bring ruine and destruction upon them for ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what <hi>need Kings,</hi> and all <hi>the Judges of the Earth</hi> have to <hi>be wise,</hi> and to <hi>kiss the Son;</hi> for he that is <hi>Judge of all the Earth cannot but do right,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> shall have right and justice from him, as well as other men.

                  </p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="unknown:000111_0111_0FA02CA1085B6780"/>
5. We see that surely he will not <hi>slay the Righteous with the Wicked, in the day of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Wicked;</hi> for, <hi>the Judge of all the Earth cannot but do right:</hi> he will put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the one and the other, he will not consume <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>dross</hi> together. [<hi>But of that we spake before.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that we may not <hi>marvel,</hi> though sometimes <hi>temporal afflictions</hi> befall the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and wicked ones escape; for, <hi>the</hi> Judge <hi>of all the Earth cannot but do right</hi> in all his dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to <hi>his own dear ones.</hi> Something he sees that it is just with him to <hi>afflict them</hi> for, and it is in <hi>love and faithfulness</hi> to them, and they see it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 75. and for the wicked that <hi>escape these,</hi> there's more behinde for them, and they shall have <hi>right done them</hi> in another manner; they are <hi>reserved men</hi> to <hi>another day,</hi> and for <hi>another time,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 9. Job 21. 30. and those <hi>afflictions of the Righteous</hi> are but as the <hi>prickings of a pin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the punishment of <hi>the damned in Hell,</hi> which shall be <hi>stung with Scorpions</hi> to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see what <hi>love</hi> we owe to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, that is the Judge <hi>that cannot but do right:</hi> All men love such a Judge as does right to <hi>every man;</hi> Oh what love then is this Judge worthy of, that <hi>cannot but do right to all?

right answer,</hi> Prov. 24. 26. and if so, how should we in way of love <hi>kiss</hi> those blessed <hi>lips,</hi> that as a Judge gives <hi>a right answer,</hi> and <hi>cannot but do right</hi> in all his dispensations of himself to us?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see what cause we have to <hi>Speak good of his Name:</hi> All men speak well of such a Judge as does right to all; his <hi>name</hi> is renowned all the Country over, his <hi>same</hi> spreads all a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over: Oh how well should we then speak of <hi>the Judge of all the Earth?</hi> how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned should <hi>his Name</hi> be? how should <hi>his Fame</hi> spread all the world over, that <hi>cannot but do right</hi> to all? we should make <hi>his Name to be remembred to all generations,</hi> Psal. 45. 17.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In that he is a <hi>Great King,</hi> Psal. 47. 2. &amp; 95. 3. and they that are great Kings have open ears, and inlarged hearts, to grant the desires of those that sue to them. <hi>Ask on my mother</hi> (sayes <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>for I will not say thee nay,</hi> I King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 20. <hi>What is thy petition, Queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee: And what is thy request? and it shall be performed to the half of the Kingdome.</hi> Great Princes think it their honour thus to do, <hi>Esth.</hi> 7. 2. how much more the Lord, who is the <hi>Great King over all the earth</hi>

come off with great thanks: and <hi>their</hi> inlarged hearts in thankfulness, shews that he is a God hearing and granting the <hi>desires</hi> that they put up to him. Great <hi>acknowledgements</hi> argue great <hi>favours,</hi> great <hi>thanks,</hi> great <hi>bounty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that his Servants have <hi>this confidence,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14, 15. and their confidence in him does not <hi>deceive them. Confidence</hi> in an unfaithfull man, is as <hi>a broken tooth, and a foot out of joynt,</hi> Prov. 25. 19. it will deceive him as a <hi>broken tooth</hi> will him that eateth, and a <hi>foot out of joynt</hi> him that goeth: but <hi>confidence</hi> in the <hi>faithful God</hi> will never deceive a man, but let him go to him in way of <hi>Request</hi> for any thing that he needs, that stands with his glory, and he shall have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that <hi>he hears the cry of the young Ravens,</hi> Psal. 147. 9. and if so, much more will he <hi>hear the cry of his Servants that sue to him.</hi> Ravens are of the worst kinde of fowls, of a devouring nature, that feed of dead Carrion, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in want, and after their manner <hi>cry to God;</hi> and if he will hear such a <hi>croking cry</hi> as that, much more will he hear the <hi>cry of his believing Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> and grant them what they sue unto him for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

See <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 19.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that he <hi>delights</hi> in our Prayers: <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight:</hi> Cant. 2. 14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice.</hi> Now <hi>Prayer</hi> being so <hi>delightful</hi> to him, being as it were sweetest musick and melody to him, what wonder is it if he <hi>hears</hi> and <hi>grants</hi> all that we sue unto him for.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Sometimes <hi>very speedily,</hi> Isa. 58. 9. <hi>Thou shalt call, and the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am:</hi> which is a marvellous condescendency in the great God, and hath more in it then I am able to express; it is like that in <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 11. as if Prayer had the <hi>command</hi> of the great God. But withall it holds out his <hi>speedy answer</hi> of Prayer: So <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>while they are yet speaking, &amp;c. Nehemiah</hi> got a <hi>speedy answer</hi> to his ejaculatory Prayer, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 4.—8. So <hi>Ezra</hi> had a <hi>speedy answer,</hi> Ezra 8. 23. So <hi>Elijah</hi> had a <hi>speedy answer,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 36, 37, 38, 39. Prayer hath <hi>wings</hi> to fly speedily <hi>to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and to bring a speedy answer <hi>from heaven.</hi> See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Graciously,</hi> Exod. 22. 27. <hi>When he crieth unto me, I will hear; for I am gracious.</hi> As God is gracious to us many other wayes, so in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner <hi>in hearing our prayers,</hi> and <hi>granting what we sue unto him</hi> for.

not able to count what wonders have been done by Prayer: That wonder of the <hi>Thundring Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions Prayer for Rain,</hi> when the Emperour and his Army were in such distress, which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their Prayer, was a rare wonder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hears them <hi>constantly;</hi> there's no time that they come before him so as they ought, but he hears, and grants what they desire of him. Psal. 55. 17. <hi>Evening and morning, and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice.</hi> Let me come before him when I will, I shall get an answer. There are some Princes on earth that never deny their Suppliants, but are all upon the <hi>giving hand:</hi> That Emperour that said, <hi>He never sent away any that came petitioning sad from him,</hi> was such a Prince. Now if Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on earth will do thus, Oh how much more will God himself at all times grant that that we sue unto him for?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Alwayes in time of need.</hi> Heb. 4. 16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of Grace, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need.</hi> God does all for us according to our <hi>need;</hi> and when we <hi>need</hi> a grant of our Requests, we shall be sure to have it. Wise men will give where they see there's <hi>need;</hi> much more the wise God. When we cannot tell how to be <hi>without a grant,</hi> then a <hi>grant comes</hi> from Heaven; when we know

not what to do <hi>without it,</hi> then it is <hi>given,</hi> then the God of Heaven is liberal in his grants to us.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Why is the Lord a God hearing Prayer, and granting the desires of his Servants?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From himself. 2. From his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. 3. From the Duty of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From himself.</hi> 1. He hath <hi>promised</hi> that he will <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> Mat. 21. 22. Joh. 16. 23. and what he promiseth he will perform: what <hi>he speaks with his mouth, he will fulfill with his hand,</hi> 1 King. 8. 24. Men often break their promises, and belie with their <hi>deeds</hi> what they utter in their <hi>words;</hi> but God <hi>cannot lie,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. and therefore what he <hi>speaks</hi> shall be done, <hi>He will not alter the thing that is gone out of his lips,</hi> Numb. 23. 19. if he say that he will <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>grant,</hi> he will make it good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hereby <hi>encourageth</hi> all flesh to come to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2. They have many beggars at their doors that are <hi>bountiful givers:</hi> Those Courts of Princes are thronged with Suiters, where the Prince's ears are open to hear, and their hands open to give: So it is with Gods <hi>Doors,</hi> many there are that lye at them; and with his <hi>Court,</hi> multitudes of Suiters throng to it with their Petitions, when Gods ear is open to hear, &amp; his had open to give. They are <hi>encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to come, when he will not say them <hi>nay.</hi> It is observed, That that gracious Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>

had very many that made suit to him; how much more then will our gracious God have many that will make supplication to him?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hereby <hi>bindes us</hi> the faster to himself in love and duty. <hi>Every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon:</hi> and all look at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as much obliged to them that are bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in giving to them: but Oh how much more does God <hi>oblige us</hi> to him by those liberal <hi>grants</hi> that he makes to us! We are ready to say as <hi>David</hi> does, Psal. 116. 16. <hi>Truely we are his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, we are his servants,</hi> and desire that none may shew our selves more faithful then we. That Traitor that <hi>Augustus</hi> was so kinde unto, not only in pardoning his Treason, but in giving him great things, and preferring him to highest Honour, look'd at himself as one that was <hi>deeply engaged</hi> and <hi>obliged</hi> to him, and proved the most faithful and loyal Subject to him of all other ever after: So does God <hi>binde</hi> and <hi>tye us</hi> to himself in <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> by his bountifull grants that he makes to us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hereby <hi>honours</hi> himself by having an <hi>open ear</hi> to hear, and an <hi>open hand</hi> to give and grant what we sue for. He is <hi>abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. and this way shews it. It is observed of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he <hi>gave the Queen of Sheba all that she asked, besides what he gave her of his royal bounty,</hi> 1 Kings 10. 13. and he <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

himself</hi> in so doing: How then does <hi>God honour himself</hi> in giving us <hi>all our desire,</hi> and <hi>what we ask?</hi> there's no <hi>Royal bounty</hi> like his, he grants <hi>like a King,</hi> and <hi>like Himself:</hi> Other Kings have their <hi>Royal Grants,</hi> but none such as his are.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From his Servants.</hi> 1. They <hi>expect</hi> his hearing of their Prayers, and a grant of their desires from him, and wait patiently upon him; and this gets a grant. Psal. 40. 1. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and be inclined unto me and heard my cry.</hi> There's nothing lost by <hi>patient waiting</hi> at the Courts of Kings, the desires of such are granted at last: much less is any thing lost by waiting upon the Lord, he will come with a <hi>full hand</hi> at last, and we shall have a <hi>full gram</hi> of what we sue for. The <hi>Husbandman waits</hi> for the precious fruits of the earth, and at length <hi>hath them;</hi> so shall we by <hi>waiting</hi> have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blessings of Heaven brought in to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They <hi>believe</hi> that they shall be heard, and a <hi>Royal Grant bestowed upon them,</hi> and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22.

The <hi>door of Mercy</hi> may be fast barred and locked, but a <hi>knock by Faith</hi> will open it to us, and open all the Treasures of his bounty for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may share in them.</p>

3. They are <hi>unwearied</hi> in their desires, and that gets a grant: The <hi>Woman of Canaan</hi> would not be discouraged, nor faint at so many denials and repulses, but went on in an <hi>unwearied</hi> course of suing and pleading, and this got a grant of what she asked, and what she would, <hi>Mat</hi> 15. 28.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what a <hi>broad difference</hi> there is between <hi>our God,</hi> and the <hi>Idols</hi> that others pray unto: Our God is <hi>a God hearing Prayer,</hi> but: <hi>Idols cannot hear. Baal's</hi> worshippers, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 26. <hi>called from morning to noon, saying, O Baal hear us: but there was no voice, nor any that answered.</hi> So <hi>Isa.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>Moah shall go to his sanctuary to pray, but shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi> Idols <hi>have ears, but they hear not,</hi> Ps. 115. 6. but our God that we pray to hath an <hi>hearing ear,</hi> and grants us all that we sue unto him for: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any had cause to say that <hi>he turns a deaf ear</hi> to them when they pray aright; his ears have alwayes been <hi>open</hi> to their Prayers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what great <hi>encouragement</hi> we have to come to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2. we may go <hi>when we

will,</hi> and be sure to speed; we may pray as <hi>often as we will,</hi> and have our desires granted: he will not turn away from us, but give us what we come for. Some Princes will <hi>chide away</hi> those that sue to them, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the oppressed Israelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 17, 18. but our God that we sue unto never discourageth them that make suit and supplication to him, but gives them all the encouragement that may be, is <hi>found of them when they seek him, when they search for him with all their hearts;</hi> Jer. 29. 13. they shall never go <hi>away empty</hi> from his doors, but go <hi>loaden</hi> with their laps full, with their hearts full, and all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires like the <hi>widows vessels,</hi> 2 Kings 4. 6. shall be <hi>filled full:</hi> we shall never say we have <hi>gone to God,</hi> but we have <hi>got something;</hi> there's a rich Treasury in Heaven, and we have carried away <hi>not a little</hi> from it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what cause we have to <hi>bless the Lord</hi> for his <hi>bounty</hi> to us, in granting our Requests that we put up to him: There's no friend that is kinde to us in granting our desires, but we judge worthy of <hi>thanks;</hi> Oh how <hi>thankeful</hi> should we then be to God, that hears and grants what we seek unto him for? <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 20. It is the Lords <hi>Tribute</hi> that he looks for, and if we would not grudge to pay the King <hi>his Tribute,</hi> being a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty,</hi> Rom. 13. 7. then we should chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully come off with the <hi>Lords Tribute,</hi> and pay
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:000111_0129_0FA02CAFD9934590"/>
it in <hi>holy Praises</hi> to him. The truth is, we do but <hi>bungle</hi> at it here, and do it not workman-like; but we shall one day do it better, when we are joyned in this heavenly melody with that <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, and blessed Souls in glory.</hi> But in the mean time we must be doing <hi>something</hi> this way for all his bounties to us, and if not so well as we <hi>would,</hi> yet we are to do it as well as we <hi>can,</hi> and long for the time when we shall perform it better.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that though we have but a <hi>few friends</hi> on earth, yet we have <hi>One</hi> in Heaven that <hi>will not fail us. There is a friend</hi> (<hi>Solomon</hi> sayes) <hi>that sticketh closer then a brother,</hi> Prov. 18. 24. and such an one is a rare jewel, and hardly to be found: but though he be not to be found <hi>on Earth,</hi> yet God is <hi>such a friend,</hi> and will hear and grant what we sue unto him for.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see the truth of that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 28. <hi>It is good for me to draw near to God:</hi> it must needs be so, considering <hi>what a God he is</hi> that we go unto, that <hi>hears our</hi> Prayers, &amp; <hi>grants</hi> us all that we ask of him. We make account that it's good to go to a Father or Friend to make our wants known, that we may have a supply: Oh how good is it then to go to such a Father and Friend as God is?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see what cause we have to <hi>delight in the Lord,</hi> that we may have the desires of our hearts

granted to us. Seeing he is so willing to grant, let us take the way that he prescribes for this, and that is by <hi>delighting in him,</hi> Psal. 37. 4.

                  </p>

How dutiful and obedient are Servants to their liberal Masters? they are ready at hand to ride, run, go, do any thing for them: Oh how loyal should we then be to such a <hi>bountiful King?</hi> and how dutiful to such a <hi>liberal Master</hi> as God is, that gives us what we ask of him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see how we may be <hi>followers of God,</hi> by hearing the cries of poor <hi>afflicted ones,</hi> and

25. 21. So <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed for <hi>deliverance from Esan</hi> his Brother, and God gave him <hi>the same thing,</hi> Gen. 32. 11. with 33. 4. <hi>Hannah</hi> desires <hi>a man-childe,</hi> and God gave her <hi>her Request,</hi> and granted <hi>the very thing she asked of him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11, 20, 26, 27. So <hi>Jabez</hi> prayed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 10. and God granted him <hi>his petition</hi> in the <hi>kinde</hi> of it. We see the like in <hi>Asa, Jehosaphat, Hezekiah, David, Solomon,</hi> and many others, that had <hi>the same things</hi> granted that they desired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From his believing ones. 3. From the efficacy of Prayer.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. From his <hi>Power:</hi> there is nothing too hard for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>Job</hi> 42. <hi>I know</hi> (sayes <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>thou canst do every thing:</hi> and therefore though there may seem to be an impossibility in nature that <hi>the same thing</hi> should be granted, yet what cannot the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent One do? <hi>With him all things are possible,</hi> Jer. 32. 17, 27. It was the speech of an <hi>Indian</hi> amongst us to some of our Rulers, <hi>Command me some difficult thing, and it shall be done.</hi> And it so, what <hi>difficult thing</hi> is there that we at any time ask, that God cannot do for us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From his <hi>Promise,</hi> Joh. 15. 7. <hi>If. ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you:</hi> the <hi>very same thing</hi> in <hi>kinde,</hi> as well as others; he will never <hi>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in his deed,</hi> what he hath <hi>said in word,</hi> but
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:000111_0136_0FA02CB4E9908C78"/>
                     <hi>fulfill with his hand what he hath spoken with his mouth,</hi> 1. Kin. 8. 24. If he say, <hi>We shall have what we will,</hi> the thing <hi>in kinde</hi> that we ask, this King is not he that can deny it to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath <hi>ordained</hi> us to be fruitful, and that our fruit should <hi>remain, that whatsoever we ask, God may give it to us,</hi> Joh. 15. 16. It hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Apostles and Ministers principally, but yet reacheth <hi>fruitful Christians</hi> also.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From his <hi>Love</hi> that he bears to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 26, 27. A friend that loves him that comes to sue to him, will give him <hi>the same thing</hi> that he desires of him; how much more will our Friend and Father give us <hi>the same thing we ask</hi> of him, if it be good for us? <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. From his <hi>Glory,</hi> which is exalted in giving in kinde <hi>the same thing</hi> that we prayed for. Thus did <hi>Hannah</hi> lift up his Name and Praise, by giving her the <hi>same mercy</hi> that she asked of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. God loseth not in his glory, when we have what we ask of him: it leaves an impression of <hi>thankefulness</hi> upon our spirits.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. From his <hi>Greatness</hi> in his bounty; for when he gives the <hi>same thing we ask,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly gives something more with it: He gave <hi>Solomon wisdome and under standing</hi> which he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he gave him more, he added <hi>Riches and Honour</hi> to it, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 9—13. He gave <hi>Hannah <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> man-childe</hi> that she asked, but something more
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:000111_0137_0FA02CB5D5E8C3C0"/>
also was given, <hi>the barren bare seven,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 5. So <hi>Abraham</hi> desired <hi>an Heir,</hi> and God gave him such a Son of whom Christ should come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers:</hi> 1. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>that</hi> that is <hi>pleasing</hi> to God, 1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he cannot tell how to deny them <hi>that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are willing to <hi>return the blessing</hi> to God again, that he hath given at their desire, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 27, 28. They improve the blessing well, and God cannot but give them <hi>such a blessing</hi> as he gives them an heart to improve for him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ask it <hi>conditionally,</hi> if the Lord see it <hi>good</hi> for them, and if it be his <hi>will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14. and <hi>modest suiters</hi> are often <hi>speeders</hi> with men, much more with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>content</hi> to stay the <hi>Lords time</hi> till the blessing come. <hi>Isaac</hi> waited twenty years for his wives fruitfulness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 20, 26. and they that <hi>so wait,</hi> cannot be denied.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They <hi>believe</hi> the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of what God promiseth upon their Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 4, 5, 6. and Faith will carry all before it, it will get any thing at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They <hi>love the Lord</hi> for giving them what they asked of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 1. <hi>Solomon loved the Lord</hi> that gave him his desire, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Efficacy of Prayer.</hi> 1. It <hi>obtains</hi> any thing at the hands of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. It makes men <hi>Princes with God </hi> to prevail for any thing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="131" facs="unknown:000111_0138_0FA02CB66FAA1A48"/>
2. It is the <hi>Souls Ambassador</hi> to God, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns with <hi>good tidings,</hi> and does negotiate in Heaven for any thing for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is <hi>that</hi> whereby we come <hi>near to God,</hi> Jam. 4. 8. and they that are near the King, may have <hi>in kinde</hi> what they ask of him; much more may we that are near to God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is <hi>that</hi> that hath got <hi>great things</hi> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, as we see in the Prayers of <hi>Moses, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> the <hi>good Prophets</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> that have obtained what they asked: and we go to the <hi>same God</hi> still, and repair to the <hi>same Fountain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It comes into Gods <hi>holy Habitation,</hi> into Heaven, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 27. and there is all to be had that we would; there is a rich Treasury of all we desire.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is <hi>that</hi> that is perfumed with Christs Intercession: <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. His <hi>Incense, offered up with the prayers of all Saints upon the golden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> prevails for any thing: and hence it is that he sayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13, 14. and he repeats it twice, <hi>I will do it, I will do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what <hi>great regard</hi> the Lord hath to the Prayers of his people put up to him, that he will <hi>sometimes</hi> give them <hi>the very same thing</hi> that they ask of him. Prayer of Faith is <hi>that</hi> that is <hi>very pleasing to him,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. and <hi>accepted of him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. or
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:000111_0139_0FA02CB7E1440D60"/>
else he would never give us <hi>in kinde</hi> what we ask of him: it is musick and melody in his ears, or else he would not give us <hi>the same thing</hi> that we desire of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see with what <hi>alacrity</hi> and <hi>chearfulness</hi> we should come before the Lord in Prayer, for we are sure to speed, and sometimes to have <hi>the very thing</hi> that we seek unto him for: it is but <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>have,</hi> and who then would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to pray to him? The little Birds lift up their heads and eyes when they take in a drop or two into their mouthes; Oh how chearfully then should we lift up our eyes to heaven <hi>to the God of Heaven,</hi> that gives us not <hi>drops,</hi> but that thing <hi>in kinde</hi> that we ask of him, out of which we day <hi>drink abundantly, and be satisfied?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what <hi>wrong</hi> they do to themselves, that <hi>restrain prayer before God,</hi> Job 15. 4. they miss of many a fair blessing that they might carry home with them, yea in the things that they desire that they might enjoy: They spare to <hi>speak,</hi> and spare to <hi>speed;</hi> they might have <hi>what they world,</hi> did they bring their Petitions will them: They need <hi>be careful for nothing,</hi> could they <hi>in every thing make their requests known to God,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. Could men but <hi>pray,</hi> and leave their Petitions with the Lord, they might have <hi>what they desire</hi> given in to them; but their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of prayer</hi> before him, causeth a <hi>restraint of
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:000111_0140_0FA02CB8D0750B10"/>
blessings</hi> that might be poured into their bosoms.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that God <hi>mindes</hi> whatever it is that we pray to him for, for he gives sometimes <hi>the very thing</hi> that we ask of him. Princes may sometimes <hi>take</hi> their Suiters Petitions into their hands, but afterward <hi>lay them aside,</hi> and never look into them; but our God does not so but he considers well what we speak in his ears, and grants <hi>the very thing</hi> we pray for. Prayer is of more reckoning with him, then to lay aside the Petitions of his suppliants, and never regard what is contained in them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see how <hi>willing</hi> we should be to grant the desires in kinde that others make to us, if we be able, and have it by us; this is to be <hi>like God himself,</hi> for so does he to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 42. We fall short this way, but we have no such pattern to imitate as God is, and who would not be <hi>like is God?</hi> It is the glory of a man, the more he resembleth the God above; it is an honour to him that comes nearest to him in Workmanship, that is the rarest and choicest Artificer: Oh what is it then to come up to <hi>that perfection</hi> in some measure that is in God himself! it's a rare thing to be a follower of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that if God give us all we ask <hi>in kinde,</hi> then we are to suit our <hi>thanks</hi> according to the <hi>benefits bestowed</hi> upon us. If he hath given us <hi>signal mercies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> so should our <hi>praises</hi> be:
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:000111_0141_0FA02CB97B938E70"/>
we should render to him according to the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits done to us,</hi> Herein <hi>Hezekiah</hi> failed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 24, 25. he <hi>was sick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and prayed unto the Lord, who spake to him, and gave him a sign, but Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah rendred not according to the benefit done to him.</hi> We must take heed of such <hi>Ingratitude:</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens could not bear unthankfulness; <hi>Ingratum si dixeris, omnia dixeris:</hi> Oh how then should God bear it! Our duty is to render <hi>parallel thanks</hi> to Gods, benefits, <hi>signal thanks</hi> for <hi>signal mercies.</hi> It is a shame to be behinde in <hi>thanks</hi> to him, who is so much before-hand in <hi>bounty</hi> to us, in giving us <hi>the same things</hi> we ask of him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see that if God do not give us <hi>alwayes</hi> what we ask, there is some <hi>great cause</hi> for it; either we have <hi>provoked him</hi> so that he will not, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26. or else <hi>it is not good for us,</hi> Psal. 34. 10. &amp; 84. 11. or else he hath some <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blessing</hi> to bestow upon us, as to give <hi>Moses</hi> entrance into the <hi>heavenly Canaan,</hi> though he might not go into <hi>earthly Canaan,</hi> or else he hath at least that to give which is <hi>equivalent,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> that may be every way as conducible to us, as if we had <hi>the thing it self:</hi> but ordinarily, except in <hi>these</hi> and <hi>such like cases,</hi> he gives us <hi>the very thing we ask of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see what <hi>love</hi> we owe to him, for answering our desires in <hi>the kinde of them.</hi> We would love him that gave us our desires that we

asked; what love then should he have! All the <hi>Springs of our love</hi> are too little for him. [<hi>But we spake of that before, and therefore give but a touch of it here.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that if we <hi>inlarge our desires,</hi> and <hi>ask much,</hi> according to that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10. we may have those <hi>large desires</hi> granted, as well as if we asked but <hi>little,</hi> Luke 11. 13. Jer. 33. 3. It is all one with a Prince to <hi>give much,</hi> as well as <hi>little,</hi> and it is more to his honour to give <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> then <hi>sparingly:</hi> Oh what honour is it then to him that ever comes off liberally, and like himself?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We see that if he give <hi>the same things we ask,</hi> he hath not bound his hands, but he can give <hi>more,</hi> even <hi>that</hi> that we have not asked: he did so to <hi>Solomon.</hi> And if we ask the <hi>best things</hi> as he did, we shall have <hi>other things</hi> cast in also, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. We go to one that <hi>hath enough</hi> by him, and that hath <hi>will enough</hi> to come off royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and like a King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to those that <hi>ask not:</hi> If they be full of these <hi>earthly things,</hi> they never desire <hi>better things;</hi> such shall get nothing in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals</hi> and <hi>Eternals</hi> that ask them not, and then what will their <hi>other things</hi> do them good? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation,</hi> that we ask not <hi>enough</hi> in the <hi>best kinde,</hi> for how rich might we best we

                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To give <hi>glory</hi> to him that gives us <hi>the same things</hi> we ask of him, and something addes more; Oh how bountiful a God do we make our addresses to! his <hi>hand is full,</hi> and so should our <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>mouthes</hi> be of his praise.</p>

7. In <hi>self-loathing,</hi> and <hi>self-abhorrency,</hi> Ezek. 36. 31. Job 42. 6. This argues an humble heart, when we can loath our selves, and abhorre our selves by provoking of him.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Why are we thus to be humble in our addresses to him?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From our selves. 3. From the Petitions we make to him.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>a great God, and a great King above all gods,</hi> Psa. 47. 2. &amp; 95. 3. Mal. 1. 14. <hi>I am a great King, saith the Lord of Hosts:</hi> and does not <hi>humility</hi> then well become them, that come before such a <hi>great One</hi> as he is?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>our Maker,</hi> Psal. 95. 6,7. and should we not be <hi>humble</hi> before our Maker? He made us <hi>at first,</hi> and hath made us <hi>again,</hi> when we had defaced his first workmanship, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. and the <hi>second gift</hi> is greater then the first. <hi>In primo opere me mihi dedit, in secundo se:</hi> sayes <hi>Bernard;</hi> and such a <hi>Makers love</hi> is to be humbly adored.</p>

5. He <hi>delights in humble ones,</hi> looks with an eye of <hi>favour</hi> to such, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. and should not this <hi>humble us</hi> in his sight? Humble suiters with <hi>men</hi> are <hi>most in favor,</hi> much more with the <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>hears the desires of the humble,</hi> Psa. 10. 17. and therefore we may well think it behoves us to be humble.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From our selves.</hi> 1. We are <hi>low</hi> in our <hi>Original,</hi> Gen. 3. 19. &amp; 2. 7. and it's good to think of <hi>that</hi> to <hi>abase</hi> us, and lay us <hi>low before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are <hi>low</hi> in our <hi>condition</hi> whither we are to go, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Job</hi> 25. 6. and can we look at <hi>proud dust</hi> without blushing?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are <hi>viler</hi> then the <hi>vilest of the creatures</hi> by reason of sin, <hi>Job</hi> 40. 4.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Petitions themselves:</hi> 1. They are for <hi>great things,</hi> and therefore it becomes us to be <hi>humble</hi> in suing for such great

things. <hi>A portion in Christ, Inheritance in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Pardon of sin, Peace of Conscience, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God, &amp;c.</hi> these are great things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are for <hi>good things,</hi> Mat. 7. 11. and we should be humble in asking such things. How good is the <hi>Favour of God,</hi> and <hi>Assurance of his Love, Justification? &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are for <hi>rare things,</hi> that but a few partake of: we pray for <hi>Salvation,</hi> and that's a rare thing, there are <hi>few saved,</hi> Mat. 7. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>wonderful things</hi> that we ask, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 3. and such things are to be <hi>humbly prayed for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>precious things</hi> that we ask; <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>holy Spirit, Grace, Glory:</hi> these are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things, and therefore we are to ask them humbly.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>whatsoever we will</hi> that we may have a grant of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 22. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7. and therefore it well becomes us to ask such things in an humble manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see that they that are of a <hi>proud spirit</hi> when they come to pray before the Lord, cannot expect that their Prayers should be accepted; for <hi>humility</hi> is that that God looks for, and that which well becomes us when we pray to him.

the <hi>old man,</hi> and it is not comely to be seen in rags before such a King as the Lord is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see a reason why Prayer is called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,</hi> Psal. 141. 2. Mal. 1. 11. The Incense was to be <hi>beaten small,</hi> Exod. 30. 36. and by the beating of it very small, was shadowed out the <hi>humility</hi> and <hi>contrition</hi> of our hearts in Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that <hi>Confession of sin</hi> is one of the chief ingredients that Prayer is to consist of, for therein we chiefly humble our selves in coming before the Lord in Prayer, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 40,41,42. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks much of it in his Prayer, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. and we cannot be too serious in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that Popish Prayers according to the number of their <hi>Beads,</hi> which they do so glory in, are of no account with God, because they <hi>trust in them,</hi> and come not from the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their hearts; for <hi>He resisteth the proud, but gives grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5. The more <hi>humble</hi> we be when we pray, the more <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> we may expect from him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that <hi>without faith</hi> there's no put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up an humble Prayer. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith made him pray so <hi>humbly:</hi> So that woman of <hi>Canaans faith</hi> was that that <hi>humbled</hi> her heart in Prayer, that she <hi>fell at Christs feet.</hi> It was the Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>faith</hi> that made him confess that he was not worthy that Christ <hi>should come under his Roof,</hi> and that he was not worthy <hi>to come to him,</hi> Luke
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:000111_0169_0FA02CEDFA471140"/>
7. 6,7. Faith is an <hi>humbling grace,</hi> and the more of it we bring with us in Prayer, the more <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> decks that Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see a reason of that In Psal. 51. 17. <hi>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, &amp;c.</hi> and that in Psal. 34. 18. <hi>The Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart:</hi> It must needs be so, for they pray in humility of heart before him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see that they that are truly godly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be <hi>humble</hi> in Prayer, it is their property, and they look at it as their <hi>duty</hi> so to be.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see that they that <hi>flant</hi> it in their Prayers with quaint words, and curious expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, they know not what <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>godliness</hi> mean: it's ill in Preaching so to do, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1,2,4. but much worse in Prayer. Eloquent Beggars are not regarded by men, much less <hi>flanting Beggars</hi> before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Reproof:</hi>1. Of those that use such gestures in Prayer, as favour not of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reverence, <hi>sitting, sleeping, gazing upon vain objects;</hi> some have much to answer for the two latter: both which argue <hi>high contempt of God,</hi> and (being frequent) <hi>great profaneness</hi> of heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Against those that <hi>confess not</hi> their own vileness and unworthiness, nor so <hi>abase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> as <hi>humble Suppliants</hi> ought.</p>

                  <p n="5">5.

6. It consists in <hi>asking great things of him:</hi> That man is <hi>bold</hi> with his Prince, that desires <hi>great things</hi> of him, as sometimes a Prince's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite will, thus <hi>bold</hi> may Believers be with God, they may ask great things of God, even the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> himself, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>What manner of boldness is it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Believers may be bold with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. An <hi>humble boldness;</hi> they may be <hi>humbly bold</hi> with him. <hi>Abraham</hi> takes upon him to <hi>speak to the Lord,</hi> but acknowledgeth in an humble manner that he is but <hi>dust and ashes.</hi> Petitioners that are <hi>bold</hi> with their Princes, yet they ask upon their knees for what they have a desire to have: So here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>familiar boldness;</hi> we may be <hi>fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly bold</hi> with him. <hi>Abraham</hi> familiarly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with God,</hi> and God with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 33.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>reverend boldness:</hi> we pray to him as to a <hi>Father,</hi> and therefore must give him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, as other Children do to their Fathers Heb. 12. 28. <hi>Let us have grace, whereby we may serve him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is a <hi>comely boldness;</hi> we must not be rude in his Presence, but pray in <hi>comely manner,</hi> be seeming the Presence of the great God. They that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> manner,</hi> and according to the Majesty they come before: So must we, we may be <hi>bold</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="unknown:000111_0174_0FA02CF1AA8BAD88"/>
with the Lord in praying to him, but so as to consider <hi>who</hi> we are before, and <hi>who</hi> we have to deal with: we do it so as becomes such a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty as God is. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he was <hi>bold,</hi> but he was not <hi>rude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a <hi>boldness</hi> that keeps it's <hi>distance. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was <hi>bold</hi> with the Lord, but looks at him as <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as the Lord infinitely above him that was vile and base, <hi>dust and ashes:</hi> So may we be <hi>bold</hi> in praying to him, but look that we know our <hi>distance,</hi> we must look at God as <hi>he is,</hi> and look at our selves as we are.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>boldness</hi> that <hi>exalts Gods grace,</hi> that we may be so bold with him. <hi>Abraham,</hi> in all the <hi>boldness</hi> that he used, aimed at this, that the grace of God might be <hi>exalted,</hi> in not destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but sparing <hi>Sodom,</hi> that wicked place and people: Such should our <hi>boldness</hi> be.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is an <hi>holy boldness:</hi> Abraham <hi>does not, dares not</hi> ask any thing that is dishonourable to the Name of God, but though he <hi>take upon him to speak to the Lord,</hi> yet it is an <hi>holy boldness;</hi> he requests for nothing but that that may well stand with <hi>holiness</hi> to desire, and with Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness to <hi>grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is a <hi>boldness full of love</hi> to those we pray for: <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>bold</hi> with God, but his <hi>love</hi> carried him out to make so bold with him; he was earnestly desirous that <hi>Sodom</hi> might be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000111_0175_0FA02CF266514F98"/>
and it was out of tender <hi>love</hi> to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that he thought might be amongst them.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 3. <hi>Why may Believers be thus bold with God in praying to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themselves.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He hath bidden us <hi>come with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath given Christ Jesus to be a <hi>great High Priest,</hi> and one that is tenderly <hi>sensible of our infirmities,</hi> and therefore encourageth us to be bold in our suits to him, <hi>ver.</hi> 14,15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath shewed himself <hi>willing</hi> to hear Prayer; as here to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so Psal. 65. 2. <hi>O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath promised that we shall <hi>obtain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. We shall not lose our labour, but have what we come for at the best time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers:</hi> 1. They are <hi>friends of God,</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore may be <hi>bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They shall have <hi>all that they ask in Christs Name,</hi> Mat. 21. 22. John 16. 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have <hi>an Advocate with the Father</hi> to plead for them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 2. and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:000111_0176_0FA02CF3997209C0"/>
their prayers with his <hi>intercession,</hi> Rev. 8. 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>near to him,</hi> and therefore may be <hi>bold</hi> with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. 14.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They <hi>delight him,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. Cant. 2. 14. and therefore may be <hi>bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>better</hi> to him then all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, though never so costly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>come up as a memorial</hi> before him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>spirituall sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may well be <hi>bold</hi> with him in our <hi>prayers</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi> Believers are to God, seeing they may be so <hi>bold with him</hi> in the Prayers that they put up to him. They that are bold with Princes, as Favourites be, are the <hi>delights</hi> of those Princes, else they durst not be so bold with them: So Believers must needs be <hi>Gods delight,</hi> seeing they are and may be so bold with him in praying to him: Cant. 7. 6. <hi>How fair and pleasant art thou, O love, for delights?</hi> Hence it is that the Lord calls his Church <hi>Hephzibah, My delight is in her;</hi> and <hi>Beaulah,</hi> that is, <hi>Married: for as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom delighteth over his Bride, so he delighteth over his people,</hi> lsa. 62. 4,5. They have his heart, and are his <hi>delight,</hi> they are the <hi>desire of his eyes,</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="unknown:000111_0177_0FA02CF3E9860CF8"/>
and that which his heart is set upon: It is so with a mans wife, and much more with Believers that are espoused and married to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what great <hi>honour</hi> God puts upon Believers, that are and may be so <hi>bold with him.</hi> Every one may not be bold with a King, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent their Suits and Supplications before him; they are <hi>honourable ones,</hi> and such as he <hi>delighteth to honour,</hi> that may be so bold as to take upon them to speak to him: Oh how honourable then are <hi>they</hi> in the sight of God, and how does he delight to honour Believers, that take the <hi>boldness</hi> to take upon them to <hi>speak to the Lord?</hi> They are the Noble ones, and the great Peers of his Kingdome, how-ever they be <hi>little</hi> in their own eyes, and style themselves but <hi>dust and ashes,</hi> yet they are <hi>great</hi> in his account, and he styles them <hi>Excellent,</hi> and <hi>Honourable ones,</hi> Psa. 16. 2,3. and Prov. 12. 26. farre above other men: they are the <hi>Grandees</hi> in his Court and Kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that when they come to <hi>glory,</hi> they will be farre greater then now they are: for here their honour is much veiled by fin, they are <hi>black,</hi> and <hi>the Sun hath looked upon them,</hi> and their honour is <hi>stained</hi> by the afflictions they suffer; the Devil and the World cast all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour they can upon them, as they did upon Christ Jesus, as he sayes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 49. but God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours them <hi>here,</hi> and if so, much more will he
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:000111_0178_0FA02CF4B0F10998"/>
honour them when they come in Heaven. Here they are <hi>bold with God,</hi> and it is their honour so to be; but no honour like to <hi>that,</hi> when they shall be <hi>ever with him,</hi> and <hi>see his face,</hi> and by that Beatifical Vision shall be <hi>made like to him,</hi> and <hi>bear the Image</hi> of the heavenly one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 49.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see how marvellously the Lord <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descends</hi> to <hi>dust and ashes,</hi> that they that have <hi>that style</hi> may be so bold with him, as to <hi>take upon them to speak to the Lord:</hi> Oh how <hi>low</hi> does he stoop to such! no <hi>humility</hi> like his. This is not the manner of men, this is not the manner of great Princes to come thus low; but <hi>God</hi> would <hi>teach them,</hi> and <hi>teach us all,</hi> to condescend and become low, and shews himself a <hi>pattern of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> that we may be the more ashamed of our pride, and learn to stoop of such a great one as he is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 113.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see a reason why some Believers have made so <hi>bold</hi> with some great men in some cases, and have spoken so freely to them, as <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n.</hi> 3. 16. &amp; 5. 17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 7,8,9. &amp; 25. 16. They that may be so <hi>bold with God,</hi> and take upon them to <hi>speak to him,</hi> may be bold much more with men, when called to it: if with the <hi>potter,</hi> then with the <hi>clay;</hi> if with the <hi>great God</hi> in our suits to him, much more with the <hi>greatest of men,</hi> when there's cause for it.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:000111_0179_0FA02CF58CE44330"/>
6. We see that when at <hi>any time</hi> we are to pray to him, we should alwayes bear this in our minde, That we go to <hi>a gracious King,</hi> and <hi>a kinde Father,</hi> and therefore may be humbly and and reverendly bold with him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. We do not go to a Prince that will terrifie us with his <hi>looks,</hi> that will fright us with his <hi>words,</hi> that will drive us from his <hi>presence;</hi> but to such an one as does <hi>encourage us</hi> to be <hi>bold with him</hi> in Christs Name. He is <hi>that Friend</hi> at Court, that we are more bold then welcome, and that he will see to it that we shall have a gracious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13,14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to Unbelievers; they are no friends of God, and therefore <hi>cannot be bold with him;</hi> they have no acquaintance with him, but are strangers and enemies to him, and how should they take upon them to <hi>speak to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation:</hi> 1. That we are <hi>too rude,</hi> and come with less reverence then becomes us in his Presence with whom we have to do: so do <hi>rude children</hi> to their Father, and get a check for it, and so do we to our <hi>Father;</hi> let it <hi>shame us,</hi> or else we shall be sure of a check for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To those that <hi>may be bold,</hi> and <hi>da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To <hi>prize Faith,</hi> that makes us <hi>bold with God,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1.

He hath put a <hi>Royal spirit</hi> in <hi>giving</hi> into some men, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Ask on, my Mother,</hi> (sayes <hi>Solomon) for I will not say thee nay.</hi> So 1 Kings 10. 13. <hi>He gave the Queen of Sheba all she asked, besides what he gave her of his royall bounty.</hi> See <hi>Esth.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. 2. and if so, he will never come short of men in royalty and bounty in <hi>giving,</hi> and therefore we are not to rest in <hi>one grant,</hi> but sue for more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He knows that we have <hi>many wants,</hi> and when <hi>one</hi> is supplied, we need <hi>another,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> to that, and so on to a <hi>multitude;</hi> and <hi>many troubles</hi> to be removed, and therefore when we sue for <hi>one,</hi> and have it granted, we must sue for <hi>more:</hi> we are <hi>poor and afflicted</hi> many wayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 6,19. and therefore must go on in our suits, and ask more.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="176" facs="unknown:000111_0183_0FA02CF90D2DE6C0"/>
7. He is pleased when he sees us again and again to <hi>renew our Requests</hi> to him: He is not like some men, that make it an argument why they will not give again, because they have <hi>given once,</hi> Jam. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. He hath an <hi>inexhaustible Treasure,</hi> that by the renewall of our suits, and asking more, we cannot <hi>draw dry.</hi> He hath a <hi>rich Myne</hi> by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12. He is a <hi>full one</hi> that commands all blessings both in temporal and spiritual things, Psal. 50. 1 Pet. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. Their <hi>faith</hi> is hereby <hi>strengthned.</hi> Judg. 6. 37—40. <hi>Gideons</hi> faith in Gods deliverance of <hi>Israel</hi> by his hand, was <hi>strengthned</hi> by his <hi>second Request</hi> that he made to God concerning the fleece: and the <hi>faith</hi> of Gods Servants needs <hi>strengthning;</hi> even the Disciples of Christ were men of <hi>weak faith,</hi> Mark 4. 40. so that Christ could not tell how to put the name of <hi>Faith</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their thankfulness is hereby more and more <hi>inlarged.</hi> The more Petitions any make to a Prince, the more full of <hi>Thanks</hi> they come off with when they are granted. Now <hi>thanksgiving</hi> is <hi>Heavenly work, Angelical, Seraphical work,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> that God is <hi>glorified by,</hi> Psal. 50. 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They do <hi>gain,</hi> and <hi>gather</hi> upon God by renewing their suits: so did <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ever
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:000111_0184_0FA02CF922DED588"/>
in his <hi>renewed Requests</hi> got something, and went away a <hi>gainer.</hi> A new Petition to a Prince by one in favour gains something: so Believers upon every renewed Petition shall finde themselves to go away with something. Even the poor at the doors that come <hi>often,</hi> lose not their labour, but get something, are not sent empty away; how much less then will God deny his poor ones that renew their requests to him? <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are the <hi>more welcome</hi> the oftner they come. Men may be <hi>weary of us</hi> the oftner we come to them: <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 17. <hi>Withdraw thy foot</hi> (sayes <hi>Solomon) from thy neighbours house, left he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</hi> A man that comes <hi>seldome</hi> shall be welcome to another, but if he come <hi>often</hi> he will but be a burthen: but it is not so with those that go <hi>often</hi> before the <hi>Lord,</hi> they are ever <hi>most welcome to him</hi> that come with <hi>new Requests</hi> oftnest before him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They become <hi>more dutiful and obedient to him,</hi> if their renewed Suits be granted. So it is with all that <hi>sue at Court,</hi> how obsequious and dutiful will they be? and so it is with those that renew their Suits at the Throne of Grace; <hi>I am thy servant, I am thy servant,</hi> will each of them say, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 16. not in a Complemental-way, as sometimes they do at Court; but in a serious way, so as <hi>dutiful servants</hi> ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They do by often coming <hi>increase their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:000111_0185_0FA02CFC1ED0DEC8"/>
with God,</hi> and this is <hi>that</hi> that he likes <hi>well</hi> of, <hi>Job</hi> 22. 21. and we may well <hi>delight</hi> in; for no acquaintance like his.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They by coming before God, and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their requests to him, shew forth <hi>the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatness of their love to those they pray for:</hi> and that the Lord is much <hi>delighted with,</hi> who is <hi>Love it self,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They do by renewing their Suits to him, <hi>acknowledge his Bounty and Grace;</hi> and that he is able to give <hi>abundant supply</hi> to us in what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of him: and that cannot but be <hi>well-pleasing to him.</hi> Princes are well pleased when they are looked at as <hi>bountiful</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> to their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants: so is God when his <hi>Grace is exalted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what a <hi>bountiful God</hi> we go to, that gives us leave to come before him with <hi>new Requests,</hi> after he hath granted <hi>that</hi> that we <hi>asked before</hi> of him. Men are oftentimes <hi>niggards,</hi> and if they have done <hi>something,</hi> they <hi>cease giving:</hi> but our God is <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral,</hi> and <hi>gives liberally to all, and upbraids not,</hi> Jam. 1. 5. When we have gone <hi>once,</hi> and got what we <hi>asked of him,</hi> we may come <hi>again:</hi> and this Believers know, and therefore are encouraged to come again, and sue for more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that the <hi>more faith</hi> any man hath, the <hi>more bold he may be with God,</hi> to put up <hi>new Requests</hi> to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a <hi>great Believer,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:000111_0186_0FA02CFC44BD39F0"/>
and his <hi>faith</hi> puts him upon a <hi>new suit,</hi> after the <hi>old was granted.</hi> What may not Believers have? and therefore they will put in for it. <hi>Faith</hi> will fetch in any thing that a man would have: <hi>All things are possible to him that beleeveth,</hi> Mar. 9. 23. and therefore the Believer will go on in his suits, and <hi>ask more</hi> after a <hi>former grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that it is lawful to covet after more of the <hi>good things</hi> that God vouchsafes to give when we make our Requests to him. To covet after <hi>earthly things inordinately</hi> is sin to those that <hi>set their hearts upon them,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. but to desire of God <hi>other things,</hi> and to <hi>ask more,</hi> after we have already got <hi>some of our Requests granted,</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that we may do, and is an high <hi>Encomium</hi> of our Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that <hi>one gift</hi> received from God makes way for <hi>another;</hi> the Believer takes it as a <hi>pledge</hi> that he shall have more. We presume upon a friend sometimes that hath done <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> at our asking, that he will do <hi>more;</hi> much more may we relie upon God when he does <hi>any thing</hi> at our request, that he will do <hi>more.</hi> One favour begets another: When once God is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with</hi> to do <hi>something</hi> at our request, we may binde upon it that he will do <hi>more,</hi> and so take courage to <hi>renew our suits.</hi> So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see what our case is here in this world,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:000111_0187_0FA02CFD73433EC8"/>
we are alwayes <hi>wanting something,</hi> either for our selves or others; and when we have got a grant of <hi>one thing,</hi> we need <hi>another,</hi> and must renew our suits. We are made up of <hi>wants,</hi> and when we get <hi>one supplied,</hi> another <hi>looks us in the face,</hi> and bespeaks a <hi>new Request</hi> to be put up to the Lord for a <hi>fresh supply.</hi> This is our case and state while we are in this world; as our <hi>troubles</hi> are many here, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 19. so are our <hi>wants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that Believers know <hi>where supply is to be had,</hi> and therefore they go to God to make <hi>a new supply.</hi> He is a <hi>Fountain</hi> that they repair unto; a <hi>Spring</hi> that is never drawn dry; a <hi>Well</hi> that is ever full: and therefore if our pitchers have been filled <hi>once,</hi> they may be filled <hi>again.</hi> We know where we have had a <hi>good dole once,</hi> and it is but <hi>going again.</hi> Thus a Believer argues with himself: I have fared well <hi>once,</hi> and will <hi>try again;</hi> I have drunk at the <hi>Well,</hi> and have had my <hi>fill,</hi> and will <hi>go again</hi> for a fresh supply; the <hi>Spring</hi> is <hi>yet open,</hi> and I will <hi>repair thither again:</hi> God is able to grant me <hi>one Request</hi> as well as <hi>another,</hi> and therefore I will seek to him yet again.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see what <hi>longings</hi> we should have for <hi>Heaven,</hi> where <hi>all our wants</hi> shall be supplied. Here, after we have had <hi>one mercy,</hi> we must have <hi>another;</hi> after we have had <hi>one grant,</hi> we must plead to get <hi>another</hi> but there all shall be <hi>made
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:000111_0188_0FA02CFDB60BA9B0"/>
up,</hi> and we shall never know what <hi>wants</hi> mean more. We are there at the <hi>Spring-head</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, sucking in and drinking abundantly of that <hi>Eternal Fountain,</hi> which shall satisfie us to all Eternity. The <hi>blessed Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified. Souls</hi> feel no <hi>wants,</hi> they are fully satiate and replenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God; and so shall we when we come thither, <hi>Psal.</hi>17. 15.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see how good it is to be in a <hi>believing state,</hi> for such can go to God and get a grant, and go again <hi>for more,</hi> and so <hi>gain upon God</hi> by suing to him. <hi>Faith</hi> is an <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>precious grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1. that can, when <hi>one suit</hi> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, bring in <hi>another;</hi> it is a <hi>Christians boldness,</hi> and makes him bold to bring <hi>fresh suits</hi> into the presence of the Holy One.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that the Lord must needs be <hi>much taken</hi> with a believing Suppliant, that is <hi>unwearied</hi> in making his addresses to him. It <hi>delights</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see a childe <hi>often asking</hi> something or other of him: so does our <hi>renewed suit</hi> delight God. <hi>Faith</hi> is that <hi>one eye that ravisheth Christs heart,</hi> Cant. 4. 9.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We see that the <hi>more</hi> we come with <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed suits</hi> to the Throne of Grace, the nearer we come to <hi>resemble Abrahams faith;</hi> for so did he, when he had obtained <hi>something,</hi> he renews his request for <hi>more;</hi> therein he shewed <hi>his faith:</hi> and in so doing we shall <hi>walk in the steps</hi> of that
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000111_0189_0FA02CFF32ED4AE0"/>
                     <hi>faith</hi> of his, and be like him <hi>who is the father of us all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to Unbelievers; They get nothing in <hi>spiritual things,</hi> and therefore have no encouragement to come again to renew their suits: <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 31. <hi>God heareth not sinners.</hi> So Psal. 66. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation</hi> to those that <hi>slack this duty</hi> of <hi>renewing their suits. Job</hi> 15. 4. There are those that <hi>restrain prayer before God:</hi> What? should we have <hi>something done for us,</hi> and not be encouraged to <hi>go again?</hi> God forbid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To be <hi>thankeful to the Lord,</hi> who (as he gives us <hi>leave</hi>) so gives us <hi>hearts</hi> to renew our suits; and having got <hi>something,</hi> to ask <hi>more.</hi> Poor ones would be thankful to men for this, much more should we be thankful to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>honour Believers,</hi> that are so <hi>honoured of God</hi> that they <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> bring <hi>new Requests</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. These are <hi>they</hi> that are in <hi>favour with God;</hi> and if Kings Favourites be <hi>honoured,</hi> much more should these.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To <hi>pity those</hi> that <hi>get nothing,</hi> neither care whether they do or no; that <hi>cannot pray,</hi> nor will not set about the <hi>duty</hi> in a serious way: these will never <hi>ask for more,</hi> because they <hi>get nothing,</hi> Jam. 1. 6,7. Proud Beggars when sent <hi>empty away,</hi> will come no more: so here.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="183" facs="unknown:000111_0190_0FA02CFFEDE2B058"/>
4. To <hi>love Jesus Christ,</hi> through whom we get a grant of our <hi>Requests,</hi> and are encouraged to <hi>ask more,</hi> and renew our suits, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To <hi>long</hi> to be at the <hi>Well-head,</hi> and that <hi>everlasting Spring</hi> that will make a <hi>full supply</hi> of all our spiritual wants, when we shall enjoy what we desired here, and farre more.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Till we come to the <hi>blessed satisfaction</hi> that we shall have in glory, let us be exhorted to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our Requests daily,</hi> and having sped well in <hi>some of our suits,</hi> let us <hi>ask more.</hi> We go to a <hi>full Fountain,</hi> to a <hi>rich Treasure,</hi> that (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 19.) can <hi>supply all our wants by Jesus Christ.</hi>

former, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.39,40. He knows how to make <hi>new grants,</hi> as well as other Princes do. If Kings Subjects renew their <hi>Requests,</hi> and get <hi>renewed Grants,</hi> then <hi>his</hi> faithful Subjects much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From his believing Suiters and Suppliants. 3. From the Grants themselves.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord himself.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Rom. 10. 12. and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough by him, how can he but <hi>renew his grants,</hi> and give more when we sue and seek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for it. Rich men give according to their quality and condition; so God that is <hi>rich in mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a great King,</hi> Mal. 1. 14. and will give according to the state of a King: and they (<hi>as I said</hi>) that are Kings on earth, stick not at <hi>renewed Grants;</hi> and how then should he that is <hi>the great King over all the earth?</hi> Psal. 47. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His <hi>Mercies are new every morning,</hi> Lam. 3. 23. the Sun is not oftner seen by us, then his <hi>Mercies;</hi> they look us in the face <hi>every day.</hi> The Light of the day does no more fail us, then his <hi>mercies</hi> do. The Morning is not oftner renewed upon us, then his <hi>mercies</hi> are: and therefore what new grant is there greater then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that we may not have from him, if we seek it of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He treads never a step, but <hi>that</hi> that is
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000111_0192_0FA02D018E8D4010"/>
                     <hi>paved</hi> with mercy: <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy to them that fear him, and to them that keep his Covenant,</hi> Psal. 25. 10. His <hi>paths</hi> that he comes in towards us in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,</hi> they are all beset and bespread with <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and therefore what <hi>new mercy</hi> it is that we would have, and what more then formerly we have had for our selves or others, he is willing to give in to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath <hi>commanded</hi> us not to <hi>withhold from others that which is their due, when it is in the power of our hand to do it,</hi> Prov. 3. 27. and if so, then sure he will not withhold any thing from us, if we seek it of him, though it be <hi>new,</hi> seeing it is in the power of his hand to do it. He would not be out-bidden and out-vied by man; he would not fall short (in a way of kindness and goodness) of any of the sons of men.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> Psal. 65. 2. he is alwayes at it. Other Princes have their times appointed to hear their Suiters, their <hi>set times</hi> and <hi>dayes of audience</hi> to hear Ambassadors; but God is <hi>alwayes</hi> hearing his Suiters: and be it that our Prayers be the <hi>Souls Ambassadors,</hi> yet he puts them not off, but is <hi>alwayes hearing;</hi> and therefore what <hi>new Requests</hi> we come with, we may get a grant from him of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From his believing Suppliants:</hi> 1. They are his <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> he is <hi>King of
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:000111_0193_0FA02D02ED6BDA78"/>
Saints,</hi> Rev. 15. 3. and Loyal and faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may get their Grants renewed, much more may his.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>his Servants,</hi> Psal. 116. 16. and Servants of Princes, such as they are that are of the Bed-chamber, as they are <hi>wise</hi> to take their time to renew their suits, so they have the Kings ear, and a new Grant <hi>signed</hi> and <hi>sealed</hi> to them: and shall the Servants of God fare worse then the Servants of Princes?

He is a rich Prince, and so full of royalty, that he will give us our asking, though we desire more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

                  <p n="2">2. We see what great <hi>encouragements</hi> we have to <hi>renew our suits,</hi> and to ask more; for God is willing to renew his grants as we do our suits, and if we would have something more then we desired at first, he is very willing to come off to us, and to give us more. Would any Prince on earth so do, his Court would be full of suiters, they would press in for <hi>audience,</hi> and fill his doors, and be much encouraged to come: Oh how full of suiters should the Court of Heaven then be, and what encouragement should they take to <hi>ask more,</hi> and to come with <hi>new suits,</hi> that have such a God to go to that will <hi>give more</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we ask, and <hi>renew grants</hi> as we do our suits, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 3.</p>

3. We see how truly he is styled <hi>A God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer,</hi> Psal. 65. 2. that does thus <hi>renew grants</hi> to his humble suppliants desires: his ears are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <hi>open</hi> to their desires. Princes cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attend the suits of their Subjects, they have somewhat else to do: but God, though he be working other wayes, <hi>creating work,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential work,</hi> yet he hath an <hi>hearing ear</hi> to all our supplications, and is not wearied out with our suits, though <hi>renewed,</hi> nor is his <hi>bounty spent,</hi> though we <hi>ask more</hi> of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p n="5">5. We see what <hi>renewed obedience</hi> we should <hi>chearfully perform</hi> to him that renews his grants according to our suits. <hi>New obedience,</hi> as it is <hi>most acceptable,</hi> so it is <hi>most suitable</hi> to come off with for <hi>new grants</hi> and <hi>new favours:</hi> as it is <hi>that</hi> that God requires, and prefers <hi>above sacrifice,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22,23. so it is <hi>that</hi> that is <hi>meet to he given</hi> to the Lord. <hi>New bounties</hi> from

It's said of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that <hi>walked constantly with God,</hi> Gen. 5. 22. and followed his suits hard, that <hi>he had this testimony, that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. and so it is with them that <hi>come again,</hi> they are <hi>welcome,</hi> and that puts them upon coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information. 1. We see that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are restless</hi> in their motions towards the Lord; they are like the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> that cannot stand still: Though they have <hi>got much</hi> at the Lords hands by bringing their suits <hi>before him,</hi> yet they <hi>cannot rest there,</hi> but must try the Lord yet further, and get <hi>something more;</hi> their Suits must <hi>go on,</hi> their Prayers must not have <hi>bounds</hi> set to them, but when new grants have been made, yet they must pray further, and speak <hi>yet again,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did. That man that ceaseth Prayer, though he <hi>hath got much,</hi> walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in <hi>the steps of the faith of Abraham,</hi> or at least <hi>keeps not pace with him</hi> in a way believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that Believers have <hi>great interest in God,</hi> for they make <hi>many suits to him;</hi> yea, when they have <hi>got much,</hi> yet cannot stop there, but will <hi>ask for more,</hi> and try the Lord for <hi>more grace</hi> be given in to them. Great is their interest in

princes that can do so, and such and much more is Believers interest in the Lord: God is <hi>theirs,</hi> and therefore they are emboldened to ask so much of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 94. &amp; 118. 28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that they that <hi>sit still,</hi> and quiet themselves in <hi>grace received,</hi> and do not <hi>come again</hi> as need is, but <hi>restrain prayer,</hi> as <hi>they cast off fear,</hi> Job 15. 4. so they are not of the <hi>faith of Abraham,</hi> for though he had suit after suit <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> yet he <hi>sued still,</hi> and spake <hi>yet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that a Believers <hi>restless motion</hi> in praying, comes near <hi>Angelical work;</hi> for, the <hi>Angels cease not night nor day in praising God,</hi> Rev. 4. and Believers here cease not to <hi>call upon God;</hi> and though they <hi>have obtained much,</hi> yet they <hi>rest not there,</hi> but must have more: and who would not be like <hi>the Angels?</hi> who would not follow those <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see what <hi>longing desires</hi> we should have to be in Heaven; where we shall be alwayes in his Presence, and never cease <hi>serving of him,</hi> Rev 22. 3,4. Here we do <hi>something</hi> like the service of God <hi>there,</hi> in that we <hi>cease not our suits to him;</hi> onely here is the difference; that what we do <hi>here</hi> is <hi>imperfect service,</hi> and we have our <hi>clogs</hi> and <hi>hindrances</hi> in what we <hi>best do,</hi> but in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as

we shall be more <hi>constant,</hi> so we shall never be <hi>interrupted</hi> in our service, nor have any <hi>clog</hi> or <hi>hindrance</hi> at all: and therefore we should <hi>long</hi> for that <hi>blessed</hi> place, where we shall have <hi>restless motions</hi> in what we do for him <hi>there,</hi> and shall never cease serving him with all our strength and might.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that Faith is <hi>an active grace,</hi> it is upon the <hi>wing,</hi> it is upon the <hi>suit for,</hi> and <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of grace</hi> and <hi>mercy:</hi> though it hath <hi>got much,</hi> yet it is still busie, and slacks not its pace, but hastes to the <hi>Kings Court</hi> to make more <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,</hi> to present more <hi>supplications at the Throne of Grace.</hi> It is an <hi>operative grace,</hi> its never <hi>idle,</hi> but ever at work, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Remembring your work of faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see that Believers are <hi>the praying men,</hi> and are the most incessant in that duty. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may call upon God for a time, but they will soon give out; <hi>Will he alwayes call upon God?</hi> sayes. <hi>Job,</hi> Job 27. 10. but sound Believers <hi>hold out</hi> in Prayer, and when they have been heard, God, shall hear of them again, and they have something to say further to him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here, that <hi>spake yet gain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see that the Lord <hi>condescends very much</hi> to Believers, that gives them leave to come so frequently into his Presence, and to bring suit after suit before him. This is not the manner

of men, this is not the manner of Princes, but God does thus, and there's none <hi>like to him,</hi> in so <hi>humbling himself</hi> in admitting us to come so often into his presence to ask more of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 113. 5,6.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to those that <hi>faint,</hi> and <hi>give out</hi> in Prayer, as Hypocrites do. <hi>Abraham</hi> here teacheth them another thing, he brings suit after suit before the Lord; and though he was heard, and his requests were granted, yet he rests not in what he had obtained, but seeks for more favour, and <hi>speaks yet again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation</hi> to those of the <hi>Saints</hi> that are too apt to <hi>faint,</hi> when they get not a <hi>speedy answer;</hi> or if they do, <hi>rest</hi> in what they <hi>have,</hi> and seek no further. <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Believer, did not so, but he goes on in his suit for more, and so should all that would be <hi>blessed with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To <hi>blush</hi> at our <hi>sparing to speak;</hi> we deprive our selves of many a fair blessing that we might be loaden with, and carry home in our laps with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To trace <hi>Abrahams steps</hi> here, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have got formerly, let us follow our suit still, we shall be sure to be no losers by it. We can never draw the <hi>Fount in</hi> dry.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From Believers. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From God.</hi> 1. He <hi>faint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th not, neither is weary,</hi> Isa. 40. 28. and if in other respects he <hi>fainteth not, neither is weary,</hi> then he is not <hi>weary</hi> in granting the desires of his people, though they come often before him to ask more of him. The <hi>unjust judge</hi> said that the <hi>widow</hi> by her <hi>often coming</hi> would <hi>weary him,</hi> Luke 18. 5. but God is not weary, how many Petitions soever they put up to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath <hi>commanded</hi> us that we should <hi>pray and not faint,</hi> Luke 18. 1. 1 Thess. 5. 17. and if he would not have us <hi>faint</hi> in Prayer, then much less will <hi>he faint,</hi> and be weary in attending to the voice of our frequent Requests to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaseth strength,</hi> Isa. 40. 29. and therefore cannot be weary himself when we pray to him, though we should <hi>ask,</hi> and <hi>ask again,</hi> and put up many Petitions to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>delighteth in our prayers,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. and how then can he be weary to grant our requests
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:000111_0209_0FA02C0E6FD0FF50"/>
which he <hi>delights in.</hi> There may be a kinde of <hi>weariness</hi> attending other <hi>delights of sinful men,</hi> but what the holy God <hi>delights in,</hi> he cannot be weary of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is a <hi>great King,</hi> Psal. 47. 2. Mal. 1. 14. and shews himself <hi>like himself,</hi> and <hi>like a King:</hi> and as other Kings are unwearied in granting what their Favourites sue for, how often soever they come, and how much soever they ask: so it is with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>commands</hi> us to be <hi>unwearied in giving,</hi> Mat. 5.42. Luke 6. 30. and this <hi>latter place,</hi> that it must be <hi>to every man than asks,</hi> holds out <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedness in giving:</hi> and he that layes this charge upon us, that we should <hi>not be weary</hi> of this, surely he must needs be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied himself in giving grants to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers.</hi> 1. They are not <hi>weary of asking,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here; and how then can he be <hi>weary of granting?</hi> We may wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry some men this way, but not God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are some of them <hi>unwearied in giving;</hi> as it is said of Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> That <hi>he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any that asked for Jesus sake.</hi> And if among men there be found <hi>some</hi> that are unwearied in <hi>giving,</hi> then much more is it true of the Lord, <hi>That he is unwearied in granting the Requests of his believing Suppliants, how often soever they pray to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="203" facs="unknown:000111_0210_0FA02C0F36F058A8"/>
3. They ask nothing but that which is <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will,</hi> and they that so ask are ever heard, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 14,15. God is never weary of such men, nor of their Prayers, come they as soft as they will to sue to him. If the <hi>Kings will</hi> be in the Petitions that are put up to him, he will not be tired out with such Petitions; though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently presented to him: So here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>ask in faith;</hi> and faith will carry all before it. God will be unwearied in granting what we ask in faith. They <hi>that doubt,</hi> get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6,7. but they that <hi>pray in faith,</hi> every thing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22. let them come as often as they will they shall be heard: God will not be weary of them, nor of their suits.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They pray <hi>fervently,</hi> and <hi>fervent prayers avail much,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. Earnest suiters are ever speeders with men, much more with the Lord; he cannot tell how to turs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> off, or to be weary of them that <hi>pray earnestly,</hi> though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bringing suit after suit before him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They pray <hi>sincerely,</hi> Psal. 17. 1. their heart goes with their lips, and he takes <hi>pleasure in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 17. Even good men <hi>delight in uprightness,</hi> how much more the Lord? and therefore he cannot be weary of such Prayers, but must needs grant them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>pure prayers;</hi> so were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here: so <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="unknown:000111_0211_0FA02C1017588448"/>
sayes, <hi>My prayer is pure;</hi> Job 16.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>pleasant</hi> Prayers, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. and how should the Lord then be weary of them? He took pleasure in <hi>Abrahams</hi> frequent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed suits, and therefore could not deny a grant to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>humble</hi> Prayers. <hi>Abraham</hi> all along, though <hi>bold</hi> in his suits, yet was very <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and God takes it well to see us <hi>humble</hi> when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>Zealous</hi> Prayers: so were <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> here; and this <hi>holy fire</hi> ever ascends and prevails, when our Prayers are offered up with it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.37.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>argument ative</hi> Prayers, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> were; and God is pleased when we argue the case with him in Prayer. So did the <hi>woman of Canaan,</hi> and got what she would.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>inwrought</hi> Prayers, <hi>J am.</hi> 5.16. such were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here; he did not <hi>word it</hi> with God, but what requests he made were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,</hi> and came from the heart, and God was not weary of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use 1. for Information.</hi> 1. We see what great <hi>encouragement</hi> we have to come with <hi>suit upon suit</hi> before the Lord, for he is <hi>unwearied</hi> in granting the requests of his <hi>believing Suppliants.</hi> how often soever they make their address to him, <hi>Psal.65.2.</hi> So it is with them that come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:000111_0212_0FA02C10B01AED18"/>
gracious Princes, when they finde them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to grant what they sue for, and are not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out with their Requests that they put up to them, they will come <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again,</hi> and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon their Clemency, and bring <hi>suit upon suit,</hi> and are encouraged to follow them with their supplications: so it should be with us in our suits to a gracious God, we cannot <hi>tire him out,</hi> but he is <hi>unwearied</hi> in giving out grants to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what cause we have <hi>not to be weary of well-doing,</hi> Gal.6.9. for if the be <hi>unwearied</hi> in granting our desires, it were a shame for us to be <hi>weary</hi> of what he would have us do for him in such a way. We are apt to be weary of any thing that is good, and are soon tired out, but Gods <hi>unweariedness</hi> in doing for us, should make us blush when we are <hi>weary</hi> of that where with we may serve him, or do good to others for his sake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see how <hi>happy</hi> the state of the <hi>blessed Angels</hi> are, that as they never yet <hi>trod a wry step,</hi> but have been constant and unwearied in a way of obedience; so they shall keep an <hi>unwearied course</hi> therein to all Eternity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20,21. God hath been unwearied in his <hi>favour</hi> to them, and they are unwearied in their <hi>duty</hi> to him, and this is their height of Happiness.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what <hi>longings</hi> we should have after <hi>that time,</hi> when we shall be unwearied in our <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> to him. Here we are soon weary
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:000111_0213_0FA02C1178E32410"/>
and tired out with what he calls for, and tread many a wry step in what we do in way of duty to him, but when we come in <hi>Heaven,</hi> we shall never be weary more, but shall <hi>praise,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him to all Eternity. This state we should <hi>long for,</hi> and be weary of our weariness in our duties here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see what our duty is, to <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>follow him</hi> in being unwearied in answering the desires of his poor ones that sue to us: though they should come <hi>often</hi> to us, and bring <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest after another</hi> to us, if it be <hi>in the power of our hand,</hi> we are to take pattern by the Lord himself, and not to turn away our ears from their cries, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27,28.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see how <hi>unworthy we should count our selves</hi> of such a mercy as this is, that God should be so unwearied in granting the Requests of his poor ones: Who are we, that <hi>we</hi> should bring <hi>suit upon suit</hi> before him, and have <hi>all granted?</hi> This should lay us <hi>low</hi> before him, and we should judge our selves (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did) <hi>less then the least of all his mercies,</hi> Gen.32.10.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see what cause Believers have to <hi>exalt Grace,</hi> that goes on in an <hi>unwearied course</hi> and way of <hi>granting</hi> what we sue unto him for. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Earth, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> may say, <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> for this.

Grants</hi> to them? Oh what <hi>shoutings,</hi> and <hi>loud acclamations</hi> then should we make for this <hi>great Grace</hi> of his towards us? See for illustration of this, <hi>Zech.4.7.</hi> and <hi>Psal.149.6.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. We see what <hi>height of praise</hi> we shall come off with in another world, for these <hi>large grants</hi> made to us here.

                     <hi>Use 2. for Terrour</hi> to Unbelievers; They get <hi>nothing</hi> for all this <hi>bounty,</hi> they are weary of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and God is weary of them, and will not hear them, Psal.66.18. Joh.9.30.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use 3. for Humiliation</hi> to the <hi>Saints,</hi> that do not so <hi>often</hi> put up their <hi>Requests</hi> as they might, nor bring <hi>suit upon suit,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did; they miss of many a grant which they might have made over to them, for God is <hi>unwearied in granting</hi> what we ask of him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use 4. for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To <hi>love the Lord,</hi> that is so <hi>unwearied in giving</hi> out his <hi>grants to us.</hi> What love would we not express to a man that should so do with us? Oh! but God deserveth infinitely more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be <hi>unwearied in our praises to him,</hi> we can never do it <hi>enough,</hi> nor long <hi>enough,</hi> till the

                  <p>Quest. 1. <hi>How does it appear that they are afraid of God being angry with their prayers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In regard of themselves. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>In regard of themselves.</hi> 1. In that they think they may be <hi>too bold with him,</hi> and press <hi>too much upon him:</hi> so did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, and so did <hi>Gideon</hi> in the place before-mentioned. They that Petition to Princes, are sometimes so bold, that they think they may be over-bold with them, and so incurre their displeasure; so it is with them that petition to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>vile,</hi> and God <hi>a glorious One,</hi> and therefore that the should come so often into his presence, and follow him so with suit upon suit, they may well <hi>fear</hi> that such a glorious One may be angry at such <hi>vile ones</hi> as they are. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> so <hi>Job</hi> looked at themselves, and so every <hi>believing humble suppliant</hi> does, and ought to think.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="210" facs="unknown:000111_0217_0FA02C1797479840"/>
3. In that they would keep that <hi>due distance</hi> that is between God and them, and therefore they are <hi>afraid</hi> that he may be angry that that <hi>distance</hi> hath not been observed. The truth is, though Princes and Subjects have this kept, yet we are not so careful to observe it when we <hi>draw near</hi> to the Lord. Little do we think <hi>who God is</hi> that we have to do with, and who <hi>we are</hi> that come before him now Believers are sensible of this, and so are afraid that God may be angry with their Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that they desire <hi>pardon</hi> for their prayers, <hi>Dan.</hi>9.19. and therefore are <hi>afraid</hi> he may be angry with their Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that they <hi>confess the sins</hi> of their prayers, Psal. 130. 3. <hi>If thou Lord shouldst mark iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, O Lord, who shall stand?</hi> if our <hi>best du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> God should mark our failings and sins, there would be no <hi>standing</hi> before him, he might well be angry with them. See <hi>Ezra 9.15.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that they <hi>finde it so,</hi> and expostulate with God about it, <hi>Psal.80.4.</hi> God can be <hi>angry.</hi> and <hi>long angry at the prayers of his people;</hi> and what he is to <hi>some of them,</hi> he may be to <hi>any of them,</hi> and the best believers may be afraid of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In regard of their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>defiled,</hi> and need <hi>washing</hi> in Christs Blood: and being <hi>so defiled,</hi> they may well be afraid that God may be angry with them, <hi>Isa.64.6.</hi> The
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:000111_0218_0FA02C214B73AFB8"/>
righteousness of our <hi>best performances,</hi> as well as of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>persons</hi> is <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> no menstruous Clout is more detailed then our Prayers are, as they come from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>full of wandrings,</hi> our hearts are <hi>unfixed</hi> in the duty of Prayer. There are many roving <hi>thoughts</hi> that we are hurried and carried about with, that marre the duty, if God pass them not by, and we may well fear that God may be angry for them. <hi>David</hi> had <hi>a fixed heart,</hi> Psal.57.7. but ours too often <hi>gad abroad.</hi> What is said of the <hi>Adulteress,</hi> may be said of our <hi>adulterous hearts:</hi> now it is said of her, Prov.7. 11,12. <hi>Her feet abide not in her house, now she is without, now is the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.</hi> So it is true of us when we come before the Lord in Prayer, our false hearts abide not close to the duty, but now they are <hi>without,</hi> now in the <hi>streets,</hi> and lye in wait to <hi>deceive us</hi> at every corner of the world, thinking of <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> and the <hi>other vain things;</hi> yea, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of these <hi>flies</hi> (if we watch not in Prayer will be buzzing about us, and carry us away from God and the duty, from one <hi>England</hi> to another, and into all the corners of the world: and this may well make us afraid that God will be angry at our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are not <hi>serious</hi> Prayers, nor we se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and upright in them; the <hi>duty</hi> it self is a
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:000111_0219_0FA02C222EEF8890"/>
serious duty, and God is serious with us in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding it,</hi> but we are apt to trifle with him in it, and rather to sport and play with the duty, and to <hi>word it</hi> with God, then to express any seriousness at all in it: the <hi>heart</hi> is gone <hi>far from God,</hi> when the <hi>lips are near him,</hi> Mat. 15.8. these are hypocritical Prayers, and they that offer them up, Hypocrites, <hi>ver.7.</hi> Now Believers Prayers have a <hi>tang</hi> of hypocrisie in them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and therefore they may fear that God may be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are not so <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>fervent</hi> Prayers as God calls for, they are not so <hi>heated</hi> with the fire of the Spirit as God expects, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Jam.</hi>5.16. though this cannot be said of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> yet of many that go for Believers it may, that are <hi>dull,</hi> and <hi>heavy,</hi> and <hi>sleepy</hi> in Prayer, as the Disciples of Christ sometimes were, <hi>Mat.</hi>26. 39,40. now may they well then fear that such Prayers God may be angry with. A Prince would be angry with a <hi>cold Suit;</hi> so God with <hi>cold</hi> Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>angry</hi> Prayers, <hi>passionate</hi> Prayers, have too much <hi>wilde-fire</hi> in them: So had <hi>Jonah</hi> when he prayed, he rather <hi>vented his passion,</hi> then prayed, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 1,2,3. and threw out words in his <hi>heat</hi> against the Lord. So <hi>Elijah</hi> cannot be excused from <hi>too much heat,</hi> and therefore <hi>James</hi> calls him <hi>a passionate man,</hi> Jam.5.17. so <hi>James</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="unknown:000111_0220_0FA02C235C934308"/>
and <hi>Job<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> had too much <hi>heat of spirit,</hi> Luke 9.54. and so others have had: now such fire of our <hi>own kindling</hi> God no way approves of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Saints may well fear that he may be angry with such <hi>angry</hi> Prayers. Would not a King be angry if Petitioner should be <hi>passionate with him</hi> that sues unto him? So here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are sometimes <hi>unconstant</hi> Prayers, they are but <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> performed; God hears of us but <hi>seldoms,</hi> or it may be when we are in <hi>affliction,</hi> Isa.26.16. Hos.5.15. and may we not then fear that God will be angry with such Prayers? Will not a father be angry when his children come seldome into his sight to ask what they stand in need of? so with God; and therefore we may well fear that he will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with such Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Why are Believers afraid that God may be angry with their Prayers?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. From God. 2. From our selves that pray.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From God.</hi> 1. He <hi>sees that</hi> in our Prayers that we <hi>cannot see</hi> our selves: He <hi>sees sin,</hi> where we <hi>see none;</hi> he hath a <hi>quick eye</hi> to look into the <hi>obliquities</hi> and <hi>iniquities</hi> of our Prayers. A little blemish is seen in the <hi>face;</hi> so if there be but any <hi>blot</hi> or <hi>spot</hi> upon the face of the <hi>duty,</hi> his <hi>pure eyes</hi> spies it out, <hi>Psal. 44. 20,21.</hi> there is not the <hi>least mote</hi> but he takes notice of,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:000111_0221_0FA02C24D8119F00"/>
not the <hi>least spot</hi> but his eye is upon, and that wherein we think we <hi>do well,</hi> he knows to be <hi>evil. James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> thought they did well, in desiring that <hi>they</hi> might do as <hi>Elias</hi> did, to <hi>call for fire from heaven</hi> to consume those that would not <hi>receive their Master</hi> and ours: but what sayes he to them? <hi>Ye know not what spirit you are of:</hi> He saw that that they thought <hi>zeal,</hi> to be <hi>wilde-fire,</hi> he knew that that which they judged to come from <hi>love to their dear Master,</hi> was but <hi>a spark of their own kindling,</hi> and no <hi>love</hi> in the bottom of it, neither to Christ nor themselves, much less to those men that they wished so ill to. And may not Believers be justly afraid that God will be angry with such Prayers?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath been angry with the Prayers of <hi>others,</hi> and <hi>long angry,</hi> Psal.80.4. and therefore they fear he may be angry with <hi>their prayers.</hi> When Princes are angry with some that sue to them, others are afraid that they may be angry with their suits also: so it is in this case between God and us. If a father be angry with some of his Children, he may be angry upon the like grounds with the rest: so may God, and that may make the rest to fear that he may be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>withdraws himself</hi> sometimes from his people when they pray to him, <hi>Lam.</hi>3. 8,44. and thats a <hi>ground</hi> of his being <hi>angry</hi> at their <hi>prayers;</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="unknown:000111_0222_0FA02C2598D9F428"/>
and this makes them afraid that he is angry with them. <hi>Job</hi> complained of this, <hi>Job 30.20. I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</hi> When a Prince <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws</hi> from a Suppliant, and <hi>regards him not,</hi> it is a sign of his anger, and he fears he is displeased with him: so it is in this case between God and us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He sees that we too often <hi>restrain prayer before him,</hi> and thereby <hi>cast off fear,</hi> Job 15.4. and that makes him angry: and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of it, that makes us afraid that he is angry with our Prayers that we are so <hi>slack in. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> sayes, <hi>As vineger to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so is a slothful messenger to him that sends him.</hi> If our Prayers, which are the <hi>Souls messengers,</hi> be <hi>slothful,</hi> and we <hi>slack our pace</hi> in them, God will be displeased, and we may well fear that he will be angry with them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From our selves that pray.</hi> 1. We sometimes <hi>distrust Gods power,</hi> and that makes him angry, and makes us afraid that he is angry with our Prayers: <hi>Mark.</hi>9.22. he doubted of <hi>Christs power to heal his son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We sometimes <hi>distrust his will,</hi> as the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per did,</hi> though he did <hi>believe his power,</hi> Mat.8.2. and that is a just ground of his anger, and <hi>that</hi> that makes us afraid that he may be angry with our prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="216" facs="unknown:000111_0223_0FA02C2982D8F548"/>
3. We sometimes ask <hi>that</hi> that God resolves he will <hi>never give:</hi> Thus <hi>Moses</hi> did, that desired God that he might <hi>go over Jordan, and see that good Land;</hi> which God was angry with him for, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 25,26. Two things hindred the granting of his desire: 1. God was <hi>provoked at the Waters of Strife,</hi> and threatned <hi>he should not bring his people into that Land,</hi> Numb. 20.12.2. He appointed <hi>Joshua</hi> to be the man; wherein was a <hi>mystery,</hi> for he was a Type of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that brings us into <hi>Heaven,</hi> that <hi>Canaan,</hi> was a Type of. Now for <hi>Moses</hi> to desire <hi>that,</hi> that God upon such just grounds <hi>denied,</hi> it could not but displease him, and make him angry: and so may we well fear that God will be angry with our Prayers, when we desire that of him that he is resolved not to give us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We desire that sometimes that is <hi>not good for us,</hi> and that will make God angry with our Prayers; for <hi>no good thing he will withhold from us,</hi> Psal.14.11. and 34.10. but if we ask any thing <hi>that is not good for us,</hi> and he sees it will <hi>hurt us,</hi> rather then <hi>do us good,</hi> he will be angry with our Prayers. Thus for <hi>Jonah</hi> to desire <hi>once</hi> and <hi>again</hi> that God would <hi>take away his life from him,</hi> Jonah 4. 3,8. which could not be <hi>good for him,</hi> could not but displease him: and when we ask that which is not <hi>good for us,</hi> we have ground to fear that he will be angry with our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="217" facs="unknown:000111_0224_0FA02C2A04B5B810"/>
5. We sometimes desire <hi>that</hi> that will be <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to others;</hi> as it would have been to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevites,</hi> if <hi>Jonah</hi> had had <hi>that</hi> that he desired, for then they had all been destroyed. So <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> if they had had their desire, what would have become of those <hi>non-entertainers of Christ? Luke 9.</hi> and if we do so, and desire <hi>the hurt of others,</hi> may we not justly be afraid that God will be angry with our Prayers?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They sometimes desire <hi>that</hi> that may be <hi>satisfaction to their own lusts,</hi> as <hi>Jonah</hi> desired <hi>Ninevehs destruction,</hi> rather then that they should be <hi>spared</hi> upon their repentance, because <hi>his Credit lay at the stake,</hi> having denounced the overthrow of it <hi>within forty dayes.</hi> Here the <hi>lust of Pride</hi> was too predominant in the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.1. and can we wonder that God should be angry with such Prayers? Pride step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in to such a <hi>duty,</hi> marres the <hi>duty,</hi> and makes God angry. Thus many will pray against such and such men, wherein they vent their <hi>pride and passion,</hi> and how can God be pleased with such Prayers? they may well fear he will be angry with them. If a man should be proud before a Prince, when he comes to Petition to him, would not the Prince be angry with such Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? So here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see that there is no cause for us to <hi>glory in our prayers</hi> that we
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:000111_0225_0FA02C2DFAA1DB70"/>
bring before the Lord; for if we look seriously into them, we may see cause to <hi>fear</hi> that God may justly be angry with there; or if we our selves should not see such cause, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2.

When a King is justly angry, the Subject stoops, and abaseth himself; if a Father be angry, all the Children carry themselves submissively: so should we.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see the truth of that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>When I would do good, evil is present with me.</hi> When we go to <hi>pray,</hi> it is <hi>good that we do,</hi> and a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duty;</hi> but even then <hi>evil is present with us,</hi> and we have cause to fear that something <hi>may</hi> or <hi>hath broken from us</hi> in the <hi>duty,</hi> for which God may be angry with us. When a man thinks to go a <hi>right step,</hi> he takes a <hi>wry step,</hi> that makes him stumble and fall: when a man would give a <hi>right stroke,</hi> his instrument sometimes <hi>slips,</hi> and the <hi>stroke is wrong:</hi> when a man would make <hi>good musick,</hi> a <hi>String</hi> breaks, or a <hi>Pegge</hi> slips, and makes <hi>an harsh sound.</hi> So it is when we <hi>pray,</hi> and would tread right in the duty, and Strike a right stroke, and make a pleasant found like melody in the Lords ears, then we tread awry, and strike amiss, and make such an harsh found, that God is not delighted, but angry with our Prayers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that if we be afraid that God may be <hi>angry</hi> with our Prayers, what cause then have we to fear that he will be angry with us for our <hi>other sins</hi> that we do too often provoke him with?

be angry for these. If he will be angry with <hi>wry steps</hi> and <hi>trips,</hi> Oh how angry will he be for <hi>deep falls,</hi> and <hi>great provocations;</hi> if for <hi>spots</hi> we may fear his displeasure, how much more for <hi>fouler sins?</hi> A Schoolmast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>WE now come to the <hi>second part</hi> of the <hi>Note,</hi> and that is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Believers desire of God that he would not be angry with them when they pray to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, <hi>Let not the Lord be angry:</hi> So <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 6. 39. <hi>Let not thine anger be hot against me.</hi> When we make Supplication to a Prince, we desire this, that we may have the <hi>smiles of his face,</hi> and that he <hi>may not be angry
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:000111_0233_0FA02C35AA765898"/>
with us:</hi> So do Believers when they make Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Lord, they do and ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Petitioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. 2. From the nature of his anger.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Petitioners.</hi> 1. They desire the <hi>acceptance</hi> of their Prayers, and that they may be <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>pleasing to him;</hi> which they could not be, if God should be angry with them. Psal. 141. 2. <hi>Let my prayer come before thee as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,</hi> Psal. 10. 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They would be <hi>Princes with God,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 28. and this cannot be, if God be angry with them. A Prince will not be prevailed with, if he be <hi>angry with him</hi> that puts up his suit to him: So we shall never prevail with God, if he be angry with us when we pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They see some just cause why <hi>he might be angry with them,</hi> if he should be strict with them, there are so many <hi>spots</hi> in the duty, and these they earnestly desire that he would not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of to be angry with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are afraid that they are <hi>too bold with him,</hi> and therefore desire that he would not be angry with them. So <hi>Abraham</hi> does here. When we sue to men for some special favour, we desire pardon for our <hi>boldness,</hi> as fearing that we may offend by it: so do they that make suit to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="227" facs="unknown:000111_0234_0FA02C37BB4AAE30"/>
5. They are <hi>conscious</hi> of their own integrity in the main, though they may have their failings, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 17,18. and therefore desire that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They <hi>expostulate</hi> with him in <hi>an humble way,</hi> about his anger with their Prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 4 which shews that they see cause to desire of God that he would not be angry with them: for such an <hi>expostulation</hi> contains the force of an <hi>earnest prayer,</hi> that he would withdraw his anger from them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the nature of his Anger.</hi> 1. It is like <hi>fire,</hi> and therefore <hi>Gideon</hi> expresseth it, Judg. 6. 39. <hi>Let not thine anger be hot against me.</hi> Gods anger is as <hi>hot as fire;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 22. it is said, <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, that shall burn to the lowest hell.</hi> Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a <hi>fiery nature,</hi> it is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at that they pray that God would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is like <hi>the dreadful waves of the Sea,</hi> Mic. 7. 9. <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord:</hi> The word translated <hi>indignation,</hi> signifies such a raging as is in the <hi>raging waves of the Sea</hi> when they are lifted up on high, and threaten drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and overwhelming; and therefore <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 15. the same word is used for <hi>the raging of the Sea</hi> in before storm and tempest, and when the Sea <hi>ragets</hi> and is <hi>tempestuous,</hi> the Marriners ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly 
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:000111_0235_0FA02C3A9EEE6948"/>
desire a Calm, and that they might be quiet, and the Sea might cease from her raging. So Believers desire of God, that the <hi>dreadful waves of the Sea of his anger</hi> may cease, and that they may enjoy a quiet Calm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is compared to <hi>smoke,</hi> Dent. 29. 20. Psal. 74. 1. and <hi>smoke</hi> is a <hi>stifling thing,</hi> if it be in the extremity of it, and cannot be endured: and as men get out of a smoky house or room, as not being able to bear it, and desire to be as farre from it as may be; so Believers desire of God that the <hi>smoke of his anger</hi> may be removed from them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is set out to us under the notion of <hi>red wine</hi> that is <hi>full of mixture</hi> of that which doth <hi>intoxicate,</hi> Psal. 75. 8. and is <hi>without mixture</hi> of any thing that should <hi>allay,</hi> and make it better to be endured, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 9,10. so those <hi>two places</hi> are reconciled. Now who would not desire to be freed from such a Cup of wine, that is so <hi>full of mixture</hi> to <hi>intoxicate</hi> and <hi>kill,</hi> and is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture</hi> of <hi>that</hi> that should <hi>allay,</hi> and take away the <hi>sharpness</hi> and <hi>deadly strength</hi> of it? Such a Cup of wine is <hi>Gods anger,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Believers may well pray that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is compared to <hi>wormwood and gall,</hi> Lam. 3. 15,19. both which are <hi>bitter things;</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God is <hi>that</hi> that makes affliction so bitter.
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:000111_0236_0FA02C3E5DFBB090"/>
Now <hi>wormwood</hi> and <hi>gall</hi> are such things as every one would decline: Oh then much more will the Saints decline the <hi>anger of God,</hi> and pray that he would not be angry with them when they pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is held out under the notion of <hi>a Bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> and of a <hi>Lion</hi> and <hi>Leopard,</hi> Hos. 13. 7,8. and these are fierce and tearing Creatures. When God is <hi>angry,</hi> he compares himself to such Creatures as are <hi>fierce,</hi> and <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renting</hi> and <hi>tearing in pieces</hi> what they meet with: Now who would not desire to be <hi>deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> from a <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Bear robbed of her whelps,</hi> and from a <hi>Leopard</hi> that <hi>watcheth to destroy?</hi> and if the Lords anger be like the <hi>fierceness</hi> of these Beasts of Prey, there is great reason that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers should pray that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see that the anger of the Lord is a <hi>dreadful thing,</hi> for else Believers would not so pray to be delivered from it. If <hi>the Kings wrath</hi> be <hi>as the roaring of a Lion,</hi> Prov. 19. 12. and <hi>as the messengers of death,</hi> Prov. 16. 14. and <hi>whose provoketh him to anger, sinneth against his own soul,</hi> Prov. 20. 2. Oh what is it then when <hi>God is angry?</hi> Nahum 1. 6. <hi>Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? His fury is poured out like fire, and the Rocks are thrown down by

him.</hi> Men make nothing of it to <hi>provoke him,</hi> but they shall know what his anger means, and what it is to stirre up <hi>this Lion,</hi> that will so <hi>roar,</hi> and <hi>rent,</hi> and <hi>tear,</hi> and <hi>kill,</hi> and <hi>devour:</hi> they shall finde it <hi>a dreadful anger,</hi> farre above any <hi>Kings anger,</hi> whoever he be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see the <hi>wofull estate</hi> of those upon whom <hi>the wrath of God must abide for ever,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. If <hi>Abraham</hi> prayed so that God would not be <hi>angry with him,</hi> surely they are in an ill case that must <hi>abide by it to all eternity:</hi> and who is able to undergo the severity of his displeasure? If <hi>his wrath be kindled but a little,</hi> there's no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of it; Oh how shall they then be able to endure it, in the <hi>extremity of it to all eternity?</hi> It's an <hi>hot hole</hi> where the Bellows blow in a furnace of Iron or Copper; Oh but what an <hi>hot hole is Hell</hi> then, <hi>which the breath and anger of the Lord, like a stream of Brimstone, kindleth for ever?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what a mercy it is to be <hi>delivered from the heat of his anger;</hi> for Believers pray that God would not be angry with them: surely therefore it is a <hi>mercy</hi> when such a shower falls not upon us, when this <hi>wrath is not poured upon us like fire,</hi> for there's no fire burns so hot as that; and this <hi>deliverance</hi> is by <hi>our Redeemer,</hi> Rom. 5. 9. <hi>Being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</hi> He quencheth this <hi>fire,</hi> and
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:000111_0238_0FA02C43D8E38178"/>
puts out all the <hi>sparks</hi> of it: He dries up this <hi>Sea,</hi> and stills all the <hi>raging</hi> of it: He hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>drunk that Cup of Red Wine full of mixture</hi> of <hi>that</hi> that <hi>killed,</hi> and <hi>without mixture</hi> of what might <hi>allay</hi> it, that we might never drink it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what <hi>love</hi> we owe to Christ Jesus, that delivereth us from <hi>the wrath to come,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 10. Oh, who should have our hearts but he? where should our love be <hi>laid out,</hi> but upon him? We would love one that plucked us out of the <hi>fire,</hi> that pulled us out of the <hi>Lions mouth,</hi> that got us out of the <hi>paw of the Bear,</hi> that rescued us from the <hi>Leopards teeth and claws:</hi> and if so, what love is he worthy of, that hath plucked us out of <hi>the fire of Gods anger?</hi> and when it hath roared upon us like a <hi>Lion,</hi> and hath watched over us as the <hi>Leopard</hi> to make a prey of us, then he hath stood up to <hi>rescue us:</hi> No love ever like <hi>his</hi> herein, and no love should be above <hi>ours</hi> to him back again.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that his favour must needs be <hi>very sweet,</hi> if his anger be <hi>that</hi> that is to be <hi>prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.</hi> Life is sweet, and <hi>in his favour is life,</hi> Psal. 30. 5. Yea <hi>better then life,</hi> Psal. 63. 3. This life is sweet, but <hi>his favour</hi> is above it; there's no sweetness to be equalled or compared with it. The <hi>favour</hi> of a Prince <hi>is as the dew upon the grass,</hi> Prov. 19. 12. Which makes it revive and flourish in its greenness and beauty; Oh what
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:000111_0239_0FA02C4F634ADDC8"/>
then is <hi>the favour of God?</hi> it must needs make us grow and flourish in viridity and greenness. If his anger be <hi>that</hi> we are to desire to be delivered from, then his favour is <hi>that</hi> that we are to be delighted in, and is to be desired after.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that they that <hi>provoke God</hi> to anger are <hi>the greatest enemies to themselves;</hi> for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that are their own friends, pray that the Lord would not be angry with them. If <hi>he that provoketh a Prince, sinneth against his own soul,</hi> Prov. 20. 2. how do they <hi>sin against, their own souls</hi> that provoke God to anger? There are no such <hi>enemies to themselves</hi> as such men be. And truly we have so many enemies abroad, that we had not need be our own enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to those that are to bear this anger for ever. Godly men are so afraid of <hi>kindling this fire,</hi> that they pray against it, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here does: Oh! but how will they do that are to suffer it to all eternity? If it be <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dwell in a corner of the house, then with an angry woman in a wide house;</hi> Oh how will they do that are to endure Gods anger? If <hi>a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall dropping in a very rainy day, and an angry wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be alike,</hi> that will wear a man if he were a stone; Oh how will they endure the anger of God, that is not to be <hi>dropped,</hi> but <hi>poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them</hi> for ever and ever? <hi>Job,</hi> when he felt but <hi>a few drops</hi> of this, cried out, <hi>Is my strength the

                  <p>TH<hi>at Believers, when they have prayed that he would not be angry with them, are encouraged to speak more in prayer to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So <hi>Abraham</hi> here sayes, <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak.</hi> Petitioners to Princes when <hi>they</hi> are not angry, are encouraged to speak in way of suit to them: so may we be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to speak to the Lord, when we have desired <hi>that he would not be angry with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lords anger. 2. From the Believers themselves. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lords anger.</hi> 1. If it should <hi>kindle</hi> against us, there would be <hi>no speaking to him.</hi> There's no wise man that would Petition to a Prince when he is angry with him; but if he be calm, and his spirit be appeased, and no anger appear in his face, or in his words or gesture, he will then be <hi>encouraged</hi> to speak, and bring his Petition before him: So if God be
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000111_0242_0FA02C552693EE48"/>
angry there is no speaking to him, but if he be appeased toward us, then we may freely speak what we have to say to him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here does.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His anger is <hi>a fierce anger,</hi> Nah. 1. 6. and that must needs stop any mans mouth from speaking. If a man be <hi>fierce in his anger,</hi> it is in vain to speak to him: so here. But if he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to lay aside his fierceness, then he may be spoken to: so it is with us <hi>in speaking to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His anger is such that <hi>none can stand before it,</hi> Nah. 1. 6. and therefore there is no speaking in way of suit till it be removed: but when this is gone, then we may have free access to him, and speak what we will in his ears.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His anger is as <hi>a Cloud that he covers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with,</hi> Lam. 3. 44. <hi>that our prayers cannot pass thorow;</hi> and therefore so long as that <hi>cloud</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, there's no speaking in Prayer to him: but when it is taken away, then our Prayers may come before him, and be accepted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. His anger is <hi>long ere it be removed,</hi> Ps. 80. 4. God is <hi>slow to anger,</hi> not easily provoked; but when once he is angry, he is not quickly pacified, and that willl hinder our Prayers: but now when this is <hi>removed,</hi> then we may speak as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here does.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. His anger is <hi>an unknown anger,</hi> Psal. 90. 11. we may know other things, but we do not know
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:000111_0243_0FA02C560CE51A08"/>
the <hi>force</hi> of this, and being so powerful, it will stop our monthes: but if this be <hi>removed,</hi> then we may speak all our minde.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From Believers.</hi> 1. They may <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God for any thing,</hi> Matth. 21. 22. and therefore may well be <hi>encouraged</hi> to speak to him when he is not angry with them: he cannot say them <hi>Bay</hi> in what they sue for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>his friends,</hi> Jam. 2. 23. and <hi>friends</hi> may speak freely to God, especially when they have prayed to him that he would not be angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>his favourites,</hi> they <hi>finde grace in his sight,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 33. 12. and they may speak what they will in the ears of their Prince.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 12. and they may be bold to ask <hi>any thing</hi> of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, especially when he is not angry with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>his Jewels,</hi> Mal. 3. 17. <hi>his peculiar Treasure,</hi> Psal. 135. 4. and they that are so <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to him,</hi> may be <hi>encouraged to speak to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are they that <hi>he hath given his own Son Christ unto,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. and therefore they may speak, and have any thing given to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>put up to him</hi> who is <hi>a God hearing prayer,</hi> Ps. 65. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are made to him that <hi>commands us to ask,</hi> Mat. 7. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:000111_0244_0FA02C585F53E5C0"/>
3. They are brought before him, who (Psal. 81. 10.) bids us <hi>open our monthes wide,</hi> .</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are directed to him who is <hi>God All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,</hi> that <hi>can do every thing,</hi> Jer. 32. 17,27. Job 42. 2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>delightful to him,</hi> Prov. 15. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>mingled with Christs intercession,</hi> Rev. 8. 3. and <hi>accepted in him,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 5. All which considered, they may be <hi>encouraged</hi> to speak and pray to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what cause we have to <hi>look to it,</hi> that God be not <hi>provoked by us</hi> when we go to pray to him; for if he be, we shall not be able <hi>to speak to any purpose</hi> in his ears.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that they that come to <hi>a reconciled God,</hi> may speak their mindes freely to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that if <hi>God be angry,</hi> there's no speaking to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that <hi>wicked men</hi> cannot speak in Prayer to God, <hi>with whom he is angry every day,</hi> Psal. 7. 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that they are <hi>happy</hi> that have Gods anger <hi>turned from them,</hi> as <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 4. for such may be <hi>encouraged</hi> to speak as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that there's <hi>no going to an angry God.</hi> What can any man look for from an angry Prince?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see how <hi>precious</hi> Christ should be to us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. who makes <hi>us</hi> and <hi>our prayers
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:000111_0245_0FA02C59CBD6B748"/>
acceptable to God,</hi> Ephes. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see that if we would go with <hi>courage to pray</hi> before the Lord, we must first <hi>prevail with him</hi> not to be angry with us.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that as there is <hi>enough</hi> in Gods <hi>anger</hi> to stop any mans mouth in Prayer; so when he is <hi>appeased,</hi> there's <hi>enough in that</hi> to open any mans mouth to pray to him.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We see that none but those that have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christs reconciling grace,</hi> can make an effectuall Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to those that <hi>anger God</hi> with their sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation</hi> to those that <hi>too often</hi> give God cause to be angry with them, as <hi>2 Sam</hi> 11. 27. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To get God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled. 2. To pray for others that do <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke</hi> him, 3. To bless God for Christ. 4. To love Christ. 5. To <hi>long</hi> for Heaven. 6. To speak as <hi>Abraham</hi> does.</p>

He hath <hi>enough by him</hi> to give us more when we ask of him, and therefore we may well desire to get something more from him: He is <hi>a full one,</hi> and can <hi>fulfill the desires of them that fear him, Psal.</hi> 145. 19. and if he would not have us send the poor away <hi>empty</hi> from us, when we <hi>have it by us,</hi> Prov. 3. 27,28. then we may well desire to get something more from <hi>such an one,</hi> that hath <hi>enough by him</hi> to give to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>a bountiful one, Rich unto all that call upon him,</hi> Rom. 10. 12. and therefore in every request that we put up to him, we may desire <hi>something more</hi> from him. Petitioners that sue to bountiful Princes, may expect more from them, when-ever they come before them: So we, when we come before the Lord, he sends none <hi>empty away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He calls upon us to <hi>open our mouthes w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de,</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="unknown:000111_0247_0FA02C5E3377F6E0"/>
to enlarge our desires, to ask much of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10. and therefore we may well desire to get <hi>something more of him,</hi> as often as we come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>loves his people,</hi> Deut. 33. 3. Psal. 146. 8. and they that <hi>love</hi> others, are willing to give more and more to them at their asking; and therefore such as come to them, may well desire to get something more of them then formerly they have had: So may we of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>gives to all liberally, and upbraideth not</hi> when we <hi>ask in faith,</hi> Jam. 5. 6. and therefore in every request that we put up to him, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>something more</hi> then formerly we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>Rewards bounty in us abundantly,</hi> Luke 6. 38. and therefore we may well desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive bountifully of him, and to desire that we may have <hi>something more of him</hi> in every request that we put up to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. They are of <hi>a noble spirit themselves,</hi> as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 14. 22,23,24. so <hi>Araunah,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 23. and if they be so <hi>royal in giving,</hi> then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may well look that God should be <hi>more Royall,</hi> and desire more of him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have <hi>large promises made to them,</hi> Psal. 81. 10. Joh. 16. 23. and having such <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> they may desire when-ever they pray to him, to get <hi>something more</hi> of him then formerly they have received</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:000111_0248_0FA02C5E4F5504B0"/>
3. They are <hi>the desire of his eyes,</hi> and <hi>the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishment of his heart,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. &amp; 4. 9. and they that are such, may in every request they make desire <hi>something more</hi> of him then formerly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>his excellent ones,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. and though they look at themselves as <hi>vile,</hi> yet they are more <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> in his eyes for that, and may desire to get <hi>something more</hi> of him. The more <hi>little</hi> we are in our own eyes, the more <hi>esteem</hi> we are of in his.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are such as are <hi>purchased by his Sons Blood,</hi> Acts 20. 28. and what may they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire in their request of him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>lovers of him,</hi> Psal. 69. 36. and what may not they desire of him? they may desire in all their requests to get <hi>something more</hi> of him then formerly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers they put up:</hi> 1. They are <hi>Odours,</hi> Rev. 5. 8. of a sweet savour to him through Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>pure prayers,</hi> Job 16. 17. and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up with <hi>holy hands and hearts,</hi> Jam. 4. 8.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>humble</hi> Prayers, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> was here, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 21. &amp; 18. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>unfeigned</hi> desires and Prayers. Psal. 17. 1.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are fervent Prayers, Jam. 5. 16,17. there's <hi>fire</hi> in them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>inwrought</hi> Prayers, <hi>ibid.</hi> the
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:000111_0249_0FA02C5EACF3B0C0"/>
                     <hi>heart</hi> is them: and being such Prayers, no wonder if Believers in every request that they make desire to get <hi>something more</hi> then formerly they have had from the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how in an holy wise <hi>bold</hi> Believers are with the Lord, that desire <hi>something more</hi> in every request that they put up, then formerly they have received. It would be so with men, and is so in our suits we make to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that <hi>stinted</hi> Prayers <hi>enjoy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed,</hi> and no other then such to be used, fall short of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prayers of Faith, for they ask for the same things, and for no more then the <hi>Book</hi> sets down, which have been asked a thousand times over not but that some requests may be the same, if some <hi>new ones</hi> be put in with them, for Christ said <hi>the same words</hi> sometimes in praying as well as in Preaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that Faith looks at God as a <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and liberal giver,</hi> Jam. 1. 5,6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that Believers think they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive <hi>enough</hi> from the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that the best of men are <hi>indigent men,</hi> and stand in need of more and more sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from the Lord. We are all of the <hi>cravins hand</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see what <hi>longings</hi> we should have here for the enjoyment of God in heaven, where we
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:000111_0250_0FA02C5F9E9EB6F0"/>
shall be at the <hi>Well-head,</hi> and never desiring more; for here we are <hi>alwayes desiring more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see what a <hi>full one</hi> God is that we make our requests unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see the <hi>excellency</hi> of Believers above other men, they have <hi>larger desires</hi> then others: other men thought they <hi>have not,</hi> yet they <hi>ask not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that God hath never the <hi>less</hi> for all that we have of him; for, <hi>faith still desires more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. We see that Believers. (though <hi>bountiful</hi>) yet are <hi>covetous</hi> in an <hi>holy way,</hi> they <hi>desire more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour,</hi> to those that <hi>have nothing,</hi> and <hi>ask nothing.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 4. <hi>for Exhortation:</hi> 1. To walk in the steps of <hi>Abrahams faith.</hi> 2. To get something more in every Prayer. 3. To <hi>long</hi> to be at the <hi>Fountain.</hi> 4. To <hi>love</hi> him that is so <hi>full.</hi> 5. To go <hi>often</hi> to him. 6. To pray here with heart-prayers.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. 3. From the Requests they put up.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Abundant in goodness,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. and scatters plentifully to those that desire to share in his bounty; as <hi>Boaz</hi> did to <hi>Ruth</hi> that came to <hi>glean in his field,</hi> Ruth 2. 15,16. So doth the Lord, when we desire to <hi>gain of him,</hi> and get <hi>something more of him</hi> then formerly; he is so <hi>abundant in goodness,</hi> that he will let <hi>handfulls fall on purpose</hi> for us: if we desire more we shall have more from him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he is <hi>abundant in goodness,</hi> so he <hi>does not grudge</hi> to give more to us, when we desire it of him. Men sometimes will grudge to give to them that they have been <hi>bountiful to</hi> before, if they should ask more; but the Lord is <hi>so free,</hi> that though we ask <hi>more,</hi> he will not grudge to give it in to us: He that would have us in our <hi>bounty</hi> to do it <hi>without grudging,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 9. will much more do it himself.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>loves a chearful giver,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 7. in our bounty he likes it, that it should not be <hi>grudgingly,</hi> or of <hi>necessity,</hi> when we can do no otherwise for very shame, but that we should come off with it with <hi>delight, chearfully</hi> and <hi>glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> Oh how chearfully will he then come off to
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:000111_0252_0FA02C61D7416A38"/>
us in his <hi>bounty?</hi> if we desire more, we shall have more of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>abhors a covetous spirit</hi> in men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 3. and if so, he must needs give liberally himself; so that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we <hi>will</hi> have more, we <hi>shall</hi> have more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He hath given the greatest <hi>gift to us,</hi> that ever he gave to the Sons of men, and therefore he will not stick at other requests, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>never weary of doing good</hi> to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that sue to him: we may <hi>weary men</hi> this way, because they either <hi>cannot spare</hi> what we desire, or have not <hi>a will to it;</hi> but we cannot <hi>weary him,</hi> because he is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to give in more to us, according to our desires.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers.</hi> 1. They are such as <hi>please him,</hi> and what may not they have of him? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22. they may have more at their desire.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>his friends,</hi> (as I said before) <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 23. and <hi>they</hi> may have more given in to them at their desire from men, much more from the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>his precious ones.</hi> Faith is a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1. and they are <hi>precious ones</hi> that partake in it, and therefore he will not stick at giving them more at their desire.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>they</hi> to whom <hi>all things are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> Mark 9. 23. and therefore he will not deny
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:000111_0253_0FA02C6262F72048"/>
them any thing, if they <hi>desire</hi> more, they shall <hi>have</hi> more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>they</hi> that do <hi>glorifie God,</hi> Rom. 4 20. and he will not deny to give more to them that <hi>give glory to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>such</hi> as he <hi>hath promised to give all things to,</hi> Mat 21. 22. Joh. 15. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Requests they put up:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are <hi>fervent,</hi> and (<hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16.) that <hi>avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth match.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>sincere,</hi> Psal 17. 1. and such re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quests never miscarry.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are put up in <hi>Christs Name,</hi> Joh. 10. 23. and such requests he will grant.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 17. Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. 1. and such requests are ever heard.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. We see that Faith is <hi>highly prized of the

                  <p n="8">8. We see how <hi>loathsome to God</hi> they be, that will give <hi>nothing to him</hi> of what he hath given to them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that they that are <hi>penurious</hi> and <hi>niggardly</hi> in upholding his Ordinances, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like God, who gives like himself.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From our selves. 3. From the nature of Believers boldness.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He loves to see his <hi>friends bold with him.</hi> So it is with some kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted men, they love to see their friends bold with them, and not <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>often:</hi> So does the the Lord, who is kinde to his friends, and farre more kinde then all the kinde-hearted men in the world put all together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He calls upon us to <hi>come with boldness to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. not <hi>once,</hi> but so <hi>often as we are in need;</hi> and that encourageth

believing Suppliants to make further bold with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He will at <hi>any time</hi> give to <hi>importunate Suiters,</hi> though they should seem to come <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably,</hi> yet if they be <hi>bold,</hi> and in an holy wise <hi>impudent,</hi> so as to take <hi>no nay,</hi> he will be free to give: this is held out in that Parable <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 5—8. <hi>Importunity</hi> does sometimes more then <hi>Friendship</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is <hi>displeased</hi> when we are not <hi>bold with him,</hi> because we do not take him to be such a friend as indeed he is; for if we did so judge, we would be <hi>more bold with him,</hi> Isa. 64. 7.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He makes account that such <hi>cast off fear,</hi> as <hi>restrain prayer,</hi> and are not <hi>bold with him,</hi> Job 15. 4. and Believers are l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="6">6. He alwayes makes us <hi>the more welcome, the more bold</hi> we are with him when we pray to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> lost nothing by <hi>taking upon him to spear unto the Lord,</hi> and being <hi>further bold with him.</hi> A bold friend findes <hi>hearty welcome</hi> from men, much more from the Lord; they that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Thirdly, <hi>From the nature of Believers boldness.</hi> 1. It draws us <hi>nearer unto God,</hi> and that God <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth</hi> in: We get near to <hi>the Throne of Grace</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>blessed fruit</hi> of <hi>Christs Ascension,</hi> Heb. 4. 14,16. Upon all which grounds Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers may be <hi>bold,</hi> and <hi>further bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what a <hi>gracious God</hi> we sue to, that we may be <hi>

                  <p n="3">3. We see that <hi>great is the friendship</hi> that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

been the friendship that hath been between some men, but none like this between God and his believing ones.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see that to be <hi>bold with God,</hi> and to be <hi>further bold with him</hi> in our requests that we put up to him, is an argument that God is very near to us, and we very near and dear to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that surely we shall be <hi>near indeed</hi> to him in heaven, when <hi>faith</hi> is turned into <hi>vision</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see that if we make so <hi>bold with him here,</hi> in praying to him; Oh what <hi>holy boldness</hi> shall we have with him when he clasps us in his <hi>Everlasting Arms,</hi> and puts us into <hi>his Bosoms</hi> to all Eternity?</p>

                  <p n="9">9. We see a reason of that in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. That that makes us <hi>bold</hi> with God, will make us <hi>victorious</hi> over the wicked one.</p>

                  <p>THat Believers in making suit to the Lord, improve Gods bounty and mercy all that ever they can in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others that they sue for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> found God <hi>merciful</hi> to <hi>Sodom,</hi> that if there had been <hi>fifty Righteous within the City,</hi> he would have spared <hi>the whole place</hi> for their sakes; then afterwards if there had been <hi>five and forty;</hi> then if there had been <hi>forty;</hi> then if there had been <hi>thirty,</hi> and had a grant so far: and now having obtained so much mercy, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it yet further to <hi>twenty; Peradventure there shall twenty be found there;</hi> he will try yet further what the Lord will do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers themselves. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Rich in mercy,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. Rom. 10. 12. and that <hi>Riches of his
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:000111_0261_0FA02C6A695C5160"/>
mercy</hi> is inexhaustible, we cannot <hi>empty</hi> the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of it, nor draw the fountain of it dry, it is a Spring that is alwayes full, and therefore we may improve it all that ever we can. A rich <hi>Myne</hi> may be digged into, and a rich <hi>Treasure</hi> may be made use of, and a full <hi>Fountain</hi> drawn: So here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>able to do exceeding abundantly above all we can ask or think,</hi> Eph. 3. 20. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may improve it to the utmost, and ask high of him. Our <hi>desires</hi> are scant, our <hi>thoughts</hi> are narrow, to that large <hi>bounty</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> that he can impart to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is such <hi>a full one,</hi> that <hi>the whole earth is full of his mercy,</hi> Psal. 119. 64. and <hi>that</hi> that fills the <hi>whole earth,</hi> we may well improve for those that we pray for. We may have <hi>enough of that</hi> that the whole <hi>earth is full of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. His <hi>thoughts and wayes of mercy</hi> are not like our <hi>thoughts and wayes,</hi> but <hi>as the heavens are higher then the earth, so are his wayes higher then our wayes, and his thoughts then our thoughts,</hi> Isa. 55. 8,9. Psal. 103. 11. and therefore we may well improve it to the utmost.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>infinite in mercy,</hi> as well as in his other Attributes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 147. 5. and therefore we may improve it what we can, and as far as our finite natures can go this way.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>delights in mercy,</hi> Mic. 7. 18. and <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="unknown:000111_0262_0FA02C6AA4573130"/>
that he <hi>delights in,</hi> that should we delight to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the utmost, and he will also delight in our improvement of it, as he did all along in <hi>Abrahams</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. They have <hi>experience of his mercy</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and therefore improve it all they can in behalf of others. <hi>Abraham</hi> found the Lord <hi>merciful to himself,</hi> and therefore improves <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are of a merciful <hi>disposition to others. Righteous</hi> and <hi>Merciful men</hi> are coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 1. Now being of a merciful dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, hence it is that they do improve the the Lords mercy what they can for them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Believers have a <hi>promise,</hi> that <hi>being merciful they shall obtain mercy,</hi> Mat. 5. 7. and that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall be no losers by it, and therefore may well improve the Lords mercy for others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They know that it's <hi>Gods will</hi> that they should <hi>love mercy,</hi> Mic. 6. 8. and this way they shew their <hi>love of mercy,</hi> in improving Gods mercy to others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>good stewards of the manifold grace of God,</hi> and this way shew it, by improving the <hi>mercy of God</hi> in behalf of others, as well as for themselves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>like God,</hi> and he is <hi>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and so are they, in improving his <hi>mercy</hi> as
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:000111_0263_0FA02C6B8C0D24E0"/>
far as may be for the good of others. <hi>God is good, does good,</hi> Psal. 119. 68. and the further a sweet Fountain runs, the better it is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They <hi>often prevail for others,</hi> as well as for Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Abraham</hi> missed not of one of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires for wicked <hi>Sodom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Prayers, if they should <hi>miss for others,</hi> yet will <hi>return into their own bosomes,</hi> Psal. 35. 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their Prayers <hi>pierce heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 2 Chro. 30. 27.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They have a kinde of <hi>soveraignty</hi> with them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 11.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They bring the Lord to <hi>our beck,</hi> Isa. 58. 9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are never <hi>in vain,</hi> Isa. 45. 19. and is not such mercy worth the improving?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how <hi>full of love</hi> Believers are to others, that are so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to improve the Lords mercy so farre for their good. <hi>Abraham</hi> desires mercy for <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there were but <hi>twenty righteous</hi> found amongst them. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ever go together, lodge in the same breast, and take up together in the same heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that Believers are not <hi>all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but very desirous that others should par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords mercy with them. <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>communicative grace,</hi> and does not centre within it self, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="257" facs="unknown:000111_0264_0FA02C6C8434B8A0"/>
3. We see how <hi>precious</hi> Believers should be in our eyes, for they are such as do <hi>all they can</hi> to make others partakers of Gods mercy, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. Jewels communicate their beauty to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as well as retain it within themselves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see how Believers resemble God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he <hi>is good,</hi> and <hi>does good,</hi> Psal. 119. 68. and so do they.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that they that <hi>share</hi> in the Lords mercy themselves, are not <hi>so content,</hi> but would have others <hi>partake in it</hi> also; and therefore so desire it for them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see what <hi>love will be in heaven,</hi> if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have so much here on earth: there's <hi>all love</hi> there, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.</p>

                  <p>TH<hi>at the Lord doth exceedingly condescend to his believing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants in praying to him, and improving his mercy in behalf of others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So does the Lord here: <hi>Abraham</hi> desires that if there be but <hi>twenty Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he would not <hi>destroy it;</hi> and God <hi>condescends</hi> to him in his request, and sayes <hi>he will not destroy it for twenties sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From his believing Suppliants. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>a God ready to forgive,</hi> Neh. 9. 17. Psal. 86. 5. and not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict punishment,</hi> especially when sued unto by Believers. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 11—14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 13—21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>prepares their hearts,</hi> and then causeth <hi>his ear to hear,</hi> Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 17. He that gives <hi>heart-preparation,</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="unknown:000111_0266_0FA02C6DA57A4CA0"/>
he ever lends a <hi>listening ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He <hi>provides for the Ravens when his young ones cry unto God,</hi> Job 38. 41. Psal. 147. 9. and if he come down so low as to hear them, then sure he will not disdain to <hi>condescend</hi> to his believing Suppliants that sue to him in behalf of others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He <hi>gives the beasts their food,</hi> ibid. and they make but an harsh sound; they some of them <hi>roar,</hi> as the <hi>Bear</hi> and <hi>Lion;</hi> and some of them <hi>bray,</hi> as the <hi>Ass;</hi> and some of them <hi>bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> as the <hi>Ox:</hi> and if he condescend so low as to hear such noises and voices, how much more will he come low in hearing his believing Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants, whoever they pray for?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is a God that is <hi>merciful and gracious,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. and therefore hears them in behalf of whomsoever they sue for: His <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> makes him thus to <hi>condescend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hears sometimes farre <hi>worse then they:</hi> The Israelites <hi>murmured at the Red-sea,</hi> yet <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 9. God <hi>heard their cry</hi> there, to save them with a temporal salvation, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they were <hi>destroyed in the wilderness,</hi> Jude ver. 5. and if he would hear <hi>such,</hi> much more will he condescend to hear his believing Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, on whose behalf soever they sue for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. They have <hi>much communion with him,</hi> as we see in <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 5. 22. &amp; 6. 9. and
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:000111_0267_0FA02C6E64CEAB20"/>
God will condescend much to those.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>accepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. and what is it that they may not prevail for? he will condescend much for their sakes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They <hi>please him,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. and such as so do may have any thing of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They <hi>ravish his heart,</hi> Cant. 4. 9. that <hi>one eye</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> wins his heart; he is <hi>taken with it,</hi> as a Lover is with the beauty of <hi>that eye</hi> that he beholds, his heart is inclosed in <hi>that eye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>they</hi> that are very <hi>dear to Christ,</hi> Mat. 12. 49,50.&amp;what may not <hi>they have</hi> of him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are such as this King <hi>delighteth to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> and they may have <hi>great things</hi> done for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 26. See for illustration <hi>Esth.</hi> 6. 6,7.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers:</hi> 1. They are the <hi>breathings of his Spirit,</hi> he <hi>

                  <p n="2">2. They are the <hi>Requests of the Spirit,</hi> ibid and shall not the Spirits requests <hi>be heard?</hi> will not God <hi>condescend</hi> far to these?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are the <hi>groanings of the Spirit,</hi> ibid. when they <hi>cannot speak,</hi> he helps them <hi>to groan</hi> and he hears <hi>groans</hi> as well as <hi>words,</hi> Psal. 102.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are as <hi>Incense,</hi> Psal. 141. 2. and the smoke of that went upward.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>Odours,</hi> sweet in the nosthrils of God. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 They are <hi>perfumed with Christs Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>

Rev. 8. 3. and will not God condescend far, and do much for these Prayers?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see what <hi> co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendency</hi> we should use to those that are <hi>suiters</hi> and <hi>petitioners</hi> to us; we should be <hi>followers of God</hi> herein, and come off to them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and condescend all that ever we can to them: we cannot have a better pattern to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what a <hi>gracious God</hi> the Lord our God is, that does so farre condescend to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Suppliants when they sue to him in behalf of others: No gracious Prince like him, that stoops so <hi>low,</hi> and comes off so <hi>largely</hi> to them that sue to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what encouragement we have to <hi>improve Gods mercy</hi> in suing to him in behalf of others, for he <hi>condescends</hi> very farre to us when we speak in their behalf: he <hi>smiles</hi> upon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and gives the thing we sue for; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ask any thing, but we have it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see who must have the <hi>glory</hi> of what he grants, in so farre <hi>condescending</hi> to us in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of others, it is not from any <hi>worthiness</hi> of us that sue, or of those that are sued for, but of his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and he must have the glory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see the great <hi>humility</hi> of the Lord, that stoops so low to poor vile dust and ashes; it should make us wonder at it, <hi>Psal</hi> 113. 5,6. no
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:000111_0269_0FA02C704260BFD8"/>
humility like this of the great God towards such earth and clay as we are.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We see how <hi>precious</hi> Believers are in his eyes, that thus <hi>condescends</hi> to them in granting what they ask of him in behalf of others, and in coming down so <hi>low</hi> to their desires for them. Surely they are his <hi>Jewels,</hi> as he styles them <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. and very precious to him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We see that Believers Prayers are like <hi>sweet Odours,</hi> for else God would never <hi>condescend</hi> so low as he does to them, in hearing them for others as well as for themselves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. We see how <hi>low</hi> we should come down to him in every thing that he <hi>calls us</hi> &amp; <hi>commands us</hi> to <hi>perform:</hi> The very least of his Commandments we should stoop unto, and be willing to say, <hi>Here I am, Lord, Command what thou wilt, and through thy grace and help I will do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. We see that we may well <hi>stoop to him</hi> in a way of <hi>suffering</hi> what he calls us to, if it were to lay our neck to the <hi>Block</hi> for him, if it were to be <hi>Whipt</hi> and <hi>Rack'd</hi> for him, if it were to be <hi>spitefully used,</hi> and <hi>scorned,</hi> and <hi>spat upon,</hi> and <hi>scoffed,</hi> &amp;c. we may well bear it for him, that condescends so farre to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to Unbelievers, he will do nothing in such a way for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 3. <hi>for Humiliation,</hi> That we too much <hi>forget others</hi> in our Prayers, that we might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for.</p>

To <hi>long</hi> to be with him. 4. To <hi>do</hi> and <hi>suffer</hi> any thing for him. 5. To be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> when we come before him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He gives them leave to be <hi>very bold</hi> with him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. and therefore they go as far as ever they <hi>can</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> with him. If a man give another leave to be <hi>bold</hi> with him, he will try him so far as may be: So God giving us leave to be bold with him, hence it is that we may go as far as we <hi>dare</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>delights</hi> to see his children asking <hi>large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of him. Fathers love to have their children asking of them as far as they <hi>dare;</hi> and so does the Lord our Father: and that makes us so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ask so far of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He hath the <hi>bowels</hi> of all the <hi>dearest Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in him, and what is to be found in <hi>all of them,</hi> is infinitely more to be found in him, and therefore we may be willing to speak as far as we can to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He puts us on to ask <hi>great things of him,</hi> and would not have us <hi>confined</hi> to our own nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row desires, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 3. and Believers are willing to put him to it, and try him to the utmost.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>exceeds</hi> our desires, gives us <hi>more</hi> then we ask, as he did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Kings 3. 13. and therefore we may speak as far as we <hi>can</hi> or <hi>dare</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="265" facs="unknown:000111_0272_0FA02C752B476050"/>
6. He is displeased when we <hi>scant our desires</hi> to him. Look as the Prophet was angry with the King of <hi>Israel</hi> in sparing to <hi>smite on the ground,</hi> 2 Kings 13. 18,19. so the Lord will be angry when we <hi>spare to speak:</hi> we might <hi>have more,</hi> if we would <hi>speak more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the believing Suppliants:</hi> 1. They finde <hi>grace in his sight,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 33. 12. and who may speak freely and largely, if not they?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have found by experience that <hi>God hath come off largely to them,</hi> and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not scant their desires to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have encouragement to <hi>enlarge their desires,</hi> both by his Commandment and Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10. and what should then hinder?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>Princes with God,</hi> Gen. 32. 28 and being such, they may well speak largely, and ask all they can of him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They go to one that is both <hi>full and free,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. Jam. 1. 5. and therefore they may well enlarge their desires all that may be.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are his <hi>choice portion,</hi> Deut. 32. 9. his <hi>garden enclosed,</hi> Cant. 4. 12. that he drops abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly his blessings upon: The rest of the world may be <hi>parched,</hi> and <hi>dry as a wilderness,</hi> but they <hi>drink of the dew of heaven,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may gape wide, and enlarge their desires for those they make their supplication for.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="unknown:000111_0273_0FA02C75519B1480"/>
Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>heard for much,</hi> as well as for <hi>little,</hi> 1. Jo. 5. 14,15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>most accepted,</hi> when the suiters <hi>ask most,</hi> and when they speak as far as they can, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have <hi>prevailed with men,</hi> and God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>above men</hi> in giving liberally. We reade of <hi>half a Kingdome</hi> that they have come off with, <hi>Esth.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 23. but what's that to what God gives? <hi>Himself,</hi> his <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> his <hi>Heavenly Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are none of them <hi>lost,</hi> such Prayers are not <hi>turned away,</hi> Psal. 66. 20.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>the Souls Ambassadors,</hi> and they effect what they are sent about, and negotiate great things for us.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> besought the Lord, that if there were but <hi>ten Righteous</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> that he <hi>would not destroy it;</hi> and the Lord heard his desire to the <hi>utmost,</hi> and gave it in to him, and sayes, <hi>I will not destroy it for tens sake.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From the Believers. 3. From their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord</hi> 1. He is <hi>never weary of doing his people good;</hi> though they follow him therefore with suit upon suit, and go as far as they <hi>can</hi> in their <hi>desires,</hi> yet they <hi>cannot weary him,</hi> and therefore have the <hi>utmost</hi> of their desires given in to them. We may <hi>weary men,</hi> Prov. 25. 17. but not <hi>him,</hi> Isa. 40. 28. We sometimes are <hi>weary of him,</hi> Isa. 43. 22. but he is not <hi>weary of hearkning to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He can come up to the <hi>utmost</hi> of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: He is an <hi>Almighty One,</hi> Job 42. 2. and therefore can give all that we desire of him.</p>
                  <p n="3">

3. He hath put it into the hearts of some men to <hi>give to the utmost</hi> of what their Petitioners sue for, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did to the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> 1 Kin. 10. 13. and will not he then grant the requests of his Suiters to the <hi>utmost</hi> of what they desire of him? He is more <hi>Royal in giving</hi> then all the <hi>Royal Kings</hi> in the world put all together.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He hath commanded us to be <hi>liberal to our servants,</hi> Deut. 15. 13,14. and will not he then come off <hi>liberally</hi> to them that <hi>serve him,</hi> and <hi>pray unto him?</hi> surely he will come off to them to the <hi>utmost</hi> of their desires that they put up to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He <hi>fills every living thing, and satisfies their desires,</hi> Psal. 145. 16. and will he not then give in to Believers the <hi>utmost</hi> of their desires, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them? He will surely do it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He <hi>saves to the utmost,</hi> Hebr. 7. 25. and therefore <hi>grants to the utmost</hi> what his believing Suppliants sue unto him for.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. According to their <hi>faith</hi> they do <hi>receive mercy</hi> at the Lords hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 29. Now their <hi>utmost desires</hi> being put up in <hi>faith,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>that faith</hi> those desires are given in to them to the <hi>utmost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They <hi>please him by their faith,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. and if so, then surely he cannot but give the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>they</hi> that are <hi>highly commended</hi> even by God himself: How <hi>famously</hi> is <hi>Abraham</hi> spoken of, and renowned for his faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. and <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> and the <hi>Centurion,</hi> Luke 7. 9. and how should it be otherwise then, but that the Lord should give them in their desires to the utmost?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are men <hi>after his own heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as is said of <hi>David,</hi> that prime Believer, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 22. and what may not such have?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are <hi>they</hi> that are <hi>familiar with him,</hi> and keep up acquaintance with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. 22. and he will give them the <hi>utmost</hi> of their desires.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>they</hi> that have <hi>power with God,</hi> Hos. 12. 3,4. and therefore shall have to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> of their desires granted to them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From their Prayers,</hi> 1. They are <hi>argumentative prayers,</hi> and they prevail to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most:</hi> so were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>holy prayers,</hi> lift up with <hi>holy hands</hi> and an <hi>holy heart,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 8. Psal. 86. 2. so were <hi>Abrahams</hi> here.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. They are <hi>importunate prayers:</hi> so were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> here; and they are granted to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,</hi> Luke 11. 8.</p>

5. They are <hi>modest</hi> prayers: <hi>I will yet speak but this once,</hi> sayes <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>awfull</hi> prayers: <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry,</hi> sayes <hi>Abraham.</hi> And such prayers shall be heard to the utmost of our desires.</p>

<pb n="275" facs="unknown:000111_0282_0FA02C8385097978"/>
we leave off <hi>petitioning</hi> before he leave <hi>granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He hath his doors ever open, his <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> and <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> ever set up, that we may repair to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. and therefore our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires fail,</hi> sooner then his <hi>will to grant,</hi> because his <hi>doors</hi> are never shut, not his <hi>Mercy-seat</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver barred up, but we may go to it when we will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers themselves:</hi> 1. We have <hi>narrow hearts,</hi> and our desires are scant, and are not so full as his hand is in giving: He opens his hand <hi>wide,</hi> but we <hi>shut</hi> our hearts. Narrow mouth'd vessels receive in little, though it rain abundantly: such vessels are our hearts, were they more open, and more capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, we might have more; but the narrowness of our desires and hearts makes us <hi>leave off pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning,</hi> before he <hi>leave giving:</hi> even <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himself, though he had a larger heart then other men, yet had it <hi>more straitned</hi> then Gods hand was to give.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are apt to <hi>stint our selves,</hi> and to set <hi>bounds</hi> to our desires: <hi>I will speak yet but this once,</hi> sayes <hi>Abraham</hi> here. And we <hi>stinting our selves,</hi> hence it comes to pass that we sooner <hi>cease</hi> to make our requests, then the Lord to <hi>give out</hi> his grants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are afraid that he may be <hi>angry with us</hi> for asking him so much, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here was, and that <hi>shortens</hi> our desires, and <hi>bars up</hi> our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:000111_0283_0FA02C83CF06CD40"/>
so that we have sooner done petitioning, then the Lord hath in granting. The fear of a Princes <hi>anger</hi> stops his mouth that is to sue to him, and makes him lay by his Petition: so here.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are apt to make an insinuation of our <hi>modesty,</hi> that we would not go beyond <hi>due bounds</hi> in asking, and this makes us cease petitioning, before the Lord leaves off to grant: So did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> here, he was a modest suiter, <hi>I will speak</hi> (sayes he) <hi>yet but this once.</hi> So do modest suiters to men, that would give more if <hi>asked;</hi> and so do we to the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are apt to think that we may be <hi>too bold in asking,</hi> and that will cause us to cease our suits. They that make <hi>over-bold</hi> with Princes are not wise, and sometimes get a frown for it: Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> though he was bold with the Lord, yet he was afraid he might be <hi>too bold,</hi> and therefore gave over <hi>suing,</hi> before the Lord gave over <hi>granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are far short (even the best of us) of <hi>those bowels of mercy and compassion that are in God.</hi> We are made partakers of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to our <hi>measure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. but fall short, and as <hi>far short</hi> as <hi>finite creatures</hi> do of the <hi>Infinite One,</hi> in those Perfections that are in him, and in particular this of <hi>Mercy:</hi> and therefore though our bowels may work us up to <hi>desire much,</hi> yet it is nothing to what is in the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:000111_0284_0FA02C84D638F700"/>
Lord himself: ours are <hi>mites,</hi> but his <hi>Talents;</hi> ours are <hi>atomes</hi> and <hi>motes,</hi> but his like <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> ours like a <hi>candle,</hi> but his like the <hi>Sun;</hi> ours <hi>little rivulets,</hi> his like <hi>the great Sea.</hi> Now then his bowels being so <hi>full and large,</hi> and ours so <hi>scant,</hi> it is not to be marvelled at if we <hi>leave off petitioning,</hi> before he <hi>leave off granting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see how <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly we are engaged to the Lord</hi> for his mercy, in that he <hi>stops not our mouthes</hi> in praying to him, but lets it appear that we <hi>leave off petitioning</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>leaves off granting;</hi> he might justly <hi>turn away our prayer, and his mercy from us,</hi> but his Name is for ever to be praised for it, that he does it not: so <hi>David</hi> sayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 20. and so are we to say, and count our selves indebted to him, that will not deny us in <hi>any thing</hi> that we <hi>sue</hi> for, but so long as we pray, gives us in our desires, and lets us <hi>leave suing,</hi> before he <hi>leave granting.</hi> We are never able enough to <hi>exalt his Name</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see what an <hi>amiable,</hi> and <hi>bountiful,</hi> and <hi>royall One</hi> we have to do with, that ceaseth not to grant our desires that we put up to him, but we leave off <hi>suing,</hi> before he ceaseth <hi>giving.</hi> It is not thus with men, it is not thus with Princes, for though they come off royally to those that are in favour with them, and sue to them, yet they put a <hi>period</hi> to their grants: but our God
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:000111_0285_0FA02C85069593D0"/>
is more royal then they, for he does never cease giving, before we cease asking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see what <hi>narrow hearts</hi> we have, and how contracted our desires are, that we have sooner done <hi>asking</hi> then he hath in <hi>giving,</hi> that we <hi>leave off petitioning</hi> before he <hi>leave off grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> We are not <hi>straitned in him,</hi> but we are <hi>straitned in our own bowels;</hi> our hearts are not <hi>enlarged</hi> as God would have them, but we give over <hi>first,</hi> we are weary <hi>first:</hi> God would be willing to hear more of us, but we are willing to leave off, and to speak no more, or else God would not be tired out with our requests, how many soever they be that we put up to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see how abundantly he will satisfie us in a <hi>state of glory,</hi> that is so willing to fulfill our desires here, that we leave off suing before he leave off granting. There will be <hi>all satisfaction</hi> there: if he have more to give <hi>here</hi> then <hi>we ask,</hi> then surely when he gets us <hi>there,</hi> we shall have our <hi>fill of him,</hi> the desires of our hearts shall be abundantly satisfied; if he <hi>stream out</hi> here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our desires, what <hi>Rivers will slow</hi> in upon us there? if here he be <hi>above our desires,</hi> and hath more to give then we to ask; Oh how will the <hi>Sea</hi> break in upon us, to overflow all the bank<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bounds of our desires? there will be a <hi>spring-tide</hi> coming in amain upon us; there'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="unknown:000111_0286_0FA02C88D29D1360"/>
shaken together, and running over.</hi> If God hath more to give then we ask here; Oh what <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall springs</hi> and <hi>full Seat</hi> of satisfaction shall we there swim in, and like the <hi>Leviathan, play and sport in it</hi> to all eternity! Our desires are <hi>strait</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> here, but there as they are <hi>enlarged</hi> more abundantly, so they shall be abundantly <hi>filled,</hi> and every corner of them brim-full, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. 15. and therefore what <hi>longings</hi> and <hi>breathings</hi> should we have after Heaven? Our hearts are <hi>strait</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> here, but there they shall be <hi>large,</hi> and be in a capacity to take in more then ever we could here. We ask a <hi>little</hi> here, and cease; but there we shall receive in more then ever we <hi>asked</hi> or <hi>thought,</hi> Eph. 3. 20. We petition for <hi>a few things,</hi> and then give over; but then when we are in a state of glory, our Souls will be capable of taking in more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly then ever they could let out in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that if we have no more then <hi>we have,</hi> we cannot fasten any blame upon God, he is clear, <hi>The King and his Throne are guiltless;</hi> the fault is <hi>ours,</hi> that we <hi>leave off asking,</hi> before he <hi>leave off granting.</hi> We might <hi>have more,</hi> if we <hi>asked more;</hi> our desires are <hi>short,</hi> when the Lords hands is <hi>long;</hi> our Petitions are at <hi>an end,</hi> when his grants <hi>end not;</hi> we give over <hi>speaking</hi> in prayer, before he hath done <hi>answering:</hi> even

the best of men have sooner done in their suits, then the Lord hath in his royal gratuities: did we stretch out our desires more, we should finde his loving kindness more stretched out to us, and further put forth in the extent and latitude of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Use</hi> 2. <hi>for Terrour</hi> to those that <hi>ask not at all,</hi> what can they look for from the Lord? If Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers leave off petitioning before he leave off granting, and end their suits before he make an end of giving, what will become of those that <hi>never beg</hi> in their suits to him? There are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in the world that never put up a serious request to him; and if they never get any thing of him, what cause have they to complain? <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>I will speak yet but this once,</hi> sayes <hi>Abraham.</hi> He had made <hi>very bold</hi> with him in going from step to step, till he came to the <hi>lowest step</hi> that he durst go, and now in modesty he will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but leaves off suing any more; he will ask for <hi>Ten,</hi> but there he will make a stop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Believers. 2. From their Desires. 3. From the Lord that they have to do with.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Believers.</hi> 1. They know <hi>who God is,</hi> and <hi>who themselves are,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dare not be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him. He is <hi>a great God,</hi> and they <hi>vile dust and ashes,</hi> and how should they dare to press too much upon him? Mean men dare not be too bold with their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; how then can we that are Believers that are infinitely below the Lord, make too bold with him? <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> was lowly before <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he looked at himself, and all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, to be but <hi>dead men,</hi> and therefore thought he had no right to <hi>cry unto the King,</hi> 2. Sam. 19. 28. So Believers judge themselves,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:000111_0290_0FA02C8F84CAB328"/>
and therefore cannot tell how to be <hi>too bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are men of <hi>ingenuity</hi> and <hi>modesty,</hi> for faith ever keeps down the heart, and makes it low, and is opposed to <hi>pride,</hi> Hab. 2. 4. We see it in the <hi>Centurion,</hi> how humble and modest he was, and it was his <hi>faith</hi> that made him so, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 7,8,9. and therefore dare not be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him. Humble ingenuity dare not ask <hi>too much</hi> of men, much less be <hi>too bold</hi> with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Believers are <hi>wise and prudent men,</hi> and therefore <hi>faith</hi> is called <hi>wisdome,</hi> Luke 1. 17. and they would not shew themselves <hi>wise,</hi> if they should be <hi>over-bold</hi> with the Lord. Wise men will not be too bold with Princes, much less they that are <hi>truly wise</hi> make <hi>too bold</hi> with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are such as think themselves <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the least of his mercies,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. and therefore cannot tell how to be too bold with him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are afraid that the Lord may be <hi>angry with them:</hi> So the Text. And that makes them to be so humbly modest with him. [<hi>But of that more in the next Note.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are <hi>friends of God,</hi> Jam. 2 23. and <hi>they</hi> though they may be bold with their <hi>friends,</hi> yet will not be <hi>over-bold</hi> with them: So here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="unknown:000111_0291_0FA02C8FC77ECED8"/>
Secondly, <hi>From their Desires and Prayers:</hi> 1. They must be <hi>bounded</hi> within the compass of <hi>Gods will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14. and if we should be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him, we should go <hi>beyond those bounds,</hi> and that Believers will not do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They must be <hi>humble desires,</hi> Psal. 10. 17. and they would not be such, if we should be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They must be <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>sincere desires,</hi> not slight and formall; and if so, then we must not be <hi>too bold</hi> with him. A serious Petitioner will ask modestly of men; so they that are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious will be modest in their suits to the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They must be <hi>holy desires;</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>over-much boldness</hi> will not stand together, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. the <hi>more holy</hi> any man is, the <hi>more modest</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> he is.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They must be <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>fervent desires, Jam.</hi> 5. 16. and no man that is <hi>over-bold</hi> with man can be <hi>earnest</hi> in his suit, much less he that is <hi>too bold</hi> with the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They must be <hi>inwrought desires,</hi> Jam. 5. 16. the heart must be in them, <hi>lip-labour</hi> will not be accepted, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 2. Now they that are <hi>over-bold</hi> with the Lord, cannot speak in their desires from the heart, nor have any hope that such desires shall be accepted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Lord that we have to do with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">

1. He is <hi>a great God, and a great King above all gods,</hi> Psal. 95. 3. and it no way becomes the best of men to be <hi>over-bold</hi> with such a <hi>great One</hi> as he is, but to be modest in our <hi>addresses</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is a <hi>good God,</hi> Psal. 136. 1. and willing to give us that which is good for us, <hi>Psa.</hi> 84. 11. and therefore it's no way fit for us to take <hi>too much boldness</hi> upon us, there's no need of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is such a God as can be <hi>angry</hi> at our Prayers, when we keep not within his <hi>bounds,</hi> but make <hi>too bold</hi> with him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 4.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is very <hi>merciful</hi> in granting to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most our <hi>lawful requests</hi> that we put up to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and why should we strain him and serew him up higher? we would not do so with men, how much less should we with the Lord? <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is a God that <hi>respects the lowly,</hi> Psal. 138. 6. and such modest suiters are <hi>lowly ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. He wants neither <hi>will nor power</hi> to give what is meet, and therefore though we may be <hi>humbly bold</hi> with him, yet it's no way fit for us to press upon him, or to be <hi>over-bold</hi> with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we would not do so to the best friend we have in the world.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. We see how <hi>truly wise</hi> Believers are in the Petitions they put up to the Lord, they know <hi>who God is with whom they have to do,</hi> and <hi>who them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are,</hi> and therefore though they <hi>speak bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> yet they <hi>speak safely;</hi> they <hi>speak freely,</hi> but do not <hi>over-speak;</hi> they know how in modesty to make a <hi>stop,</hi> and to set <hi>bounds</hi> to their desires,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he made his <hi>last Request</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Righteous</hi> that he hoped might be in <hi>Sodom,</hi> is very tender of displeasing him: <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but this once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lrod. 2. From Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. 3. From the Requests themselves.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. Though he be not <hi>soon displeased,</hi> but <hi>slow to anger,</hi> especially with his own dear ones, yet he knows how to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with <hi>them,</hi> and with their <hi>prayers,</hi> as he was with <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prayer that he made, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 24,25,26. and therefore we had need be tender of displeasing him, when we make our <hi>last Petitions</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He <hi>wills</hi> that we should be bold with him in our <hi>Requests</hi> to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. but he would not have us put him beyond what he intends to do for us. <hi>Moses</hi> would have had him go <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his intentions,</hi> in the Prayer he put up, and God could not bear that. <hi>Abraham</hi> was afraid of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore is very tender of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him in this <hi>last Request</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="291" facs="unknown:000111_0298_0FA02C95090ABA50"/>
3. He is very <hi>free in granting</hi> what we desire <hi>according to his will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>15. but if we should go <hi>contrary to his will</hi> in what we desire, then he knows how to <hi>deny us,</hi> and will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at it; and we should be <hi>tender</hi> of that, as <hi>Abraham</hi> here was.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is very <hi>tender of us,</hi> of our <hi>Names,</hi> of our <hi>Estates,</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> of our <hi>Comforts</hi> for <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward man,</hi> every way <hi>tender of our good;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should be <hi>tender of displeasing him,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we pray to him, and when we bring our <hi>last Requests</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>tender of his own glory,</hi> Isa. 42. 8. and therefore we should be tender of it too, and tender of putting any dishonour upon him by displeasing him. We would be tender of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Prince: So here.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>tender of displeasing us,</hi> of sending us <hi>sad away</hi> from his Presence when we pray to him; and therefore when we pray to him, we should be very tender of displeasing him. We would be tender of displeasing any that were dear to us: So here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From the Believers.</hi> 1. They are <hi>his Children,</hi> and Children are tender of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their father; so are <hi>they,</hi> and so should <hi>they be,</hi> especially when they pray to him, and come with their <hi>last request</hi> in that duty before him, <hi>

2. They are <hi>his friends,</hi> Jam. 2. 23. and friends are <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing one another: so here.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>his Spouse,</hi> Cant. 5. 1. and a Spouse is <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing her Husband, especially when she is to ask any thing of him, and any <hi>great thing:</hi> So should we.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are very <hi>familiar with him,</hi> and <hi>he with them: [As I shall</hi>(God willing) <hi>shew when I come to the last Verse of this Chapter.]</hi> and they that are intimately familiar, they are <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing one another: So here.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are the <hi>Apple of his Eye</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure a <hi>touch</hi> of, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8. and if so, how should they endure to <hi>touch him</hi> by displeasing him, especially when they pray and desire some great thing of him?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are such as he hath <hi>rebuked Kings for,</hi> so tender they have been to him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 14,15. and may they not then be very <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing him, especially when they pray to him, and ask high of him?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>From the Requests themselves.</hi> 1. They are such as we <hi>hope to gain most by,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> here did, that came up so high, as to desire to prevail in his suit if there had been but <hi>ten</hi> found in that <hi>great place:</hi> and this made him to be so <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing the Lord that he prayed unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are such Requests as <hi>make tria<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

his Bounty and Mercy most,</hi> and whereby we put him to it to <hi>condescend very far</hi> to us in granting our requests; and therefore we ought to be <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are such Requests as whereby we are <hi>most bold with him,</hi> and therefore may well suspect our selves that we may <hi>over-speak,</hi> and so displease him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are such requests as are for <hi>great matters,</hi> and are <hi>great requests,</hi> and we are <hi>poor worms, vile dust and ashes,</hi> and therefore may and ought to be <hi>tender</hi> of displeasing him in so ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are such requests as are put up by them that are <hi>less then the least of his mercies,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. and therefore they may suspect that they may be <hi>too bold,</hi> and so displease the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are such requests as are <hi>rare,</hi> and <hi>sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome put up;</hi> we reade but of this <hi>onely man</hi> that went thus <hi>step by step</hi> in his requests: <hi>Abraham</hi> was the <hi>onely one,</hi> no other before him, nor scarce any since; and therefore he might justly sear that he might displease the Lord in what he did.</p>

                     <hi>Use</hi> 1. <hi>for Information.</hi> 1. We see the <hi>sweet disposition</hi> that's in believing suppliants when they come to pray before the Lord, they are very <hi>

<pb n="294" facs="unknown:000111_0301_0FA02BC74B974CE8"/>
to him, and make their <hi>last Request</hi> to him, they would not then provoke him; they would then have a <hi>smile of his face,</hi> they would then have a <hi>kiss of his mouth,</hi> they would then have an <hi>answer of peace,</hi> they would then have a <hi>sweet shine from heaven,</hi> they would then have <hi>fair weather over head,</hi> they would not have a <hi>cloud arise upon them,</hi> nor any <hi>frown appear in the Lords brow,</hi> nor any <hi>wrinkle in his face</hi> at their Prayers, but are very <hi>tender of displeasing him:</hi> So was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> here, when he said, <hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak but this once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We see that when a Believer is in a <hi>praying frame,</hi> he is then in an <hi>awfull frame,</hi> Gods <hi>dread Majesty,</hi> and his <hi>consciousness of his own sins,</hi> put an holy awe into his heart, and make him afraid that the Lord may be displeased with him. Prayer is an <hi>awfull Ordinance,</hi> and they that are most earnest in it (as <hi>Abraham</hi> here was) they are most <hi>awfully afraid,</hi> and most tender of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in the duty, especially in the close of it, that might displease him that they pray unto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We see that if we would make it out that we are <hi>Believers,</hi> we must be tender of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, (as at all times, so) then more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we pray to him, and in the close of our <hi>Requests</hi> that we present the Lord with. So did <hi>Abraham</hi> here, and if we would evidence
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:000111_0302_0FA02BC7E61344C8"/>
we are <hi>his children,</hi> so must we. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> go hand in hand, lodge in the same breast toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dwell in the same heart together; where the <hi>one is,</hi> there is <hi>the other;</hi> that man in whose heart <hi>faith is,</hi> is ever <hi>afraid,</hi> and <hi>tender of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing God,</hi> especially then when he makes his <hi>last</hi> and <hi>greatest request to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We see what a mercy of God it is to any of us, that we have <hi>hearts stricken with fear of displeasing God,</hi> especially when we pray before him, for thereby he evidenceth to us that we are <hi>Believers:</hi> for so <hi>Abraham</hi> did, he was tender of <hi>displeasing him</hi> in praying to him, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his <hi>last words</hi> that he spake in suing to him in their behalf that he prayed for. He would not have the Sun set in a Cloud at Even.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We see that the <hi>displeasure of God</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that is to be <hi>feared</hi> above all other things. Some there are that <hi>fear man,</hi> but there's <hi>a snare</hi> in that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 25. Some there are that are <hi>afraid of Princes,</hi> and what they can do against them, but <hi>they are in Gods hand,</hi> Prov. 21.1. and he knows how to be <hi>terrible to them,</hi> Psal. 76. 12. Some are <hi>afraid of Persecutors,</hi> but they <hi>can but kill the body,</hi> Luke 12. 4.

Concernments</hi> in the <hi>matters of this life;</hi> and <hi>holy duties</hi> (such as Prayer is) must give way to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. From the Lord. 2. From our selves. 3. From our other outward occasions and imployments.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He hath enjoyned and appointed to every one that they should be in <hi>some Calling,</hi> and that they should <hi>abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 20, 24. the <hi>greatest on Earth</hi> are not exempted: The <hi>Magistrate</hi> is to attend to <hi>his great Work,</hi> Rom. 13. 6. the <hi>Minister</hi> to his, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. and so of the rest. There's none must think to live <hi>an idle life</hi> without a Calling; he hath <hi>appointed to every man his work,</hi> Mark 13.34. he is the <hi>great Lord</hi> and <hi>Master</hi> that hath set every one his task; he will have us all be <hi>up and doing:</hi> We must not any of us think to live and <hi>do nothing,</hi> but to be busily imployed in our Callings for him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath of old <hi>shadowed out</hi> this to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, the <hi>clean beasts</hi> were not onely to <hi>chew the cud,</hi> but to <hi>divide the hoof,</hi> Lev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>. 11. 3. Now this <hi>dividing the hoof,</hi> holds out our <hi>right dividing</hi> between our <hi>general</hi> and <hi>particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and that one should not <hi>cross,</hi> or <hi>interfere with another,</hi> but diligently and carefully to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>duties of both.</hi> Our <hi>general Calling,</hi> and the duties of it must not justle out our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

                  <p n="3">3. We are not yet <hi>in heaven,</hi> but <hi>on earth,</hi> and therefore must attend on our <hi>outward occasions</hi> and <hi>businesses</hi> that we are called to.

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We need many things for the <hi>outward man,</hi> which by diligence in our <hi>ordinary Callings,</hi> through the blessing of God, are brought in to us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 4, 22. we get our <hi>daily bread</hi> by the labour of our hearts and hands, <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

and <hi>physick,</hi> and all necessaries by the Lords mercy are given in to us this way: <hi>The King himself is served by the field,</hi> Eccles. 5. 9. Gods <hi>crowning the year with his goodness,</hi> his <hi>steps dropping fatness,</hi> make our labours successful, and bring in all outward blessings to us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diligence in our <hi>Callings</hi> is <hi>that</hi> that God approves, and looks for from every one of us.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have <hi>Gods example</hi> in the <hi>first Creation</hi> set before us to follow, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. These imployments in our Callings are such as that we cannot <hi>live without them:</hi> Bread is called <hi>The staff of life,</hi> Isa. 3. 1. and Clothing is the <hi>health of life;</hi> and neither of these in an ordinary way can be had without <hi>labour.</hi>

These imployments in our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> are such, as that we cannot expect the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Lord</hi> upon us: <hi>The blessing of the Lord maketh rich;</hi> but it is when <hi>the hand is diligent,</hi> Prov. 10. 4, 22. otherwise there is no blessing of <hi>wealth,</hi> or <hi>increase</hi> promised.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These imployments in our <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> do fit us to come to God in <hi>spiritual duties,</hi> and fit us for his coming to us either by <hi>death</hi> or <hi>judgement,</hi> Luke 12. 42, 43, 44. and this is worth something.

If the <hi>love of the world</hi> be the great wheel that sets all a going, and puts our hands to labour in out Callings, we shall never please God, nor benefit our selves or others by what we do this way. The <hi>world</hi> is both <hi>an Harlot and a Witch;</hi> and if we lust after the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this <hi>Harlot,</hi> and suffer our selves to be taken with her <hi>eye-lids;</hi> if we seek after this <hi>Witch,</hi> as <hi>Soul</hi> did after the <hi>Witch of Ender,</hi> and bribe the Harlot and witch with the <hi>labour of our hands,</hi> we shall never do <hi>that</hi> that is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, nor <hi>that</hi> that we shall reap any good by, but <hi>pierce our selves thorow with many sorrows,</hi> and when we come to die, we shall say that <hi>we have laboured for the wind</hi> and have miserably deluded or Souls by courting such a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> and enquiring after such an <hi>old Witch,</hi> and taking so much pains to <hi>win the World, and lose our own Souls:</hi> and what a miserable bargain will that be to us? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26.</item>

Let such know, that <hi>the Curse is not farre from such men.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. <hi>Malac.</hi> 1. 8. 14.</item>
                     <item>3. We must take heed that in labouring in our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling, we do not spend our labour for that <hi>which satisfieth not. Isa.</hi> 55. 2. The truth is, these outward things that men labour for, will not satisfie, they are nor Bread that is of a filling nature. Hence <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 19. and therefore such labour turns to no profit: To <hi>eat, and not have enough by our labour; to earn wages, and put all in a bag with holes,</hi> is a judgement, <hi>Haggai</hi> 1. 6.</item>
                     <item>4. We must beware that we suppose not that <hi>Gain is Godliness,</hi> for that were a strange supposition; yet the holy Ghost tells us some such there are, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. We must not have such a supposition, nor go upon such a principle in labouring in our particular Calling. There are multitudes that labour for no other end but to get the Wealth of the world, as if that were the only thing that they were to minde; and that it is <hi>godliness enough,</hi> if they can but <hi>gain enough.</hi> But this is that which is a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some conceit, and favours of a base and fordid spirit, and comes from the earth, and will lead men to perdition an destruction: And the Apostle tells us that <hi>Godliness is great gain,</hi> in opposition to that supposition.</item>
                     <item>5. We must take heed that in labouring in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings we do not <hi>labour for our selves onely,</hi> but to do good with what we get by our labour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. Some there are <hi>wholly for themselves,</hi> and so they may but

pocket up for themselves, and fill their own Coffers, they never regard the helping and succouring of others: but God would have us to attend our particular Callings, and to labour in them so, that we may do good to others, especially to those that stand in need of our help. Christ himself tells us this, that <hi>the poor we have alwayes with us,</hi> and when we will we may do them good, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 7. intimating, that we are not to be all for our selves, but to do good to others that need. And so <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. 10. was <hi>forward to remember the poor.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. We must beware that in labouring in our Callings we spend not what we so get <hi>invioting and darkness,</hi> and upon our lusts. Many such there are, that get a great deal by labour in their Calling, but spend it all waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and prodigally, and consume it upon their lusts; and sometimes that they have got in a week or fortnight, they spend riotously in one day, or in one piece of day. We must take heed of this labour in our Calling, and what we get by a diligent hand, must be better laid out then upon our lusts, else we had as good have sate still, and done nothing.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Q. 1. <hi>How does it appear that our Prayer is a communing with God, and that his Answers are a communing with us?</hi> Let me speak to the <hi>first</hi> first, <hi>That our Prayer is a communing with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. 1. In that when we pray, we <hi>draw near to God;</hi> they that commune together, <hi>draw near</hi> first one to another: So <hi>Abraham drew near to God</hi> in Prayer, and so <hi>communed with God.</hi> [<hi>But of that I have fully spoken in the first Note.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that when we pray we <hi>come to a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled God,</hi> for else we could not familiarly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with him: <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> sayes the Prophet, <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>

                  <p n="4">4. In that when we pray we <hi>take hold of God. Isa.</hi> 64. 7. and they that take hold of one another and take one another by the hand, are in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="5">5. In that when we pray to God we are <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>Prevailers with him,</hi> Gen. 32. 28. with <hi>Hos.</hi> 12. 3, 4. and that shews that we commune with the Lord in the duty.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that when we pray to God we <hi>plead with him,</hi> and that holds out our communing with him. They that <hi>plead at the Barre</hi> before a Judge, commune with him: so they that plead with God. <hi>Job</hi> said, <hi>Job</hi> 16. 21. <hi>O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour:</hi> and 23. 3, 4. <hi>O that I knew where I might finde him, that I might come even to his seat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</hi> Prayer is <hi>pleading,</hi> and <hi>argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative pleading,</hi> &amp; that way we <hi>commune with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how does it appear that God communes with us in granting our Requests?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. In that when he grants our requests he <hi>listens to what we say</hi> when we pray, and <hi>answers us,</hi> and so <hi>communes with us;</hi> so does one man to another, and so does God to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that when he grants us our requests he <hi>smiles upon us,</hi> and accepts our prayers, as men do that commune one with another, I <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that when he grants our requests he <hi>draws near to us,</hi> Jam. 4. 8. as they do that have <hi>colloquy</hi> and <hi>communing</hi> one with another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that when he grants our requests he is

                     <hi>pleased with us,</hi> as they are that commune loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together one with another. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 10.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In that when he grants our requests he <hi>loves our company</hi> and <hi>fellowship,</hi> and gives us a pledge of it hereby, as they do that <hi>commune</hi> one with another. God and Believers are <hi>good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> Believers when they pray shew that they <hi>love</hi> Gods company; and God when he grants their requests shews that he loves theirs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In that when he grants their requests he declares that he <hi>respects</hi> and <hi>accepts their persons,</hi> as they do that lovingly converse together, and commune one with another, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. Princes will not grant their Petitions whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not in favour with them; but when they are accepted, and in favour, they may have any thing: So here.</p>
                  <p>Q. 2. <hi>What manner of communing is it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> 1. It is a <hi>serious communing;</hi> we are serious with God when we pray to him, and do not trifle with him: and he is serious with us when he grants us what we sue unto him for, he does not <hi>word it</hi> with us, but is very <hi>real</hi> with us, and sayes no more then he will certainly do for us: he <hi>will fulfil with his hand what he speaks with his mouth,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 24. Even <hi>Balaam</hi> (when guided by a better Spirit then his own) could say, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 19 <hi>God is not a man that he should lie, neither the son of man that he should repent: hath he said, and shall
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:000111_0324_0FA02BDFE68A1AA8"/>
he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?</hi> Men may say <hi>in word,</hi> and unsay what they have said <hi>in their deed,</hi> (so trifling, and vain, and false they are) but it is not so with God, he is <hi>serious</hi> in what he sayes, and will make good all he sayes in <hi>a promising way</hi> to us. If a Kings grant be given out, it is for his honour to see it performed, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. 12. <hi>I Darius have made a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, let it be done with speed:</hi> how much more will the Lord be serious with us when he gives out any grants to us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>comfortable communing</hi> when we pray we sweetly converse with him: <hi>sweet is thy voice,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. and when he grants our requests he sweetly converseth with us. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there any sweetness between the dearest relations, like <hi>that</hi> that is between the Lord and us, when we pray to him, and he grants our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests that we put up to him. There is much sweetness between <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>wife,</hi> between fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>childe</hi> in their communing together, but no sweetness like to <hi>that</hi> that is betwixt the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>us</hi> when we pray to him, and he grants our requests to us: Our prayers are <hi>sweet Odours,</hi> Rev. 5. 8. and his grants are so many <hi>sweet smiles</hi> of his face, and so many <hi>sweet kisses of his mouth,</hi> and so many <hi>amiable and sweet glances</hi> and <hi>casts of his eye towards us,</hi> or so many <hi>sweet words of his mouth,</hi> that like <hi>sweet wine chear our hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="318" facs="unknown:000111_0325_0FA02BE0A5ADA140"/>
3. It is an <hi>holy communing:</hi> if ever we be <hi>holy,</hi> it is so with us when we pray to the Lord, we lift up <hi>holy hands to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>holy hearts,</hi> 1 Sant. 4. 8. <hi>holiness becomes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> at all times,</hi> but then more especially when we pray to the holy One: and when the Lord grants our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests (as he is alwayes holy, so) he remembers his <hi>holy promise</hi> to us, and that <hi>holy Covenant</hi> that he hath made with us, and so our mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning is an holy communing. When two gratious ones are speaking and communing together, Oh what holy breathings are there ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered forth between them, their speeches are seasoned with holiness, and argue holy hearts: but when God and we commune together, there is no holiness like <hi>that,</hi> an holy God and an holy Soul breathe out much holiness in communing one with another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a <hi>friendly communing;</hi> we are <hi>friends to God</hi> (if believers,) <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 23. and when we pray in faith we friendly commune with him, and God is a friend to us: and when he grants our requests, he does like a friend to us, and in a friendly manner does commune with us. There is no friendship on earth, in all the communings that are between men and men, comparable to that friendly communing that is between God and us when we pray to him, and when he grants our desires to us. Great hath been that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:000111_0326_0FA02BE164C68148"/>
that hath been between some men, as both <hi>sacred and heathen stories</hi> tell us, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings together have been very friendly: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were very friendly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 26. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16, &amp; 20. 41. So <hi>Heathen Authors</hi> tell us of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias,</hi> of <hi>Pilades</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restes,</hi> that have been great friends, and been full of love one to another; but no friendship like to <hi>that</hi> that is between the Lord and the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; no friendly communings like theirs, when the Soul is in a praying frame, and when the Lord grants the desires of such a soul.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is an <hi>humble communing;</hi> when we pray, we <hi>humble</hi> and lay our selves <hi>low</hi> before God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did that looked at himself as <hi>vile dust and ashes:</hi> humility does alwayes become us, but never more then when we pray to the high God: we never behave our selves so humbly as when we speak to such a Prince as he is, and when God grants our requests he <hi>humbleth himself</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending to look at such vile worms as we are and to have respect to the petitions that we put up to him. God <hi>humbleth himself</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the things that are <hi>done in Heaven,</hi> when he looks at what the <hi>Angles</hi> and <hi>blessed Souls</hi> do for him, in praising and yielding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him: but when he beholds what is done <hi>upon Earth,</hi> by such as we are, and accepts our prayers, and grants us what we petition for.
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:000111_0327_0FA02BE28B414960"/>
Oh how low does he stoop, and how does he <hi>humble himself,</hi> that we may commune with him, and he vouchsafes thus to commune with us, and to be so familiar with us, we may well say, <hi>Who is a God like our God? Psal.</hi> 113. 5, 6. to be sure what ever our failings be, and how short soever we fall of humbling our selves before him, he exceedingly humbleth himself, and condescends and comes very low to us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>gracious communing;</hi> when we pray we utter gracious words; grace is in <hi>our lips,</hi> and grace bubbles from the fountain of <hi>our hearts:</hi> as we <hi>sing with grace in our hearts, Col.</hi> 3. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. When we pray, we pray <hi>with grace from our hearts,</hi> and hence it is that these two are coupled together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>a spirit of grace and of supplication.</hi> The same spirit that is a spirit of <hi>supplication,</hi> is a spirit of <hi>grace</hi> in us. But when the Lord hears us, and grants our requests, and that way communes with us; Oh how gracious is he to us! <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 27. There are gracious communings between man and man sometimes, so as that they are in heaven together upon earth; but there are no such gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings as is between the Lord and us, when we pray and he grants.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a <hi>glorious communing.</hi> Oh <hi>the divine lustre</hi> that is in our faces sometimes when we have been at Prayer! Oh the <hi>glorious beauty</hi> that
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:000111_0328_0FA02BE2E39325B0"/>
is then seen in our very countenances! look as it was with Christ himself, so it was with us: it is said of him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 29. <hi>as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered;</hi> there was great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seen upon it; so it is with us sometimes when we pray there is a kind of <hi>heavenly glory</hi> sparkles in our faces, and when he grants our requests, and communes that way with us, Oh how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is he in his grace and mercy to us! how gloriously does he dispense himself to us? it is a glorious communing: he glorifies himself, and puts glory upon us thereby.</p>
                  <p>Q. 3. <hi>Why will God be so familiar with us, and suffer us to be so familiar with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> First, <hi>From the Lord.</hi> 1. He is <hi>Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8. and they that are most loving, will be most familiar with them that they love. Now God being <hi>originally, primarily, eminently, transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, essentially, everlastingly love</hi> to his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones; hence it is that he is so familiar with them, as to commune in so friendly a way with them Love is ever the <hi>efficient procreant and conserving cause</hi> of familiarity between man and man, and Gods love is <hi>that</hi> that makes him so familiar as to commune with us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>abundant in goodness,</hi> Exod. 34. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. and the more a man abounds in goodness, the more familiar he will be to those that are dear to him, he will commune with them, and make himself
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:000111_0329_0FA02BEB92313230"/>
very familiar with them: an so it is with the Lord, his <hi>abundant goodness</hi> make him have sweet familiarity, so as to commune with us, though we be sinful <hi>dust and ashes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is such an one as <hi>humbleth himself</hi> in an <hi>unparallel'd way,</hi> Psal. 113. 5, 6. and humble ones are very familiar with those they delight in. Proud persons scorn to be familiar with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, but humble ones will come low this way, they will take their inferiours by the hand, and talk &amp; commune familiarly with them; how much more will God do it, who does so humble himself that none may be <hi>compared to him therein?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is a <hi>Father in Christ Jesus</hi> to us, and therefore will be familiar with us: Fathers are familiar with their children, will <hi>speak</hi> familiarly, and <hi>commune</hi> with them, and <hi>grant</hi> their desires; so will the Lord familiarly commune with us, and grant us our desires that we ask of him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14, 15. there's no father on earth that will be so familiar with his children, as he will be with us. though there be such an infinite distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is <hi>an Husband to us,</hi> Isa. 5 4. 5. and there's <hi>no greater familiarity</hi> in the world then is <hi>between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

familiarly conversed with her, that shee might have any thing that shee desired of him, <hi>Esth.</hi> 5. 3. and what then may not we expect from the Lord, that doth more familiarly commune thus with us then any husband in the world that is most dear to his spouse?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He is <hi>our friend,</hi> Cant. 5. 19. and therefore is so sweetly familiar with us. A friend will be very familiar, so will the Lord be, and give us all we sue unto him for; Friendship carries famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity ever along with it. A friend is as dear as a mans own soul, and lies next the soul, and will be familiar whoever is not; such a friend is the Lord, he will be familiar with us, and though he will be reserved to others, and carry himself as a stranger to them, yet he will be very familiar with his own.</p>
                  <p>But in the second place, <hi>Why will he suffer as to be so familiar with him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We are those that are a people <hi>near to him,</hi> Psal. 148. 14. and though sometimes we were <hi>far off,</hi> are made <hi>nigh</hi> by the blood of Christ <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 13. and will he not suffer us that are so <hi>nigh him</hi> to be familiar with him? he will surely let us commune in a familiar and friendly way with him. They that are near the King, as <hi>they of the Council</hi> and <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> be, they may speak familiarly to him and bring <hi>their Petitions</hi> before him: So may we that are <hi>so nigh to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="324" facs="unknown:000111_0331_0FA02BEDD75D5A90"/>
2. We that are believers are they that finde favour in his eyes, and to whom he holds out the <hi>golden scepter</hi> of <hi>his grace,</hi> as that King did to <hi>Esther,</hi> Esth. 5. 2. and therefore may draw near, and touch the top of <hi>the Scepter as she did,</hi> and make our Petitions boldly and familiarly to him. They that are in favour with <hi>a Prince</hi> may be familiar <hi>with him,</hi> and He of his Princely grace will suffer them so to be: how much more may we that are <hi>in favour</hi> with God, who is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi> above all the gracious Princes in the earth for <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are they that he will admit to greatest and sweetest familiarity in <hi>another world,</hi> that he will lay us in his <hi>everlasting arms,</hi> and put us in his <hi>bosome;</hi> no familiarity will be like that, when we shall be ever with the Lord, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 17. and see his face, and be transformed into his <hi>Image,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 2. Now God would give as a pledge of that then by suffering us to be familiar with him now. [<hi>But of this I shall speak more when I come to the Uses.</hi>]</p>

4. It is great comfort to Believers that the time is <hi>hasting</hi> when (as they have had sweet communings with the Lord here, so) they shall enjoy everlasting communion with him in glory: It is but a little while, and the time will be when <hi>we shall be ever with the Lord:</hi> when a few dayes are come, we shall have other manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings with him, and he with us, then now we have. As Dr. <hi>Taylour</hi> sometimes said, with rejoicing, <hi>within two stiles, and I shall be at my Fathers house;</hi> so after a little time we shall go to God, where we shall be better acquainted with him, and be more familiar with him: that though our communings together he very <hi>sweet</hi> here, yet ere long we shall have <hi>sweeter</hi> fellowship one with another: here we have some <hi>smiles,</hi> and <hi>kisses,</hi> and such communings as put us in Heaven; but within a little time we shall have more: after a few wearisome <hi>agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conflicts</hi> with enemies and troubles, we shall rest in his armes, and be alwayes in his presence, and lye next his heart, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munings we shall then have together, we shall then know when we come to the happy enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our God, then <hi>all tears shall be wiped from our eyes,</hi> all sorrows removed from our hearts, all burthens taken from our shoulders, we shall <hi>sigh no more,</hi> nor <hi>weep no more,</hi> nor <hi>feel pain any more,</hi> nor <hi>sin any more;</hi> no <hi>Devils</hi> shall

To end in a word or two more; after we have been tossed with <hi>tempest</hi> a little while, we shall come to the <hi>Haven;</hi> after we have been in the <hi>battel</hi> we shall gain the <hi>victory;</hi> after we have <hi>wrestled,</hi> we shall win and wear the <hi>Crown;</hi> and after a few <hi>embraces</hi> in the arms of God here, in our fellowship that we have with him in this world, we shall be <hi>clasped</hi> in his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting arms, and be <hi>kissed</hi> and <hi>embraced</hi> by him to all Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Quest. <hi>But how shall we come to know that this happy condition shall be ours?</hi>

By our <hi>Holiness,</hi> Matth. 5. 8. 1 John 3. 2, 3. <hi>Holy</hi> here, <hi>Happy</hi> hereafter: <hi>Without Holiness we shall never see God,</hi> Hebr. 12. 14. but if we be <hi>holy</hi> in body and spirit, we shall see him with comfort, and have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting fellowship with him. <hi>Holiness</hi> is the <hi>Beauty of Heaven,</hi> for they are <hi>all holy</hi> there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none that are <hi>defiled</hi> come into the <hi>holy

 place,</hi> Psal. 24. 3, 4. No <hi>Leper</hi> was to come into the <hi>holy Camp</hi> of old; even <hi>Miriam</hi> her self, till she was healed, must be <hi>shut out,</hi> Numb. 12. 14. how much more then must all defiled <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Souls</hi> be shut out of Heaven? Look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to our <hi>Holiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By our <hi>Uprightness of heart,</hi> Psal. 15. 1, 2. Hypocrites shall be <hi>cast out,</hi> and <hi>rejected,</hi> Mat. 7. 23. they cannot escape the damnation of Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 33. they <hi>heap up wrath,</hi> Job 36. 13. But they that are <hi>upright,</hi> as they have <hi>good things</hi> in possession here, so they shall be happy in another world; as they walk <hi>surely</hi> here, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 9. so they shall be sure of a <hi>blessed state</hi> in glory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By our <hi>Obedience,</hi> Matth. 7. 21. Heb. 5. 9.

                     <p n="4">4. By our <hi>Victory over our sins, and other Enemies,</hi> Revel. 3. 21. Conquerours win the Crown and wear it. They that overcame in the <hi>Olympick Games</hi> got the <hi>Prize,</hi> and had

Look to this therefore, that we quit our selves like men, and hold out to the last.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By our <hi>love</hi> to God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 12. if <hi>eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive what God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> in Gospel promises here, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. then surely <hi>no eye ever saw, nor ear ever heard, neither ever came it into the heart of man to conceive the things that he hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> in another World in glory.
