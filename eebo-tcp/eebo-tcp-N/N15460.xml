            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>SOME time ago Ariſtides addreſſed you on a motion which had been made in the houſe of delegates for a removal of the ſeat of government; he was inſtantly attacked by a pair of writers, whoſe chief aim ſeems to have been to depreciate his character. There is, however, a third, who expreſſes a regard for decency, who premiſes that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have like a gentleman, and examine the reaſons of Ariſtides with candour and moderation; it is to him only that Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thinks proper to reply.</p>
               <p>In the Farmer's ſecond paragraph, he ſeems to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the promiſe he had juſt before made; he taxes Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des with ſiniſter ambitious views, and with feeling a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant pleaſure in the proſpect of preventing a great public good. Let us then examine this matter, as he ſays, with the "critical eyes of unerring truth."</p>
               <p>From whom flowed the propoſition to the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly? Who are the men that clamour for the meaſure? The community at large, feeling no inconvenience, were content that things ſhould remain as they are, and, without the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Farmer and his coadjutors, would not have probably thought of a change. The citizens of Annapolis were oppoſed to their own deſtruction; no ſhadow of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been offered to demonſtrate, that by quietly giving up their intereſts, they would have a merit in ſacrificing to the public good. Notwithſtanding all this, the Farmer, for their conduct on this occaſion, reproaches them for yielding to the "never failing influence of private intereſt." No practice is more common with mankind, than that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning in their neighbours the faults moſt conſpicuous in themſelves; it ariſes from the vain expectation of deceiving the world. But the Farmer's intelligent readers muſt have anticipated me in the remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:019698_0003_0FADA349CD054080"/>
Has the Farmer then, by his firſt publication, given a ſatisfactory anſwer to the reaſons of Ariſtides reſpecting the power of the legiſlature? He has choſen for his publication that paper which has the moſt general circulation, the editor of which had refuſed a place to Ariſtides; he ſometimes quotes part of a ſentence from Ariſtides, but it is impoſſible for his readers, from his ſtate, to comprehend what was the reaſoning of Ariſtides. It is on theſe conſiderations that Ariſtides adopts this mode of publication, in which he will recapitulate ſome of his former obſervations, and add ſuch remarks as have ſince occurred on a more mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The 9th article of the declaration of rights directs, <q>that a place for the meeting of the legiſlature ought to be fixed, the moſt convenient to the members thereof, and to the depoſitory of the public records; and the legiſlature ought not to be convened, or held, at ony other place, but from evident neceſſity.</q> The 61ſt and laſt clauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and form of government, directs the firſt legiſlature to meet at Annapolis, on Monday the tenth of February 1777. I contend, that from the true conſtruction of that article and this clauſe, taken together, Annapolis is the place fixed for the meeting of the legiſlature; and that a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attention to every other part of the declaration and conſtitution, which has any relation to the ſubject, will evince my poſition.</p>
               <p>If the convention did not mean, by theſe two parts, to fix the legiſlature at Annapolis, it is extremely probable that the 61ſt clauſe would have gone further, and directed the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature "then and there to appoint a place where it ſhall be convened in future;" or, "then and there to appoint a place where it ſhall be held during the war, after which a place ſhall be fixed, agreeably to the 9th article of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration."</p>
               <p>The ſureſt way of finding the true conſtruction of a law, admitting of two conſtructions, is to examine the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of each, and this conſtruction is to be made, from examining and comparing all the different parts. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and the form of government I conſider as making one law, or which is the ſame thing, as conſiſting of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of laws, all having relation to each other, and made by one body of men, at one meeting.</p>
               <p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, What poſſible inconvenience or incongruity can flow from my conſtruction? Can it be conceived, that an injury can reſult to the community by continuing the ſeat of a government at a place where it has ſo long been held, until two general aſſemblies ſhall concur in an act for its removal? It may indeed be urged, that a wiſe, politic aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, may ſometimes paſs an act tending greatly to the public good, and their immediate ſucceſſors may be ſo blind, or ſo perverſe, as to with-hold their concurrence; be it ſo; ſuppoſe then the ſeat of government removed by this ſingle wiſe, politic aſſembly, May not their unworthy ſucceſſors, by another ſingle act, undo what they have done? And, if that ſhould be the caſe, would it not be infinitely better that the thing never had been done?</p>
               <p>In ſupport of my conſtruction, I maintained, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in the declaration of rights, laid down rules and maxims for their own government, whilſt afterwards they ſhould be framing the conſtitution, as well as for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all future legiſlatures, whilſt they ſhould be framing laws; and that part of the 61ſt clauſe of the one was made in obedience to the 9th article of the other. To this I am told, <q>that it would be abſurd for a body of men to preſcribe rules for their own government.</q> If ſo, then almoſt every body of men, who have aſſembled upon any great and extraordinary occaſion, to enter into reſolutions which were to have the force of laws, have acted abſurdly; for it has been an univerſal practice with ſuch aſſemblies, in the firſt place, to lay down certain principles, agreeably to which their after reſolves were to be framed. Advert only to the proceedings of the congreſs and of your late commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, and to the proceedings of the late popular meetings in Ireland. The declaration of rights contains a variety of ſuch principles, rules and maxims, that were manifeſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the direction of the convention in framing the conſtitution, to which that declaration is a ſpecies of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble. The 5th article aſſerts, that elections ought to be frequent; the conſtitution accordingly directs the election of delegates to be annual, &amp;c. The 6th article maintains, that the legiſlative, executive, and judicial powers of government, ought to be for ever ſeparate and diſtinct from each other; this two is amply provided for by the conſtitution. Again, the 31ſt article maintains, that a long continuance in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019698_0005_0FADA34B426290B0"/>firſt-executive departments of power and truſt is dangerous to liberty; accordingly, the conſtitution directs the governor and council to be annually elected, and does not permit any man to act as governor more than three years out of ſeven.</p>
               <p>Theſe inſtances muſt certainly eſtabliſh my principle, that the declaration was intended as a guide to the convention in forming the government, as well as to all future legiſlatures in framing laws. To me the convention appears to have acted in this reſpect, as in almoſt every other, like ſage and enlightened law-givers; and it would be extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if the important direction contained in the 9th article of rights ſhould have been neglected by the convention, when they muſt have known it to be impoſſible (as I ſhall hereafter ſhew,) for any ſucceeding legiſlature to put it into execution.</p>
               <p>Some perſons affect to conſider this 61ſt clauſe, as no part of the conſtitution. This is pleaſant enough! If I attempt to prove, by ſerious argument, that which is evident in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I may perhaps induce a belief, that there was ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for the ſuggeſtion. It is indeed unlucky, that the 61ſt clauſe was not placed immediately after thoſe other clauſes which reſpect the legiſlature, as the title which it claims to be conſidered as a part of the conſtitution, would have then been clear and indefeaſible.</p>
               <p>Say they, the firſt meeting of the legiſlature, under that proviſion, was only for a particular purpoſe; it was merely to introduce the new government, by appointing an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and by filling the other offices. If we admit this, and if the convention, by this 61ſt clauſe, did not intend to fix the place of holding the legiſlature, after that firſt meeting the conſtitution remained almoſt as defective as it was before, becauſe no place was yet appointed for holding the firſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, to be elected agreeably to the antecedent parts of the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Such would be one conſequence of the conſtruction of the Farmer, and his aſſociates; attend to another, agreeably to theſe antecedent parts of the conſtitution, there could be no election of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ate until the third Monday in September 1781, of courſe, there could be no meeting of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional legiſlature until the firſt Monday in November in that year, and yet the houſe of delegates was to be choſen five times before that period, on the firſt Monday in October in the years 1777, 1778, 1779, 1780, and 1781; in the four firſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019698_0006_0FADA34C164C7348"/>years then, the delegates were to be choſen to no purpoſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; in the fifth year, indeed, they might meet the ſenate, if they would know where to find them. If the convention which was framing, as they thought, a complete form of government, could appoint the firſt conſtitutional meeting of the legiſlature at a period five years diſtant, and could leave the place of their firſt meeting to be aſcertained by tacit and common conſent, they muſt have committed an overſight which no individual of common ſenſe could have poſſibly been guilty of.</p>
               <p>I agree, nay, I ſtrenuouſly maintain, that the 61ſt clauſe was intended to give life to the new government, and that the conſtitution was a dead letter without it. How is this done by my opponents conſtruction? Why the people are to meet for the purpoſe of chooſing a ſpecial aſſembly, which is to meet on a ſpecial day to do a particular thing, viz. to appoint all the officers of the government, which government may then go on; advert again, I beſeech you, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which I have juſt pointed out, and ſay, whether a conſtruction, which involves ſuch conſequences, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be right.</p>
               <p>I appeal now to thoſe, who without prejudice or prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, will attentively peruſe the whole ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether the following be not the plain and obvious meaning of the convention, in the 61ſt clauſe of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We have already, by the 15th clauſe, directed the electors of the ſenate to meet on the 3d Monday in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1781; and we have directed the people to chooſe their immediate repreſentatives annually, on the firſt Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in October; now, as the third Monday in September 1781 is diſtant almoſt five years, it is neceſſary for us to make a further proviſion, for giving life to that ſyſtem which we have contrived with ſo much care and attention; we have likewiſe, hitherto, omitted to fix the place of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the legiſlature, which the legiſlature to ſucceed us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, as all their acts are liable to be immediately after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, either by themſelves or their ſucceſſors; we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, by directing the people to chooſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the ſenate on the 25th of November next, who are to meet at Annapolis on the 9th of December next, to elect the ſenate; and by directing the people in each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019698_0007_0FADA34CB3E7EB08"/>chooſe their delegates on the 18th of the ſame month. The aſſembly, ſo choſen, is to meet at Annapolis on Monday the 10th of February next, and then, or at ſome future ſeſſion, one principle part of their buſineſs muſt be to appoint the executive, and all the other officers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the firſt time. We thus direct the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the legiſlature, for which it is plain, from the 15th clauſe, that we had reſerved ourſelves until this laſt clauſe, we fix the place of their meeting; and it is thus we complete our great and arduous undertaking.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I repeat again and again, the new government could not have been introduced without appointing the place for the general meeting of the legiſlature; this 61ſt clauſe is as much a part of the conſtitution as if it had been placed in the centre, and the conſtitution having once appointed a place for holding the legiſlature, it becomes fixed at that place in the manner intended by the 9th article of rights. It is indeed of importance to the Farmer to prove this 61ſt clauſe to be no part of the conſtitution, and that it makes no permanent proviſion, becauſe the ſeat of government may then be removed without the odious formality preſcribed for aboliſhing or altering any part of the declaration, and the form of government; but, accuſtomed as I am to confident aſſertions at the bar, this propoſition has more amazed me than any thing I ever yet have heard.</p>
               <p>Is this 61ſt clauſe no part of the conſtitution, becauſe it preſcribes the mode in which the new government is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence? Or is it no part, becauſe without it the government never could commence? I beſeech you, my countrymen, to reflect ſeriouſly what could have been done without it; you might have aſſembled on the firſt Monday in October 1777, to chooſe your delegates, but that would have been fruitleſs, becauſe they could enact no law without the ſenate, and the electors of that branch were not to be aſſembled until the 3d Monday in September 1781. Well, the year 1781 at laſt arrives, and both branches are elected; but where ſhall they meet, no place being named by the conſtitution? It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely probable a majority will repair to Annapolis, under the expectation of there meeting their fellow members. By what authority are they to ſit there? It is propoſed to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and make an ordinance for the purpoſe; to this it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <q>the 9th article of rights requires the place for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But this conſtitution, which has ſo long deferred our firſt meeting, has enjoined a thing which its own neglect has rendered impoſſible. The beſt thing we can do, is to go back to our conſtituents, and adviſe them to appoint another convention, either to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete this form of government, or to frame an entire new ſyſtem.</q> Says a third, <q>I accede to your conſtruction of the 9th article, it contains a proviſion which appears founded in policy, and dictated by experience, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not join in your inference; I rather conclude, that as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napolis was always the ſeat of the proprietary government; as it contains every public building requiſite for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as every convention has met at that place; as this very article, and the ſubſequent conſtitution, was framed there; as this place ſeems to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with a favourable eye by the 37th article, which ſecures it in all its rights, privileges and benefits; thoſe circumſtances induce me to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> from a fair and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive conſtruction of the whole, that Annapolis muſt have been conſidered, by the founders of the conſtitution, as the place fixed for the meeting of the legiſlature.</q> I acknowledge, continues he, <q>from the 15th clauſe of that conſtitution it would appear, that the framers did not think the place as yet fixed, or at leaſt, that they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the point not yet abſolutely ſettled, becauſe, they ſay the electors ſhall meet at Annapolis, or ſuch o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>er place as ſhall be appointed for convening the legiſlature. It appears from that very clauſe, that they did not perform every thing they intended; they ſurely could not have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the houſe of delegates to be elected four times before the ſenate. However, as it is, we muſt make the beſt of it; and it is better to give ſuch a conſtruction as will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, than ſuch a one as muſt ſet aſide, the conſtitution under which we have here aſſembled to act.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch a manner would the members of the firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional aſſembly have probably debated, had the 61ſt clauſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019698_0009_0FADA34E52BD39D8"/>never been framed, and had it been poſſible for the people of Maryland to have remained without government, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adminiſtration of law, during the whole of the memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interval between the 11th of November 1776, when the laſt convention was diſſolved, and the firſt Monday in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1781, on which day the firſt meeting of the ſenate, according the 15th clauſe, was to take place.</p>
               <p>But my antagoniſts may aſk, <q>Why make theſe unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuppoſitions? Although the proviſion, which you call the 61ſt clauſe, be no part of the conſtitution, it was a neceſſary meaſure of the convention, to give motion to the government they had juſt fabricated.</q> This expoſition will not ſerve their turn, becauſe, if this proviſion were no part of the conſtitution, it was abſolutely void, for it gives the firſt appointment of the officers of government to the legiſlature, and the conſtitution had juſt before conferred that power on the executive only.</p>
               <p>Attend now to the Farmer, he alleges the meeting of the legiſlature under this 61ſt clauſe, to have been <q>ſpecial, for a ſpecial purpoſe, and to do a particular piece of buſineſs; that the intention of it has long been fulfilled; that its operation now ceaſes to exiſt; that it does not expreſsly, or by implication, enjoin the legiſlature to meet at Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, at any time thereafter; that the meeting was not on the day preſcribed by the conſtitution for its annual meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</q> From all this I infer his opinion, that the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, at that meeting, could only appoint the executive, and other officers of government; that when this particular piece of buſineſs was diſpatched, this ſpecial aſſembly ought to have been diſſolved, and, of courſe, that no place could have been appointed by that general aſſembly for the meeting of the conſtitutional general aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Let it be recorded on your minds, and ſuffer me to repeat once more, this conſtitutional general aſſembly could not have met before the firſt Monday in November 1781, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, independent of this 61ſt clauſe, the firſt meeting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the electors of the ſenate, was to take place on the 3d Monday in September 1781; according then to his expoſition of this 61ſt clauſe, the general aſſembly was to chooſe a governor and his council; For how long? For the reſidue of the year, ſays the clauſe. They were likewiſe to fill, in the firſt inſtance, all the offices in the diſpoſition
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019698_0010_0FADA34F0C0EFD88"/>of the governor and council; For how long? Some of them, ſays the antecedent conſtitution, are of annual appointment, but the judges are to hold their offices during good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Let us ſee then how all this will work, and what is the conſequence of the Farmer's expoſition. The ſpecial aſſembly is diſſolved. The conſtitutional general aſſembly cannot meet, as I have before inculcated, until November 1781. The governor and council drop off at the end of the year, which is the ſecond Monday for the governor, and the ſecond Tueſday for the council, in November 1777; all officers of annual appointment, muſt likewiſe ceaſe to act about the ſame time. Well then, Who are left to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the public affairs? In ſuch a caſe, it would indeed be a "fine thing to be a judge," becauſe there would perhaps be a neceſſity for the judges to exerciſe, not only the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, but the legiſlative and executive powers of government. Such would be the bleſſed conſequences of conſtruing the 61ſt clauſe as no part of the conſtitution, and of limiting the power of that ſpecial aſſembly to the appointment of the officers of government. I think myſelf then moſt clearly warranted in denying, that the conſtitution, without the clauſe, would have been a "perfect code of conſtitutional juriſprudence;" and yet, with the Farmer's expoſition, this clauſe made the matter hardly a jot the better.</p>
               <p>As few of my readers can have an opportunity of peruſing the conſtitution, I will give them ſo much of the 61ſt clauſe as it is neceſſary they ſhould ſee for the purpoſe of forming a judgment on this point. Here are the words: <q>61. That to introduce the new government, an election be held for the electors of the ſenate on Monday the twenty-fifth of November in this preſent year, and that the electors of the ſenate meet at Annapolis on Monday the ninth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember in this preſent year, and there chooſe ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and that an election be held on Wedneſday the eighteenth of December, for delegates to ſerve in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly, and for ſheriffs; and that the ſaid elections be made by ſuch perſons, in the ſame manner, and under the ſame qualifications, as ſuch elections are <hi>herein</hi> before directed to be made, at the periodical times before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the returns of all which firſt elections ſhall be made to the council of ſafety for the time being; and the general aſſembly ſhall meet at A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>It may not be unworthy of remark, that in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the convention, each clauſe or ſection of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is numbered, and this is numbered among the reſt, ſo that not Ariſtides only, but the convention itſelf, has deemed this a clauſe of the conſtitution, and not merely an after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. The convention having gone through the whole, paragraph by paragraph, declared the whole, at one time, to be the conſtitution and form of government. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible then is the aſſertion, that this very neceſſary clauſe is no part of the conſtitution!</p>
               <p>The Farmer obſerves, <q>that the legiſlature has, from time to time, been held at Annapolis for the convenience of the buildings, by common conſent, without the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having, by any act, determined that ſpot for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent reſidence.</q> Would not any perſon, unacquainted with the hiſtory of our tranſactions, ſuppoſed this firſt ſpecial aſſembly was actually diſſolved, after appointing the officers of government? That no other meeting of a legiſlature took place, until the time appointed for the conſtitutional meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I have before ſhewn could not, agreeably to the Farmer's conſtruction of this clauſe, have taken place until the firſt Monday in November 1781? And that, at this firſt conſtitutional meeting, the members aſſembled, by tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at Annapolis?</p>
               <p>Very different from all this is the truth. This ſpecial le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, elected for a particular purpoſe under this ſpecial proviſion, which is called no part of the conſtitution, did not confine themſelves to that particular piece of buſineſs; they conſidered themſelves conſtitutionally choſen; that the power of the ſenate was to continue until that meeting of the electors which is preſcribed by the 15th ſection; and that the houſe of delegates was to continue until the firſt Monday of October in the following year, when another election was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019698_0012_0FADA3506E1EC728"/>to take place, under the conſtitution. Accordingly, they not only performed this particular piece of buſineſs, but they actually ſat near three months; and, if I be not egregiouſly miſtaken, the Farmer aſſiſted at their deliberations. In that length of time they paſſed a variety of laws, ſome of which are ſtill in force. They adjourned until ſome day in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing June, without naming a place; they met at the time appointed at Annapolis, and paſſed other laws, and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed until ſome time in September, when their meeting was prevented by an invaſion of the enemy. The ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate met the houſe of delegates, conſtitutionally elected, on the firſt Monday in October 1777, 1778, 1779, and 1780, and no perſon has ever preſumed to arraign them for having uſurped an authority. In all that time the general aſſembly never thought of appointing the place of their own meeting, and for this plain reaſon; I preſume, that they conceived the place fixed, and reaſoned on the declaration and form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment juſt as I do. <q>The declaration ſays, the place of our meeting muſt be fixed; the conſtitution then appoints a place where the legiſlature ſhall meet. No part of either can be altered, but by the joint act of two aſſemblies. If then the convention in one part ſays, the place ought to be fixed, in another appoints the place where the firſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature is to meet, and in a third ſays, that all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions muſt ſtand for a law until they ſhall be repealed by two ſucceſſive general aſſemblies, there can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As the Farmer ſeems conſtituted, by common conſent, the leading advocate for Baltimore-town, I ſhall patiently examine every one of his reaſons; I ſhall not contine myſelf to his preciſe words, let it ſuffice that I preſerve his meaning.</p>

               <p>But, ſays the Farmer, <q>the place muſt be convenient to the members; thoſe who are to uſe the convenience are the only competent judges of it; beſides, convenience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on after events and circumſtances not permanent.</q> What! Could not the convention judge of the convenience of a place to aſſemble at and enact laws, when it was itſelf a legiſlature of the moſt exalted kind? The members of that convention certainly were as good judges of that, as the members of any legiſlature can be of the place which will be moſt convenient to its ſucceſſors; indeed, neither the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, nor any future legiſlature, could determine that any place whatever would always remain the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſt convenient for men to repair to, and the beſt calculated, on every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for the tranſaction of public affairs, and therefore the ſeat of government may, at any time, be removed by the joint act of two general aſſemblies. The Farmer thinks this 9th article of rights <hi>only declaratory;</hi> by this we are to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it means nothing, or is to ſtand for nothing, and at any time may be diſpenſed with at the pleaſure of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature; our conſtitution, however, that ſacred palladium of our rights, that ſtrong barrier againſt the encroachments of power, expreſsly ordains, that no part of the declaration ſhall be altered by a ſingle legiſlature; by this is effectually provided, that the declaration of rights ſhall remain as a law, and that it ſhall limit the power of the legiſlature, which without it might indeed be called omnipotent. The ſenate, and the repreſentatives of the people, derive their power merely from that conſtitution, and they are delegated to paſs laws in conformity to it; whenever they violate it, by their acts, they betray their truſt, and if it were not for the check which is provided <hi>by ſecuring the independence of judges,</hi> in every inſtance of an infringement of the declaration or form of government, the whole government would revert to the people. This would be fatal doctrine indeed! As I do not doubt that attempts will hereafter be made to violate the conſtitution by the arbitrary acts of a ſingle legiſlature, I
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019698_0014_0FADA35552009CB0"/>conceive it a fortunate circumſtance, that the conſtitution, without containing explicit terms, has been ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. The power of the judges to reject any acts that, in their opinion, may be repugnant to any part of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or form of government, has been aſſerted on a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of occaſions, and has never yet been diſputed, except by a ſingle writer of Baltimore-town. According to his ideas, it ſeems, the general aſſembly is the only judge of thoſe parts which reſpect itſelf; and, if it thinks proper to diſregard both, its acts muſt nevertheleſs be admitted as laws. Such an extravagant opinion could never have entered the head of a rational man. What! Are the men who are to be bound by a law, the propereſt to decide on the law? If that be ſubſtantial doctrine, it was in vain for the reſpectable founders of our conſtitution to beſtow ſuch labour and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention on a work calculated to inſure the ſafety and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their conſtituents! It was in vain to expect every part of that work to ſtand until two aſſemblies ſhould concur to overthrow it! But a more rational conſtruction has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to generally prevailed, and it would be a waſte of time to demonſtrate, that the judges may reject unconſtitutional acts, and that, by ſo doing, they have a countroul over the legiſlature, which in other reſpects has a controul over them. This controul of the judges does not make them legiſlators, it only enables them to reſtrain the proper legiſlature within its proper limits, and ſuch a controul is infinitely preferable to that of the people at large, which could not be exerted without a diſſolution of the bonds of government.</p>
               <p>It may here be proper likewiſe to remark, that by accuſing all perſons who would dare to execute any unconſtitutional acts, that grand juries would evince their importance.</p>
               <p>As the judges then are indiſpenſably obliged to reject all acts paſſed in an unconſtitutional manner, and as many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things may be tranſacted under thoſe acts before they ſhall be declared void; as all this may throw our affairs into confuſion, and may bring ruin on individuals, it would ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be prudent for the legiſlature, before it adopts the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's propoſition, to be ſatisfied, that by removing to Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more-town, without publiſhing their act three months before a new election, and having that act ratified by a new aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, it will not violate the conſtitution. For this reaſon
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019698_0015_0FADA3567B2EC5A8"/>Ariſtides adviſed them previouſly to conſult the judges, not that he meant himſelf to give a judicial opinion. The Farmer expreſſes a great reſpect for the judges, but thinks <q>it would be ridiculous to require their opinion on this occaſion, becauſe the point is involved in no more difficulty than the queſtion whether one houſe can adjourn without the other.</q> I ſhall make no comment on the very extraordinary treatment which the Farmer thinks fit to give Ariſtides; the proper remark on ſuch an occaſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of ſuggeſting itſelf to the reader.</p>
               <p>It has been aſſerted, that Ariſtides was not ſincere in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. He diſdains the imputation. He never did, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will, endeavour to impreſs an opinion not entertained by himſelf. He offers reaſons which the Farmer promiſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, but which the Farmer does not even analize. His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is confirmed by two of the moſt eminent council at the bar; indeed, by almoſt every lawyer with whom he converſes. I cannot, however, be perſuaded, that the Farmer's confident aſſertions have proceeded altogether from a thorough convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In this I am clear, that a thorough conviction could not induce any man to decline a reference in which there can be no impropriety, inconvenience or danger. In what a ſtate ſhall we be, if a ſingle aſſembly ſhall undertake to remove the ſeat of government, and if the acts paſſed by them at Baltimore-town ſhall be hereafter declared null and void! Thoſe who examine the ſubject merely on the principles of public good, will allow the advice of Ariſtides to be wholeſome; but thoſe who would ſtir Heaven and earth to bring about a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the government, will be at all events for rejecting it. <q>Let anarchy and confuſion prevail; let even the ſtate itſelf be thrown into a convulſion; let ruin attend every man who may act under thoſe unconſtitutional mandates; let us involve the legiſlative and the judicial departments in a diſpute; the ſmaller number muſt ſoon yield to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the people; but if even theſe few men ſhould have firmneſs to reſiſt lawleſs acts, no matter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we ſucceed in this our darling undertaking.</q> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, however, believe the Farmer capable of thus reaſoning within himſelf; and I am inclined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:019698_0016_0FADA35742C66360"/>
We ſhall however be told, I doubt not, that it would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade the ſovereign power to await the approbation of a few men, before it ſhall dare to act. But let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that theſe few men have the power to reſtrain it within the conſtitutional limits. We ſhall be told too, that there are men in the legiſlature, equal in legal abilities to the judges. Be it ſo; but theſe men have only each one vote in deciding the queſtion; they are not under obligations, equal to thoſe of the judges; and it is the opinion of the judges only, which is ultimately to decide.</p>
               <p>I return now to my argument. That the convention, by appointing the firſt legiſlature to meet at Annapolis, intended to fix that place for the meeting of the legiſlature, would to me be ſufficiently clear, from this conſideration. They knew that the place could not be fixed by any ſucceeding legiſlature; becauſe any act of one ſeſſion may be abrogated by the next. The word "fixed" is a moſt ſignificant term; and, ſuppoſing my poſition to be right, I admire the wiſdom and foreſight of the convention, in preventing artful men, on an occaſion ſo intereſting to the public, from taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a critical ſeaſon, of temporary ſits of diſguſt in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering capricious minds, of diſſeminating tales, which cannot be refuted until it be too late; in preventing men, I ſay, from doing that in a hurry, which ought never to be done but upon the matureſt deliberation. The convention muſt have been impreſſed with an idea of the propriety of fixing the ſeat of government, even on account of giving ſome ſtability to the real property of the place, where it may happen to be. It would be an unhappy thing, indeed, for the citizens of any capital, if, at every meeting of the legiſlature, they are to run the hazard of being inſtantly deprived of their property; if their minds are to be thus agitated, if they are to be thus filled with doubts and alarms, and if all ſpirit of enterprize, is thus to be effectually checked. I will explain what I mean by ſpirit of enterprize, as it ſeems that unlucky ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in my firſt addreſs ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> been more commented on, in Baltimore-town, than all the reſt of the publication. It was evident, I did not mean to extol "the beloved city" for its enterprize in commerce. My meaning was, that a propoſal of removing from it the ſeat of government, for a time, puts all buſineſs at a ſtand. Should a man be about to build, he muſt, in prudence, await the event; if his building has
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019698_0017_0FADA3582433D668"/>already been commenced, he muſt ſuſpend the work; if two men are treating about the ſale of a houſe, either the treaty muſt be broken off, or one party will gain an advantage; a vacant houſe muſt remain unoccupied. And when, at laſt, the queſtion is determined in favour of Annapolis, the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of what may take place at the next ſeſſion, cannot fail to affect the value of its houſes and lots, and to obſtruct all further growth and improvement. Theſe are ſerious evils, and the men who feel them are entitled to as much conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as if they inhabited a town of extent, popula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>n and enterprize, equal to that of the antient city of Tyre. To me there cannot be a more deciſive proof of an illiberal ſoul, than the ſport which has been recently made with the anxieties of the Annapolitans. I appeal even to the ſober and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of Baltimore-town, whether my conſtruction does not place matters on the proper footing. That the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be removed in the way preſcribed for altering any part of the declaration of rights, or form of government, no rational being ever could deny. But if it can be removed by a more compendious method, no man who regards the plain well known import of words, could affirm, that it can be ſaid to be fixed. And, as at any rate it may be removed by the joint act of two general aſſemblies, it cannot with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be called <hi>"immoveable."</hi> My conſtruction, therefore, I conceive, is not only the moſt rational, but the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient. It affords a ſecurity againſt whim and caprice; it may prevent a variety of evils; and it allows a ſafe remedy, whenever circumſtances ſhall render the further holding of the legiſlature at the fixed place a public grievance.</p>
               <p>The deſtruction of a capital town is ſurely a meaſure which no body of men ſhould have it in their power haſtily to adopt; and, happily, our conſtitution has taken care to prevent the legiſlature from proceeding with haſte in almoſt every thing that very materially affects our rights and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. When two general aſſemblies, after a mature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, ſhall concur in any meaſure, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the meaſure will be right; and, if it be probable, that two general aſſemblies will concur in the propoſed act for removing the ſeat of government, the citizens of Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis will be able to foreſee, and, in ſome meaſure, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the event, of which the Farmer, with ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and exultation, undertakes to give them warning.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:019698_0018_0FADA358B1D3D048"/>And after loſing the ſeat of government in this way, they will, perhaps, renounce the fond idea of regaining it, at a future ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>But the Farmer may perhaps ſay, <q>admitting it might have been good policy for the convention to have fixed the ſeat of government at Annapolis, or any where elſe, <hi>if words be ſuffered to retain their meaning,</hi> this power has been conferred by the conſtitution on the future legiſlature.</q> Obſerve, ſays he in his firſt addreſs, <q>the electors of the ſenate are to meet <hi>at ſuch other place as the legiſlature ſhall appoint.</hi>
                  </q> The opinion I entertain of the Farmer's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, will not permit me, one moment, to ſuppoſe him guilty of a wilful miſquotation. Such words are found no where in the conſtitution, and had its framers really intended to confer this power on the legiſlature, it is aſtoniſhing that they never did it by plain and poſitive terms. Although in ſeveral places they ſpeak of the place to be appointed for holding the legiſlature, they no where have ſaid, this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be in the legiſlature; and yet they often ſpeak of things to be done by a future legiſlature. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſufficient to evince, that they intended themſelves to fix the place for the meeting of the legiſlature.</p>
               <p>The words of the 15th clauſe are theſe, <q>That the ſaid electors of the ſenate ſhall meet at the city of Annapolis, or ſuch other place as ſhall be appointed for convening the legiſlature, on the third Monday in September 1781, and on the ſame day in every fifth year for ever thereafter.</q> I was fully apprized of this clauſe, but did not eſteem it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial for either ſide. I now find it of importance to my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Obſerve, ſay I, this 15th ſection is antecedent to the 61ſt; no ſection before this gives the leaſt hint where the ſeat of government ſhall be; this ſection does not declare by whom the appointment ſhall be made, it directs a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the electors at a period five years diſtant from its own date; and the 61ſt clauſe afterwards appoints a meeting of the electors at Annapolis, at a very near period, and a meeting of the legiſlature likewiſe at Annapolis. Does not all this "moſt forcibly inculcate and impreſs on every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind," that the convention, at the time of framing the 15th clauſe, intended to do that, which neither in that, nor in any other part, they have directed the legiſlature to do; that by giving directions for a meeting of the electors
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019698_0019_0FADA3599092E3B0"/>five years diſtant, they reſerved themſelves for giving direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as to the firſt meeting of the electors, until they ſhould come to the laſt clauſe, which was to introduce the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that this clauſe was abſolutely neceſſary; that, without it the conſtitution was not a "perfect code;" that, without it, the fixing of the place for holding the legiſlature, which they had before aſſerted to be neceſſary, has not been, and never can be done; finally, that, if he, who made the notable diſcovery of the 61ſt clauſe being no part of the conſtitution, can ſupport his opinion, he deſerves from Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more-town much <hi>credit</hi> for his ingenuity.</p>
               <p>The Farmer has derived an argument from the 56th ſection of the form of government, of which he gives ſuch an extract, as he thought ſuited his own purpoſe, <q>That the general court ſhall ſit for tranſacting buſineſs at ſuch prices as the future legiſlature of this ſtate ſhall direct and appoint.</q> Now, ſays he, <q>the 9th article of the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration requires the legiſlature to be held at a place moſt convenient to the depoſitory of the public records, and the records of the general court are part thereof.</q> From all this he infers, that had the framers of the conſtitution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to fix the place of holding the legiſlature, they would have likewiſe fixed the place of holding the ſupreme courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>I diſlike all partial quotations or abſtracts of ſentences and clauſes; becauſe the reader is entitled to form his judgment of the whole, upon a view of the whole; and becauſe, the diſcarding of a ſingle word which at firſt view may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear material, on an attentive examination may exhibit a very different complexion. The words of the 56th clauſe we theſe. <q>That the ſame court be hereafter called and known by the name of the general court; which court ſhall ſit on the weſtern and eaſtern ſhores, for tranſacting and determining the buſineſs of the reſpective ſhores, at ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> times and places, as the future legiſlature of this ſtate ſhall direct and appoint.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The convention, we may ſuppoſe, found a difficulty in chooſing a place for the court on the eaſtern ſhore, and had not themſelves yet fixed a place for holding the legiſlature. It was merely on this account, I preſume, that they gave the appointment of a place on each ſhore to the future legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. They would not make diſtinctions between the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019698_0020_0FADA35AC1AE6B80"/>ſhores; for, had they appointed a place for the weſtern ſhore, the court would have been <hi>fixed</hi> there; whereas no future legiſlature could <hi>fix</hi> the place for the eaſtern ſhore. I now aſk, if the convention intended that a future legiſlature ſhould fix the place of holding the legiſlature, why it did not ſay ſo in explicit terms, ſuch as they have made uſe of with reſpect to the general court? Had indeed this 56th ſection ſaid, <q>the general court for the weſtern ſhore ſhall be held at the place hereafter to be appointed by the legiſlature for its own meeting,</q> it would have precluded all argument in ſupport of my poſition.</p>
               <p>The fact is. The conſtitution no where expreſsly directs the ſupreme courts of juſtice, and the legiſlature, to be held at the ſame place; and hence it became neceſſary for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, by a particular act, to direct where theſe courts ſhall be held. But if it be clear, that the convention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the legiſlature and the general court to be held at the ſame place, and any argument can be drawn from the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the firſt legiſlature, compoſed in a great meaſure of thoſe who had been members of the laſt convention, the act for appointing the place for holding theſe courts is highly worthy of attention. That act was paſſed at the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the legiſlature, which the Farmer maintains, was held only for a ſpecial purpoſe. And if their conſtruction and the Farmer's be the ſame, that the ſupreme courts of juſtice and the legiſlature are directed by the conſtitution to be held at the ſame place, they have, by implication, given a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided opinion in favour of Ariſtides; for they have ordained, that the court of appeals, and the general court for the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſhore, ſhall be for ever held at Annapolis. By ſo doing, they muſt have thought Annapolis already fixed for the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the legiſlature, or they would, at the ſame time, have paſſed an act for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If they conceived Annapolis appointed by the 61ſt clauſe for their firſt meeting only, no body of men ever acted ſo ſtrange a part; for they paſſed no act for appointing the the place where the legiſlature ſhould be held in future; no bill was framed for the purpoſe in either houſe, no meſſage on the ſubject was ſent by either houſe, and, at the end of the journal of each houſe, is an adjournment to an early day, without naming the place. From all this ariſes an implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtrong as the moſt poſitive words, that this aſſembly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019698_0021_0FADA35B1AA4ADC0"/>conſidered the ſeat of government to have been fixed by the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>It is a ſettled rule of conſtruction, that the ſenſe of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw muſt be collected from the words alone, where thoſe carry any meaning conſiſtent with the general intent of the law. The queſtion is, what did the convention mean by ſaying the legiſlature ſhall meet at Annapolis on the tenth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary text? Does it mean thereby to fix the general place of meeting? I ſay yes, becauſe that is conſiſtent with the intention clearly expreſſed in the 9th article of the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becauſe that article could not otherwiſe have the force of a law.</p>
               <p>Says the Farmer, "that article is only <hi>declaratory.</hi>" I reply, that article, as well as every other article in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of rights, is by the conſtitution made a law, irrevocable, except by the joint act of two general aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>All the articles of the declaration are, I confeſs, <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and there needs no Farmer to tell us that. But what conſtitutes them laws is, that no act of a ſingle aſſembly, repugnant to the rules, maxims and principles, which they contain, ſhall have the force of a law. Well then, the next aſſembly paſſes an act for removing the ſeat of government to Baltimore-town. I maintain, that it is repugnant to the 9th article of rights, which ſays the place for holding the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature ought to be fixed. The proper mode for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to proceed by, in removing the ſeat of government, would be, to paſs an act for repealing that article, and to ſubmit it to the conſideration of the people three months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a new election. And if that act be confirmed by the ſucceeding aſſembly, then may an act paſs for removing the ſeat of government. Or, the act itſelf for removing the ſeat of government, as it would amount to a repeal of the 9th article, might be publiſhed for the conſideration of the people.</p>
               <p>But had the 61ſt ſection of the conſtitution never been paſſed by the convention, and had the aſſembly been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly held at Annapolis, without the direction of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or any aſſembly which has ſince been held, inaſmuch as the 9th article ſays the place ought to be fixed, I might even in ſuch a caſe ſafely maintain, that the uniform practice and uſage of the aſſembly has fixed the ſeat of government at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019698_0022_0FADA35BE0858020"/>Annapolis; and that it cannot be removed, unleſs in one of the ways which I have pointed out.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the 9th article of rights had never been inſerted, I think, even in ſuch a caſe, it might well be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that a ſingle legiſlature could not appoint Baltimore for the place of meeting, becauſe the laſt ſection of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution has appointed Annapolis the place for holding the legiſlature. That ſection directs the firſt legiſlature to meet at Annapolis on a certain day, and preſcribes a particular piece of buſineſs which it is to do at that, or at <hi>ſome future ſeſſion.</hi> Does this look as if the convention intended it to be a ſpecial legiſlature, appointed to do one ſpecial act and no other, and that a future legiſlature might meet wherever they might happen or might agree to aſſemble? But I have already pointed out the conſequences of conſidering the firſt legiſlature in that light; and I dare ſay even the Farmer will be convinced, that the firſt legiſlature did right in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every other act of legiſlation. Well then, the firſt legiſlature choſen under the conſtitution, is by that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed to meet at Annapolis. It is doing no violence to the rules of conſtruction, and it is agreeable to common ſenſe, to maintain, that the conſtitution intended the future meetings of that legiſlature ſhould be there, that all future le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures ſhould meet there, and that no legiſlature can be held at any other place before that implied direction of the conſtitution be repealed in the manner which the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution preſcribes.</p>
               <p>It is another rule of conſtruction, that every word in a law, if poſſible, muſt be conſtrued ſo as to convey a meaning. But, without my conſtruction, the word "fixed," in the 9th article, has no meaning at all. It is totally diſcarded, and then the clauſe ſtands thus, <q>that a place for the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the legiſlature ought to be the moſt convenient,</q> &amp;c. And then, if it were not for the 61ſt clauſe, the legiſlature might move about as it pleaſed, always taking care, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to carry with it the public records, and to pitch on a place moſt convenient to the members.</p>
               <p>When the meaning of the law-makers, after a careful conſideration of every part, ſtill remains a doubt, a recourſe to the hiſtory of the times is ſaid to be proper. An honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able member of the preſent ſenate, who was a delegate to the laſt convention, has declared, he would moſt ſtrenuouſly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019698_0023_0FADA35C73113248"/>have oppoſed the fixing of the ſeat of government, had he diſcovered ſuch an intent in the convention. Another ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable member of the ſame body, who likewiſe had a ſhare in fabricating the conſtitution, has aſſured me, that had he conceived the ſeat of government not to be fixed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as it ſtands, he would have inſiſted for more expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit terms. I greatly reſpect both theſe honourable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and I mention their different ideas, to ſhew how little ſatisfaction could be obtained by an appeal to the founders of the conſtitution. Should this point be ever brought before a court of juſtice, theſe gentlemen, I am perſuaded, would never be interrogated by the judges.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude my argument on the conſtitution with one more obſervation, and with a brief recapitulation of what I have before ſaid. Admitting the ſeat of government not to be fixed in the manner I contend, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to Baltimore-town without even the formality of an act. By meſſage the two houſes may agree to adjourn to meet at that place. At the next ſeſſion they may in the ſame manner adjourn back to Annapolis. If the convention did not mean themſelves to fix the ſeat of government, they muſt have ſeen that the 9th article of rights was entirely uſeleſs; becauſe the act of any future legiſlature for that purpoſe, in whatever terms it might be expreſſed, could not prevent their ſucceſſors, or even themſelves, from removing it in the very next ſeſſion. But the convention intended no part of their work to be uſeleſs. They intended the 9th article to have ſome effect; and every article is to remain a law, until it be repealed by two ſucceſſive aſſemblies. But that article has no operation, unleſs it has by itſelf fixed the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or unleſs the conſtitution has appointed a place which anſwers its deſcription; or unleſs the place for the meeting of the legiſlature be fixed by uniform practice and uſage. The conſtitution appoints Annapolis for the meeting of the firſt legiſlature, and that place, in every reſpect, anſwers the deſcription of the 9th article. By appointing that meeting, it meant to aſcertain the place at which the legiſlature ſhould always meet, unleſs on evident neceſſity, when it might adjourn, for one meeting only, to ſome other place. The proviſion, in the latter part of the 9th article, for caſes of evident ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, was peculiarly adapted to the time when the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was framed, when an invaſion of the enemy might
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:019698_0024_0FADA35D4B80DEB8"/>every moment be expected. My conſtruction places every thing on a proper footing, and grati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es every part of the declaration of rights, and the form of government; and the conduct of every legiſlature ſince the convention evinces, that they have made the ſame conſtruction with myſelf.</p>
               <p>Thinking as Ariſtides does on this important point, under a firm perſuation that the conſtitution has fixed the ſeat of government at Annapolis, and fearing that the legiſlature might do an act which would involve the ſtate in anarchy and confuſion, he conceived his duty as a citizen, obliged him to declare his opinion, although not called upon in a judicial way. He may perhaps have acted an imprudent part. He may have hazarded ſome part of that reputation which he has been conſtantly and gradually acquiring. But conſiderations like theſe ſhall never deter him from his duty. <hi>If he cannot maintain the good opinion of men, without acting in conformity to their views, he muſt conſole himſelf with the purity of his motives.</hi> In his judicial character he never can receive, as a law, any act of the general aſſembly, which may be repugnant to his ſenſe of the conſtitution, unleſs he be firſt over-ruled by his aſſociates, or by a ſuperior tribunal. At the ſame time, he is ſatisfied that his aſſociates will deem binding no acts, which the legiſlature can be induced to paſs, in direct violation of the conſtitution. And he has that opinion of their firmneſs and integrity, that as guardians of the ſacred palladium of our rights, he is perſuaded they will ever ſtand up againſt the encroachments and uſurpation of any body of men whatever.</p>
               <p>The Farmer cannot be ſo far blinded, by having his eyes continually fixed on this favourite object, as to deny the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol of the judges. I demand of him then, what would be the reſult, ſhould a ſingle legiſlature attempt to paſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed act into a law, and ſhould the judges adopt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Ariſtides, and reject all their acts paſſed at Baltimore-town?</p>
               <p>In ſpite then of the Farmer's confidence, I do not imagine the ſucceeding legiſlature, for the ſake of gratifying the eager wiſhes of Baltimore-town, will do an act which may hazard a revolution of the government. Should they be of opinion, that a removal of the ſeat of government is a meaſure which the public good abſolutely demands, they will act in one of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:019698_0025_0FADA35E2417AB78"/>the following ways. They will paſs an act, and publiſh it three months before a new election. Or they will demand of the whole judicial body, whether a ſingle legiſlature has the power to remove the ſeat of government; and if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the judges ſhall be in the affirmative, the legiſlature will then paſs a common act, or a reſolve, for meeting at Baltimore-town.</p>
               <p>It will naturally be ſuppoſed, that I conſider this point of ſingular importance. I indeed view it in that light. For, if two aſſemblies muſt concur, before the removal of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can be effected, there will be little danger of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, or fineſſe. The citizens of Annapolis can never be greatly diſturbed, until the firſt of theſe aſſemblies ſhall have paſſed the act; and a few defeats cannot fail to damp the ardour of its adverſaries. In the mean time, it may advance to that degree of improvement of which it is yet capable; and it may attain the very little it wants, of exactly anſwering the deſcription, which a diſintereſted enlightened politician would give of a capital beſt ſuited to a republic, like that of Maryland.</p>
               <p>Its adverſaries will endeavour to impreſs an idea, that ſhould a ſingle legiſlature, by its arbitrary fiat, transfer the ſeat of government, the judges would be compelled, from neceſſity, to give all the acts of the legiſlature, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional or not, the ſtamp of their authority. Be aſſured that this is a vain idea. But in the firſt place, where is the inducement for the members of the legiſlature to violate their own ſolemn oaths? Where is the propriety of precipitating this very important meaſure, when the preparatory ſteps, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Ariſtides, even if they may conſtitutionally be diſpenſed with, would be attended with ſo little delay, and when theſe ſteps would remove every ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint?</p>
               <p>Had the declaration of rights, and the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, been both ſilent on this head, it would, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be ſound policy to adopt no weighty meaſure that does not require haſte, without uſing the method preſcribed by the conſtitution for the alteration of any part of itſelf.</p>
               <p>There are two parts of that conſtitution which will excite the admiration of your lateſt poſterity. The firſt is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined mode of electing a ſenate. The other is the ſalutary proviſion for preventing haſty innovations, and the premature
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019698_0026_0FADA360CD169218"/>adoption of all momentous meaſures. May you always poſſeſs a due ſenſe of its value, and may it protect the rights and ſecure the happineſs <hi>of you and your poſterity, till time ſhall be no more.</hi>

               <p>I PROCEED to examine the conſequences which will flow from a removal of the ſeat of government, ſuppoſing it effected in a conſtitutional way. The Farmer repreſents, that this meaſure will render an eſſential ſervice to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Annapolis, by curing them of their dependent ways, and by compelling them to adopt the habits of induſtry. His want of candour, or rather his want of reflection, will appear on the ſlighteſt attention to their real ſituation.</p>
               <p>Annapolis, we may conjecture, had a beginning like moſt other towns within the ſtate. A tavern, or a blackſmith's ſhop, may have firſt been erected on the ſpot, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome little reſort. A few tradeſmen then, of different kinds, needing occaſionally the aſſiſtance of each other, and thinking it a likely place to gain employment, may have choſen it for a ſtand. It might then tempt a merchant or two to eſtabliſh a ſtore, and thus, by degrees, a ſmall village may have been formed. We know from record and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in a ſhort time its advantages induced the former government there to fix its ſeat, and to procure for it a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of incorporation from the Britiſh throne. Annapolis then, compared to cotemporary towns, ſoon became a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing place. The officers of government found it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſettle there. Theſe men, with the concourſe of people at ſtated periods, encouraged a competent number of tradeſmen and mechanics to fix at a place where there was a certain proſpect of employment. Hence it is that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of houſes had there been erected. But let it be remembered, although it was thought well ſituated for commerce, that commerce never thrived at Annapolis, after it became the ſeat of government. The conſideration of its being the reſidence of inſolent great men, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of being entirely over-ſhadowed, deterred many plain, independent, enterpriſing men, from ſettling there; and it muſt be obvious, that the reſidence of the government has been unfavourable to it as a commercial town.</p>

This was the ſtate of Annapolis at the commencement of the conteſt with Great-Britain. In the courſe of the war, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ed there, it has at this time rather more inhabitants than it had before the revolution. A very great majority of theſe depend not on government immediately for ſupplies. Their ſole dependence is the property they have already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the further ſucceſsful proſecution of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent trades and profeſſions. The men whom a connexion with government has occaſioned to reſide at the capital; the men whom periodical meetings of the general aſſembly and ſuperior courts, or the public offices and records, attract to Annapolis; all theſe, I ſay, at preſent afford employment to its private citizens. Some of theſe citizens have laboured with ſucceſs, and ſcraped together wherewithal to build or purchaſe a habitation. Others, more ſucceſsful, have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a number of tenements, which they leaſe. Scarcely a ſingle houſe is now ſtanding, that was not built on account of its being the reſidence of government. Well then. A law paſſes for transferring the ſeat of government to another place. What is the certain conſequence? The immediate dependents on government, having nothing to detain them at Annapolic, repair to the new capital. There is now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to occaſion, at any time, a concourſe of people at the old capital. The merchants, tradeſmen and mechanics, muſt abandon it, to ſeek employment elſewhere. They have once more to begin the world, and for that purpoſe, they too will perhaps follow the government, provided they have a ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It were in vain for Annapolic, at this time, to expect an indemnification from commerce, for that has long ſince centred with its aſpiring neighbour. What is there then to prevent it from exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a few years, gloomy piles of ruins? And what is
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:019698_0028_0FADA3638E9F2A00"/>there to prevent it from becoming a ſad monument of that policy, which, however beneficial it ſhall have proved to another town, was fatal to a great number of honeſt merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious citizens.</p>
               <p>Is not this, my countrymen, a probable ſtate of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences? Does it at all reſemble the Farmer's? Can you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſuppoſe, that almoſt every man in Annapolis is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fed by the public, and that the only conſequence of the removal of the government would be the laying him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the neceſſity of labouring, like his neighbours, for a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence? The truth is, that the ſmall proportion of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens who depend immediately on the treaſury for ſupplies, would the leaſt of all be injured by the meaſure, ſince they would not by the removal be deprived of their employments.</p>
               <p>The citizens of Annapolis are, notwithſtanding, under ſome obligation to the Farmer. He purpoſes to convert the ſtadt-houſe into a college, which he thinks, may alone falſify the "<hi>prophetic</hi> mournful <hi>prediction</hi>" of Ariſtidas. But you ſurely muſt remark, how poor a compenſation this would be for the loſs of the government. A college can have little influence on the value of private buildings, becauſe the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents from the country are to board in the college buildings. It would afford little cuſtom to ſhopkeepers and tradeſmen, becauſe the young gentlemen at ſchool will be ſupplied with moſt neceſſaries, at thoſe ſeaſons when they ſhall viſit their parents. In ſhort, the college would detain and ſupport few indeed of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But wherefore the inſtitution of a ſeminary of learning, renders it expedient or more proper to remove the ſeat of government from Annapolis, does not yet clearly appear. Should this ſeminary be actually perfected, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>well grounded apprehenſions</hi> of Ariſtides; ſhould youths be ſent thither from all parts to which its fame ſhall reach; there will be a ſingular advantage to them, and of courſe to the community, in permitting the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to remain where it is.</p>
               <p>That you want men of abilities to conduct your affairs, is a ſad and acknowledged truth!</p>
               <p>The preamble of the act for founding this college, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an advantage to the ſtate in training up and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating a ſucceſſion of able and honeſt men for performing
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:019698_0029_0FADA36403257738"/>the various offices and duties of life. The art of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that moſt noble, moſt uſeful, moſt difficult of all ſciences, may be ſtudied with peculiar advantage at a capital like Annapolis. Obſervation and experience may be here combined with theory; and example, in this, as well as in every thing elſe, is infinitely ſuperior to the ſageſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Beſides, that man has a deplorable idea of education, who does not comprehend in it both manners and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the world. The Farmer does not preſume to deny, that Annapolis is the ſeat of elegance, propriety, and reſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manners, although he ſneers at theſe advantages, as if there were nothing ſolid, ſubſtantial or praiſe-worthy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of wealth. He was not aware of the extent of his conceſſions. Nothing forms manners as well as example, and Annapolis affords the beſt patterns in the ſtate. There is nothing more advantageous in a republic, where every perſon muſt depend on himſelf for advancement, than a knowledge of the world; and, to acquire this knowledge, there is nothing more proper than to attend public aſſemblies where order and decency are invariably preſerved. At the numerous public aſſemblies in Annapolis, good order is ever maintained. Annapolis, on account of its ſize and popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is preciſely the place for a college. It is not ſo large as that every ſtudent may not be known to the inhabitants; and it is not ſo ſmall but that the whole body of ſtudents may be always overawed from breaking forth into riots. But remove the ſeat of government, and Annapolis, in a little time, will loſe every advantage, and with reſpect to forming the manners of youth, or teaching them a proper knowledge of mankind, would be little ſuperior to the remoteſt corner of the ſtate. The college would loſe that ſingular advantage of having viſitors on the ſpot capable of ſuperintending its maſters and profeſſors. Theſe viſitors, at preſent, may be aſſiſted by others, who occaſionally come thither on public and private buſineſs; and the idea of excelling in the eyes of theſe men, will be a ſtrong incentive to the ſtudents. But after a removal of the government, it will be difficult at any time to procure a meeting of viſitors, and when met, they will not remain long enough to inſpect the affairs of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, to concert proper regulations, to diſcover and reform abuſes. In ſhort, when Annapolis ſhall become an obſcure and decayed village, the college, inſtead of poſſeſſing the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:019698_0030_0FADA3652E8C61C0"/>higheſt reputation, will in all probability be one of the laſt ſeminaries to which a judicious man will chooſe to ſend his ſon.</p>
               <p>A young man, with a thorough knowledge of all that is taught in the ſchools, who has acquired neither manners nor ſome tincture of the knowledge of mankind, is ſcarcely more fit to advance himſelf in the world, than if he were juſt brought from the nurſery. He has thoſe things yet to learn which are ſeldom well acquired after early manhood. His Latin, Greek, mathematics, &amp;c. without theſe, are mere learned lumber, and may rather diſqualify him from making that figure which the fond imagination of a parent may have ſo often pictured. I need not enlarge on a ſubject which has been ſo often handled by men of ſuperior talents. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience too has given men proper ideas. And you particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, my countrymen, who are intereſted in making Saint John's college the theatre of education, muſt join me in opinion, that the eſtabliſhment of it at the capital, ſo far from operating as an argument for a removal of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, affords a moſt perſuaſive reaſon againſt it.</p>
               <p>It has yielded me much ſecret amuſement, to contemplate the zeal of ſome gentlemen for fixing the college at Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis. I muſt think, that for once they have tripped in their politics. At the ſame time, I cannot but lament the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which is made to <hi>immediately ſetting on foot the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> I can account for it but in one way. Your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives are to be addreſſed to the following effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>By the removal of the ſeat of government, the public will incur not one farthings expence, as the town and county of Baltimore will generouſly undertake to erect noble and ſpacious buildings, which they will preſent to the government. On the contrary, you will obſerve, that by theſe means the public may be a gainer. The ſtadt-houſe will ſerve admirably for a college, and by transferring it to the viſitors, the public may be exonerated from the payment of ſome part of the £.1750 0 0 which it is now obliged annually to contribute.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here too, I truſt, is a loſt hope. A majority of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, acting like viſitors and men of ſenſe, would never think of converting the ſtadt-houſe into a college, as its ſituation, independent of any other circumſtance, makes it extremely unfit for the purpoſe, and as their funds are too ample, to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:019698_0031_0FADA3658C3EDF58"/>permit them, for the ſake of a little ſaving, to chooſe an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſpot. But ſurely neither you, nor your repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, can be influenced by the proſpect of a little ſaving
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Thoſe who calculate on a ſaving to the ſtate, would do well to conſider the loſs which the revenue would ſuſtain by ſinking the value of the real property in Annapolis. Suppoſe this to be at preſent worth £.</hi>75000, <hi>and that by a removal of the government it will be reduced to £.</hi>25000, <hi>there would be a loſs to the annual revenue of the ſtate of about £.</hi>500.</note> in a matter of ſuch vaſt importance, as the removal of the ſeat of government. I will, on this head, ſuggeſt another thing to your conſideration; Baltimore-town may make large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it may enter into extenſive engagements, and, I doubt not, it means perfectly fair; but without wiſhing to irritate its inhabitants, I cannot help entertaining doubts as to its exact and punctual performance. At any rate, if the government muſt be removed, for the ſake of common ſenſe let it remain until theſe ſame buildings ſhall be prepared for its reception. I am ſufficiently ſkilled in politics to be ſatisfied, that theſe buildings will never be completed at the expence of a ſingle town and county. Let them once obtain their wiſhes, and they will diſcover, how mean a thing it were for the ſtate to impoſe burthens on a part for the good of the whole; and one of the firſt things in which Baltimore-town will exert its influence in the legiſlature, will be to releaſe itſelf from an unreaſonable engagement. Nay, I make no doubt, that for the money diſburſed in the beginning, it will have even the addreſs to procure a compenſation.</p>
               <p>That the propoſed meaſure will be attended with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects of extending commerce, increaſing the value of your lands, and preſerving an equilibrium with the powerful neighbouring ſtates, is with great ſolemnity predicted by the Farmer. As his predictions are not upon a footing with thoſe of the antient prophets, it was incumbent on him to ſhew, that theſe things muſt unavoidably take place from mere natural cauſes. The queſtion between him and Ariſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des is not ſimply, whether it were beneficial for the ſtate to improve its commerce and agriculture, and thereby to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the value of its lands. God forbid that Ariſtides ſhould be oppoſed to the proſperity of his country! God forbid that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:019698_0032_0FADA3663B941EF8"/>a mere local attachment, the prejudice of long reſidence, or even his private friendſhips, ſhould make him oppoſe the means of eſtabliſhing that proſperity. He is perſuaded, that this ſtate may yet conſiderably increaſe its riches, without entailing on itſelf the evils concomitant to exceſſive wealth; and he wiſhes to increaſe its riches to that preciſe point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which they cannot be extended, without deſtroying thoſe virtues, and that ſimplicity and purity of manners, which are eſſential to the exiſtence of a genuine repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</p>
               <p>Ariſtides does not deal in generals. They may well ſerve to deceive and miſlead, but they are of little uſe in a faithful inquiry after truth. It is from a patient attention to details, that right information is to be acquired. A habit of calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation too, which he did not ſuppoſe would be thought ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by the advocate of a commercial town, is of excellent uſe to detect fallacy, and to prevent us from being the dupes of an over heated imagination. Let us then conſider calmly, what would be the conſequences to Baltimore-town, and to the ſtate at large, of acceding to the meaſure propoſed, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that the influence of Baltimore-town would not govern the ſtate.</p>
               <p>On ſuch an event, Baltimore-town would gain a part of the preſent citizens of Annapolis, ſome employed by govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and others compelled to repair thither, for the purpoſe of carrying on their trades and profeſſions. It would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe attract a greater number than Annapolis does, of thoſe men, whoſe principal uſe and employment is that of ſpending money. Aſſembly-men, jurors, witneſſes, ſuitors, and others attending the public bodies, and offices, would then lay out in Baltimore-town, the money which at preſent they ſpend at Annapolis, and perhaps ſomething more. Of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, the demand for goods would be increaſed, and a greater quantity of country produce would there find a market. Thus it is that commerce would be promoted. That is, there would be more buying and ſelling at a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſpot.</p>
               <p>No man of candour and reflection can in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r, from Ariſtides' firſt addreſs, that he is an enemy of Baltimore-town. With pleaſure he has contemplated its rapid growth, and ſincerely he wiſhes it to increaſe ſo far as is conſiſtent with its own, and the welfare of the ſtate. But it will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:019698_0033_0FADA3671F5BA620"/>no real ſubſtantial advantage, if it retains not the ſpirit, the virtues, and the manners, which firſt enabled it to riſe. If Ariſtides reſided in a diſtant corner of the ſtate, if he had never ſeen "the beloved city," and if the good of Baltimore-town were his governing principle, he would oppoſe the meaſure on which the minds of its inhabitants appear ſo violently bent. When a large, wealthy, and populous town, which hath riſen ſolely by the enterprize, induſtry, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of its inhabitants, becomes the capital of a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, immediately the idle and luxurious, thoſe verſed in the arts of luxury and diſſipation, the various miniſters of vice, are drawn thither, as if it were by inſtinct. Is it poſſible that a great change of manners will not be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult? All this diſcourages from ſettling there the men who might be of real utility to the place; ſuch men chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a place which is yet in its infancy, and of the proſperity of which, together with their own, they may lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Let not a plain ſober inhabitant of Baltimore-town, after the government ſhall have been removed, expect to live in the ſtyle to which he has ever before been accuſtomed. Although he may be able to preſerve himſelf from contagion, it is extremely probable that his family will not view things in the ſame light with himſelf; and yet, without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, his rational plan cannot be obſerved. Can he bear the idea of acting like a tyrant, and doing a perpetual violence to their <hi>innocent</hi> inclinations? Can he even himſelf endure to be ſo far ſurpaſſed, and to live in a ſtyle inferior to that of his neighbours, with whom he has hitherto lived on ſtrict terms of intimacy and equality? Can he bear that his former habits and manners ſhall be deſpiſed? Theſe things muſt undoubtedly occaſion him great vexation. Suppoſe him then to glide eaſily down with the torrent. Suppoſe that before the removal, his annual income was £.500; that by this event it is increaſed to £.600, and that in conſequence of the event, his income will ſcarcely defray his current ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. I ſuppoſe nothing but what is extremely likely to happen. Is it not probable then, that the inhabitants of Baltimore-town in general, with reſpect to mere profit, will be in a worſe ſituation than they were before? But the men of real ſenſe and virtue, when they ſhall obſerve the general perverſion of morals, vice triumphant, and every thing public and private expoſed to ſale, will regret the event, as one of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:019698_0034_0FADA367B35FDB00"/>the moſt fatal that could have happened to themſelves, their families, and their fellow-citizens.</p>
               <p>Ariſtides received his education in the capital of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtate. As at that time it was the metropolis of a province dependent on Great-Britain, as the government of it was in the hands of men belonging to a ſect of religious enthuſiaſts, who did every poſſible thing for the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vice, it was exempt from almoſt all the uſual vices of capital towns. But mark the change. Upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the war, it became the ſeat of congreſs, the reſort of gay military men, and of all idle and curious travellers from the neighbouring ſtates, and from the old world. It became too the reſidence of foreign miniſters. Ariſtides vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited it juſt before the departure of congreſs, and inſtantly perceived the alteration. He diſcovered many outward ſigns of increaſed wealth. In every houſe which he entered, he ſaw coſtly ſplendid furniture. A vaſt number of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent carriages rolled along the ſtreets; and the habits of the people correſponded with the affected gaiety of their faces. He was aſtoniſhed at the manners of his former acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Many tales of domeſtic grief were related to him; and he was told of families, who, with incomes increaſed, were haſtening to their ruin. He was ſo ſtruck with all he obſerved and heard, that he was alarmed at the coming of congreſs to his native ſtate, and to the ſpot of his reſidence. Happily it remained but a ſhort time, and the peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the ſeaſon whilſt it ſtaid, prevented that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and that diſſipation, which might have turned the heads, and perverted the hearts of his fellow-citizens. But it remained long enough to teach them, that the influx of wealth which congreſs occaſioned, would not indemnify them for the increaſe of their general expences, and the fatal change of their manners. And yet the reſidence of congreſs would have occaſioned wealth, in ſome degree, to flow from every quarter into the ſtate. I wiſh to impreſs on your minds, that an addition of money does not always make one actually the richer. Perhaps it may be concluded, that from having in ſome manner or other imbibed a ſet of old faſhioned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am, at all events, againſt enriching the ſtate. I do not inſiſt, that this ſtate would not, by becoming the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent reſidence of congreſs, have derived more real good than evil. I leave it as a doubtful point, not neceſſary at
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:019698_0035_0FADA368970FCF00"/>this time to be ſettled. I have endeavoured to demonſtrate, that the removal of the government, although it might carry money with it, would not be really beneficial even to Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-town. And it is my purpoſe to ſhew preſently, that it would not, in any ſenſe, add to the riches of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Athough Ariſtides flatters himſelf that he poſſeſſes the true ſpirit of a republican, he does not conſider modern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics on the ſame footing with thoſe of antient Greece. In theſe days, the ſtrength and ſecurity of every government muſt depend in a great meaſure on the flouriſhing ſtate of its trade. In war particularly, the richeſt ſtates, or thoſe rather whoſe governments can command the largeſt ſums, will in general have the advantage. But let us not, becauſe we may have occaſionally ſkimmed a few pages of hiſtory, be ſo fond of quoting parallels and examples. Let us firſt learn a little to diſtinguiſh. Is the ſtate of Maryland, which is no more than one member of thirteen which compoſe the great republic of North-America, is this petty dependent ſtate to be viewed in the ſame light with a great independent ſeparate ſtate, ſurrounded by the powerful empires and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Europe? With reſpect to theſe, the Farmer's laſt addreſs contains many judicious, pertinent obſervations, the application of which is left to the reader. I am enabled to conjecture the meaning by what I have frequently heard of the politics of "the beloved town." It is there, as I have been told, pretty generally maintained, that we ought to have but one port; or if even the law ſhould not directly confine importation and exportation to a ſingle port, that it ought, nevertheleſs, to be brought about by political regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or in other words, by indirect means. If this be found doctrine, and if it be conſonant to your wiſhes, that no foreign goods ſhould be imported unleſs into Baltimore-town, and that Baltimore-town ſhould be the ſole mart for your produce, and if this would promote the proſperity of the ſtate in an eminent degree, then ought not the propoſed meaſure to be longer delayed than is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It will be difficult, I conceive, to perſuade you, that we may not have ſeveral commercial towns. I mean, towns where your produce may be purchaſed for exportation, and to which goods may be imported immediately from abroad.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:019698_0036_0FADA3693A6BA488"/>It will be difficult to perſuade you, that by having ſeveral ſuch towns, the ſum total of the value of your lands throughout the ſtate will not be greater, than if you had but one
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>It may be demanded, why is the price of wheat greater at Philadelphia than Maryland? I anſwer, that until very lately, that town had the advantage of us by the number of mills in its vicinity; and, for the purpoſe of converting wheat into flour, there was a demand for almoſt any quantity. To prove that the ſuperiority of price was not owing to the ſize of Philadelphia, or to the commerce of Pennſylvania being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that place, it muſt be remarked, that wheat was ever as high at Brandywine, as at Philadelphia.</hi>
                  </note>. George-town, I have the moſt ſanguine expectations, will become a place of conſiderable trade. The act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the clearing of the Patowmack, excited jealous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in Baltimore-town, and a remembrance of that ought to excite ſimilar apprehenſions in you. Havre-de-Grace, from the advantages of its ſituation, is, by many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, expected to ſhoot up with a rapidity, equal to the late growth of Baltimore-town. But the narrow ſelfiſh policy of this, like that of every other great town, ſuppoſes the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of other places incompatible with its own, and would gladly cruſh them, either in infancy, or old age. Nothing but the want of a few enterpriſing men, and a little good policy in the legiſlature, and diſcernment in the people, can prevent a town of conſiderable importance from erecting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>y beloved countrymen, to raiſe the value of your lands, and to preſerve your equilibrium with your powerful neighbours!</p>
               <p>But let commerce be generally diffuſed, or let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a ſingle ſpot, it will be impoſſible for the prices of your produce ever to exceed a certain point, as theſe prices muſt be regulated by the demand in other countries. And let Baltimore-town grow to any ſize which the proprietors of vacant lots may wiſh, it is impoſſible theſe prices, on an average, can exceed that degree which will admit of ſome
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:019698_0037_0FADA36A84CC5908"/>profit to the merchant, upon the exportation of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. If there be only one market to which you can or would chooſe to ſend them, is there not great danger that this market will, at times be over ſtocked? In ſuch a caſe, your commodities muſt be either ſold at an under rate, or be ſtored for a more convenient ſeaſon. I aſk, whether ſomething of this kind has not been by ſome of you already experienced
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>I have been informed, when the demand for a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle was confined to a ſingle town, a common buyer was once appointed for all the merchants who wanted that article. It appeared then, that nobody wanted it but himſelf; and as there was no competition of purchaſers, the ſellers, in a great meaſure, were at his mercy. This circumſtance deſerves a place in your memory.</hi>
                  </note>. I dare aver, that ſome of the gentlemen who urge a removal of the government, and whoſe views extend to the <hi>beneficial</hi> conſequences of that removal, do not wiſh to enrich the land-holders at the expence of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile intereſt. And yet they would inflame your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, by general vague aſſertions and promiſes, and would perſuade you, that the meaſures which ſelf-love impels them to promote, are dictated only by a regard to public good.</p>
               <p>Without the leaſt pretence to inſpiration, I ſhall, in my turn, deliver a prediction. When the ſeat of government ſhall be removed to Baltimore-town, there will ſoon be an end to all fairneſs and freedom of legiſlative debate. It is a ſad truth, that in our days, whatever ſpecious pretences may be made to public ſpirit, private intereſt is almoſt the univerſal principle. With my whole heart I ſubſcribe to the Farmer's culogium on his beloved merchants. It is for merchants in general, that of all orders of men, I entertain the higheſt opinion. But theſe particular merchants muſt excuſe me if I think, that like other merchants, and other men, they will exert themſelves to bring about thoſe meaſures which will tend moſt to the advancement of their own ſuppoſed welfare, and the aggrandiſement of their town. I deem not ſo meanly of country members, as to ſuppoſe them capable of being bribed by elegant fare, old Madeira, or even a good round ſum of money. But I know full well the efficacy of polite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:019698_0038_0FADA36AC6B72D60"/>and infinuating addreſs, more eſpecially when infidious motives are not even ſuſpected. No claſs of men in the univerſe are ſo apt as merchants to unite in a common cauſe. No other men purſue their objects with ſo much perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, ſteadineſs and conſiſtency. The Farmer, I think, gives you plainly to underſtand the great motive for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing the firſt grand undertaking. It is, ſays he, that the legiſlature may take the inhabitants of Baltimore-town <q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its immediate protection.</q> That is, my friends, that the legiſlature may paſs no law which they ſhall not dictate; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, the ſenate will, in a little time, loſe all its dignity and authority, it will no longer ſerve as a check or counterpoiſe to the other branch; the conſtitution will be no longer preſerved; and no man is able to ſay what government ſhall next prevail. Should the mere forms of the preſent be permitted to ſubſiſt, as I doubt not they will, be aſſured, that no government is more arbitrary than that in which, by corruption and intrigue, a few ambitious men conduct every thing under the ſpecious forms of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken of the miſchiefs to be apprehended from the intrigues and over-bearing influence of the leading men. There would be hardly leſs to be apprehended from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace. Permit me here to tranſcribe a part of my firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. <q>No man of reflection can expect, in a large town, that the deliberations of the legiſlature, without an army to protect it, can be perfectly free. Let us ſuppoſe a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agitated in the aſſembly, which rouſes the paſſions of a mob, and about which popular clamours have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</q> Let us ſuppoſe ſuch a caſe as the late religious bill, (whether that bill was beneficial o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>I here ſpeak on a ſuppoſition of the ſenate being compoſed, as it heretofore has been, of proper men. When the election of the ſenate is to be held at Baltimore-town, I conceive that it will not be compoſed from the firſt claſs of men, conſidered with reſpect to either character, fortune or talents; and that ſuch men only will be elected who can ſubmit to be the tools of a party.</hi>

                        <hi>The city of Philadelphia is ſaid, in many caſes, to have influenced the determinations of congreſs, againſt their own better judgment.

When general Howe landed at the Head of Elk, his purpoſe appeared to be to penetrate to Philadelphia. The intrigues of the principal men in that city, and the clamours of the reſt, occaſioned the battle of Brandywine. The army of general Waſhington was greatly inferior to that of the enemy; but to ſave Philadelphia all hazards muſt be run. We were accordingly defeated; and had general Howe been diſpoſed to puſh his advantages, our affairs might, in all probability, have been irretrievably ruined.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:019698_0041_0FADA36D7A096FE8"/>intereſting to its inhabitants. I have mentioned the caſe of congreſs, as recent, ſtriking and familiar. Many other caſes might be produced to the ſame purpoſe,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſhew that in large and free capitals the open delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a legiſlature are liable to interruption from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, I barely mentioned the cities of London and Dublin. I ſuppoſe the inhabitants of Baltimore to be neither more orderly, nor more ſeditious, than thoſe of other large free trading towns. It muſt be admitted, that all theſe are, more or leſs, ſubject to parties, ſeditions and tumults. I ſmile at the ſuggeſtion of a mob being always to be overawed and ſuppreſſed by the reſpectable body of merchants. The time will come, when perhaps ſome of theſe reſpectable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants may deem mobs very proper political engines. There will ever be found in great cities, men (no matter to what order they belong) who by courting and humouring the people, will render them ſubſervient to their purpoſes; and theſe demagogues, by the weight of the people, will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to break down every conſtitutional barrier oppoſed to the aggrandiſement of their own power.</p>
               <p>Why does the Farmer ſo repeatedly wreſt the meaning of Ariſtides? Why does he imagine, I eſteem it a fatal policy to permit London to be the metropolis of Great-Britain? For the monarch of an independent nation, I am ſatisfied that it is a ſound policy to bring much force within a narrow compaſs; and for the king of England to remove his court, and, to eſtabliſh the ſeat of his government in a ſmall town, would be directly to ſeek his own deſtruction. I aſſent to all the Farmer has advanced in his paragraph reſpecting that nation, and the republic of Venice. But he ought to reflect, that, in each of theſe governments, the deliberations of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are protected by armed guards, continually maintained, and not unfrequently called into action.</p>
               <p>His doctrine of concentration can apply only to evince the propriety of drawing together the ſtrength and riches of the United States, provided we could think it neceſſary to ſacrifice everything to the protection of congreſs, our ſovereign power

"What have we to do," might they not ſay, <q>with this kind of policy? We have, thanks be to providence, little to apprehend from invaſions. But if we had, we are ſituated differently from the nations in Europe.

Let the legiſlature do what it will for the aggrandiſement of a ſingle town, and let my apprehenſions of the ill conſequences of the great preliminary meaſure be ever ſo groundleſs, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, from the nature of things, that this town will be ever a match for Philadelphia. It is perhaps to be expected, that in time it will be eclipſed even by Alexandria. And I think it not improbable, unleſs its good habits be perſerved, that the commerce of Baltimore-town has already been at its b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However be that as it may, I conceive it the true policy of the ſtate, taking not only the preſent, but future times into conſideration, to lend an aiding hand to every riſing town. It ought, in a particular manner, to cheriſh all ſuch as have any natural advantages. It ſeems ordained by providence that we ſhould have ſeveral trading towns; and it would be an inſult to that providence, to contemn the bleſſings, which it has dealt forth with a liberal hand. In our ſituation, the policy of a plurality of trading towns is beneficial, on a variety of accounts. It is by theſe, if by any thing, that Maryland as a ſeparate independent nation, would be able to preſerve its equilibrium with the neighbouring govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Suppoſe we have three towns, conſiſting each of 15,000 inhabitants, theſe, on one account at leaſt, muſt be more advantageous than one town of 45,000, as three towns would raiſe the value of lands in three neighbourhoods. But luxury, that bane of all genuine republics, that inſidious deadly ſoe to freedom, could never attain ſo great a height in any of the three, as it would moſt aſſuredly do in the one. Beſides, many of you would have a choice of markets. And, if a rival hip could take place amongſt them, it would operate to thy advantage of all, by ſtimulating the induſtry and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the merchants and mechanics, and by affording
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:019698_0044_0FADA373B08DD328"/>excitements to the farmers and planters. It would be thus that commerce would indeed be promoted, and the value of your lands indeed improved. It is not by paving the way for the principal inhabitants of a ſingle town to acquire immenſe eſtates, and by theſe eſtates, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they ſhall acquire in the legiſlature, to lord it over the land, that we ſhall beſt provide for our own happineſs, and that of our lateſt poſterity.</p>
               <p>That the merchants of this ſingle town are deſirous of engroſſing the whole commerce of the ſtate, is, I think, but too evident. The main public reaſon which they aſſign for giving them the ſeat of government, is the neceſſity of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commerce, and of concentrating our powers of exertion. Now this argument ſurely applies to the ſuppreſſion of all other trading towns; and if they can by any means bring about the projected removal, I think you muſt perceive the great advantage they will have for compaſſing any other meaſure which they may ſet their hearts upon. When I am calculating their weight and influence in the legiſlature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened amongſt them, I ſhould never think of ſtating proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the Farmer would have me. And he muſt think very meanly of his countrymen if he imagines they cannot detect the fallacy of his rule! Does any man ſuppoſe, that "as two are to thirty-ſix," ſo will the intereſt of Baltimore-town be to the landed intereſt? If indeed the queſtion could be plainly put, <q>ſhall the intereſt of Baltimore-town, or the landed intereſt be preferred?</q> I make no doubt, it would be determined by a vaſt majority in favour of the latter! Baltimore-town will take care never to contend openly againſt the landed intereſt, and it will take care alſo to gain over or to deceive, thoſe who ought to eſpouſe the intereſt of the land-holders.</p>
               <p>He has not aſſigned the true cauſes of the flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Pennſylvania. That condition is not owing to the government having confined commerce to a ſingle ſpot. Nature had provided for that, by affording only a ſingle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable river. Pennſylvania owes its proſperity to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of perfect religious freedom, to the other wiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of its illuſtrious founder, to the diſcouragements which have been conſtantly given to ſlavery, and to the wiſe
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:019698_0045_0FADA37472041F78"/>policy and admirable manners of the quakers, under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer government. But that the condition of our country people is far preferable to the condition of the country people of Pennſylvania, is evident to him who has travelled through or ſojourned in each ſtate, and who is not blinded by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and prepoſſeſſion. The reaſon is plain. The whole country of Pennſylvania is, at this time, under a kind of vaſſalage to the metropolis. Every thing depends upon their great town, and it is well known, and greatly lamented, that Philadelphia governs the whole ſtate. It is true, as I have before ſaid, that Pennſylvania is more powerful than Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Its territory is vaſtly more extenſive; and, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſize and buſtle of its capical, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> bank paper, it has at this moment the appearance of enjoying a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of proſperity than Maryland. Suppoſing even, that this appearance is not deceitful, for Maryland to confine its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to a ſingle town, becauſe nature has done it in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtate, would be running blindfold into a renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe bleſſings for which we are the envy of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent perſons in every part of that very ſtate, except the capital.</p>
               <p>If a town can be erected ſomewhere in Talbot county, and the inhabitants of the eaſtern ſhore can there find a ready market, it will ſurely be more advantageous for them to carry thither their commodities, and with them procure the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe they want, than to be obliged to go a long tedious voyage to the town of Baltimore. Perhaps indeed, the eaſtern ſhore might, by means of ſome beneficial regulations, have two or three conſiderable trading towns. George-town is nearer than Baltimore is to ſome parts of the upper counties; of courſe, it is more convenient to the inhabitants of thoſe parts by land. But, if the obſtructions in the Patowmack can be removed ſo as to afford a water carriage, it would be wicked in the extreme to labour for the deſtruction of George-town. If the trade down the Suſquehanna ſhall become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and a market may be had at Havre-de-Grace, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you would not compel the people to convey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, by a dangerous navigation, to Baltimore-town.</p>
               <p>There are great advantages to a ſtate in having conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trading towns. Its own citizens may, at one of theſe towns, diſpoſe immediately of the produce they ſhall carry to market; and a merchant may there, if he pleaſes, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:019698_0046_0FADA375A2297008"/>diſpoſe of a whole cargo at wholeſale, load his veſſel with diſpatch, and in a little time ſend her back to ſea. As in theſe towns there is generally a competition amongſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, the prices of your commodities cannot fail to be as high as can poſſibly be afforded by the merchant who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them; and as too there is a competition amongſt the ſellers of imported merchandiſe, you cannot fail to procure it as cheap as it can be ſold without ruin to the ſhopkeepers. For one trading town, Baltimore is already ſufficiently large; and the growth and commerce of that place has been of great ſervice to the ſtate; but it is not yet large enough to prevent its merchants from taking advantage of you by art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful combinations, provided we have but one trading town. The true policy of our government, would prompt it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine commerce to juſt as many ſpots as the real convenience of all its citizens would require. There is indeed a great ſeeming advantage for every man to have a port almoſt at his own door, as the carriage to market is thereby ſaved; but then the price is much leſs, and the ſale more uncertain, than if he were obliged to carry his commodities ſome little diſtance from home. A judicious port law is the only thing wanting to render this ſtate, in a little time, the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proſperous ſtate, in proportion to its ſize, in the union. But having a port at every man's door is one extreme, and having only one port is another. A wiſe politician might ſoon diſcover the proper medium. Were three or four ports eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on this and as many on the eaſtern ſhore, and were all merchant veſſels prohibited from leading or unloading any where elſe, we ſhould therein ſoon ſind our account, every one, or a competent number of theſe places, would, in a little time, afford the advantages I have mentioned; you would enjoy the benefit of a competition between theſe places, and there would be no danger of your ſuffering from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and monopolies.</p>
               <p>Againſt a ſcheme like this, I fear the prejudices of my countrymen, and the miſtaken notions of private intereſt, will raiſe inſuperable bars; but I flatter myſelf, that theſe prejudices will nevertheleſs produce ſome good. They muſt, I think, prevent the inhabitants of Baltimore-town from ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their preſent undertaking, provided only you have penetration to foreſee all the conſequences of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected removal.</p>

I think that I not only foreſee theſe conſequences, but can perceive plainly the views and expectations of ſome of theſe inhabitants. They expect, I preſume, by the legiſlature "taking them under its immediate protection," to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Petty towns there may be in the different parts of the ſtate; but theſe muſt contain no capital merchants. They ſhall contain ſhopkeepers, tributary to Baltimore; and theſe ſhopkeepers ſhall not preſume to load or unload a ſingle ſhip: If all this can be effected by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the government, the town of Baltimore will indeed be a moſt important place. But can you, reflecting on all I have advanced, and uſing too your own reflections and obſervations, can you, I ſay, perceive, that all this will tend to the general happineſs and proſperity to the ſtate? Can you ſuppoſe it will raiſe the value of your lands at a diſtance from the capital? Can you ſuppoſe it will raiſe the prices of your commodities beyond what they may attain without this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Can you ſuppoſe that this will increaſe the ſtrength of Maryland more than by having a variety of trading towns, or that it will give a greater weight in the union?</p>
               <p>I have endeavoured to demonſtrate, (and I truſt to your ſatisfaction,) that if Baltimore does not become the favourite, or in other words, the director of the legiſlature, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of that town will not in the end be promoted by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the government, notwithſtanding that at firſt more goods will be there ſold, more country produce there pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, its houſes better filled, and more tenements erected. You muſt, I think, be ſatisfied, that your own welfare, and the ſtrength and dignity of the ſtate, do not depend on the completion of the meaſures againſt which I have warned you.

Theſe may alter with a change of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and even the ſet of inhabitants, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a removal of the government, will be materially changed in the courſe of a very few years. But in the name of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, what is it they do mean? If at any time they can hit upon a ſcheme for the advancement of the public good, or if they want any local regulations that are juſt and conſiſtent with the public welfare, what is there to prevent them from laying their plans before the legiſlature at Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis? The miſchief is, that every thing muſt there undergo a full and fair diſcuſſion. The aſſembly has been ever prone to indulge them in every thing that has had the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of propriety; the aſſembly to have done otherwiſe muſt have been wicked and blind; and every one readily allows, that they are, on all accounts, entitled to the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reſpect. If, notwithſtanding this, they cannot be contented until they get under the immediate protection of the legiſlature, and yet do not mean to govern the ſtate, I can aſſign to them no other motives but theſe. They muſt have in contemplation ſome matter of mere private intereſt, and hence they become advocates for their town. Or they muſt conceive, that by merely enjoying the ſeat of government, without having any influence in the legiſlature, their town will be benefited; and they may think too, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the ſtate will be improved. In both theſe I have endeavoured to demonſtrate they would be deceived. Or their mere pride cannot ſupport the idea of a town, ſo far inferior to theirs, being the metropolis, bearing all the honours of government, and compelling them at times to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend public bodies. But in this matter you are all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And you ought ſurely to keep the ſeat of government where you may be certain that your repreſentatives cannot be expoſed to the arts of cunning, intriguing, intereſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By fixing the ſeat of government at a large commercial town, you put your liberties to the hazard, as much as a ſingle ſtate in the union of thirteen free ſtates can poſſibly do. True policy does not require us to confine commerce to a ſingle ſpot; and you are greatly intereſted in the growth of other towns. The value of your lands will not increaſe in the ſame proportion as the ſize and trade of a ſingle town. The value of all your lands may be augmented by the growth of a number of other towns. The liberal inſtruction of the riſing generation will be beſt carried on at a ſmall capital, diſtinguiſhed by the refinement of its manners, purity of morals, and univerſal good order; and the liberties of your poſterity depend on maintaining a ſucceſſion of honeſt and able men. There is no uſe whatever to a ſtate like ours, in concentrating our riches and ſtrength; but by ſo doing you may run the riſk of combinations againſt your liberties. In all great towns there is a fatal tendency to luxury and diſſipation, and of courſe to a degeneracy of manners; but theſe evils will be much greater in a large town, when it becomes the capital of a ſtate. The native ſoil of every ſpecies of corruption is an extenſive metropolis. The ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, merely as ſuch, is not favourable to the commerce of a town; but as it cannot fail to give any large town an undue influence in all public councils, the fixing of the ſeat of government at Baltimore, and the adoption of the politics of that town, will probably do an irreperable injury to the community at large. And all theſe are but a part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments

The motion was ſeconded, and Thurſday laſt was aſſigned for the conſideration of this important matter. It has long been complained of, that large and populous ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are improper places for the deliberations of a legiſlature. Beſides the neceſſary noiſe and hurry of buſineſs in a large commercial town, many members of the legiſlature are thought to be under an undue influence.

Of Philadelphia I know a little more; and might ſafely refer you to a hiſtory of that ſtate for an illuſtration of almoſt every part of my argument. That ſtate, indeed, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of almoſt all its worthy citizens, has only one branch of the legiſlature.

               <p>Some of the inhabitants of Baltimore-town have ſet up a kind of claim to the ſeat of government, and they found it on the amount of their public taxes.</p>
               <p>If a thing, merely in the gift of government, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for between the town of Baltimore and the city of Annapolis, the legiſlature might determine on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which actuated the judges in the famous conteſt for the armour of Achilles; or they might perhaps decide with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in favour of the town, on account of its great ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of numbers. But if a deciſion in its favour would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the community, this ſingle town would be bound to give up to the ſtate, on the ſame principle that Annapolis would be bound to yield to it. The payment of taxes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, confers no other right, either on an individual or a town, than a right to the equal protection of government; which, as it is milituted for the benefit of all the perſons compoſing ſociety, ſhould, if poſſible, be adminiſtered ſo as to injure none, and to conſult the welfare of all.</p>

At leaſt they have not, in the ſmalleſt degree, their livelihoods depending on the event. Say even that they would be conſiderably enriched, and that the community is in no way intereſted. Would you, on account merely of doing good to your fellow-citizens, prefer the giving to a great number of men that, which they never have poſſeſſed, that which, 'till very lately, they never looked for, and that, which is by no means neceſſary to their happineſs? Would you, I ſay, prefer doing this, to the letting a ſmall number of men retain that which they ever have held, to which no others have a ſuperior right, which cannot be divided, and which is almoſt eſſential to their exiſtence? Whether it is better to let a ſingle man retain an eſtate, juſt competent to his ſupport, or to take it, and diſtribute it amongſt half a dozen men, who before were as rich as himſelf? The queſtion will not admit a diſpute; and you muſt at once perceive the vaſt difference between with-holding from a man that which he never had, and the depriving him of what he has always had. Examine the ſubject in every point of view, the more you reflect, the better you will be convinced, that Baltimore-town ought not, in this inſtance, to be gratified. I will not go ſo far as others have done. I will not ſay, the attempt for its wickedneſs, is without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel. But I muſt ſay, that never yet have I heard of any thing more ungenerous. To view it in its naked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is, indeed, almoſt ſufficient to impreſs one with horror!</p>
               <p>The only arguments in favour of the propoſition, which remain to be diſcuſſed, are directed to your repreſentatives in their private capacities, and it is your buſineſs to take care that theſe arguments ſhall not influence them to ſacrifice your intereſt to what they may conceive to be their own private advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It is ſaid that at Baltimore-town the members of the aſſembly may tranſact their private buſineſs, whilſt they are managing the affairs of government. This conſideration is preſſed home to their feelings, as individuals. But ſurely <hi>you</hi> cannot be benefited, by having <hi>their</hi> attention diverted from the public buſineſs. Would any pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:019698_0053_0FADA37A6F8D0110"/>utmoſt diligence and attention, a perſon, who at the ſame time, is carrying on a buſineſs much more intereſting to him than that of his employers? I acknowledge, that in general the private buſineſs of the members may ſoon be diſpatched. But their ſtaunch friends at election will expect their little affairs to be managed likewiſe. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that your repreſentatives will even ſolicit agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and commiſſions,</q> and will eſteem their ſeats of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, on account of being maintained by the public, whilſt they ſhall be devoting their talents and attention to private concerns. Does not every man know, that to execute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the duties of a legiſlator, the cloſeſt application, the moſt intenſe ſtudy, and an entire exemption from all other buſineſs, is abſolutely neceſſary? We are told indeed, that few members are diſtinguiſhed, even at Annapolis, by their application to the buſineſs of the ſeſſion; and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a great portion of their time in unprofitable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This I ſhall not diſpute; but let them, at any time, have private buſineſs to tranſact, and I am afraid, that inſtead of devoting to it their hours of amuſement, they will rather employ thoſe hours which belong ſtrictly to the public. There is a danger too of having their minds occupied by this private buſineſs, even whilſt they ſhall be within the public walls.</p>
               <p>From a gentleman who has called the 9th article of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of rights <hi>only declaratory,</hi> I did not expect an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derived from that article. But it ſeems, that whenever it ſuits the purpoſe of Baltimore-town, this article may ſerve as a guide to the legiſlature. The article ſays, that the place for the meeting of the legiſlature muſt be moſt convenient to the members. He has miſtaken the plain and obvious ſenſe of the article. The place is not to be the moſt convenient for them in their private characters, to conduct their private affairs. In theſe the public is not intereſted; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is intereſted, as I have before ſaid, in letting them have little opportunity of tranſacting their private affairs, whilſt they ought to be engaged in its ſervice. The article means a place the moſt central, the moſt convenient for them to repair to, and the beſt ſuited to them in their public charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as members of the legiſlature. <q>Let us then examine which place is better adapted to the buſineſs of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In Baltimore-town the members may be occupied
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:019698_0054_0FADA37B678508F0"/>by private buſineſs. In Annapolis, it is preſumable, they will have little buſineſs,</q> except that upon which they ſhall be ſent, the weighty buſineſs of ſecuring the happineſs of their conſtituents. <q>I will not ſay that Baltimore-town, with all its numerous buildings, cannot afford proper ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations, becauſe I doubt not, in the beginning, that great efforts would be made to render the place agreeable. I maintain, that in Annapolis the members may always procure, at a reaſonable rate, even elegant fare, comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lodgings, and quiet apartments, remote from all that noiſe and buſtle of buſineſs, which is altogether inconſiſtent with calm thought and ſober deliberation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That Annapolis is more central, and more convenient for a majority of the ſtate to repair to, you muſt all know. By your conſtitution, the annual meeting of the legiſlature takes place in November, and it rarely ends before January. At that time, <hi>as I am informed,</hi> the town of Baltimore is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inacceſſible by water, and therefore the gentlemen of the eaſtern ſhore, to return home, might be under the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of heading the bay, or coming down by land to Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis. At what other ſeaſon can they ſo conveniently leave their homes as at the end of autumn? Say that you will change the conſtitution, and let the annual meeting be in ſummer, (for it cannot be in the ſpring,) the heat, the duſt, and the apprehenſion, if not the real danger, of contagion, will ſoon induce an opinion, that it were better to attend at the preſent ſtated period at Annapolis.</p>
               <p>There is a ſet of men, the pretended friends to Annapolis, but in effect its moſt dangerous foes. Theſe men affect candour and diſintereſtedneſs. They yield to the force of the reaſons againſt the meaſure, but then they argue in this way. <q>The removal is an event which the ordinary courſe of affairs muſt inevitably bring about. The citizens of Annapolis can prevent it only a few ſeaſons longer; the delay will afford them very little benefit; and, until it takes place, they muſt remain in an uneaſy ſtate of ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From the creation of the world unto this preſent day, there is no record or tradition that death has ſpared any man more than a thouſand years. For numerous ages paſt, how few have reached the ſhort ſum of threeſcore years and ten! Were it not better then for ye at once to die, than to linger out a frail feveriſh exiſtence, continually harraffed by the dread of that which no earthly means can prevent?</p>

               <p>Would this harrangue induce a ſingle man to lay violent hands upon himſelf? Would it prevent him in his ſickneſs from uſing the means of recovery? There is, however, a capital diſtinction between the two caſes. Death we all know to be inevitable. The removal of the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am ſo far from thinking unavoidable, that I never yet could ſee the great cauſe which Annapolis had to fear. In a few years, I am perſuaded, the matter will be totally out of the queſtion; for in theſe few years you will be able to profit from the experience of your ſiſter ſtates; and you will diſcern your true intereſts too well to afford Baltimore-town the leaſt room for hope.</p>
               <p>That the greateſt towns throughout the world are, for the moſt part, capitals, I cannot deny; but this conſideration affords no argument for Baltimore-town. Moſt of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the world are arbitrary, and for the ſecurity of ſuch, large capitals are abſolutely neceſſary. Whenever therefore, in one of theſe governments, whether it be a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, a monarchy, or an ariſtocracy, a town increaſes ſo far as to overtop the capital, it is good policy for the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power immediately to change the place of its reſidence There is perhaps no inſtance of a large metropolis in a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment entirely free.

For us then to change our capital, becauſe in moſt other governments their largeſt towns are capitals, would be acting contrary to the dictates of common ſenſe and experience. In a word, ſo long as your liberties ſhall be dear to your hearts, and ſo long as ye ſhall be able to underſtand your true intereſts, you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the government to remain where there is nothing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger them.</p>

I DOUBT not, my countrymen, that before the next general election, you will be ſtrongly ſolicited for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and I apprehend, from the induſtry, perſeverance and influence, of Baltimore-town, that moſt of the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be in its favour. I could invoke Heaven to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that in writing this addreſs I have the ſincereſt wiſhes to promote your happineſs. And all the return I aſk from you, is to weigh well the arguments I have uſed, to carry them with you to all public meetings in your reſpective counties, and to all upon every man who ſhall ſolicit your countenance to the propoſed meaſure, to give them a full, clear, and ſati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is the evident intention of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that theſe men ſhall always be at perfect liberty to exerciſe their own judgments. If not, wherein is the uſe of that refined mode of election? It were much better for the people at once to elect the ſenate, than to chooſe electors who are bound to obey their inſtructions. It would in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Permit me now, my countrymen, to remark, that although I do not queſtion your right of dictating to your delegates, you ought to exerciſe that right in a very ſparing manner. Perhaps inſtructions have never yet been fairly obtained. I will inform you what alone I conceive to be fair inſtructions, and ſuch as your repreſentatives may be bound to obey. If at a public meeting, of which general notice has been given, any matter ſhall be freely diſcuſſed, and inſtructions reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be produced, and read to the people there aſſei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r delegates either to purſue thoſe inſtructions, or to reſign their ſeats.</p>
               <p>But when buſy artful men, who are not even reſidents of the county, ſhall go about ſoliciting the people, one after another, to ſubſcribe their inſtructions; and when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have never heard a diſcuſſion of the ſubject; and when even a majority has not ſigned them; inſtructions like theſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:019698_0057_0FADA382EB909680"/>cannot, and ought not, on any principle whatever, to be binding. It is notorious, that inſtructions like theſe may be obtained for almoſt any purpoſe whatever. Sometimes indeed, your repreſentatives take a fancy that they are inſtructed, when they have not even a writing to ſhew; when they have not converſed on the ſubject with a tenth part of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and when perhaps the ſubject has not in their county been even generally talked of. The truth is, theſe men have not a proper ſenſe of their own dignity, and they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be dictated to by a few buſtling noiſy men, without whoſe aſſiſtance they are apprehenſive they cannot maintain their ſeats.</p>
               <p>It is rarely that the people of a county can have a fair comprehen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>des of a queſtion are permitted to be ſtated and exammed. Beſides, the repreſentatives of each county are, at the ſame time, repreſentatives of the ſtate, and bound to conſult the good of the whole. For all theſe weighty and moſt ſubſtantial reaſons, I would adviſe you to give your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions in thoſe caſes only where your rights and liberties may be endangered. In a caſe like the preſent, when every e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>But I do not urge you, my countrymen, even on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, to bind your delegates by inſtructions. I have ever obſerved, that the men fondeſt of procuring them, are thoſe who are fearful of being borne down by ſuperior reaſon. You will be told, that the friends of Annapolis, at the laſt ſeſſion, would not conſent to refer to the people the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a removal. It is true that a motion was made for leave to bring in a bill for removing the ſeat of government. This motion being both ſeconded and oppoſed, a day was aſſigned for the debate. On that day, after a fair and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate diſcuſſion, and when every member was <hi>at perfect liberty</hi> to vote his opinion, the motion was rejected by 35 againſt 18. A ſecond motion was then made, for leave to bring in the ſame bill, to be publiſhed under the direction of the houſe for your conſideration. This motion too was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected almoſt without a debate. It was the publication of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:019698_0058_0FADA3843843DEA0"/>this bill, by order of the houſe of delegates, that the Farmer thinks would have been "a reaſonable expedient for collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſenſe." It would have been indulging the friends of Baltimore-town in a manner, of which, in this ſtate, there never was, and never ought to be, an example; and a ſmall minority had not the leaſt colour of right to expect it. You muſt indeed have deſpiſed the conduct of your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, had they publiſhed for your conſideration, a bill which, after deliberation, they would not ſuffer to be brought into their houſe.</p>
               <p>It has been generally believed, that a majority of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen compoſing the preſent ſenate, was oppoſed to the meaſure. Of courſe, one great object may be (if I may uſe the expreſſion) to pack a ſenate; and for that purpoſe it will be expedient, in the firſt inſtance, to pack their electors. You will remember, however, that the ſenate to be choſen in September next, is to laſt five years, and in that time an improper ſenate might ſubvert the conſtitution. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention were ſo fully impreſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I wiſh not to be underſtood, that any perſon who ſhall vote for a removal of the government would be unworthy of a ſeat in the ſenate. I have no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted narrow way of thinking. My poſition is, that ſuch men only ought to be elected, who poſſeſs the moſt culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated minds, the moſt independent ſpirits, the greateſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As few men, indeed, poſſeſs all theſe requiſites of a perfect ſenator, the electors ſhould diſcard no man of whoſe worth we have had ample experience. I would diſmiſs no man merely becauſe he is an advocate for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, and I would not elect even a plain, honeſt, ignorant man, merely becauſe he is a ſtaunch friend to Annapolis. Let the electors examine the merits of our preſent ſenators, without any regard to their ſentiments on any one particular queſtion. Let the opinion of the electors on the preſent queſtion be what it may, they cannot ſuppoſe every thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on carrying the meaſure. I conceive, that if an cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>I beſeech you, my beloved countrymen, to be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly circumſpect in your choice of electors, and attempt not to lay them under any injunction whatever, except that of examining the conduct of each memner of the preſent ſenate, and of making very particular inquiries concerning all thoſe who ſhall be prepoſed as objects of their choice, As to the general proceedings of the ſenate, from the commencement of the government, the whole ſtate bears ample teſtimony of their worth; and I know not the man in the preſent body, whoſe conduct, on the whole, has not merited your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. However, it is the duty of your electors to make the ſtricteſt ſcrutiny, and let them not think of diſmiſſing any gentleman, until they ſhall be certain of finding a more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſucceſſor.</p>

They tell you, ſhe receives more from the public than ſhe contributes. In what manner can they ſupport the aſſertion?

And that ever ſince, the members of the church of England, who conſtitute almoſt the whole of the citizens, have conſtantly had Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and have handſomely ſupported their miniſter?
