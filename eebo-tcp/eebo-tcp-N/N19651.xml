            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It has been the deſtiny of the writer of this Story, to be occupied throughout her life, in what has the leaſt ſuited either her inclination or capacity—with an invincible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment in her ſpeech, it was her lot for thirteen years to gain a ſubſiſtence by public ſpeaking—and, with the utmoſt deteſtation of the fatigue of inventing, a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuffering under a ſedentary life, and an education confined to the narrow boundaries preſcribed her ſex, it has been her fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>DORRIFORTH bred at St. Omer's in all the ſcholaſtic rigour of that college, was by education, and the ſolemn vows of his order, a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic prieſt—but nicely diſcriminating between the philoſophical and the ſuperſtitious part of that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and adopting the former only, he poſſeſſed qualities not unworthy the firſt profeſſors of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity—every virtue which it was his vocation to preach, it was his care to practiſe; nor was he in the claſs of thoſe of the religious, who, by ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves from the world, fly the merit they might have in reforming mankind. He refuſed to ſhelter himſelf from the temptations of the layman by the walls of a cloiſter, but ſought for, and found that ſhelter in the centre of London, where he dwelt, in his own prudence, juſtice, fortitude, and temperance.</p>
                     <p>He was about thirty, and had lived in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis near five years, when a gentleman, above his own age, but with whom he had from his youth contracted a moſt ſincere friendſhip, died, and left

Milner was a member of the church of Rome, but on his marriage with a lady of Proteſtant tenets, they mutually agreed their ſons ſhould be educated in the religious opinion of their father, and their daughters in that of their mother. One child only was the reſult of their union, the child whoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture welfare now occupied the thoughts of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring father—from him the care of her education had been with-held, as he kept inviolate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Her little heart employed in all the endleſs purſuits of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal accompliſhments, had left her mind without one ornament, except thoſe which nature gave, and even they were not wholly preſerved from the ravages made by its rival, <hi>Art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While her father was in health he beheld with the extreme of delight, his accompliſhed daughter without one fault with which taſte or elegance could have reproached her, nor ever enquired what might be her other failings—Caſt on a bed of ſickneſs, and upon the point of leaving her to her future fate, thoſe failings at once ruſhed on his memory—and all the pride, the fond enjoyment he had taken in beholding her open the ball, or delight her hearers with her ſprightly wit, eſcaped his remembrance; or not eſcaping, were thought of with a ſigh of contrition, or at beſt a contemptuous frown, at the frivolous qualification.</p>
                     <p>"Something more eſſential," ſaid he to himſelf, "muſt be conſidered—ſomething to prepare her for an hour like this I now experience—can I then leave her to the charge of thoſe who themſelves never remember ſuch an hour will come?—Dorriforth is

                     <p>Dorriforth, who came poſt from London to viſit Mr. Milner, in his illneſs, received a few moments before his death all his injunctions, and promiſed to fulfil them—but in this laſt token of Mr. Milner's perfect eſteem of his friend, he ſtill reſtrained him from all authority to direct his ward in one religious opinion contrary to thoſe her mother had profeſſed, and in which ſhe herſelf had been educated.</p>
                     <p>"Never perplex her mind with an idea that may diſturb, but cannot reform"—were his lateſt words, and Dorriforth's reply gave him entire ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner was not with her father at this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting period—ſome delicately nervous friend, with whom ſhe was on a viſit at Bath, thought proper to conceal from her not only the danger of his death, but even his indiſpoſition, leſt it might alarm a mind ſhe thought too ſuſceptible. This refined tenderneſs gave poor Miſs Milner the almoſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable agony, of hearing her father was no more, even before ſhe was told he was not in health. In the bittereſt anguiſh ſhe flew to pay her laſt duty to his remains, and performed it with the trueſt filial love, while Dorriforth, upon important buſineſs, was obliged to return to town.</p>

with his thoughts more engaged upon the truſt that friend had repoſed in him.

                     <p>Mr. Dorriforth was nearly related to one of our firſt Catholic peers; his income was by no means confined, but approaching to affluence, yet his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to thoſe in poverty, and the moderation of his own deſires were ſuch, that he lived in all the careful plainneſs of oeconomy—his habitation was in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> houſe of a Mrs. Horton, an elderly lady, who had a maiden niece reſiding with her not many years younger than herſelf—But although Miſs Woodley was thirty, and in perſon exceedingly plain, yet ſhe poſſeſſed ſuch an extreme cheerfulneſs of temper, and ſuch an inexhauſtible fund of good nature, that ſhe eſcaped not only the ridicule, but even the appellation, of an old maid.</p>
                     <p>In this houſe Dorriforth had lived before the death of Mr. Horton, nor upon that event did he think it neceſſary, notwithſtanding his religious vow of celibacy, to fly the roof of two ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeductive innocent females as Mrs. Horton and her niece—on their part, they regarded him with all that reſpect and reverence the moſt religious flock regards its paſtor; and his friendly ſociety they not only eſteemed a ſpiritual, but a temporal advantage, as the liberal ſtipend he allowed for his apartments and board enabled them to continue in the large and commodious houſe where they had reſided du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of Mr. Horton.</p>
                     <p>Here, upon Mr. Dorriforth's return from his journey, preparations were made for the reception of his ward, her father having made it one of his

requeſts that ſhe might, for a time at leaſt, dwell in the ſame houſe with her guardian, receive the ſame viſits, and cultivate the acquaintance of his acquaintances and friends.</p>
                     <p>When the will of her father was made known to Miſs Milner, ſhe ſubmitted without the ſmalleſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to all he had required—her mind, at that time impreſſed with the moſt poignant ſorrow for his loſs, made no diſtinction of happineſs that was to come; and the day was appointed, with her ſilent acquieſcence, when ſhe was to arrive in London, and take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's, with all the retinue of a rich heireſs.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton was delighted with the addition this acquiſition to her family was likely to make to her annual income, and to the ſtyle of her living.—The good-natured Miſs Woodley was overjoyed at the expectation of their new gueſt, yet ſhe herſelf could not tell why—but the reaſon was, her kind heart wanted more ample field for its benevolence; and now her thoughts were all pleaſingly employed how ſhe ſhould render, not only the lady herſelf, but even all her attendants, happy in their new ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The thoughts of Dorrriforth were leſs agreeably engaged—Cares, doubts, fears, poſſeſſed his mind—ſo forcibly poſſeſſed it, that upon every occaſion which offered, he would inquiſitively try to gain intelligence of his ward's diſpoſition before he ſaw her; for he was, as yet, a ſtranger not only to the real propenſities of her mind, but even to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; a conſtant round of viſits having prevented his meeting her at her father's, the very few times he had been at his houſe, ſince her return from boarding-ſchool. The firſt perſon whoſe opinion he, with all proper reſerve, aſked concerning Miſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025650_0010_0FCEB0EE7674DF48"/>
Milner was lady Evans, the widow of a baronet who frequently viſited at Mrs. Horton's.</p>
                     <p>But that the reader may be intereſted in what Dorriforth ſays and does, it is neceſſary to give ſome deſcription of his perſon and manners. His figure was tall and elegant, but his face, except a pair of dark bright eyes, a ſet of white teeth, and a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fall in his clerical curls of dark brown hair, had not one feature to excite admiration—he poſſeſſed notwithſtanding ſuch a gleam of ſenſibility diffuſed over each, that many people miſtook his face for handſome, and all were more or leſs attracted by it—in a word, the charm that is here meant to be deſcribed is a countenance—on his countenance you beheld the feelings of his heart—ſaw all its inmoſt workings—the quick pulſes that beat with hope and fear, or the placid ones that were ſtationary with patient reſignation. On this countenance his thoughts were pictured, and as his mind was enriched with every virtue that could make it valuable, ſo was his honeſt face adorned with every emblem of thoſe virtues—and they not only gave a luſtre to his aſpect, but added a harmonious ſound to all he uttered; it was perſuaſive, it was perfect eloquence, whilſt in his looks you beheld his thoughts moving with his lips, and ever coinciding with what he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>With one of thoſe intereſting looks which reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the anxiety of his heart, and with that graceful reſtraint of all geſticulation, for which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable even in his moſt anxious concerns, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed lady Evans who had called on Mrs. Horton to hear and to tell the news of the day: Your ladyſhip was at Bath laſt ſpring—you know the young lady to whom I have the honour of being appointed guardian.—Pray"—</p>
                     <p>He was earneſtly intent upon aſking a queſtion, but was prevented by her ladyſhip.</p>

"Dear Mr. Dorriforth, do not aſk me any thing about the lady—when I ſaw her ſhe was very young: though indeed that is but three months ago, and ſhe can't be much older now."</p>
                     <p>"She is eighteen," anſwered Dorriforth, colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with regret at the doubts her ladyſhip had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, but not inſpired.</p>
                     <p>"And ſhe is very beautiful, that I can aſſure you," replied her ladyſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Which I call no qualification," ſaid Dorriforth, riſing from his ſeat in evident uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"But where there is nothing elſe," returned lady Evans; "let me tell you, beauty is ſomething."</p>
                     <p>"Much worſe than nothing, in my opinion," returned Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>"But now, Mr. Dorriforth, do not from what I have ſaid, frighten yourſelf, and imagine the young lady worſe than ſhe really is—all I know of her, is merely that ſhe's a young, idle; indiſcreet, giddy girl, with half a dozen lovers in her ſuite; ſome coxcombs, ſome men of gallantry, ſome ſingle, and ſome married."</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth ſtarted.—"For the firſt time of my life," cried he with a manly ſorrow, "I wiſh I had never known her father."</p>
                     <p>"Nay," ſaid Mrs. Horton, who expected every thing to happen juſt as ſhe wiſhed, (for neither an excellent education, the beſt company, or long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience had been able to cultivate or brighten this good lady's underſtanding.)

The good natured Miſs Woodley, who ſat work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the window, an humble liſtener to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ventured on this to ſay exactly ſix words: "Then don't mention them any more."</p>
                     <p>"Let us change the ſubject," ſaid Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>"With all my heart," cried her ladyſhip, "and I am ſure it will be to the young lady's advantage."</p>
                     <p>"Is ſhe tall, or ſhort?" aſked Mrs. Horton, ſtill wiſhing for farther information.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, tall enough of all conſcience," returned lady Evans; "I tell you again there is no fault can be found with her perſon."</p>
                     <p>"But if her mind is defective"—exclaimed Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth with a ſigh—</p>
                     <p>"—That may be improved as well as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," cried Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"No my dear," returned her ladyſhip, "I never heard of a pad to make ſtrait an ill-ſhapen diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition."</p>
                     <p>"O yes, lady Evans," anſwered Miſs Woodley; "good company, good books, experience, and the misfortunes of other's, may have more power to form the mind to virtue, than"—</p>
                     <p>"Her ladyſhip would not ſuffer her to go on, but riſing haſtily from her ſeat, cried, "I muſt be gone—I have fifty people waiting for me at home—beſides, were I inclined to hear a ſermon, I ſhould deſire Mr. Dorriforth to preach, and not you."</p>
                     <p>Juſt then Mrs. Hillgrave was announced.—"And here is Mrs. Hillgrave,"—Continued lady Evans—"I believe Mrs. Hillgrave you know Miſs Milner don't you? The young lady who has lately loſt her father."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Hillgrave was the wife of a merchant who had met with ſome ſevere loſſes, and as ſoon as the name of Miſs Milner was uttered, ſhe lifted up her hands, and the tears ſtarted in her eyes.</p>

                        <pb n="10" facs="unknown:025650_0013_0FCEB0F3B8FE02F8"/>
"There!" cried lady Evans, "I deſire you will give your opinion of her, and I am ſorry I cannot ſtay to hear it." Saying this, ſhe coure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>d and took her leave.</p>
                     <p>When Mrs. Hillgrave had been ſeated a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, Mrs. Horton, who loved information equal to the moſt inquiſitive of her ſex, begged that lady,—"if ſhe might be permitted to know, why, at the mention of Miſs Milner, ſhe had ſeemed ſo much affected?"</p>
                     <p>This queſtion intereſting the fears of Dorriforth, he turned anxiouſly round attentive to the reply.</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Milner," anſwered ſhe, "has been my benefactreſs, and the beſt I ever had." As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe took out her handkerchief and wiped away the tears that ran down her face.</p>
                     <p>"How ſo?" cried Dorriforth eagerly, with his eyes moiſtened with joy, nearly as much as her's were with gratitude.</p>
                     <p>"My huſband, at the commencement of his diſtreſſes," replied Mrs. Hillgrave, "owed a ſum of money to her father, and from repeated provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Mr. Milner was determined to ſeize upon all our effects—his daughter, however, procured us time in order to diſcharge the debt; and when ſhe found that time was inſufficient, and her father no longer to be diſſuaded from his intention, ſhe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſold ſome of her moſt valuable ornaments to ſatisfy his demand and ſcreen us from its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces."</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth, pleaſed at this recital, took Mrs. Hillgrave by the hand, and told her "ſhe ſhould never want a friend."</p>
                     <p>"Is Miſs Milner tall, or ſhort?" again aſked Mrs. Horton, fearing from the ſudden pauſe which had enſued, the ſubject ſhould be dropped.</p>

                     <p>THIS gentlewoman's viſit inſpired Mr. Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth with ſome confidence in the principles and character of his ward.—The day arrived on which ſhe was to leave her father's ſeat, to take up her abode at Mrs. Horton's; and he, accompanied by Miſs Woodley, went in his carriage to meet her, and waited at an inn on the road for her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>When the carriage which brought Miſs.

                     <p>But the ſprightly vivacity, the natural gaiety, which report had given to Miſs Milner, were ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by her recent ſorrow to a meek ſadneſs—and that haughty diſplay of charms, imputed to her manners, was changed to a penſive demeanor.—The inſtant Dorriforth was introduced to her by Miſs Woodley as her "Guardian, and her deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed father's moſt beloved friend," ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, knelt down to him for a moment, and promiſed ever to obey him as her father.—He had his handkerchief to his face at the time, or ſhe would have beheld the agitation of his heart—the remoteſt ſenſations of his ſoul.</p>

                     <p>AFTER a night's reſt in London, leſs ſtrongly impreſſed with the loſs of her father, reconciled, if not already attached to her new acquaintance, her thoughts pleaſingly occupied with the reflection ſhe was in that gay metropolis—a wild rapturous picture of which her active fancy had often formed—Miſs Milner aroſe from a peaceful and refreſhing ſleep, with much of that vivacity, and all thoſe airy charms, which for a while had yielded their tranſcendant power, to leſs potent ſadneſs.</p>
                     <p>Beautiful as ſhe had appeared to Miſs Woodley and to Dorriforth the preceding day, when ſhe joined them the next morning at breakfaſt, repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of her lively elegance and dignified ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they gazed at her, and at each other alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with wonder!—and Mrs. Horton, as ſhe ſat at the head of her tea-table, felt herſelf but as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſervant, ſuch command has beauty if united with ſenſe and with virtue.—In Miſs Milner it was ſo united.—Yet let not our over-ſcrupulous readers be miſled, and extend their idea of her virtue ſo as to magnify it beyond that which frail mortals commonly poſſeſs; nor muſt they cavil, if, on a nearer view, they find it leſs—but let them conſider, that if Miſs Milner had more faults than generally belong to others, ſhe had likewiſe more temptations.</p>
                     <p>From her infancy ſhe had been indulged in all her wiſhes to the extreme of folly, and habitually ſtarted at the unpleaſant voice of controul—ſhe was beautiful, ſhe had been too frequently told the high value of that beauty, and thought thoſe moments

paſſed in waſteful idleneſs during which ſhe was not gaining ſome new conqueſt—ſhe had beſides a quick ſenſibility, which too frequently diſcovered itſelf in the immediate reſentment of injury or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect—ſhe had acquired alſo the dangerous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a wit; but to which ſhe had no real preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, although the moſt diſcerning critic, hearing her converſe, might fall into this miſtake.—Her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies had all the effect of repartee, not becauſe ſhe poſſeſſed thoſe qualities which can properly be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wit, but that what ſhe ſaid was ſpoken with an energy, an inſtantaneous and powerful perception of what ſhe ſaid, joined with a real or well-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited ſimplicity, a quick turn of the eye, and an arch ſmile of the countenance.—Her words were but the words of others, and, like thoſe of others, put into common ſentences; but the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very made them paſs for wit, as grace, in an ill proportioned figure, will often make it paſs for ſymmetry.</p>
                     <p>And now—leaving deſcription—the reader muſt form a judgment of her by her actions; by all the round of great or trivial circumſtances that ſhall be related.</p>
                     <p>At breakfaſt, which was juſt begun at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this chapter, the converſation was lively on the part of Miſs Milner, wiſe on the part of Dorriforth, good on the part of Miſs Woodley, and an endeavour at all three on the part of Mrs. Horton.—The diſcourſe at length drew from Mr. Dorriforth this obſervation.</p>
                     <p>"You have a greater reſemblance of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Miſs Milner, than I imagined you had from report: I did not expect to find you ſo like him."</p>
                     <p>"Nor did I, Mr. Dorriforth, expect to find you any thing like what you are."</p>

"No?—pray, madam, what did you expect to find me?"</p>
                     <p>"I expected to find you an elderly man, and a plain man."</p>
                     <p>This was ſpoken in an artleſs manner, but in a tone which obviouſly declared ſhe thought her guardian both young and handſome.—He replied, but not without ſome little embarraſſment, "A plain man you ſhall find me in all my actions."</p>
                     <p>She returned, "Then your actions are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your looks."</p>
                     <p>For in what ſhe ſaid, Miſs Milner had the quality peculiar to wits, to ſpeak the thought that firſt occurs, which thought has generally truth on its ſide.—On this he ventured to pay her a compliment in return.</p>
                     <p>"You, Miſs Milner, I ſhould ſuppoſe, muſt be a very bad judge of what is plain, and what is not."</p>
                     <p>"How ſo, Sir?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe I am ſure you will readily own you do not think yourſelf handſome; and allowing that, you inſtantly want judgment."</p>
                     <p>"And I would rather want judgment than beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty," ſhe replied; "and ſo I give up the one for the other."</p>
                     <p>With a ſerious face, as if propoſing a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious queſtion, Dorriforth continued, "And you really believe you are not handſome?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould from my own opinion believe ſo, but in ſome reſpects I am like you, Roman Catholics; I don't believe from my own underſtanding, but from what other people tell me."</p>
                     <p>"And let this be the criterion," replied Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, "that what we teach is truth; for you find you would be deceived did you not truſt to perſons who know better than yourſelf.—But, my dear Miſs Milner, we will talk upon ſome other topic, and

                     <p>Miſs Milner looked with ſupriſe that any thing ſo lightly ſaid, ſhould be ſo ſeriouſly received.—The kind Miſs Woodley ejaculated a ſhort prayer to herſelf, that heaven would forgive her young friend the involuntary ſin of ignorance—while Mrs. Horton, unperceived as ſhe imagined, made the ſign of the croſs upon her forehead to prevent the infectious taint of Heretical opinions. This pious ceremony Miſs Milner, by chance, obſerved, and now ſhowed ſuch an evident propenſity to burſt into a ſit of laughter, that the good lady of the houſe could no longer contain her reſentment, but exclaimed, "God forgive you." With a ſeverity ſo far different from the idea the words conveyed, that the object of her anger was, on this, obliged freely to indulge that riſibilty which ſhe had been ſtruggling to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and without longer ſuffering under the agony of reſtraint, ſhe gave way to her humour, and laughed with a liberty ſo uncontrouled, that in a ſhort time leſt her in the room with none but the tender-hearted Miſs Woodley a witneſs of her folly.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Miſs Woodley," (then cried Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, after recovering herſelf,) "I am afraid you will not forgive me."</p>
                     <p>"No, indeed I will not" returned Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</p>
                     <p>But how unimportant, how weak, how ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual are <hi>words</hi> in converſation—looks and manners alone expreſs—for Miſs Woodley, with her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable face and mild accents, ſaying ſhe would not forgive, implied only forgiveneſs—while Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,

with her enraged voice and aſpect, begging heaven to pardon the offender, palpably ſaid, ſhe thought her unworthy of all pardon.</p>

                     <p>SIX weeks have now elapſed ſince Miſs Milner has been in London, partaking with delight in all its pleaſures, whilſt Dorriforth has been ſighing with apprehenſions, attending with precaution, and praying with the moſt zealous fervour for her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—Her own and her guardian's acquaintance, and the new friendſhips (to ſpeak in the unmeaning language of the world) which ſhe was continually forming, crowded ſo perpetually to the houſe, that ſeldom had Dorriforth even a moment left from her viſits or viſitors, to warn her of her danger—yet when a moment offered, he ſnatched it eagerly—preſſed the neceſſity of "time not always paſſed in ſociety; of reflection; of reading: of thoughts for a future ſtate; and of virtues acquired to make old age ſupportable."—That forcible power of innate feeling, which directs the tongue to eloquence, had its effect while ſhe liſtened to him, and ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put on the looks and geſture of aſſent, and ſometimes even ſpoke the language of conviction; but this, the firſt call of diſſipation would change to ill-timed raillery, or peeviſh remonſtrance, at being limited in delights her birth and fortune en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled her to enjoy.</p>
                     <p>Among the many viſitors who attended at her levees, and followed wherever ſhe went, was one
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025650_0021_0FCEB10374676BA8"/>
that ſeemed, even when abſent, to ſhare her thoughts.—This was Lord Frederick Lawnly, the ſon of a duke, and the avowed favourite of all the moſt diſcerning women of taſte.</p>
                     <p>Lord Frederick was not more than twenty-three; ſprightly, elegant, extremely handſome, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of every accompliſhment to captivate a heart leſs ſuſceptible of love than Miſs Milner's was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be.—With theſe allurements, no wonder if ſhe took a pleaſure in his company—no wonder if ſhe took a pride to have it known he was among the number of her moſt devoted admirers.—Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth beheld the growing intimacy with alternate pain and pleaſure—he wiſhed to ſee Miſs Milner married, to ſee his charge in the protection of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rather than of himſelf: yet under the care of a young nobleman, immerſed in all the vices of the town, without one moral excellence, but ſuch as might reſult eventually from the influence of the moment—under ſuch care he trembled for her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—yet trembled more leſt her heart ſhould be purloined, without even the authority of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial views.</p>
                     <p>With theſe ſentiments Dorriforth could never diſguiſe his uneaſineſs at the ſight of Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, nor could his lordſhip but diſcern the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of the guardian, and conſequently each was embarraſſed in the preſence of the other.—Miſs Milner obſerved, but obſerved with indifference, the ſenſations of both—there was but one paſſion which at preſent held a place in her heart, and that was vanity; vanity defined into all the ſpecies of pride, vain-glory, ſelf-approbation—an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire of admiration, and on immoderate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the art of pleaſing, for her own indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual happineſs, and not for the happineſs of others—Still had ſhe a heart inclined, and oftentimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025650_0022_0FCEB108ABE27F40"/>
by tendencies leſs unworthy; but thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to what was eſtimable, were generally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in their firſt impulſe by ſome darling folly.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley (who could diſcover virtue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of the moſt diminu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>By this time all her acquaintance had given Lord Frederick to her as a lover, the ſervants whiſpered it, and ſome of the public prints had even fixed the day of marriage;—but as no explanation had taken place on the part of his lordſhip, Dorriforth's uneaſineſs was encreaſed, and he ſeriouſly told his Ward he thought it prudent to entreat Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich to deſiſt-viſiting her.—She ſmiled with ridicule at the caution, but finding it a ſecond time repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a manner that ſavoured of authority, ſhe promiſed to make, and to enforce, the requeſt.—The next time his lordſhip came ſhe did ſo, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him it was by her guardian's deſire; "who from motives of delicacy had permitted her rather to ſolicit as a favour, what he himſelf would make as a demand."—Lord Frederick reddened with anger—he loved Miſs Milner, but he doubted whether from the frequent proofs he had experienced of (his own inconſtancy) he ſhould continue to love—and this interference of her guardian threatened an explanation or a diſmiſſion, before he became thoroughly acquainted with his own heart.—Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, confounded, and provoked, he replied,</p>

"By heaven, I believe Mr. Dorriforth loves you himſelf, and it is jealouſy makes him treat me thus."</p>
                     <p>"For ſhame, my lord!" cried Miſs Woodley, who was preſent, and trembling with horror at the ſacrilegious idea.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ſhame for him if he be not in love,"—anſwered his lordſhip; "for what but a ſavage could behold beauty like her's, and not own its power?"</p>
                     <p>"Habit," replied Miſs Milner, "is every thing—and Mr. Dorriforth ſees and converſes with beauty, and from habit does not fall in love, as you, my lord, merely from habit do."</p>
                     <p>"Then you believe," cried he, "love is not in my nature?"</p>
                     <p>"No more of it, my lord, than habit could very ſoon extinguiſh."</p>
                     <p>"But I would not have it extinguiſhed—I would rather it ſhould mount to a flame, for I think it a crime to be inſenſible of the bleſſings love can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow."</p>
                     <p>"Then your lordſhip indulges the paſſion to avoid a ſin?—the very motive which deters Mr. Dorriforth."</p>
                     <p>"Which ought to deter him, madam, for the ſake of his oaths—but monaſtic vows, like thoſe of marriage, were made to be broken—and ſurely when your guardian looks on you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

a confuſion that trembled on her lips and ſhook through all her frame.</p>
                     <p>"What's the matter?" cried Dorriforth, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with concern on her diſcompoſure.</p>
                     <p>"A compliment paid by herſelf to you, Sir," replied his lordſhip, "has thus affected the lady."</p>
                     <p>"As if ſhe bluſhed at the untruth," ſaid Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, that is unkind," cried Miſs Woodley, "for if you had been here"—</p>
                     <p>"—I would not have ſaid what I did," replied Miſs Milner, "but leſt him to vindicate himſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible I can want vindication?" return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dorriforth, "Who would think it worth their while to ſlander ſo unimportant a perſon as I am?"</p>
                     <p>"The man who has the charge of Miſs Milner," replied Lord Frederick, "derives a conſequence from her."</p>
                     <p>"No ill conſequence, I hope, my lord?" replied Dorriforth with a firmneſs in his voice, and an eye fixed ſo ſtedfaſtly, that his lordſhip heſitated for a a moment in want of a reply—and Miſs Milner ſoftly whiſpering to him, as her guardian turned his head, to avoid an argument, he bowed acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence.—And then, as in compliment to her, he wiſhed to change the ſubject, with a ſmile of ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule he cried,</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh, Mr. Dorriforth, you would give me abſolution of all my ſins, for I confeſs they are many and manifold."</p>
                     <p>"Hold, my lord," exclaimed Dorriforth, "do not confeſs before the ladies, leſt in order to excite their compaſſion, you ſhould be tempted to accuſe yourſelf of ſins you have never yet committed."</p>
                     <p>At this Miſs Milner laughed, ſeemingly ſo well pleaſed, that Lord Frederick with a ſarcaſtic ſneer, repeated,

Whether from an inattention to the quotation, or from a conſciouſneſs it was wholly inapplicable, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth heard it without one emotion of ſhame or of anger—while Miſs Milner ſeemed ſhocked at the implication; her pleaſantry was immediately depreſſed, and ſhe threw open the ſaſh and held her head out at the window, to conceal the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment theſe lines had occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of Elmwood was at this juncture an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced—a Catholic nobleman, juſt come of age, and on the eve of marriage—his lordſhip's viſit was to his couſin, Mr. Dorriforth, but as all ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious viſits were alike received by Dorriforth, Miſs Milner, and Mrs. Horton's family in one common apartment, Lord Elmwood was uſhered into this, and for the preſent directed the converſation to a different ſubject.</p>

                     <p>IN anxious deſire that the affection, or acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, between Lord Frederick Lawnly and Miſs Milner might be finally broken, her guardian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the higheſt ſatisfaction, overtures from Sir Edward Aſhton, in behalf of his paſſion for that young lady.—Sir Edward was not young or handſome; old or ugly; but immenſely rich, and poſſeſſed of qualities that made him, in every ſenſe, worthy the happineſs to which he aſpired.—He was the man Dorriforth would have choſen before any other for the huſband of his Ward, and his wiſhes made him ſometimes hope, againſt his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025650_0026_0FCEB111087DC078"/>
ſon, that Sir Edward would not be rejected—and he reſolved to try the force of his own power in the ſtrongeſt recommendation of him.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding that diſſimilarity of opinion, which in almoſt every reſpect, ſubſiſted between Miſs Milner and her guardian, there was generally the moſt punctilious obſervance of good manners from each towards the other—on the part of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth more eſpecially; for his politeneſs would ſometimes appear even like the reſult of a ſyſtem he had marked out for himſelf, as the only means to keep his Ward reſtrained within the ſame limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.—Whenever he addreſſed her there was unuſual reſerve upon his countenance, and more than uſual gentleneſs in his tone of voice; which ſeemed the effect of ſentiments her birth and ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inſpired, joined to a ſtudied mode of reſpect beſt ſuited to enforce the ſame from her.—The wiſhed for conſequence was produced—for though there was an inſtinctive rectitude in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miſs Milner that would have taught her, without other inſtruction, what manners to obſerve towards her deputed father; yet from ſome volatile thought, or ſome quick ſenſe of feeling, ſhe had not been accuſtomed to ſubdue, ſhe was perpetually on the verge of treating him with levity; but he would immediately recall her recollection by a reſerve too awful, and a gentleneſs too ſacred for her to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. The diſtinction which both required, was thus, by his ſkilful management alone, preſerved.</p>
                     <p>One morning he took an opportunity, before her and Miſs Woodley, to introduce and preſs the ſubject of Sir Edward Aſhton's hopes. He firſt ſpoke warmly in his praiſe, then plainly told Miſs Milner he believed ſhe poſſeſſed the power to make ſo deſerving a man happy to the ſummit of his wiſhes. A laugh of ridicule was the only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,—but a ſudden and expreſſive frown from
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025650_0027_0FCEB11277A4DB98"/>
Dorriforth having quickly put an end to it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his wonted politeneſs, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh, Miſs Milner, you would ſhow more good taſte than thus pointedly to diſapprove of Sir Edward."</p>
                     <p>"How, Mr. Dorriforth," replied ſhe, "can you expect me to give proofs of a good taſte, when Sir Edward, whom you conſider with ſuch high eſteem, has given ſo bad an example of his, in approving of me?"</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth wiſhed not to flatter her frailty by a compliment ſhe ſeemed to have ſought for, and for a moment heſitated what to ſay.</p>
                     <p>"Anſwer, Sir, that queſtion," ſhe cried.</p>
                     <p>"Why then, madam," replied he, "it is my opinion, that ſuppoſing what your humility has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be juſt, yet Sir Edward will not ſuffer by the ſuggeſtion: for in caſes where the heart is ſo immediately concerned, as I believe Sir Edward's to be, good taſte, or rather reaſon, has not proper power to act."</p>
                     <p>"You are right, Mr. Dorriforth: this is a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough juſtification of Sir Edward—and when I fall in love, I muſt beg you will make the ſame excuſe for me."</p>
                     <p>"Then," returned he earneſtly, "before your heart is in that ſtate I have deſcribed, exert your reaſon."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall," anſwered ſhe, "and not conſent to marry a man whom I could never love."</p>
                     <p>"Unleſs your heart is already given away, Miſs Milner, what can make you ſpeak with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of certainty?"</p>

                        </gap>e ſaid this, and he fixed his eyes upon her as if he wiſhed to penetrate her ſentiments, and yet trembled for what he might find there;—ſhe bluſhed, and her

looks would have confirmed her guilty, had not a free and unembarraſſed tone of voice, more than her words, preſerved her from that ſentence.</p>
                     <p>"No," ſhe replied, "my heart is not given away, and yet I can venture to declare Sir Edward will never poſſeſs an atom of it."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry for both your ſakes, theſe are your ſentiments," he replied; "but as your heart is ſtill your own," (and he ſeemed rejoiced to find it was) "permit me to warn you how you part with a thing ſo precious—the dangers, the ſorrows you hazard in beſtowing it, are greater than you may be aware of. The heart once gone, our thoughts, our actions, are no more our own, than that is."—He ſeemed <hi>forcing</hi> himſelf to utter all this, and yet to break off as if he could have ſaid much more, had not the extreme delicacy of the ſubject prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
                     <p>When he left the room, and Miſs Milner heard the door ſhut after him, ſhe ſaid with a thoughtful and inquiſitive earneſtneſs, "What can make good people ſo ſkilled in all the weakneſſes of the bad? Mr. Dorriforth with all thoſe prudent admonitions, appears rather like a man who has paſſed his life in the gay world, experienced all its dangerous allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all its repentant ſorrows, than like one who had lived his whole time ſecluded in a monaſtery or his own ſtudy.—Then he ſpeaks with ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſibility on the ſubject of love, he commend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Miſs Woodley, who heard the concluſion of this

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025650_0030_0FCEB1199B68F7C0"/>
paſſion, (for he ſtill continued his viſits, tho' leſs frequently than before) pleaded his cauſe ſo ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Miſs Woodley, who was occaſionally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ever compaſſionate, could ſcarce reſiſt wiſhing him ſucceſs. He now unequivocally offered marriage, and entreated to be ſuffered to lay his propoſals before Mr. Dorriforth, but this Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner poſitively forbid.</p>
                     <p>Her reluctance he imputed, however, more to the known partiality of her guardian to the addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Sir Edward, than to any motive which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon herſelf; and to Mr. Dorriforth his lordſhip conceived a greater diſlike than ever; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that through his interpoſition, in ſpite of his ward's attachment, he might yet be deprived of her—but Miſs Milner declared both to him and to her friend, Love had, at preſent, gained no one influence over her mind—Yet did the watchful Miſs Woodley oftentimes hear a ſigh burſt forth, unknowing to herſelf, till ſhe was reminded of it, and then a ſudden bluſh of ſhame would inſtantly ſpread over her face.—This ſeeming ſtruggle with her paſſion, endeared her more than ever to Miſs Woodley, and ſhe would even riſk the diſpleaſure of Dorriforth by her ready compliance in every new purſuit that might amuſe the time, ſhe elſe ſaw paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her friend in heavineſs of heart.</p>
                     <p>Balls, plays, inceſſant company, at length rouſed her guardian from that mildneſs with which he had been accuſtomed to treat her—night after night his ſleep had been diſturbed by fears for her ſafety while abroad; morning after morning it had been broken by the clamour of her return.—He therefore ſaid to her one forenoon, as he met her accidentally upon the ſtair caſe,</p>
                     <p>"I hope, Miſs Milner, you paſs this evening at home?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:025650_0031_0FCEB11D08461A60"/>
Unprepared for the ſudden queſtion, ſhe bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and replied, "Yes;" while ſhe knew ſhe was engaged to a brilliant aſſembly, for which ſhe had been a whole week conſulting her milliner in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p>She, however, flattered herſelf what ſhe had ſaid to Mr. Dorriforth might be excuſed as a ſlight miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, the lapſe of memory, or ſome other trifling fault, when he ſhould know the truth—the truth was earlier divulged than ſhe expected—for juſt as dinner was removed, her footman delivered a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to her from her milliner concerning a new dreſs for the evening—the preſent evening particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly marked.—Dorriforth looked aſtoniſhed.</p>
                     <p>"I thought, Miſs Milner, you gave me your word you would paſs this evening at home?"</p>
                     <p>"I miſtook then—for I had before given my word I ſhould paſs it abroad."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed!" cried he.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, indeed," returned ſhe; "and I believe it is right I ſhould keep my firſt promiſe; is it not?"</p>
                     <p>"The promiſe you gave me then, you do not think of any conſequence."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, certainly; if you do."</p>
                     <p>"I do."</p>
                     <p>"And mean, perhaps, to make it of much more conſequence than it deſerves, by being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
                     <p>"Whether or not, I am offended—you ſhall find I am." And he looked ſo.</p>
                     <p>She caught his piercing, ſtedfaſt eye—her's were immediately caſt down; and ſhe trembled—either with ſhame or with reſentment.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton roſe from her ſeat—moved the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canters and the fruit round the table—ſtirred the fire—and came back to her ſeat again, before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word was uttered.—Nor had this good woman's
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025650_0032_0FCEB11EE1E0F940"/>
officious labours taken the leaſt from the awkward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſilence, which as ſoon as the buſtle ſhe had made was over, returned in its full force.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, Miſs Milner, riſing with alacrity, was preparing to go out of the room, when Dorriforth raiſed his voice, and in a tone of authority ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Milner, you ſhall not leave the houſe this evening."</p>
                     <p>"Sir?"—ſhe exclaimed with a kind of doubt of what ſhe had heard—a ſurpriſe, which fixed her hand on the door ſhe had half opened, but which now ſhe ſhowed herſelf irreſolute whether to open wide in defiance, or to ſhut ſubmiſſive.—Before ſhe could reſolve, Dorriforth aroſe from his ſeat, and ſaid with a degree of force and warmth ſhe had never heard him ſpeak with before,</p>
                     <p>"I command you to ſtay at home this evening."</p>
                     <p>And he walked immediately out of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the oppoſite door.—Her hand fell motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from that ſhe held—ſhe appeared motionleſs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ſome time;—till Mrs. Horton, "beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her not to be uneaſy at the treatment ſhe had received," cauſed a flood of tears to flow, and her boſom to heave as if her heart was breaking.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley would have ſaid ſomething to comfort her, but ſhe had caught the infection and could not utter a word—not from any real cauſe of grief did this lady weep; but there was a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic quality in tears, which always drew forth her's.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton ſecretly enjoyed this ſcene, although the real well meaning of her heart, and eaſe of her conſcience, did not tell her ſo—ſhe, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe had long prognoſticated it would come to this;" and ſhe "now only thanked heaven it was no worſe."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="unknown:025650_0033_0FCEB120007BDB08"/>
"What would you have worſe, madam?" cried Miſs Milner, "am not I diſappointed of the ball?"</p>
                     <p>"You don't mean to go then?" ſaid Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; "I commend your prudence; and I dare ſay it is more than your guardian gives you credit for."</p>
                     <p>"Do you think I would go," anſwered Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with an earneſtneſs that for a time ſuppreſſed her tears, "in contradiction to his will?"</p>
                     <p>"It is not the firſt time, I believe you have acted contrary to that, Miſs Milner," returned Mrs. Horton, and affected a tenderneſs of voice, to ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the harſhneſs of her words.</p>
                     <p>"If that is the caſe, madam," replied Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "I ſee nothing that ſhould prevent me now." And ſhe flung out of the room as if ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſobey him.—This alarmed poor Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Aunt," ſhe cried to Mrs. Horton, "fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and prevail upon Miſs Milner to give up her deſign; ſhe means to go to the ball in oppoſition to her guardian's will."</p>
                     <p>"Then," cried Mrs. Horton, "I'll not be an inſtrument in deterring her—if ſhe does, it may be for the beſt; it may give Mr. Dorriforth a clearer knowledge what means are proper to uſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her from evil."</p>
                     <p>"But, dear madam, ſhe muſt be prevented the evil of diſobedience; and as you tempted, you will be the moſt likely to diſſuade her—but if you will not, I muſt endeavour."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was leaving the room to perform this good deſign, when Mrs. Horton, in humble imitation of the example given by Dorriforth, cried,</p>
                     <p>"Niece, I command you not to ſtir out of this room this evening."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley obediently ſat down—and though her thoughts and heart were in the chamber with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025650_0034_0FCEB122E2F67850"/>
her friend, ſhe never ſhowed by one impertinent word, or by one line of her face, the reſtraint ſhe ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>At the uſual hour, Mr. Dorriforth and his ward were ſummoned to tea:—Dorriforth entered with a countenance which evinced the remains of anger; his eye gave teſtimony of his abſent thoughts; and although he took up a pamphlet and affected to read, it was plain to diſcern he ſcarcely knew he held it in his hand.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton began to make tea with a mind as wholly intent upon ſomething elſe, as Dorriforth's—ſhe was longing for the event of this miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (for to age trivial matters are important,) and though ſhe wiſhed no ill to Miſs Milner, yet with an inclination bent upon ſeeing ſomething new—without the fatigue of going out of her own houſe—ſhe was not over ſcrupulous what that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty might be.—But for fear ſhe ſhould have the imprudence to ſpeak a word upon the ſubject which employed her thoughts, or even look as if ſhe thought of it at all; ſhe pinched her lips cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and caſt her eyes on vacancy, leſt their ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant regards might detect her.—And for fear any noiſe ſhould intercept even the ſound of what might happen, ſhe walked acroſs the room more ſoftly than uſual, and more ſoftly touched every thing ſhe was obliged to lay her hand on.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley thought it her duty to be mute, and now the gingle of a tea-ſpoon, was like a deep-toned bell, all was ſo quiet.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton too, in the ſelf-approving reflection that ſhe herſelf was not in any quarrel, or alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any kind, felt at this moment remarkably peaceful, and charitable.—Miſs Woodley did not recollect <hi>herſelf</hi> ſo, but was ſo in reality—in her
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025650_0035_0FCEB1248F0BAF40"/>
peace and charity were inſtinctive virtues, accident could not increaſe them.</p>
                     <p>The firſt cups of tea were ſcarcely poured out, when a ſervant came with Miſs Milner's compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſhe ſhould drink none.—The book ſhook in Dorriforth's hand while this meſſage was delivered—he believed her to be dreſſing for her evening's entertainment, and now ſtudied in what manner to prevent, or to reſent it.—He coughed—drank his tea—endeavoured to talk, but found it difficult—ſometimes read—and in this manner near two hours were paſſed away, when Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner came into the room.—Not dreſt for the ball, but as ſhe roſe from dinner.—Dorriforth read on, and ſeemed afraid to look up, leſt he ſhould behold what he could not have pardoned.—She drew a chair and ſat down at the table by the ſide of Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>After a few minutes pauſe, and ſome ſmall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment on the part of Mrs. Horton, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment ſhe had to contend with from Miſs Milner's unexpected obedience, ſhe aſked that young lady "if ſhe would now take tea?"—to which Miſs Milner replied, "No, I thank you, ma'am," in a voice ſo languid, compared to her uſual one, that Dorriforth lifted his eyes from the book; and ſeeing her in the ſame negligent dreſs ſhe had worn all the day, caſt them away again—not with a look of triumph, but of confuſion.</p>
                     <p>And whatever he might have ſuffered had he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her decorated, and on the point of bidding defiance to his commands, yet even upon that trial, he had not endured half the painful ſenſations he now for a moment felt—he felt himſelf to blame.</p>
                     <p>He feared he had treated her with too much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity—he admired her condeſcenſion, accuſed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025650_0036_0FCE9EFC1D9D67D8"/>
himſelf for exacting it—he longed to aſk her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he did not know how.</p>
                     <p>A cheerful reply from her, to a queſtion of Miſs Woodley's, embarraſſed him ſtill more—he wiſhed ſhe had been ſullen, he then would have had a temptation, or a pretence, to have been ſo too.</p>
                     <p>With all theſe thoughts crowding faſt on his mind he ſtill read, or ſeemed to read, and to take no notice of what was paſſing; till a ſervant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and aſked Miſs Milner what time ſhe would want the chariot? to which ſhe replied, "I don't go out to night."—He then laid the book out of his hand, and by the time the ſervant had left the room, thus began:—</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Milner, I give you, I fear, ſome unkind proofs of my regard—it is often the ungrateful taſk of a friend to be troubleſome—ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly.—Forgive the duty of my office, and believe no one is half ſo much concerned if it robs you of any amuſements, as I myſelf am."</p>
                     <p>What he ſaid, he looked with ſo much ſincerity, that had ſhe been burning with rage at his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſhe muſt have forgiven him, for the regret he ſo forcibly expreſt.—She was going to reply, but found ſhe could not without accompanying her words with tears, therefore as ſoon as ſhe attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe deſiſted.</p>
                     <p>On this he roſe from his ſeat, and going to her, ſaid, "Once more ſhow your ſubmiſſion by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me a ſecond time to-day. Keep your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be aſſured I ſhall iſſue my commands with greater circumſpection for the future, as I find how ſtrictly they are complied with."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, the gay, the proud, the haughty Miſs Milner, ſunk underneath this kindneſs, and wept with a gentleneſs and patience, which did not give more ſurpriſe than it gave ſatisfaction to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025650_0037_0FCEB12992DD5498"/>
Dorriforth.—He was charmed to find her diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo little untractable—foreboded the future proſperity of his guardianſhip, and her eternal as well as temporal happineſs from this ſpecimen.</p>

                     <p>ALTHOUGH Dorriforth was that good man that has been deſcribed, there were in his nature ſhades of evil—there was an obſtinacy; ſuch as he himſelf, and his friends termed firmneſs of mind; but had not religion and ſome oppoſite virtues weighed heavy in the balance, it would frequently have degenerated into implacable ſtubbornneſs.</p>
                     <p>The child of a once beloved ſiſter, who married a young officer againſt her brother's conſent, was at the age of three years left an orphan, deſtitute of every ſupport but from his uncle's generoſity: but though Dorriforth mentioned, he would never ſee him, Miſs Milner whoſe heart was a receptacle for the unfortunate, no ſooner was told the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hiſtory of Mr. and Mrs. Ruſbrook, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the child, than ſhe longed to behold the innocent inheritor of her guardian's reſentment, and took Miſs Woodley with her to ſee the boy—he was at a farm houſe a few miles from town; and his extreme beauty and engaging manners, needed not the ſorrows to which he had been born, to give him farther recommendation to the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her, who had come to viſit him. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him with admiration and pity, and having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared herſelf to him by the moſt affectionate words and careſſes, on her bidding him farewell, he cried moſt ſorrowfully to go along with her. Unuſed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025650_0038_0FCEB12A974BC690"/>
to reſiſt temptations, whether to reprehenſible, or to laudable actions, ſhe yielded to his ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and having overcome a few ſcruples of Miſs Woodley's, determined to take young Ruſbrook to town, and preſent him to his uncle. This idea was no ſooner formed than executed.—By making a preſent to the nurſe, ſhe readily gained her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to part with him for a day or two, and the ſigns of joy the child denoted on being put into the carriage, ſeemed to repay her before-hand, for every reproof ſhe might receive from her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, for the liberty ſhe had taken.</p>
                     <p>"Beſides," ſaid ſhe to Miſs Woodley, who had ſtill her apprehenſions, "do you not with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhould have ſome warmer intereſt in his care than duty?—it is that alone, which induces Mr. Dorriforth to provide for him, but it is proper, affection ſhould have ſome ſhare in his benevolence—and how, hereafter, will he be ſo fit an object for that love, which compaſſion muſt excite, as he is at preſent?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley acquieſced.—But before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at their own door, it came into Miſs Milner's remembrance, there was a grave ſternneſs in the manners of her guardian when provoked: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of which made her ſomething apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive for what ſhe had done—Miſs Woodley was more ſo.—They both became ſilent as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the ſtreet where they lived—for Miſs Woodley having once repreſented her fears, and having ſuppreſſed them in reſignation to Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's better judgment, would not repeat them—and Miſs Milner would not confeſs they were now troubling her.</p>
                     <p>Juſt, however, as the coach ſtopt, ſhe had the forecaſt and the humility to ſay, "we will not tell Mr. Dorriforth the child is his nephew, Miſs
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025650_0039_0FCEB12C0B7EDF00"/>
Woodley, unleſs he ſhould appear fond, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, and then we may venture without any danger."</p>
                     <p>This was agreed, and when Dorriforth entered the room juſt before dinner, poor Harry Ruſbrook was introduced to him as the ſon of a lady who frequently viſited there. The deception paſſed—Dorriforth ſhook hands with him, and at length highly pleaſed with his engaging wiles, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble replies, took him on his knee, and kiſſed him with affection. Miſs Milner could ſcarcely reſtrain the joy this gave her; but, unluckily, Dorriforth ſaid ſoon after to the child, "and now tell me your name."</p>
                     <p>"Harry Ruſbrook," replied he with great force and clearneſs in his voice.</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth was holding him fondly round the waiſt as he ſtood with his feet upon his knees; and at this reply he did not throw him from him—but he removed his hands, which ſupported him, ſo ſuddenly, that the child to prevent falling on the floor, threw himſelf about his uncle's neck.—Miſs Milner and Miſs Woodley turned aſide to conceal their tears. "I had liked to have been down," cried Harry, fearing no other danger.—But his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle took hold of each hand that had twined around him, and placed him immediately on the ground; and dinner being that inſtant ſerved, he gave no greater marks of his reſentment than calling for his hat, and walking inſtantly out of the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner cried for anger; yet ſhe did not treat with leſs kindneſs the object of this vexatious circumſtance: ſhe held him in her arms all the while ſhe ſat at table, and repeatedly ſaid to him, (though he had not the ſenſe to thank her) "ſhe would always be his friend."</p>
                     <p>The firſt emotions of reſentment againſt Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025650_0040_0FCEB12DABDD6E60"/>
being over, ſhe was eaſily prevailed upon to return with poor Ruſbrook to the farm-houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was likely his uncle ſhould come back; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of obedience which Miſs Woodley was impatient her guardian ſhould know; ſhe therefore inquired where he was, and ſent him a note to acquaint him with it, offering at the ſame time an apology for what had happened. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the evening ſeemingly reconciled, nor was a word mentioned of the incident which had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red during the day; yet there remained in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere looks of Dorriforth a perfect remembrance of it, and not one trait of compaſſion for his hapleſs nephew.</p>

                     <p>THERE are few things ſo mortifying to a proud ſpirit as to ſuffer by immediate compariſon—men, can ſcarcely bear this humiliation, but to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the puniſhment is intolerable; and Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now laboured under the diſadvantage to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which gave her no ſmall inquietude.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Fenton, a young lady of the moſt delicate beauty, elegant manners, gentle diſpoſition, and diſcreet conduct, was introduced to Miſs Milner's acquaintance by her guardian; and frequently, ſometimes inadvertently, held up by him as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for her to follow—for when he did not ſay this in direct terms, it was inſinuated by the warmth of his panegyrics on thoſe virtues in which Miſs Fenton excelled, and his ward was obviouſly deficient. Conſcious of her inferiority in theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025650_0041_0FCEB13141AA3178"/>
of her guardian's praiſe, Miſs Milner, inſtead of being inſpired to emulation, was provoked to envy.</p>
                     <p>Not to admire Miſs Fenton was impoſſible—to find a fault in her perſon or ſentiments was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible—and yet to love her, was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
                     <p>That ſerenity of mind which kept her features in a continual placid form, though enchanting at the firſt glance, upon a ſecond, or third, fatigued the ſight for a want of variety; and to have ſeen her diſtorted with rage, convulſed with mirth, or in deep dejection, had been to her advantage. But her ſuperior ſoul appeared above thoſe natural commotions of the mind, and there was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to worſhip her as a ſaint, than to love her as a woman.—Yet Dorriforth, whoſe heart was not formed, (at leaſt not educated) for love; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding her in the light of friendſhip, beheld her as the moſt perfect model of her ſex. Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, on firſt ſeeing her, was ſtruck with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Miſs Milner apprehended ſhe had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a rival; but he had not ſeen her three times, before he called her the moſt "inſufferable of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's creatures," and vowed there was more charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variation in the features of Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner had a heart affectionate to her ſex, even where ſhe ſaw them in the poſſeſſion of charms ſuperior to her own; but whether from the ſpirit of contradiction, whether from feeling herſelf more than ordinarily offended by her guardian's praiſe of this lady, or whether there was ſomething in the reſerve of Miſs Fenton that did not accord with her own frank and ingenuous diſpoſition ſo as to engage her eſteem, it is certain ſhe took infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in hearing her beauty and her virtues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated, or turned to ridicule, particularly if Mr.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025650_0042_0FCEB132B5875A98"/>
Dorriforth was preſent. This was very painful to him upon many accounts; perhaps regard to Miſs Milner's conduct was not among the leaſt; and whenever the circumſtance occurred, he could with difficulty reſtrain his anger. Miſs Fenton was not only a young lady whoſe amiable qualities Dorriforth admired, but ſhe was ſoon to be allied to him by her marriage with his neareſt relation, Lord Elmwood, a young nobleman whom he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loved.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood had diſcovered all that beauty in Miſs Fenton, which every common obſerver could not but ſee—the charms of her mind and her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had been pointed out to him by his tutor; and the utility of their marriage in perfect ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This preceptor held with a magiſterial power the government of his pupil's paſſions; nay, governed them ſo entirely, no one could perceive (nor did the young lord himſelf know) that he had any.</p>
                     <p>This rigid monitor and friend was a Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, bred a jeſuit in the ſame college where Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth was educated, but before his time the order was compelled to take another name.—Sandford had been the tutor of Dorriforth, as well as of his couſin Lord Elmwood, and by this double <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The young earl, accuſtomed in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to fear him as his maſter, in his youth and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood received every new indulgence with which his preceptor favoured him with gratitude, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025650_0043_0FCEB136B478B570"/>
came at length to love him as his father—nor had Dorriforth as yet ſhook off ſimilar ſenſations.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sandford perfectly knew how to work upon the paſſions of all human nature, but yet had the conſcience not to "draw all hearts towards him." There were of mankind, thoſe, whoſe hate he thought not unworthy his holy labour; and in that he was more rapid in his ſucceſs than even in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing eſteem. In this enterprize he ſucceeded with Miſs Milner, even beyond his moſt ſanguine with.</p>
                     <p>She had been educated at an Engliſh boarding-ſchool, and had no idea of the ſuperior and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ſtate of a foreign ſeminary—beſides, as a woman, ſhe was privileged to ſay any thing ſhe pleaſed; and as a beautiful woman, ſhe had a right to expect whatever ſhe pleaſed to ſay, ſhould be admired.</p>
                     <p>Sandford knew the hearts of women, as well as thoſe of men, notwithſtanding he had paſſed but little of his time in their ſociety—he ſaw Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's heart at the firſt view of her perſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding in that little circumference a weight of folly he wiſhed to ſee eradicated, he began to toil in the vineyard, eager to draw upon him her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, in the hope he could alſo make her abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate herſelf. The mortifications of ſlight he was expert in, and being a man of talents, ſuch as all companies, eſpecially thoſe Miſs Milner often frequented, looked on with reſpect, he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by waſting that reverence ſo highly valued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ineffectual remonſtrances, of which he could foreſee the reception, but awakened the attention of the lady ſolely by his neglect of her. He ſpoke of her in her preſence as of an indifferent perſon, ſometimes forgot to name her when the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it; and then would aſk her pardon and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025650_0044_0FCEB137F5BC7070"/>
ſay, "he did not recollect her," with ſuch ſeeming ſorrow for his fault, ſhe could not think the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence intended, and of courſe felt the affront much more ſeverely.</p>
                     <p>While, with every other perſon, ſhe was the principal, the firſt cauſe upon which a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany depended for converſation, muſic, cards, or dancing, with Mr. Sandford ſhe found ſhe was of no importance.—Sometimes ſhe tried to conſider this diſregard of her as merely the effect of ill-breeding, but he was not an ill-bred man; he was a gentleman by birth, and one who had kept the beſt company; a man of ſenſe and learning.—'And does ſuch a man ſlight me without knowing it?' ſhe cried—for ſhe had not dived ſo deep into the powers of ſimulation, as to ſuſpect ſuch careleſs manners were the reſult of art.</p>
                     <p>This behaviour of Mr. Sandford's had its deſired effect; it humbled Miſs Milner in her own opinion more than a thouſand ſermons would have done preached on the vanity of youth and beauty. She felt an inward nothingneſs ſhe never knew before, and had been cured of all her pride, had ſhe not poſſeſſed a degree of ſpirit beyond the generality of her ſex, and ſuch as even Mr. Sandford with all his penetration did not expect.—She determined to reſent his treatment, and entering the liſt as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemy, give reaſons to the beholders why he did not, with them, acknowledge her ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</p>
                     <p>She now commenced hoſtilities on all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his learning, and his favourite axioms; and by a happy turn for ridicule, in want of other weapons, threw in the way of the holy father as great trials for his patience, as any his order could have ſubſtituted in penance. Some things he bore like a martyr—at others, his fortitude would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025650_0045_0FCEB139D8B79B30"/>
him, and he would call on her guardian, his late pupil, to interpoſe with his authority; on which ſhe would declare ſhe only acted "to try the good man's temper," and had he combated with his fretfulneſs but a few minutes longer, ſhe would have acknowledged his right to canonization; but having yielded to the ſallies of his anger, he muſt now go through numerous other probations."</p>
                     <p>If Miſs Fenton was admired by Dorriforth, by Sandford ſhe was adored—and inſtead of giving her as an example to Miſs Milner, he ſpoke of her as of one, endowed beyond Miſs Milner's power of imitation.—Often with a ſhake of his head and a ſigh would he ſay,</p>
                     <p>"No, I am not ſo hard upon you as your guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, I only deſire you to love Miſs Fenton; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her, I believe, is above your ability."</p>
                     <p>This was ſomething too much—and poor Miſs Woodley, who was generally a witneſs of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, ſuffered a degree of ſorrow at every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that diſtreſt Miſs Milner.—Yet as ſhe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Mr. Sandford too, the joy of her friend's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was abated by the uneaſineſs it gave to him. But Mrs. Horton felt for none but the right reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend prieſt; and often did ſhe feel ſo violently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in his cauſe, ſhe could not refrain giving an anſwer herſelf in his behalf—thus, doing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MR. Sandford finding his friend Dorriforth frequently perplexed in the management of his
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025650_0046_0FCEB13D188F8190"/>
ward, and he himſelf thinking her incorrigible, gave his advice, that a proper match ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſought out for her, and the care of ſo dangerous a perſon given into other hands. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth acknowledged the propriety of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but lamented the difficulty there was in pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ward as to the quality of her lover, for ſhe had refuſed, beſides Sir Edward Aſhton, many others of equal pretenſions. "Depend upon it then," cried Mr. Sandford, "her affections are already engaged, and it is proper you ſhould know to whom." Dorriforth thought he did know, and mentioned Lord Frederick Lawnly; but ſaid he had no further authority for the ſuppoſition, than what his obſervation had given him, for that every explanation both on his lordſhip's ſide, and on that of the lady's, were evaded.—"Take her then," cried Sandford, "into the country, and if his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip does not follow, there is an end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> your ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions."—"I ſhall not eaſily prevail upon Miſs Milner to leave the town," replied Dorriforth, "while it is in its higheſt faſhion; while all the gay world are reſorted hither."—"You can but try," returned Sandford, "and if you ſhould not ſucceed now; at leaſt fix the time you mean to go dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Autumn, and keep to your determination." "But in the Autumn," replied Dorriforth, "Lord Frederick will of courſe be in the country, and as his uncle's eſtate is near to our reſidence, he will not then ſo evidently follow Miſs Milner, as he would, could I induce her to go now."</p>
                     <p>It was agreed the attempt ſhould be made—and inſtead of receiving the propoſal with uneaſineſs, Miſs Milner, to the ſurpriſe of every one preſent, immediately conſented; and gave her guardian an opportunity of ſaying ſeveral of the kindeſt and politeſt things upon her ready compliance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:025650_0047_0FCEB13E045FB870"/>
"A token of approbation from you, Mr. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth," returned ſhe, "I always conſidered with the higheſt eſtimation—but your commendations are now become infinitely ſuperior in value, by their ſcarcity; for I do not believe that ſince Miſs Fenton and Mr. Sandford came to town, I have received one teſtimony of your friendſhip."</p>
                     <p>Had theſe words been uttered with pleaſantry, they might have paſſed without obſervation; but at the concluſion of the period, reſentment flew to Miſs Milner's face, and ſhe darted a piercing look at Mr. Sandford, which more pointedly expreſſed ſhe was angry with him, than had ſhe ſpoken vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in her uſual ſtrain of raillery.—Dorriforth looked confuſed.—But the concern which ſhe had ſo plainly evinced for his good opinion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out what ſhe had ſaid, ſilenced any rebuke he might elſe have been tempted to give her, for this unwarrantable charge againſt his friend. Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was ſhocked at the irregular manner in which Mr. Sandford was treated—while Miſs Woodley turned to him with a ſmile upon her face, hoping to ſet him an example of the manner in which he ſhould receive this reproach.—Her good wiſhes did not ſucceed—yet he was perfectly unruffled, and replied with coolneſs.</p>
                     <p>"The air of the country has affected the young lady already—but it is a comfortable thing," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "that in the variety of humours ſome women are expoſed to, they cannot be ſteadfaſt even in deceit."</p>
                     <p>"Deceit," cried Miſs Milner, "In what am I deceitful? did I ever pretend, Sir, I had an eſteem for you."</p>
                     <p>"That had not been deceit, madam, but merely good manners."</p>

"I never, Mr. Sandford, ſacrificed truth to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs."</p>
                     <p>"Except when the country has been propoſed, and you thought it politeneſs to appear ſatisfied."</p>
                     <p>"And I was ſatisfied, till I recollected you might probably be of the party—then every grove was changed to a wilderneſs, every rivulet into a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated pool, and every ſinging bird into a croaking raven."</p>
                     <p>"A very poetical deſcription," returned he calmly.—"But, Miſs Milner, you need not have had any apprehenſions of my company in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for I underſtand the ſeat to which your guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian means to go, belongs to you; and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, madam, I ſhall never enter a houſe where you are the miſtreſs."</p>
                     <p>"Nor any houſe, I am certain, Mr. Sandford, but where you yourſelf are the maſter."</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean, madam? (and for the firſt time he elevated his voice) am I the maſter here?"</p>
                     <p>"Your ſervants," replied ſhe, looking at the company, "will not tell you ſo, but I do."</p>
                     <p>"You condeſcend, Mr. Sandford," cried Mrs. Horton, "in talking ſo much to a young woman, but I know you do it for her good."</p>
                     <p>"Well, Miſs Milner," cried Dorriforth, (and the moſt cutting thing he could ſay) ſince I find my propoſal of the country has put you out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I ſhall mention it no more."</p>
                     <p>With all that vaſt quantity of reſentment, anger, or rage which ſometimes boiled in the veins of Miſs Milner, ſhe was yet never wanting in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"To prove mine was ſuch, madam," replied Dorriforth, "be prepared to quit London, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any marks of regret, within a few days."</p>
                     <p>She bowed aſſent; the neceſſary preparations were agreed upon; and while Miſs Milner with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſatisfaction adjuſted the plan of her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, (like thoſe perſons who behave well, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The news of this intended journey was ſoon made public. There is a ſecret charm in being pitied, when the misfortune is but ideal, and Miſs Milner found immenſe gratification in being told, "her's was a cruel caſe," and that it was "unjuſt and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous to force ſo much beauty to be concealed in the country, while London was filled with admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who, like her, would languiſh in conſequence of the ſeparation."

                     <p>Thoſe ſighs, which Miſs Woodley had long ago obſerved, became, however, more frequent ſtill; and a tear half ſtarting to her eye, was an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional matter of her friend's obſervation. Yet though Miſs Milner at thoſe times was ſoftened to melancholy, ſhe by no means appeared unhappy. Miſs Woodley was acquainted with the name of love only, yet ſhe concluded from theſe increaſed ſymptoms, what ſhe before only ſuſpected, that love muſt be their baſis. "Her ſenſes have been captivated by the perſon and accompliſhments of Lord Frederick," ſaid Miſs Woodley to herſelf, "while her underſtanding beholds his faults, and reproaches her paſſion—and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>n to believe, a contention of this nature was the preſent ſtate of Miſs Milner's mind.—Dorriforth was affected at the deſcription, and Sandford urged more than ever the neceſſity of the country expedition.—In a few days time they undertook it; Mrs. Horton, Miſs Woodley, Miſs Milner, and Mr. Dorriforth, accompanied by Miſs Fenton, whom Miſs Milner, as ſhe knew it to be the wiſh of her guardian, invited to paſs the three months previous to her marriage, at her country ſeat. Elmwood Houſe, or rather caſtle, the ſeat of Lord Elmwood, was only a few miles from this reſidence, and his lordſhip was expected to paſs great part of the ſummer there, with his tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Mr. Sandford.</p>

In the neighbourhood was alſo an eſtate belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an uncle of lord Frederick's, and many of the company ſuſpected they ſhould ſoon ſee his lordſhip on a viſit there, and to that expectation did they in great meaſure attribute Miſs Milner's viſible content.</p>

                     <p>WITH this party Miſs Milner arrived at her country houſe, and for near ſix weeks all around was the perfect picture of tranquillity;—her ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was as evident as every other perſon's; and every ſevere reflection being at this time unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, either to teize her to her duty, or to warn her againſt follies, ſhe was even in perfect good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with Miſs Fenton, and added to the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of a hoſt, the kindneſs of a friend.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sandford, who came with Lord Elmwood to the neighbouring ſeat, about a week after the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Miſs Milner at her's, was ſo ſcrupulouſly exact in the obſervance of his word, "never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a houſe of Miſs Milner's," that he would not even call upon his friend Dorriforth there—but in their walks, and at Lord Elmwood's, the two parties would occaſionally join, and of courſe Sandford and ſhe at thoſe times met—yet ſo diſtant was the reſerve on either ſide, that not a ſingle word was, upon any occaſion, ever exchanged between them.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner did not like Mr. Sandford; yet, as there was no real cauſe for inveterate rancour, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring him too as a man who meant well, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides of a moſt forgiving temper, ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

felt concerned that he did not ſpeak to her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it had been to find fault as uſual—and one morning as they were all, after a long ramble, drawing towards her houſe, where Lord Elmwood was invited to dine, ſhe even burſt into tears at ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sandford turn back and wiſh them a "good day."</p>
                     <p>But though ſhe had generoſity to forgive an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, ſhe had not the humility to make a conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſhe foreſaw that nothing leſs than ſome very humble atonement on her part, would prevail upon the haughty prieſt to be reconciled. Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſaw her concern upon this trifling occaſion with a ſecret pleaſure, and an admiration ſhe had never before excited. She inſinuated to him to be a mediator between them; but before any accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation could take place, the peace and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their abode was diſturbed by the arrival of Sir Edward Aſhton at Lord Elmwood's, where it appeared as if he had been invited in order to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his matrimonial plan.</p>
                     <p>At a dinner at Lord Elmwood's Sir Edward was announced as an unexpected viſitor; Miſs Milner did not ſuppoſe him ſuch, and turned pale when his name was uttered—Dorriforth fixed his eyes upon her with ſome tokens of compaſſion, while Sandford ſeemed to exult, and by his repeated "Welcome," to the baronet, gave evident proofs how much he was rejoiced to ſee him. All the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining enmity of Miſs Milner, was renewed at this behaviour, and ſuſpecting Sandford to be the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of his viſit, ſhe could not overcome her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, but gave way to it in a manner ſhe thought the moſt mortifying.—Sir Edward, in the courſe of converſation, inquired "what neighbours were in the country;" and ſhe, with the higheſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025650_0053_0FCEB17001D51DC0"/>
of ſatisfaction, named Lord Frederick Lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; as one who was hourly expected at his uncle's. The colour ſpread over Sir Edward's face.—Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth looked confounded—and Mr. Sandford as if he could have ſtruck her.</p>
                     <p>"Did Lord Frederick tell <hi>you</hi> he ſhould be down?" Sandford aſked Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>To which he replied, "No."</p>
                     <p>"But I hope, Mr. Sandford, you will permit me to know," cried Miſs Milner.—For as ſhe now meant to torture him by what ſhe ſaid, ſhe no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſtrained herſelf to ſilence—and as he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the ſame kind intent towards her, he had no longer any objection to make a reply, and therefore anſwered,</p>
                     <p>"No, madam, if it depended upon my permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, you ſhould not know."</p>
                     <p>"Not any thing, Sir, I dare ſay;—you would keep me in utter ignorance."</p>
                     <p>"I would."</p>
                     <p>"From a ſelf-intereſted motive, Mr. Sandford—that I might have a greater reſpect for you."</p>
                     <p>Some of the perſons preſent laughed—Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton coughed—Miſs Woodley bluſhed—Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood ſneered—Dorriforth frowned—and Miſs Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton looked juſt as ſhe did before.</p>
                     <p>The converſation was changed as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and early in the evening the company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner had ſcarce left her dreſſing room, where ſhe had been taking off part of her dreſs, when Dorriforth's ſervant came to acquaint her his maſter was alone in his ſtudy, and begged to ſpeak with her.—She felt herſelf tremble—ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately experienced a conſciouſneſs ſhe had not acted properly at Lord Elmwood's; for ſhe had a
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025650_0054_0FCE9F05ED6E7670"/>
a preſcience her guardian was going to upbraid her, and her heart told her, he had never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached her without a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley juſt then entered the apartment, and ſhe even found herſelf ſo much a coward, as to propoſe her going to Dorriforth along with her, and aiding her with a word or two occaſionally in her excuſe.</p>
                     <p>"What you, my dear," returned Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, "who not two hours ago, had the courage to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"It is that tenderneſs which frightens me, Miſs Woodley; that intimidates, and ſtrikes me dumb—is it poſſible I can return impertinence to the language and manners Mr. Dorriforth uſes? and as I am debarred from that, what can I do but ſtand before him like a guilty creature, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my faults."</p>
                     <p>She again entreated Miſs Woodley to go with her, but on a poſitive refuſal, from the impropriety of ſuch an intruſion, ſhe was at length obliged to go by herſelf.</p>
                     <p>How much do different circumſtances influence not only the manners, but even the perſons of ſome people!—Miſs Milner in the drawing room at Lord Elmwood's ſurrounded by liſteners, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers, (for even her enemies beheld her with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,) and warm with their approbation and applauſe—and Miſs Milner, with no giddy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver to give a falſe eclat ſo her actions, left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all but her own underſtanding, (which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly condemns her,) and upon the point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the cenſure of her guardian and friend, are two different beings.—Though ſtill beautiful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025650_0055_0FCEB1710090A358"/>
deſcription, ſhe does not look even in perſon the ſame.—In the laſt mentioned ſituation, ſhe was ſhorter in ſtature than in the former—ſhe was paler—ſhe was thinner—and a very different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour preſided over her whole air, and all her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe arrived at the ſtudy door, ſhe opened it with a trepidation ſhe could hardly account for, and entered to Dorriforth the altered woman ſhe has been repreſented. His heart had taken the moſt decided part againſt her, and his face aſſumed the moſt ſevere aſpect of reproach; when her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance gave an inſtantaneous change to <hi>his</hi> whole mind, and countenance.</p>
                     <p>She halted, as if ſhe feared to approach—he he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated, as if he knew not how to ſpeak—Inſtead of the warmth with which he was prepared to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, his voice involuntarily ſoftened, and without knowing what he ſaid, he began,</p>
                     <p>"My dear Miſs Milner"—</p>
                     <p>She expected he was angry, and in her confuſion his gentleneſs was loſt upon her—ſhe imagined what he ſaid might be ſevere, and ſhe continued to tremble, although he repeatedly aſſured her, he meant only to adviſe, not to upbraid her.</p>
                     <p>"For in reſpect to all thoſe little diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Sandford and you," ſaid he, "I ſhould be partial if I blamed you more than him—indeed, when you take the liberty to cenſure him, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter makes the freedom appear in a more ſerious light than when he complains of you—yet, if he provokes your retorts, he alone muſt anſwer for them; nor will I undertake to decide betwixt you.—But I have a queſtion to aſk you, and to which I require a ſerious and unequivocal anſwer.—Do you expect Lord Frederick in the country?"</p>
                     <p>Without heſitation ſhe replied, "ſhe did."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="unknown:025650_0056_0FCE9F0962EBD5A8"/>
"I have one more queſtion to aſk, madam, and and to which I expect a reply equally unreſerved—Is Lord Frederick the man you approve for a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?"</p>
                     <p>Upon this cloſe interrogation ſhe diſcovered an embarraſſment, and a confuſion beyond any ſhe had ever before given proofs of; and in this ſituation ſhe faintly replied,</p>
                     <p>"No, he is not."</p>
                     <p>"Your words tell me one thing," anſwered Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth, "while your looks declare another—which am I to truſt?"</p>
                     <p>"Which you pleaſe," ſhe returned with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted dignity, that aſtoniſhed, awed, yet did not convince him.</p>
                     <p>"But then, why encourage him to follow you thither, Miſs Milner?"</p>
                     <p>"Why commit a thouſand follies (ſhe replied in tears) every hour of my life?"</p>
                     <p>"You then promote the hopes of Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick without one ſerious intention of compleating them? This is a conduct which it is my duty to guard you againſt, and you ſhall no longer deceive either him or yourſelf. The moment he arrives it is my fixed reſolution you refuſe to ſee him, or agree to become his wife."</p>
                     <p>In anſwer to this, ſhe appeared averſe both to the one propoſition and the other, yet came to no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation why; but left her guardian at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the converſation as much at a loſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide upon her real ſentiments, as he was before he had thus ſeriouſly requeſted to be informed of ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                     <p>SIR EDWARD ASHTON, though not invited by Miſs Milner, yet frequently did himſelf the favour to come to her houſe; ſometimes he accompanied Lord Elmwood on a viſit to her, at other times he came to ſee Dorriforth only, who generally intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to the ladies. But Sir Edward was either ſo unwilling to give pain to the object of his love, or ſo much intimidated by her frowns, that he ſeldom addreſſed a ſingle word to her, except the common compliments of entering and retiring.—This apprehenſion of offending, without one hope of pleaſing, had the moſt awkward effect upon the manners of the worthy baronet, and his endeavours to inſinuate himſelf into the affections of the woman he loved, merely by the means of not giving her offence either by ſpeaking or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her, was a circumſtance ſo whimſical, that it frequently forced a ſmile from Miſs Milner, though the very name of Sir Edward was of power to throw a gloom over her face; for ſhe looked upon him as the cauſe why ſhe ſhould be hurried to make an election of a lover, before her own mind could well direct her where to fix.—Beſides, his purſuit was a trouble, while it was not the ſmalleſt triumph to her vanity, which, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of Lord Frederick, was in the higheſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gratified.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip now arrives in the country, and calls at Miſs Milner's; his guardian ſees his chariot coming along the lawn, and gives orders to the ſervants to ſay their lady is not at home, but that Mr. Dorriforth is; Lord Frederick leaves his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments and goes away.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:025650_0058_0FCEB14179CAE818"/>
The ladies all ſaw his carriage and ſervants at the door; Miſs Milner flew to the glaſs to adjuſt her dreſs, and in her looks expreſſed ſigns of pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation—but in vain ſhe keeps her eyes fixed upon the door of the apartment; he does not enter.</p>
                     <p>After ſome minutes expectation, the door opens and her guardian comes in; ſhe was diſappointed, he perceived ſhe was, and he looked at her with a very ſerious face; ſhe immediately called to mind the aſſurance he had given her "that her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Lord Frederick in its preſent ſtate ſhould not continue," and between chagrin and confuſion, ſhe was at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> how to behave.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the ladies were all preſent, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth ſaid to her, without the ſmalleſt reſerve, "Perhaps, Miſs Milner, you may think I have taken an unwarrantable liberty in giving orders to your ſervants to deny you to Lord Frederick, but until his lordſhip and I have had a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, or you condeſcend to declare your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more fully in regard to his viſits, I think it my duty to put an end to them."</p>
                     <p>"You will always perform your duty, Mr. Dorriforth, I have no doubt, whether I concur or not."</p>
                     <p>"Yet believe me, madam, I ſhould do it much more cheerfully, could I hope it was ſanctioned by your inclinations."</p>
                     <p>"I am not miſtreſs of my inclination, Sir, or they ſhould conform to yours."</p>
                     <p>"Place them under my directions, madam, and I'll anſwer they will."</p>
                     <p>A ſervant entered.—"Lord Frederick is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, Sir, and ſays he ſhould be glad to ſee you."—"Show him into the ſtudy," cried Dorriforth haſtily, and riſing from his ſeat, left the room.</p>
                     <p>"I hope they won't quarrel," ſaid Mrs. Horton, meaning, ſhe thought they would.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="unknown:025650_0059_0FCEB175D97A4720"/>
"I am ſorry to ſee you ſo uneaſy, Miſs Milner," ſaid Miſs Fenton, with the moſt perfect unconcern.</p>
                     <p>As the badneſs of the weather had prevented their uſual morning's exerciſe, the ladies ſat em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at their needles till the dinner bell called them away.—"Do you think Lord Frederick is gone?" then, whiſpered Miſs Milner to Miſs Woodley.—"I think not," returned Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.—"Go aſk of the ſervants, dear creature." And Miſs Woodley went out of the room.—She ſoon returned and ſaid, apart, "He is now getting into his chariot, I ſaw him paſs haſtily through the hall; he ſeemed to fly."</p>
                     <p>"Ladies, the dinner is waiting," cried Mrs. Horton, and they repaired to the dining room; where Dorriforth ſoon after came, and engroſſed their whole attention by his diſturbed looks, and unuſual ſilence. Before dinner was over, he was, however, more himſelf, but ſtill he appeared thoughtful and diſſatisfied. At the time of their evening walks he excuſed himſelf, and was ſeen in a diſtant field with Mr. Sandford in earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: for they frequently ſtopt on one ſpot for a quarter of an hour, as if the intereſt of the ſubject had ſo totally engaged them, they ſtood ſtill without knowing it. Lord Elmwood, who had joined the ladies, walked home with them; Dorriforth entered ſoon after, in a much leſs gloomy humour than when he went out, and told his lordſhip he and the ladies would dine with him to-morrow if he was diſengaged, and it was fixed they ſhould.</p>
                     <p>Still Dorriforth was in ſome perturbation, but the immediate cauſe was concealed till the next day, when about an hour before the company's depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Caſtle, Miſs Milner and Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley were deſired, by a ſervant, to walk into a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025650_0060_0FCEB14335612170"/>
apartment, where they found Dorriforth with Mr. Sandford waiting their coming. Her guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian made an apology to Miſs Milner for the form, the ceremony, of which he was going to make uſe; but he truſted the extreme weight with which his mind was oppreſſed, leſt he ſhould miſtake the real ſentiments of a lady whoſe happineſs depended upon his being correct in the knowledge of them, he truſted, that would plead his excuſe.</p>
                     <p>"I know, Miſs Milner," continued he, "the world, in general, allows to unmarried women great latitude in diſguiſing their minds with reſpect to the man they love.—I too, am willing to pardon any little diſſimulation that is but conſiſtent with that modeſty, becoming every woman on the ſubject of marriage. But to what point I may limit, or you may think proper to extend this kind of venial deceit, may ſo widely differ, that it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I remain wholly unacquainted with your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even after you have revealed them to me.—Under this conſideration, I wiſh once more to hear your thoughts in regard to matrimony, and to hear them before one of your own ſex, that I may be enabled to form my opinion by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions."</p>
                     <p>To all this ſerious oration, Miſs Milner made no other reply than by turning to Mr. Sandford, and aſking "If he was the perſon of her own ſex, to whoſe judgment her guardian meant to ſubmit his own?"</p>
                     <p>"Madam," cried Sandford very angrily, "you are come hither upon ſerious buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>"Any buſineſs muſt be ſerious to me, Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in which you are concerned; and if you had called it <hi>ſorrowful,</hi> the epithet would have ſuite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"Then why, Sir, bring him hither? for where he and I are, there muſt be contention."</p>
                     <p>"I brought him hither, Madam, or rather brought you to this houſe, merely that he might be preſent on this occaſion, and with his diſcernment relieve me from a ſuſpicion, that my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can neither ſuppreſs or confirm."</p>
                     <p>"Is there any more company you may wiſh to call in, Sir, to clear up your doubts of my vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city? If ſo, pray ſend for them before you begin your interrogations."</p>
                     <p>He ſhook his head—ſhe continued. "The whole world is welcome to hear what I ſay, and every different judge welcome, if they pleaſe, to judge me differently."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Miſs Milner,"—cried Miſs Woodley, with a tone of reproach for the vehemence with which ſhe ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps, Miſs Milner," ſaid Dorriforth, "you will not now reply to thoſe queſtions I was going to put to you?"</p>
                     <p>"Did I ever refuſe, Sir," returned ſhe with a ſelf-approving air, "to comply with any requeſt you have ſeriouſly made me? Have I ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to obey your commands whenever you thought proper to lay them upon me? If not, you have no right to ſuppoſe I will now."</p>
                     <p>He was going to reply, when Mr. Sandford ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenly interrupted him, and making towards the door, cried, "When you come to the point for which you brought me here, ſend for me again."</p>
                     <p>"Stay now," cried Dorriforth. "And Miſs Milner," continued he, "I not only entreat, but command you to tell me—Have you given your promiſes, your word, or your affections to Lord Frederick Lawnley?"</p>
                     <p>The colour ſpread over her face, and ſhe replied—"I thought confeſſions were only permitted in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy; however, as I am not a member of your

church. I ſubmit to the perſecution of a heretic, and anſwer—Lord Frederick has neither my word, my promiſe, nor any ſhare in my affections."</p>
                     <p>Sandford, Dorriforth, and Miſs Woodley all looked at each other with a ſurpriſe that was for ſome time dumb.—At length Dorriforth ſaid, "And it is your firm intention never to become his wife?"</p>
                     <p>To which ſhe anſwered—"At preſent it is"</p>
                     <p>"At preſent; do you ſuſpect you ſhall change your ſentiments?"</p>
                     <p>"Women ſometimes do."</p>
                     <p>"But before that change can take place, Madam, your acquaintance will be broken off: for it is that, I ſhall next inſiſt upon; and to which you can have no objection."</p>
                     <p>She replied, "I had rather it would continue."</p>
                     <p>"On what account?" cried Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe it entertains me."</p>
                     <p>"For ſhame, for ſhame!" returned he, "it endangers both your character and your happineſs.—Yet again, do not ſuffer me to bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Miſs Woodley heſitated—he continued. "Or has the preſent converſation altered them?"</p>
                     <p>She heſitated again, then anſwered—"The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent converſation has altered them."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:025650_0063_0FCEB1787A592A10"/>
"And yet you confide in it!" cried Sandford, looking at her with contempt.</p>
                     <p>"Certainly, I do," replied Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Do not you then, Mr. Sandford?" aſked Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>"I would adviſe you to act the ſame as if I did," replied Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Then, Miſs Milner," ſaid Dorriforth, "you ſee Lord Frederick no more—and I hope I have your permiſſion to tell him ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"You have, Sir," ſhe replied with a completely unembarraſſed countenance and voice.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley looked hard at her, to diſcover ſome lurking wiſh adverſe to all theſe proteſtations, but ſhe could not diſcern one.—Sandford too fixed his penetrating eyes as if he would look through her ſoul, but finding it perfectly compoſed, he cried out,</p>
                     <p>"Why then not write his lordſhip's diſmiſſion herſelf, and ſave you, Mr. Dorriforth, the trouble of any farther conteſt with him?"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed, Miſs Milner," ſaid Dorriforth, "that would oblige me; for it is with the greateſt reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance I meet his lordſhip upon this ſubject—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e was extremely impatient and importunate the laſt time he was with me—he took advantage of my eccleſiaſtical ſituation to treat me with a levity, and ill-breeding, I could ill have ſuffered upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration, than the complying with my duty to you."</p>
                     <p>"Dictate what you pleaſe, Mr. Dorriforth, and I will write it," ſaid ſhe with a warmth like the moſt unaffected inclination.—"And while you, Sir," ſhe continued, "are ſo indulgent as not to diſtreſs me with the importunities of any gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whom I am averſe, I think myſelf equally bound to rid you of the impertinence of every one, to whom you may have objection."</p>
                     <p>"But," anſwered he, "be aſſured I have no material objection to my Lord Frederick, except
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025650_0064_0FCEB14635ECC388"/>
from that dilemma, into which your acquaintance with him has involved us all; and the ſame I ſhould conceive againſt any other man, where the ſame circumſtance occurred.—As you have now, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, freely and politely conſented to the manner in which it has been propoſed, you ſhall break with him, I will not trouble you a moment longer upon a ſubject on which I have ſo frequently explained my wiſhes, but conclude it by aſſuring you, your ready acquieſcence has given me the ſincereſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction."</p>
                     <p>"I hope, Mr. Sandford," ſaid ſhe, turning to him with a ſmile, "I have given you ſatisfaction likewiſe."</p>
                     <p>Sandford could not ſay yes, and was aſhamed to ſay no; he, therefore, made no anſwer except by his looks, which were full of ſuſpicion. She, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, made him a very low courteſy.—Her guardian then handed her out of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into her coach, which was waiting to take her, Miſs Woodley, and himſelf home.</p>

                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the ſeeming readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which Miſs Milner had reſigned all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaintance with Lord Frederick, during the ſhort ride home ſhe appeared to have loſt great part of her wonted ſpirits; ſhe was thoughtful, and once ſighed moſt heavily. Dorriforth began to fear ſhe had not only made a ſacrifice of her affections, but of her veracity; yet, why ſhe had done ſo, he could not comprehend.</p>
                     <p>As the carriage moved ſlowly through a lane between Elmwood Caſtle and her houſe, on caſting
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025650_0065_0FCEB17CE4842118"/>
her eyes out of the window, Miſs Milner's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance was brightened in an inſtant, and that inſtant Lord Frederick on horſe-back was at the coach door, and the coachman ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Miſs Milner," cried he, (with a voice and manner that could give little ſuſpicion of the truth of what he ſaid) "I am overjoyed at the happineſs of ſeeing you, even though it is but an accidental meeting."</p>
                     <p>She was evidently glad to ſee him, but the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs with which he ſpoke, put her upon her guard not to expreſs the like; and ſhe ſaid in a cool conſtrained manner, ſhe "was glad to ſee his lordſhip."</p>
                     <p>The reſerve with which ſhe ſpoke, gave Lord Frederick immediate ſuſpicion who was in the coach with her, and turning his head quickly, he met the ſtern eye of Dorriforth; upon which, without the ſmalleſt ſalutation he turned from him again abruptly and rudely. Miſs Milner was confuſed, and Miſs Woodley in torture at the palpable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; to which Dorriforth appeared alone indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                     <p>"Go on," ſaid Miſs Milner to the footman, "deſire the coachman to drive on."</p>
                     <p>"No," cried Lord Frederick, "not till you have told me when I ſhall ſee you again."</p>
                     <p>"I will write you word, my Lord," replied ſhe, ſomething alarmed; "you ſhall have a letter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after I get home"</p>
                     <p>As if he gueſſed what its contents were to be, he cried out with warmth, "Take care, then, madam, how you treat me in that letter—and you, Mr. Dorriforth," turning to him, "do you take care what it contains, for if it is dictated by you, to you I ſhall ſend the anſwer."</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth, without making his lordſhip a reply, or caſting a look at him, put his head out of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025650_0066_0FCEB14996CC8858"/>
window on the oppoſite ſide, and called, in a very angry tone to the coachman, "How dare you not drive on, when your lady orders you?"</p>
                     <p>The ſound of Dorriforth's voice in anger was to the ſervants ſo unuſual, it acted like a ſtroke of electricity on the man, and he drove on at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſo ſwiftly, that Lord Frederick was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left many yards behind. As ſoon, however, as he recovered from the ſurpriſe into which this ſudden command had thrown him, he rode with ſpeed after the carriage, and followed it till they all arrived at the door of Miſs Milner's houſe; where his lordſhip, giving himſelf up to the rage of love, or to rage againſt Dorriforth for the contempt with which he had treated him, leapt from his horſe as Miſs Milner ſtept from her carriage, and ſeizing her hand, entreated her "Not to deſert him, in compliance to the monaſtic precepts of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy."</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth heard this, ſtanding ſilently by, with a manly ſcorn pointed in his countenance.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner ſtruggled to looſe her hand, ſaying, "Excuſe me from replying to you now, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>In return to which his lordſhip brought her hand to his lips, and began to devour it with kiſſes, when Dorriforth, with an inſtantaneous impulſe, ruſhed forward, and ſtruck him a blow in the face.—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the force with which this aſſault was given, and the aſtoniſhment it excited, his lordſhip ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered, and letting fall the hand of Miſs Milner, her guardian immediately laid hold of it, and led her into the houſe.</p>
                     <p>She was terrified beyond deſcription; and it was with difficulty Mr. Dorriforth could get her to her own chamber, without taking her in his arms.—When, with the aſſiſtance of her woman,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025650_0067_0FCEB17DCC196D68"/>
he had placed her upon a ſopha—all ſhame and confuſion for what he had done, he dropped upon his knees before her, and earneſtly, "entreated her forgiveneſs for the indelicacy he had been guilty of in her preſence"—And that he had alarmed her, and loſt ſight of the reſpect which he thought ſacredly her due, ſeemed to be the only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that dwelt upon his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>She felt the indecorum of the poſture he had condeſcended to take, and was ſhocked—to ſee her guardian at her feet, ſtruck with the ſame impropriety as if ſhe had beheld a parent there; and, all agitation and emotion, ſhe implored him to riſe, and with a thouſand proteſtations declared, "ſhe thought the raſhneſs of the act, was the higheſt proof of his regard for her."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley now entered; for her care being ever employed upon the unfortunate, Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick on this occaſion, had been the object of it; and ſhe had waited by his ſide, and with every good purpoſe, preached patience to him, while he was ſmarting under the pain and ſhame of his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—At firſt, his fury threatened to retort upon the ſervants around him, and who refuſed his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the houſe, the puniſhment he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived—But in the certainty of an honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends which muſt hereafter be made, he overcame the many temptations which the moment offered, and remounting his horſe, rode from the place.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner had Miſs Woodley entered the room, and Dorriforth had reſigned to her the care of his ward, than he flew to the ſpot where he had left his lordſhip, negligent what might have been the event had he ſtill remained there.—After inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being told he was gone, Dorriforth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his own apartment, and with a boſom torn by more excruciating ſenſations far, than thoſe he had given to his adverſary.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:025650_0068_0FCEB14AF1FABD20"/>
The remorſe that firſt ſtruck him as he ſhut the door upon himſelf was—I have departed from my character—from the ſacred character and dignity of my profeſſion and ſentiments—I have departed from myſelf.—I am no longer the philoſopher, but the ruffian—I have treated with an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable inſult a young nobleman, whoſe only crime was love, and a fond deſire to inſinuate himſelf into the favour of his miſtreſs.—I muſt atone for this outrage in whatever manner he may chooſe, and the law of juſtice and equity (though in this one inſtance contrary to the law of religion) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, that if he demands my life, in ſatisfaction for his wounded honour, it is his due. "Alas," cried he, "that I could have laid it down this morning, unſullied with the cauſe, for which it will make but poor atonement."</p>
                     <p>He next reflected—I have offended, and filled with horror a beautiful young lady, whom it was my duty to have protected from the brutal manners, to which I myſelf have expoſed her.</p>
                     <p>Again—I have drawn upon me the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of my faithful preceptor and friend; the man in whoſe judgment it was my delight to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved—above all, I have drawn upon myſelf the the ſtings of my own conſcience.</p>
                     <p>"Where ſhall I paſs this ſleepleſs night?" cried he, walking repeatedly acroſs his chamber; "Can I go to the ladies? I am a brute, unworthy ſuch ſociety.—Shall I go and repoſe my diſturbed mind on Sandford? I am aſhamed to tell him the cauſe of my uneaſineſs.—Shall I go to Lord Frederick, and, humbling myſelf before him, beg his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! He would ſpurn me for a coward.—No"—(and he lifted up his eyes to Heaven) "Thou all great, all wiſe, and all omnipotent being, whom I have above any other offended, to thee alone I
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025650_0069_0FCEB17F4988FE88"/>
apply in this hour of tribulation, and from thee alone I expect comfort.—And the confidence with which I now addreſs myſelf to thee, encouraged by that long intercourſe religion has effected, in this one moment pays me amply, for the many years of my paſt life wholly devoted to thy ſervice."</p>

                     <p>ALTHOUGH Miſs Milner had foreſeen no fatal event from the indignity offered Lord Frederick, yet ſhe paſſed a night very different from thoſe to which ſhe had been accuſtomed. No ſooner was ſhe fallen into a ſleep, than a thouſand vague but diſtreſſing ideas darted acroſs her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.—Her heart would at times whiſper to her as ſhe was half aſleep, "Lord Frederick is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from you for ever."—She ſhakes off the uneaſineſs this idea brings along with it—ſhe then ſtarts, and beholds the blow ſtill aimed at him by Dorriforth.—And no ſooner has ſhe driven away this painful image, than ſhe is again awakened by ſeeing her guardian at her feet ſuing for pardon.—She ſighs, ſhe trembles, ſhe is chilled with terror.</p>
                     <p>Relieved by a flood of tears; towards the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſinks into a refreſhing ſlumber, but waking, finds the ſelf-ſame-images crowding altogether upon her mind—ſhe is doubtful to which to give the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—one, however, ruſhes the foremoſt, and will continue ſo—ſhe knows not the conſequence of ruminating, nor why ſhe dwells upon that more than upon all the reſt, and yet it will give place to none.</p>
                     <p>She riſes in a languid and diſordered ſtate, and at breakfaſt adds freſh pain to Dorriforth by her altered appearance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="unknown:025650_0070_0FCEB14C38466328"/>
He had ſcarce left the breakfaſt room when an officer waited upon him charged with a challenge from Lord Frederick. To the meſſage delivered to him by this gentleman, Dorriforth replied,</p>
                     <p>"As a clergyman, more eſpecially in the church of Rome, I know not whether I am not exempt from anſwering a claim of this kind; but not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had forbearance to avoid an offence, I have no right to a privilege that would only indemnify me from making reparation."</p>
                     <p>"You will then meet his lordſhip, Sir, at the appointed time?" ſaid the officer.</p>
                     <p>"I will," anſwered Dorriforth, "and my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care ſhall be to procure a gentleman to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me."</p>
                     <p>The officer withdrew, and as ſoon as Dorriforth was once more alone, he was going once more to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, but he durſt not—ſince yeſterday, reflection, for the firſt time of his life, was become painful to him; and even as he rode the ſhort way to Lord Elmwood's immediately after, he found his own thoughts ſo inſufferable, he was obliged to enter into converſation with his ſervant. Solitude, that he was formerly ſo charmed withal, at thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had been worſe than death.</p>
                     <p>At Lord Elmwood's, he met Sandford in the hall, and the ſight of him was no longer welcome, but diſpleaſing—he knew how different the principles he had juſt adopted were to thoſe of that reverend friend's, and without his complaining, or even ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting what had happened, his preſence was a ſufficient reproach. Dorriforth paſſed him as haſtily as he could, and inquiring for Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, diſcloſed to him his errand, which was to aſk him to be his ſecond; his lordſhip ſtarted, and and wiſhed to conſult his tutor, but that his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtrictly forbid; and having urged his reaſons
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025650_0071_0FCEB180C745CD18"/>
with arguments, ſuch as his lordſhip could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, he at length prevailed upon him to promiſe he would accompany him to the field, which was at a few miles diſtance only, and the parties were to be there at ſeven on the ſame evening.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as his buſineſs with Lord Elmwood was ſettled, Dorriforth returned home, to make ſome neceſſary preparations for the event which might enſue from this meeting—he wrote letters to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his friends; and one to his ward, over which he ſhed tears.</p>
                     <p>Sandford going into Lord Elmwood's library ſoon after Dorriforth had left it, expreſſed his ſurpriſe at finding him gone; upon which that young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, after anſwering a few queſtions, and giving a few ſignificant tokens, that he was intruſted with a ſecret, frankly confeſſed what he had promiſed to conceal.</p>
                     <p>Sandford, as much as a holy man could be, was enraged at Dorriforth for the cauſe of this chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, but was ſtill more enraged at him for his wickedneſs in accepting it—he applauded his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil's virtue in making the diſcovery, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated himſelf that he ſhould be the inſtrument of ſaving not only the blood of his friend, but of preventing the ſcandal of his being engaged in a duel.</p>
                     <p>In the ardour of his deſigns he went immediately to Miſs Milner's—entered the houſe he had ſo long, refuſed to enter, and at a time when he was on ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated bad terms with its owner.</p>
                     <p>He aſked for Dorriforth, went haſtily into his apartment, and poured upon him a torrent of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes.—Dorriforth bore all he ſaid with the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a devotee, but with the firmneſs of a man.—He owned his fault, but no eloquence could make him recall the promiſe he had given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025650_0072_0FCEB14E457771D0"/>
the injury.—Unſhaken by the arguments, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and menaces of Sandford, he gave a freſh proof of that inflexibility for which he has been deſcribed and after two hours diſpute they parted, neither of them the better for what either had advanced, but Dorriforth ſomething the worſe; his conſcience gave teſtimony to Sandford's opinion, "that he was bound by ties more ſacred than wordly honour," but while he owned, he would not yield to the duty.</p>
                     <p>Sandford left him, determined, however, that Lord Elmwood ſhould not be acceſſary in his guilt, and this he declared; on which Dorriforth took the reſolution of ſeeking another ſecond.</p>
                     <p>In paſſing through the houſe on his return home, Sandford met, by accident, Mrs Horton, Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the other two ladies returning from a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ter in the garden.—Surpriſed at the ſight of Mr. Sandford in her houſe, Miſs Milner would not expreſs that ſurpriſe, but going up to him with all the friendly benevolence which generally played about her heart, ſhe took hold of one of his hands, and preſſed it with a kindneſs which told him he was welcome more forcibly, than if ſhe had made the moſt elaborate ſpeech to convince him of it.—He, however, ſeemed little touched with her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and as an excuſe for breaking his word, cried,</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, Madam, but I was brought hither in my anxiety to prevent murder."</p>
                     <p>"Murder!" exclaimed all the ladies.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered he, addreſſing himſelf to Miſs Fenton, "your betrothed huſband is a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; he is going to ſecond Mr. Dorriforth, who means this very evening to be killed by my Lord Frederick, or to kill him, in addition to the blow he gave him laſt night."</p>

                        <pb n="70" facs="unknown:025650_0073_0FCEB1844600F4F0"/>
Mrs. Horton exclaimed, "If Mr. Dorriforth dies, he dies a martyr."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley cried with fervour, "Heaven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid!"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Fenton cried, "Dear me!"</p>
                     <p>While Miſs Milner, without uttering one word, ſunk ſpeechleſs on the floor.</p>
                     <p>They lifted her up and brought her to the door which entered the garden. She ſoon recovered; for the tumult of her mind would not ſuffer her to remain inactive, and ſhe was rouzed, in ſpite of her weakneſs, to endeavour to ward off the preſent diſaſter. In vain, however, ſhe tried to walk to Dorriforth's apartment—in the trial ſhe ſunk as before, and was taken to a ſettee, while Miſs Woodley was diſpatched to bring her guardian to her.</p>
                     <p>Informed of the cauſe of her ſwoonings, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Miſs Woodley with a tender anxiety for her health, and with grief and confuſion that he had ſo careleſsly endangered it.—On his entering the room, Sandford beheld the inquietude of his mind, and cried, "Here is your <hi>guardian,</hi>" with a cruel emphaſis on the word.</p>
                     <p>He was too much engaged by the indiſpoſition of his ward to reply to Sandford.—He placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſettee by her, and with the utmoſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, reverence, and pity, entreated her not to be concerned at an accident in which he, and he only, had been to blame; but which he had ſtill no doubt would be accommodated in the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable manner.</p>
                     <p>"I have one favour to require of you, Mr. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth," ſaid ſhe "and that is your promiſe, your ſolemn promiſe, which I know is ſacred, that you will not fight with my Lord Frederick."</p>
                     <p>He heſitated.</p>

                        <pb n="71" facs="unknown:025650_0074_0FCEB14F40118460"/>
"Oh, madam," cried Sandford, "he is grown a libertine now, and I would not believe his word were he to give it you."</p>
                     <p>"Then, Sir," returned Dorriforth angrily, "you <hi>may</hi> believe my word, for I will keep that, I have paſſed to you.—I will give Lord Frederick all the reſtitution in my power.—But, my dear Miſs Milner, let not this alarm you; we may not find it convenient to meet this many a day; and moſt probably ſome fortunate explanation may yet take place, and prevent our meeting at all. If not, reckon but among the many duels that are fought, how few are fatal; and even in that caſe, how ſmall would be the loſs to ſociety.—He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding—</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould ever deplore the loſs," cried Miſs Milner, "I could not ſurvive the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"For my part," returned Dorriforth, "I look upon my life as much forfeited to his lordſhip, to whom I have given a high offence, as it might in other inſtances have been forfeited to the offended laws of the land. Honour is the law of the polite part of the land; we know it; and when we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt it knowingly, we juſtly incur our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.—However, Miſs Milner, this buſineſs is not to be ſettled immediately, and I have no doubt but all will be as you could wiſh—Do you think I ſhould appear thus eaſy," added he with a ſmile, "if I were going to be ſhot at by my Lord Frederick?"</p>
                     <p>"Very well," cried Sandford, with a look that demonſtrated he knew better.</p>
                     <p>"You will ſtay within then, all this day?" ſaid Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"I am engaged out to dinner," he replied, "it is unlucky—I am ſorry for it—but I'll be at home early in the evening."</p>

"Stained with human blood," cried Sandford, "or yourſelf a corpſe."</p>
                     <p>The ladies all lifted up their hands, and Miſs Milner roſe from her ſeat and threw herſelf at her guardian's feet.</p>
                     <p>"You knelt to me laſt night, I now kneel to you," ſhe cried; "kneel, never deſiring to riſe more, if you perſiſt in your intention—I am weak, I am volatile, I am indiſcreet, but I have a heart from whence ſome impreſſions can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſed."</p>
                     <p>He endeavoured to raiſe her, ſhe perſiſted to kneel—and here the trouble, the affright, the terror ſhe endured, diſcovered to her for the firſt time her own ſentiments—which, till that moment, ſhe had doubted and ſhe continued,</p>
                     <p>"I no longer pretend to conceal my paſſion—I love Lord Frederick Lawnly."</p>
                     <p>Her guardian ſtarted.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, to my ſhame I love him:" (cried ſhe, all emotion) "I meant to have ſtruggled with the weakneſs, becauſe I ſuppoſed it would he diſpleaſing to you—but apprehenſion for his ſafety takes away every power of reſtraint, and I beſeech you to ſpare his life."</p>
                     <p>"This is exactly what I thought," cried Sandford triumphantly.</p>
                     <p>"Good heaven!" cried Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"But it is very natural," ſaid Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"I own," ſaid Dorriforth, (ſtruck with amaze, and now taking her from his feet with a force ſhe could not reſiſt) "I own, Miſs Milner, I am greatly affected at this contradiction in your charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter."—</p>
                     <p>"But did I not ſay ſo?" cried Sandford inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him.</p>
                     <p>"However," continued he, "you may take my word, though you have deceived me in yours, that

                     <p>He was proceeding with the moſt poignant lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and auſtere looks, when obſerving the ſhame, the terror, and the ſelf-reproach which agitated her mind, he diveſted himſelf in great meaſure of his auſterity, and ſaid, mildly,</p>

                     <p>Perhaps for the preſent you can much eaſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with mine?" ſaid Dorriforth. She made no anſwer: he therefore having once more aſſured her Lord Frederick's life was ſafe, was quitting the room; when he recollected in what a ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation he had left her, and turning towards her as he opened the door, added,</p>

                     <p>THIS taunting reproof from Sandford made little impreſſion upon Miſs Milner, whoſe thoughts were all fixed on a ſubject of much more importance than the opinion he entertained of her.—She threw her arms about Miſs Woodley as ſoon as they were left alone, and aſked with anxiety, "What ſhe thought of her behaviour?" Miſs Woodley, who could not approve of the duplicity her friend had betrayed, ſtill wiſhed to reconcile her as much as poſſible to her own conduct, and replied, ſhe "highly commended the frankneſs with which ſhe had, at laſt, acknowledged her ſentiments."</p>
                     <p>"Frankneſs!" cried Miſs Milner, ſtarting.</p>
                     <p>"Frankneſs, my dear Miſs Woodley!—what you have juſt now heard me ſay, is all a falſehood."</p>
                     <p>"How, Miſs Milner!"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, my dear Miſs Woodley," returned ſhe, ſobbing upon her boſom, "pity the agonies of my heart, by nature ſincere, when ſuch are the fatal propenſities it cheriſhes; I muſt ſubmit to the groſſeſt falſehoods rather than reveal the truth."</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean?" cried Miſs Woodley, with the ſtrongeſt amazement painted on her face.</p>
                     <p>"Do you ſuppoſe I love Lord Frederick? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the other. "Do you ſuppoſe I <hi>can</hi> love him?—Oh fly, Miſs Woodley, and prevent my guardian from telling him ſuch an untruth.</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean?" repeated Miſs Woodley;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025650_0078_0FCEB15262D93038"/>
"I proteſt you frighten me:"—and this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency in the behaviour of Miſs Milner really ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as if her ſenſes had been deranged.</p>
                     <p>"Only fly," reſumed ſhe, "and prevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ill conſequence which muſt enſue from Lord Frederick's being told this falſehood. It will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us all in greater diſquietude than we ſuffer at preſent."</p>
                     <p>"Then what has influenced you, my dear Miſs Milner?"—</p>
                     <p>"That which impels my every action," returned ſhe; "an unſurmountable inſtinct—a fatality, that will ever render me the moſt miſerable of human beings; and yet you, even you, my dear Miſs Woodley, will not pity me."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley preſſed her cloſe in her arms, and vowed, "That while ſhe was unhappy, from whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cauſe, ſhe ſtill would pity her."</p>
                     <p>"Go to Mr. Dorriforth then, and prevent him from impoſing upon Lord Frederick."</p>
                     <p>"But that impoſition is the only means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the duel," replied Miſs Woodley. "The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have told him you have no regard for his lordſhip, he will no longer refuſe to fight with him."</p>
                     <p>"Then at all events I am undone," exclaimed Miſs Milner, "for the duel is horrible, even beyond every thing elſe."</p>
                     <p>"How ſo?" returned Miſs Woodley, ſince you have declared you do not care for my Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick."</p>
                     <p>"But are you ſo blind," returned Miſs Milner, with a degree of madneſs in her looks, "to believe I do not care for Mr. Dorriforth? Oh, Miſs Woodley! I love him with all the paſſion of a miſtreſs, and with all the tenderneſs of a wife."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley at this ſentence ſat down—it was
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025650_0079_0FCE9F02D3981918"/>
on a chair that was cloſe to her—her feet could not have taken her to any other.—She trembled—ſhe was white as aſhes, and deprived of ſpeech. Miſs Milner, taking her by the hand, ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"I know what you feel—I know what you think of me—and how much you hate and deſpiſe me.—But Heaven is witneſs to all my ſtruggles—nor would I, even to myſelf, acknowledge the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prepoſſeſſion, till forced by a ſenſe of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger"—</p>
                     <p>"Silence," cried Miſs Woodley, ſtruck with horror.</p>
                     <p>"And even now," reſumed Miſs Milner, "have I not concealed it from all but you, by plunging myſelf into a new difficulty, from whence I know not how I ſhall be extricated?—And do I entertain a hope? No, Miſs Woodley, nor ever will—But ſuffer me to own my folly to you—to entreat your ſoothing friendſhip to free me from my weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—And, oh! give me your friendly advice to deliver me from the difficulties which ſurround me."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was ſtill pale, and ſtill ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Education is called ſecond nature; in the ſtrict (but not enlarged) education of Miſs Woodley, it was more powerful than the firſt—and the violation of oaths, perſons, or things conſecrated to Heaven, was, in her opinion, if not in the moſt enormous, the moſt horrid among the catalogue of crimes.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner had lived too long in a family who had imbibed thoſe opinions not to be convinced of their exiſtence; nay, her own reaſon told her that ſolemn vows of whatever kind, ought to be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the more ſhe reſpected her guardian's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſs ſhe called in queſtion his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious tenets—in eſteeming him, ſhe eſteemed all his notions; and among the reſt, even venerated
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025650_0080_0FCEB153BAEE0B58"/>
thoſe of his religion.—Yet that paſſion, which had unhappily taken poſſeſſion of her whole ſoul, would not have been inſpired, had there not ſubſiſted an early difference, in their ſyſtems of divine faith—had ſhe been early taught what were the ſacred functions of a Roman eccleſiaſtic, though all her eſteem, all her admiration, had been attracted by the qualities and accompliſhments of her guardian; yet education would have given ſuch a prohibition to her love, that ſhe had been precluded from it, as by that barrier which divides a ſiſter from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>This unfortunately, was not the caſe; and Miſs Milner loved Dorriforth without one conſcious check to tell her ſhe was wrong, except that which convinced her, her love would be avoided by him, with deteſtation, with horror.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley, ſomething recovered from her firſt ſurpriſe, and ſuffering—for never did her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible mind ſuffer ſo exquiſitely—amidſt all the grief and abhorrence ſhe felt, pity was ſtill predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant—and reconciled to the faults of Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by her miſery, ſhe once more looked at her with friendſhip, and aſked, "what ſhe could do, to render her leſs unhappy?"</p>
                     <p>"Make me forget," replied Miſs Milner, "every moment of my paſt life ſince I firſt ſaw you—that moment was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"And even in death," replied Miſs Woodley, "do not be ſo preſumptuous as to hope to ſhake them off—if unrepented in this world"—</p>
                     <p>She was proceeding—but the anxiety her friend endured, would not ſuffer her to be wholly free from the apprehenſion, that notwithſtanding the poſitive aſſurance of her guardian, (ſhould he and Lord Frederick meet) the duel might ſtill take
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025650_0081_0FCEB18B37805020"/>
place; ſhe therefore rung the bell and inquired if Mr. Dorriforth was ſtill at home?—the anſwer was—"He is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ode out."—"You remember," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "he told you he ſhould dine out." This did not, however, diſmiſs her fears, and ſhe diſpatched two ſervants different ways in purſuit of him, acquainting them with her ſuſpicions, and charging them to prevent his and Lord Frederick's meeting. Sandford had alſo taken his precautions; but though he knew the time, he did not know the exact place of their appointment, for that, Lord Elmwood had forgot to inquire.</p>
                     <p>The exceſſive alarm which Miſs Milner diſcovered upon this occaſion, was imputed by the ſervants, and others who were witneſſes of it, to her affection for Lord Edward, while none but Miſs Woodley knew, or had the moſt diſtant ſuſpicion of the real cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton and Miſs Fenton, who were ſitting together expatiating on the duplicity of their own ſex in the inſtance juſt before them, had, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the intereſt of the diſcourſe, a longing deſire to break it off; for they were impatient to ſee this poor frail being whom they were loading with their innocent—as it was among friends—calumny. They longed to ſee if ſhe would have the confidence to look them in the face: they, to whom ſhe had ſo often proteſted, ſhe had not the ſmalleſt attachment to Lord Frederick but from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of vanity.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ladies heard with much ſatisfaction dinner was ſerved, but met Miſs Milner at table with a leſs degree of pleaſure than they expected; for her Bath was ſo totally abſtracted from them, they could not diſcern a ſingle bluſh, or confuſed glance, which their preſence occaſioned. No, Miſs Milner had before them divulged nothing of which ſhe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025650_0082_0FCEB1553733AB08"/>
was aſhamed, ſhe only was aſhamed what ſhe had ſaid was not truth. In the boſom of Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley alone was that ſecret entruſted which could call a bluſh into her face, and before her ſhe <hi>did</hi> feel confuſion—before the gentle friend, to whom ſhe had till this time communicated all her faults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out embarraſſment, ſhe now caſt down her eyes in ſhame, and ſcarce durſt lift them up to meet her's.</p>
                     <p>At table there was little talking, and leſs eating; Miſs Milner did not attempt to eat; Miſs Woodley endeavoured, but could not.</p>
                     <p>Soon after the dinner was removed, Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood entered; and that gallant nobleman declared—"Mr. Sandford had uſed him ill in not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to accompany his relation; for he feared Dorriforth would now throw himſelf upon the ſword of Lord Frederick without a friend by to defend him."—A rebuke from the eye of Miſs Woodley, which from this day forward had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over Miſs Milner, reſtrained her from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the affright ſhe ſuffered from this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his lordſhip's. Miſs Fenton replied, "As to that, my lord, I ſee no reaſon why Mr. Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, and Lord Frederick ſhould not now be friends.—"Certainly," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "for as ſoon as my Lord Frederick is made acquainted with Miſs Milner's confeſſion, all differences muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled."—"What confeſſion?" aſked his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, to avoid hearing a repetition of that which gave her pain but to think of, aroſe in order to retire into her own apartment, but was obliged to ſit down again—and received the aſſiſtance of her friend and Lord Elmwood to lead her into her dreſſing-room. Reclined upon a ſofa there, a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued between her and Miſs Woodley for
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025650_0083_0FCEB18CB4DFBC70"/>
near half an hour; and when the converſation began, the name of Dorriforth was never uttered—they were both grown cool and conſiderate ſince the diſcovery, and both were equally aſhamed and fearful of naming him.</p>
                     <p>The vanity of the world, the folly of riches, the pleaſures of retirement, and ſuch topics, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their diſcourſe, but not their thoughts, for near two hours; and the firſt time the word Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth was ſpoken, a ſervant with alacrity opened the dreſſing-room door, without previouſly rapping, and cried, "Mr. Dorriforth, madam."</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth immediately came in, and went eagerly to Miſs Milner.—Miſs Woodley beheld the glow of joy, and guilt upon her face, and did not riſe to give him her ſeat, as was her cuſtom, if he came with intelligence to his ward, and ſhe was ſitting next her—he therefore ſtood while he re-repeated all that had happened in his interview with Lord Frederick.</p>
                     <p>But with her gladneſs to ſee her guardian ſafe, Miſs Milner had forgot to inquire for the ſafety of his lordſhip; the man whom ſhe had pretended to love ſo paſſionately—even a ſmile of rapture was upon her face, though Dorriforth might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from putting him to death. This incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of behaviour Miſs Woodley ſaw, and was confounded—but Dorriforth, in whoſe thoughts a ſuſpicion either of her love to him, or want of love for Lord Frederick, had not the ſmalleſt place, eaſily reconciled this inconſiſtency, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"You ſee by my countenance all is well, and therefore you ſmile on me before I tell you what has paſſed."</p>
                     <p>This brought her to the recollection of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and now with a countenance conſtrained to ſome ſhow of gravity, ſhe tried to expreſs alarm ſhe did not feel.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:025650_0084_0FCEB156E5111ED8"/>
"Nay, I have the pleaſure to aſſure you Lord Frederick is ſafe," reſumed Dorriforth, "and the diſgrace of his blow waſhed entirely away, by a few drops of blood from this arm," and he laid his hand upon his left arm, which reſted in his waiſtcoat as a ſling.</p>
                     <p>She caſt her eyes there, and ſeeing where the ball had entered the coat ſleeve, ſhe gave an invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſcream, and ſunk on the ſide of the ſopha. Inſtead of that tender ſympathy with which Miſs Woodley uſed to attend her upon the ſlighteſt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or affliction, ſhe now addreſſed her in a ſharp tone, and cried, "Miſs Milner, you have heard Lord Frederick is ſafe, you have then nothing to alarm you."—Nor did ſhe run to offer a ſmelling-bottle, or to raiſe her head. Her guardian ſeeing her near fainting, and without this aſſiſtance from her friend, was going himſelf to give it; but on this, Miſs Woodley interfered, and having taken her head upon her arm, aſſured him, "It was a trifling weakneſs to which Miſs Milner was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, and that ſhe would ring for her woman, who knew how to relieve her inſtantly with a few drops."—Satisfied with this, Dorriforth left the room; and a ſurgeon being arrived to dreſs his wound, he retired into his own chamber.</p>

                     <p>THE power delegated to the keeper of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, Miſs Woodley was the laſt perſon on earth to abuſe—but ſhe was alſo the laſt, who, by her complacency, would participate in the guilt of her

Of vows made to God or to man, the former muſt weigh the heavier.—Moreover, the dreadful ſin of infidelity in the marriage ſtate, is much ſoftened to a common underſtanding, by the frequency of the crime; whereas, of vows broken by a devotee ſhe had ſcarce heard of any; or if any, they were generally followed by ſuch examples of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, ſuch miraculous puniſhments in this world, (as well as eternal puniſhment in the other) that ſerved to exaggerate their wickedneſs.</p>
                     <p>She, who could, and did pardon Miſs Milner, was the perſon who ſaw her paſſion in the ſevereſt light, and reſolved to take every method<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however harſh, to root it from her heart—nor did ſhe fear ſucceſs, reſting on the certain aſſurance, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deep her love was fixed, it would never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Yet this confidence did not prevent her taking every precaution, leſt Dorriforth ſhould come to the knowledge of it—ſhe would not have his compoſed mind diſturbed with ſuch a thought—his ſtedfaſt principles ſo much as ſhook by the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination—nor overwhelm him with thoſe ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which his fatal attraction, unpremeditated as it was, would ſtill have drawn upon him.</p>
                     <p>With this plan of concealment, in which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural modeſty of Miſs Milner acquieſced, there was but one effort to make which that young lady was not prepared for; and that was an entire ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from her guardian.—She had, from the firſt, cheriſhed her paſſion without the moſt diſtant proſpect of a return—ſhe was prepared to ſee Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025650_0086_0FCEB15A0364C258"/>
without ever ſeeing him nearer to her than her guardian and friend, but not to ſee him at all—for that, ſhe was not prepared.</p>
                     <p>But Miſs Woodley reflected upon the inevitable neceſſity of this ſtep before ſhe made the propoſal, and then made it with a firmneſs that might have done honour to the inflexibility of Dorriforth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>During the few days that intervened between her open confeſſion of love for Lord Frederick, and this propoſal, the moſt intricate incoherence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the whole family, in the character of Miſs Milner—and in order to evade a marriage with his lordſhip, and to conceal, at the ſame time, the ſhameful propenſity which lurked in her breaſt, ſhe was once, even on the point of declaring a paſſion for Sir Edward Aſhton.</p>
                     <p>In the duel which had taken place between Lord Frederick and Dorriforth, the latter had received his antagoniſt's fire, but poſitively refuſed to return it; by which he had kept his promiſe not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his lordſhip's life, and had reconciled Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in great meaſure, to his behaviour—and Sandford now (his reſolution once broken) no longer refuſed entering Miſs Milner's houſe, but came every time it was convenient, though he yet avoided its miſtreſs as much as poſſible; or ſhowed by every word and look, when ſhe was preſent, that ſhe was ſtill leſs in his favour than ſhe had ever been.</p>
                     <p>He viſited Dorriforth on the evening after his engagement with Lord Frederick, and again the next morning breakfaſted with him in his own chamber; nor did Miſs Milner ſee her guardian ſince his firſt return from that engagement till the following noon. She inquired, however, of the ſervant how his maſter did, and was rejoiced to
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025650_0087_0FCEB191F4A2D2B0"/>
hear his wound was but very ſlight—yet this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry ſhe durſt not make before Miſs Woodley, but waited till ſhe was abſent.</p>
                     <p>When Dorriforth made his appearance the next day, it was evident he had thrown from his heart a load of cares; and though they had left a langour upon his face, there was content in his voice, his manners, in his every word and action.—Far from ſeeming to retain any reſentment towards his ward, for the trouble and danger into which her impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had led him, he appeared rather to pity her weakneſs, and to wiſh to ſooth the perturbation which the recollection of her own conduct had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly raiſed in her mind—His endeavours were moſt ſucceſsful—ſhe was ſoothed every time he ſpoke to her; and had not the watchful eye of Miſs Woodley ſtood guard over her inclinations, ſhe had plainly evinced, ſhe was enraptured with the joy of ſeeing him again himſelf, after the danger to which he had been expoſed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe emotions, which ſhe laboured to ſubdue, paſſed, however, the bounds of her ineffectual reſiſtance; when, at the time of retiring after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he ſaid to her in a low voice, but ſuch as it was meant the company ſhould hear, "Do me the favour, Miſs Milner, to call at my ſtudy ſometime in the evening; I have to ſpeak to you upon buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
                     <p>She anſwered, "I will, Sir," And her eyes ſwam with delight in expectation of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</p>
                     <p>Let not the reader, nevertheleſs, imagine, there was in that ardent expectation, one idea which the moſt ſpotleſs mind, in love, might not have indulged without reproach.—Sincere love, (at leaſt among the delicate of the female ſex) is often gratified by that degree of enjoyment, or rather forbearance,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025650_0088_0FCEB15D088B3D98"/>
which would be torture in the purſuit of any other paſſion—real, delicate, and reſtrained love, like that of Miſs Milner's, was indulged in the ſight of the object only; and having bounded her wiſhes by her hopes, the height of her happineſs was limited to a converſation in which no other but themſelves partook a part.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was one who heard the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the only one who conceived with what ſenſation it was received.</p>
                     <p>While the ladies remained in the ſame room with Dorriforth, Miſs Milner thought of little, except of him—as ſoon as they withdrew into another apartment, ſhe remembered Miſs Woodley, and turning her head ſuddenly, ſaw Miſs Woodley's face imprinted with ſuſpicion and diſpleaſure—this at firſt was painful to her—but recollecting that in a couple of hours time ſhe was to meet her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian alone—ſpeak to him, and hear him ſpeak to herſelf only—every other thought was abſorbed in that one, and ſhe conſidered with indifference, the uneaſineſs, or the anger of her friend.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, to do juſtice to her heart, did not wiſh to beguile Dorriforth into the ſnares of love.—Could any ſupernatural power have endowed her with the means, and at the ſame time ſhown to her the ills that muſt ariſe from ſuch an effect of her charms, ſhe had aſſuredly enough of virtue to have declined the conqueſt; but without inquiring of herſelf what ſhe propoſed? She never ſaw him without previouſly endeavouring to look more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive than ſhe would have deſired, in any other company.—And now, without liſtening to the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand exhortations that were ſpeaking in every feature of Miſs Woodley's face, ſhe flew to a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, to adjuſt her dreſs in a manner that ſhe thought moſt enchanting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:025650_0089_0FCEB19377E7F748"/>
Time ſtole away, and the time to go to her guardian arrived. In his preſence, unſupported by the preſence of a third perſon, every grace ſhe had practiſed, every look ſhe had borrowed to ſet off her charms were annihilated, and ſhe became a native beauty, with the artleſs arguments of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, only for her aid.—Awed  thus, by his power, from every thing but what ſhe really was, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was perhaps half ſo bewitching as in thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>ay, even her embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment; and never would one word of anger paſs on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>On the preſent occaſion, he firſt expreſſed the higheſt ſatisfaction that ſhe had, at length, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him the ſtate of her mind.</p>
                     <p>"And taking every thing into conſideration, Miſs Milner," added he, "I rejoice that your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents happen to be ſuch as you have owned—for although my Lord Frederick is not the very man I could have wiſhed for your perfect happineſs, yet in the ſtate of human perfection and human happineſs, you might have fixed your affections with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Not a word of reply did this demand, or if it had, not a word could ſhe have given.</p>
                     <p>"And now, madam, the reaſon of my deſire to ſpeak with you—is to know from yourſelf, the means you think moſt proper to purſue, in order to acquaint his lordſhip, that notwithſtanding this late repulſe, there are hopes of your partiality in his favour."</p>
                     <p>"Defer the explanation," returned ſhe, eagerly.</p>

                     <p>"Mr. Dorriforth, can you allow nothing to the moments of ſurpriſe? and that pity, which the fate impending inſpired; and which might urge me to expreſs myſelf of Lord Frederick, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner my cooler thoughts will not warrant?"</p>
                     <p>"There was nothing in your expreſſions, my dear Miſs Milner, the leaſt equivocal—if you were off your guard, when you pleaded for Lord Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, as I believe you were, you ſaid more ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what you thought; and no diſcreet, or rather indiſcreet retractions, can make me change my opinion."</p>
                     <p>"I am very ſorry," ſhe replied, confuſed, and trembling.</p>
                     <p>"Why ſorry? Come, give me commiſſion to reveal theſe ſentiments.—I'll not be too hard upon you—a hint from me to his lordſhip will do—hope, is ever apt to interpret the ſlighteſt words to its own uſe, and a lover's hope, is, beyond all others, ſanguine."</p>

                     <p>"But did you ever plunge him into deſpair?"</p>
                     <p>"His purſuit ſays I never have, but he has no other proof."</p>

"However light and frivolous you have been upon frivolous ſubjects, yet I muſt own, Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I expected, that when a caſe of this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance came ſeriouſly before you, you would have diſcovered a proper ſtability in your behaviour."</p>
                     <p>"I do, Sir; and it was only while I was affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a weakneſs, which aroſe from accident, that I have ever ſhown an inconſiſtence."</p>
                     <p>"You then ſtill aſſert you have no affection for my Lord Frederick?"</p>
                     <p>"Not ſufficient to become his wife."</p>
                     <p>"You are alarmed at marriage, and I do not wonder you ſhould be ſo; it ſhows a prudent fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight that does you honour—but, my dear, are there no dangers in a ſingle ſtate?—If I may judge, Miſs Milner, there are many more to a young lady of your accompliſhments, than were you under the protection of a huſband."</p>

                     <p>Here the ſtrong glow of joy, and of gratitude, for an opinion ſo negligently, and yet ſo ſincerely expreſſed, flew to Miſs Milner's face, neck, and even to her hands and fingers; the blood mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every part of her ſkin that was viſible, for not a fibre but felt the ſecret tranſport, that Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth thought her more beautiful than the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Miſs Fenton.</p>
                     <p>If he obſerved her bluſhes, he was unſuſpicious of the cauſe, and went on.</p>

There is, beſides, in the temper of Miſs Fenton, a ſedateneſs that might with leſs hazard ſecure her ſafety in an unmarried life; and yet ſhe very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly thinks it her duty, as ſhe does not mean to ſeclude herſelf by any vows to the contrary, to become a wife—and in obedience to the counſel of her friends, will be married within a few weeks."</p>

"I wiſh ſhe may," replied Dorriforth, mildly, for he beheld the tears flowing down her face at the rough and ſevere manner in which Sandford had ſpoken, and began to feel for her uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>"I beg pardon," cried Sandford, "for ſpeaking ſo rudely to the miſtreſs of the houſe—I have no buſineſs here, I know; but where you are, Mr. Dorriforth, unleſs I am turned out, I ſhall ever think it my duty to come."</p>

                     <p>Miſs Woodley, to whom ſhe repeated all that had paſſed between herſelf, her guardian, and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, took this moment, during the alarm and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her ſpirits, to alarm them ſtill more by her prophetic inſinuations; and at length repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her there, for the firſt time, the neceſſity,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025650_0096_0FCEB165F56DDB40"/>
"that Mr. Dorriforth and ſhe ſhould remain no longer under the ſame roof." This was like the ſtroke of ſudden death to Miſs Milner, and cling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to life, ſhe endeavoured to avert the blow by prayers and by promiſes—her friend loved her too ſincerely, however, to be prevailed upon.</p>
                     <p>"But in what manner can I bring about the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration?" cried ſhe, "for till I marry we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, by my father's requeſt, to live in the ſame houſe."</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Milner," anſwered Miſs Woodley, "much as I reſpect the will of a dying man, I regard your and Mr. Dorriforth's preſent and eternal happineſs much more; and it is my reſolution you <hi>ſhall part</hi>—if you will not contrive the means, that duty falls on me, and without any invention, I ſee the meaſure at once."</p>
                     <p>"What is it?" cried Miſs Milner, eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"To go and reveal to Mr. Dorriforth, without heſitation, the real ſtate of your heart; which your preſent inconſiſtent conduct will but too readily confirm."</p>
                     <p>"You would not plunge me into ſo much ſhame, into ſo much anguiſh!" cried ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractedly.</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Miſs Woodley, "not for the world, provided you will ſeparate from him, by any method of your own—but that you <hi>ſhall</hi> ſeparate is my determination; and in ſpite of all your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, this ſhall be the means, unleſs you inſtantly agree to ſome other."</p>
                     <p>"Good Heaven, Miſs Woodley! is this your friendſhip?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes—and the trueſt friendſhip I have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.—Think what a taſk I undertake for your ſake and his, when I condemn myſelf to explain to him your weakneſs—what aſtoniſhment! what confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion!
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025650_0097_0FCEB19AF55F6808"/>
what remorſe, do I foreſee painted upon his face!—I hear him call you by the harſheſt names, and behold him fly from your ſight for ever, as an object of his deteſtation."</p>
                     <p>"Oh ſpare the dreadful picture.—Fly from my ſight for ever—deteſt my name. Oh! my dear Miſs Woodley, let his friendſhip for me but ſtill remain, and I will conſent to do any thing.—You may command me—I will go away from him directly—but let us part in friendſhip—Oh! without the friendſhip of Mr. Dorriforth, life would be a heavy burthen indeed."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley immediately began to plan ſchemes for their ſeparation; and with all her invention alive on the ſubject, this was the only probable one ſhe could form.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner was to write to her diſtant relation at Bath, complaining of the melancholy of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try life, which ſhe was to ſay her guardian impoſed upon her, and entreat the lady to ſend a preſſing invitation for her to paſs a month or two with her; this invitation was to be ſhown to Dorriforth for his approbation, and both Miſs Woodley, and Miſs Milner were to enforce it, by expreſſing their earneſt wiſhes for his conſent. This plan properly regulated, the neceſſary letter was ſent by Miſs Milner to Bath, and Miſs Woodley waited with patience, but with a watchful guard upon the conduct of her friend till the anſwer arrived.</p>
                     <p>During this interval a moſt tender and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing epiſtle from Lord Frederick was delivered to Miſs Milner; to which, as he received no anſwer, his lordſhip prevailed upon his uncle, with whom he reſided, to wait upon her, and obtain her verbal reply; for he ſtill flattered himſelf, fear of her guardian's anger, or perhaps his interception of the letter he had ſent, was the cauſe of her ſeeming contempt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="unknown:025650_0098_0FCEB1691E3477B8"/>
The old gentleman was introduced to Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and after to Mr. Dorriforth, but received from each an anſwer ſo explicit, that left his nephew no longer in doubt but all farther purſuit was vain.</p>
                     <p>Sir Edward Aſhton about this time alſo, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a formal diſmiſſion, and had the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reflect, he was beſtowing upon the object of his affections the tendereſt proof of his regard, by abſenting himſelf wholly from her ſociety.</p>
                     <p>Upon this ſerious and certain concluſion to the hopes of Lord Frederick, Dorriforth was more aſtoniſhed than he had ever yet been at the conduct of his ward—he had once thought her behaviour, in reſpect to his lordſhip, was ambiguous, but ſince her confeſſion of a paſſion for him, he had no doubt in the end, ſhe would become his wife.—He lamented to find himſelf miſtaken, and now thought it proper to give ſome important marks of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of her pernicious capri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>; and not merely in words, but by the general tenour of his behaviour. He conſequently became much more reſerved, and more auſtere than he had been, ſince his firſt acquaintance with her; for his manners, not from deſign, but unknowingly, were ſoftened ſince his guardianſhip, by that tender reſpect he had never ceaſed to pay to the object of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this ſeverity he aſſumed, his ward in the proſpect of parting from him grew me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; Miſs Woodley's love to her friend ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her little otherwiſe; and Dorriforth's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar gravity, oftentimes rigour, could not but make the whole party much leſs cheerful than they had been. Lord Elmwood too was lying dangerouſly ill of a fever; Miſs Fenton of courſe was as much in ſorrow as her nature would ſuffer her to be, and both Sandford and Dorriforth, in extreme concern on his lordſhip's account.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:025650_0099_0FCEB240021AD950"/>
In this ſtate of affairs, the letter of invitation arrives from Lady Luneham at Bath: it was ſhown to Dorriforth; and to prove to his ward he is ſo much offended, as no longer to feel that exceſſive intereſt in her concerns he once did, he gives his opinion on the ſubject with indifference—he deſires "Miſs Milner will do as ſhe herſelf thinks proper."—Miſs Woodley inſtantly accepts this permiſſion, writes back, and appoints the day her friend means to ſet off for the viſit.</p>
                     <p>She is wounded to the heart by the cold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind manners of her guardian, but dares not take one method to retrieve his opinion.—Alone, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Miſs Woodley ſhe ſighs and weeps; he diſcovers her ſorrow, and is doubtful whether the departure of Lord Frederick from that part of the country is not the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>When the day on which ſhe was to ſet off for Bath, was within two days diſtance only, the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Dorriforth took, by degrees, its uſual form; if not a greater ſhare of polite and tender attention than ever.—It was the firſt time he had parted from Miſs Milner ſince he became her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and he felt, upon the occaſion, a reluctance.—He had been angry with her, he had ſhown her he was ſo, and he now began to wiſh he had not.—She is not happy, (he conſidered within himſelf) every word and action declares ſhe is not, and I may have been too ſevere, and added to her unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.—"At leaſt we will part on good terms."—ſaid he, "Indeed my regard for her is ſuch, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not part otherwiſe."—</p>
                     <p>She ſoon returned his returning kindneſs, and it was a gentle tie that would have faſtened her to the ſpot where ſhe was, but for the firm reſiſtance of Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"What will a few months abſence effect?" cried

                     <p>"In that time," replied Miſs Woodley, "we may find ſome method to make it ſtill longer."—To this ſhe liſtened with a kind of deſpair, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſhe "was reſigned;" and accordingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her departure.</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth was all anxiety that every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her journey ſhould be commodious; he was eager ſhe ſhould be happy, and he was eager ſhe ſhould ſee he entirely forgave her.—He would have gone part of the way with her, but from the extreme illneſs of Lord Elmwood, in whoſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he paſſed the chief of the day, and ſlept in Elmwood Houſe every night.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of her journey, when Dorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth gave his hand and conducted Miſs Milner to the carriage, all the way he led her ſhe could not reſtrain a flood of tears; which increaſed, as he parted from her, to convulſive ſobs.—He was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and notwithſtanding he had previouſly bid her farewell, he drew her gently on one ſide and ſaid, with his eyes moiſtened from regard of the moſt laudable nature,</p>
                     <p>"My dear Miſs Milner, we part friends?—I hope we do?—on my ſide, depend upon it, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret nothing ſo much at this ſhort ſeparation as having ever given you a moment's pain."</p>
                     <p>"I believe ſo," was all ſhe could ſay; for ſhe haſtened to break from him, leſt his diſcerning eye ſhould diſcover the cauſe of the weakneſs which thus overcame her.—But her apprehenſions were groundleſs; the rectitude of his own heart was a bar to the ſuſpicion of her's.—He once more kindly bade her adieu, and the carriage drove away.</p>

Miſs Fenton and Miſs Woodley accompanied Miſs Milner part of the journey, about thirty miles, where they were met by Sir Harry and Lady Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.—Here was a parting nearly as affecting as that between her and her guardian. Miſs Woodley, who for ſeveral weeks had treated her friend with a rigidneſs ſhe herſelf hardly ſuppoſed was in her nature, now bewailed her own ſeverity, begged her forgiveneſs, promiſed to correſpond with her punctually, and to omit no opportunity of giving her every conſolation ſhort of cheriſhing her fatal paſſion; but in that, and that only, was the heart of Miſs Milner to be conſoled.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Miſs Milner arrived at Bath, ſhe thought it the moſt altered place ſhe had ever ſeen—ſhe was miſtaken, it was ſhe herſelf, who was changed.</p>
                     <p>The walks were melancholy, the company inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, the ball-room fatiguing—in fine, ſhe had left behind all that could charm or pleaſe her.</p>
                     <p>Though ſhe found herſelf far leſs happy than when ſhe was at Bath before, yet ſhe felt, ſhe would not, to enjoy all that paſt happineſs, be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the being ſhe was at that time. Thus, does the lover conſider the extinction of his paſſion, with the ſame horror as the libertine looks upon annihilation; the one would rather live hereafter (though in all the tortures with which his future ſtate is deſcribed) than ceaſe to exiſt, ſo there are no tortures a lover would not ſuffer, rather than ceaſe to love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="99" facs="unknown:025650_0102_0FCEB1C2C36A2D10"/>
In the wide proſpect of melancholy before her, Miſs Milner's fancy caught hold of the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which preſented itſelf; and this, ſlender as it was, in the total abſence of every other, her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination pictured as exceſſive. The comfort was a letter from Miſs Woodley—a letter wherein the ſubject of her love would moſt aſſuredly be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and in whatever terms, muſt ſtill be the means of delight.</p>
                     <p>A letter arrived—ſhe devoured it with her eyes.—The poſt-mark on the outſide denoting from whence it came, the name of "Milner Lodge" written on the top, were all ſources of pleaſure—and ſhe read ſlowly every line it contained to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate the pleaſing expectation ſhe enjoyed, till ſhe ſhould arrive at the name of Dorriforth. At laſt her impatient eye, caught the word three lines beyond the place ſhe was reading—irreſiſtibly, ſhe ſkipped over thoſe lines, and fixed on the point to which ſhe was attracted.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was cautious in her indulgence; ſhe made the ſlighteſt mention of Dorriforth, ſaying only, "He was extremely concerned, and even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, at the little hope there was of his couſin, Lord Elmwood's, recovery."—Short and trivia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as this paſſage was, it was ſtill more important to Miſs Milner than any other in the letter—ſhe read it again and again, conſidered, and reflected upon it.—Dejected, thought ſhe, what does that word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly mean?—did I ever ſee Mr. Dorriforth deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—how, I wonder, does he look in that ſtate?—Thus did ſhe muſe, while the cauſe of his dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though a moſt ſerious one, and pathetically deſcribed by Miſs Woodley, ſcarce arreſted her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention once.—She run over with haſte the account of Lord Elmwood's ſtate of health; ſhe certainly pitied him while ſhe thought of him, but ſhe did
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025650_0103_0FCE9F15246CEBB0"/>
not think of him long. To die was a hard fate for a young nobleman juſt in poſſeſſion of his immenſe fortune, and on the eve of marriage with a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young woman; but Miſs Milner thought Heaven might ſtill be better than all this, and ſhe had no doubt but his lordſhip would go there. The forlorn ſtate of Miſs Fenton ought to have been a ſubject for compaſſion, but ſhe knew that lady had reſignation to bear any lot with patience, and that a trial of her fortitude might be more flattering to her vanity than to be Counteſs of Elmwood: in a word, ſhe ſaw nobody's misfortunes equal to her own, becauſe ſhe ſaw no one ſo little able to bear misfortune.</p>
                     <p>She replied to Miſs Woodley's letter, and dwelt very long on that ſubject which Miſs Woodley had taken care to paſs over lightly; this was another indulgence; and to hear from, and to write to her friend, were now the only enjoyments ſhe poſſeſſed. From Bath Miſs Milner paid ſeveral feſtive viſits with Lady Luneham—all were alike tedious and melancholy.</p>
                     <p>But her guardian wrote to her, and though the ſubject was ſorrowful, the letter gave her joy—the ſentiments it expreſſed were but trite and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, yet ſhe valued them as the deareſt effuſions of friendſhip and affection; and her hand trembled, and her heart beat with rapture while ſhe wrote the anſwer, tho' ſhe knew it would not be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with one emotion, ſuch as thoſe which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced. In her ſecond letter to Miſs Woodley ſhe prayed like a perſon inſane to be taken home from confinement, and like a lunatic proteſted, in ſenſible language, ſhe "had no diſorder." But her friend replied, "that very declaration proves its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence." And aſſured her that nothing leſs than placing her affections elſewhere, ſhould induce her to believe, but that ſhe was incurable.</p>

Miſs Woodley's third letter acquainted Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the death of Lord Elmwood—Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was exceedingly affected by this event, and ſaid lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe on any other ſubject.—Miſs Milner was ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when ſhe read the words "he is dead," and inſtantly thought, "How tranſient are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſublunary things!—within a few years I ſhall be dead—and how fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous will it then be, if I have reſiſted every temptation to the deluſive pleaſures of this life!" The happineſs of a peaceful death occupied her contemplation for near an hour; but at length every virtuous and pious ſentiment this meditation inſpired, ſerved but to remind her of the many ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe had heard fall from her guardian's lips upon the ſame ſubject—her thoughts were again fixed on him, and ſhe could think of nothing beſide.</p>
                     <p>In a very ſhort time after, her health became impaired from the indiſpoſition of her mind; ſhe languiſhed, and was once in imminent danger. During a ſlight delirium of her fever, Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's name and her guardian's were repeated inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly; Lady Luneham ſent them immediate word of this, and they both haſtened to Bath, and arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, juſt as her diſorder had taken a moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable turn. As ſoon as ſhe became perfectly recollected, her firſt care was, knowing the frailty of her heart, to inquire what ſhe had uttered while delirious.—Miſs Woodley, who was by her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, begged her not to be alarmed on that account, and aſſured her ſhe knew, from all her attendants, that ſhe had only ſpoken with a friendly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance (as was really the caſe) of thoſe perſons who were dear to her.</p>
                     <p>She wiſhed to know whether her guardian was come to ſee her, but ſhe had not the courage to aſk before Miſs Woodley; and her friend was afraid, by the too ſudden mention of his name, to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:025650_0105_0FCE9F164A58B268"/>
her. Her woman, however, after ſome little time, entered the chamber and whiſpered Miſs Woodley. Miſs Milner aſked inquiſitively "What ſhe ſaid?" and the woman going to her, replied ſoftly, "Lord Elmwood, madam, would wiſh to come and ſee you for a few moments, if you will allow him?" Miſs Milner turned her head, and ſtared wildly.</p>
                     <p>"I thought," ſaid ſhe, "Lord Elmwood had been dead—are my ſenſes diſordered ſtill?"</p>
                     <p>"No, my dear," anſwered Miſs Woodley, "it is the preſent Lord Elmwood who wiſhes to ſee you; he whom you left ill when you came hither is dead."</p>
                     <p>"And who is the preſent Lord Elmwood?" ſhe aſked.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley after a ſhort heſitation replied—"Your guardian."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo he is," cried Miſs Milner, "he is the next heir—I had forgot.—But is it poſſible he is here?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes—" returned Miſs Woodley with a grave voice and manner, to moderate that glow of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which for a moment ſparkled even in her languid eye, and bluſhed over her pallid counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance—"Yes—as he heard you were ill, he thought it right to come and ſee you."</p>
                     <p>"He is very good," anſwered ſhe, and the tears ſtarted in her eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Would you pleaſe to admit his lordſhip?" aſked her woman.</p>
                     <p>"Not yet, not yet," ſhe replied, "let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect myſelf firſt." And ſhe looked with a timid doubt upon her friend, to aſk if it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley could ſcarce ſupport this humble reference to her judgment from the wan face of the

poor invalid, and taking her by the hand, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, in tears, "You ſhall do what you pleaſe."—In a few minutes Lord Elmwood was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe who ſincerely love, every change of ſituation or circumſtances in the object beloved, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears an advantage.—So, the acquiſition of a title and eſtate, was in Miſs Milner's eye an immeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage to her guardian, not on the ſcore of their real value, but any change inſtead of diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her paſſion would have ſerved but to increaſe it—even a change to the utmoſt poverty.</p>
                     <p>When he entered, the ſight of him ſeemed to be too much for her, and after the firſt glance ſhe turned her head away—the ſound of his voice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged her, however, to look once more—and now ſhe rivetted her eyes upon him.</p>
                     <p>"It is impoſſible, my dear Miſs Milner," he gently whiſpered, "to ſay, the joy I feel that your diſorder has ſubſided."</p>
                     <p>But though it was impoſſible to ſay, it was poſſible to <hi>look</hi> what he felt, and his looks expreſſed his feelings.—In the zeal of thoſe ſenſations, he laid hold of her hand, and held it between his—this he himſelf did not know—but ſhe did.</p>
                     <p>"You have prayed for me, my lord, I dare ſay?" ſaid ſhe, with a ſmile of thanks for thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>"Fervently, ardently!"—returned he; and the fervency with which he prayed, ſpoke in every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>"But I am a proteſtant, my Lord, and if I had died ſuch, do you believe I ſhould have gone to Heaven?"</p>
                     <p>"Moſt aſſuredly, that would not have prevented you."</p>

"He muſt; for he means to go there himſelf."</p>
                     <p>To keep her guardian with her, Miſs Milner ſeemed inclined to converſe; but Miſs Woodley perceived the temporal as well as the ſpiritual evil of this, and adviſed his lordſhip to retire.</p>
                     <p>They had only one more interview before he left the place; at which Miſs Milner was capable of ſitting up—he was with her, however, but a very ſhort time, ſome neceſſary concerns relative to the late Lord Elmwood's affairs, calling him in haſte to London. Miſs Woodley continued with her friend till ſhe ſaw her entirely reinſtated in her health: during which time his lordſhip was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſubject of their private converſation; and upon thoſe occaſions Miſs Milner has ſometimes brought Miſs Woodley to acknowledge, "That could Mr. Dorriforth have foreſeen the early death of the late Lord Elmwood, it had been for the greater honour of his religion (conſidering that ancient title would now after him become extinct), had he preferred marriage vows, to thoſe of celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy."</p>

                     <p>WHEN the time for Miſs Woodley to depart arrived, Miſs Milner entreated earneſtly to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her home, and made the moſt ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that ſhe would guard not only her behaviour, but her very thoughts, within the limitation her friend ſhould preſcribe. Miſs Woodley at length yielded thus much, "That as ſoon as Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood was ſet out on his journey to Italy, where ſhe

                        </gap> the ſuppreſſion of her paſſion was the happy reſult, ſhe would at that time take her word, and riſk the danger of their once more reſiding together."</p>
                     <p>With this conceſſion on the ſide of Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley they parted; and as winter was now far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, that lady returned to her aunt's houſe in town, from whence Mrs. Horton was, however, preparing to remove, in order to ſuperintend Lord Elmwood's houſe, (which had been occupied by the late Earl,) in Groſvenor-ſquare; and Miſs Woodley was to accompany her.</p>
                     <p>If Lord Elmwood was not deſirous Miſs Milner ſhould conclude her viſit and return to his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was partly from the multiplicity of affairs in which he was this time engaged, and partly from having Mr. Sandford now entirely placed with him as his chaplain; for he dreaded that living in the ſame houſe their natural antipathy might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to averſion—upon this account he once thought of adviſing Mr. Sandford to take up his abode elſewhere; but the great pleaſure his lordſhip took in his ſociety, joined to the great mortification he knew ſuch a propoſal would be to his friend, would not ſuffer him to make it.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner all this time was not thinking upon thoſe ſhe hated, but on thoſe ſhe loved.—Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford never came into her thoughts, while the image of Lord Elmwood never left them. One morning, as ſhe ſat talking to Lady Luneham on various ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but thinking alone on him; Sir Harry, with another gentleman, a Mr. Fleetmond, came in, and the converſation turned upon the great improbabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025650_0109_0FCE9F1A524A2100"/>
there was, during the preſent Lord Elmwood's youth, that he ſhould ever inherit the title and eſtate that had now fallen to him—and ſaid Mr. Fleetmond, "Independent of the fortune, it muſt be matter of infinite joy to Dorriforth."—"No," anſwered Sir Harry, "independent of the fortune, it muſt be a motive of concern to him; for he muſt now regret, beyond meaſure, his folly in taking prieſt's orders—thus depriving himſelf of the hopes of an heir, by which the title, at his death, will be loſt."</p>
                     <p>"By no means," replied Mr. Fleetmond, "he may yet have an heir, for he will certainly marry."</p>
                     <p>"Marry!" cried Sir Harry.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered the other, "it was that I meant by the joy it might probably give him, beyond the poſſeſſion of his eſtate and title."</p>
                     <p>"How be married?" ſaid Lady Luneham, "Has he not taken a vow never to marry?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered Mr. Fleetmond, "but there are no religious vows, from which the great Pontiff of Rome cannot grant a diſpenſation—thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments made by the church, the church has always the power to diſpenſe withal; and when it is for the general good of religion, his holineſs thinks it incumbent on him, to publiſh his bull to remit all pains and penalties for their non-obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; and certainly it is for the honour of the catholics, that this earldom ſhould continue in a catholic family—In ſhort, I'll lay a wager my Lord Elmwood is married within the twelvemonth.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, who liſtened with attention, feared ſhe was in a dream, or deceived by the pretended knowledge of Mr. Fleetmond, who might know nothing—but on conſideration, all that he had ſaid was very probable; and to confirm its truth, he was himſelf a Roman Catholic, and muſt be well
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025650_0110_0FCEB1CAFAC0D520"/>
informed on the ſubject upon which he ſpoke—If ſhe had heard the direſt news that ever ſounded in the ears of the moſt ſuſceptible of mortals, the agitation of her mind and perſon could not have been ſtronger—ſhe felt, while every word was ſpeaking, a chill through all her veins—it was a pleaſure too exquiſite, not to bear along with it the ſenſation of exquiſite pain; of which ſhe was ſo ſenſible, that for a few moments it cauſed her to wiſh ſhe had not heard the intelligence though, very ſoon after, ſhe would not but have heard it for the world.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as ſhe had recovered from her firſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and joy, ſhe wrote to Miſs Woodley an exact account of what ſhe had heard, and received this anſwer:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>I am ſorry any body ſhould have given you this piece of information, becauſe it was a taſk, in the executing of which, I had promiſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt extreme ſatisfaction—but the fear your health was not ſufficiently returned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, without danger, the burthen of hopes which I knew would, upon this occaſion, preſs upon you, I deferred my pleaſing communication, and I have had it anticipated. Yet, as you ſeem in the utmoſt doubt as to the truth of what you have been told, perhaps this confirmation of it, may fall little ſhort of the firſt news; eſpecially when it is ſtrengthened by my entreating you to come to us, as ſoon as you can with propriety leave Lady Luneham.</p>
                        <p>Come, my dear Miſs Milner, and find in your once rigid monitor, a faithful confident—I will no longer threaten to diſcloſe a ſecret you have truſted me with, but leave it to the wiſdom and ſenſibility of his heart, (who is now to penetrate into the hearts of our ſex, in ſearch of one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant

to his own) to find it out.—I no longer condemn, but congratulate you on your paſſion; and will aſſiſt you with all my advice and earneſt wiſhes, that you may obtain a return.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>This letter was another of thoſe excruciating pleaſures, that nearly reduced Miſs Milner to the grave—it took away from her all appetite to food, and from her eyes the power of being cloſed ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nights—ſhe thought ſo much upon the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of accompliſhing her wiſhes, that ſhe could think of nothing beſide; not even invent a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe for leaving Lady Luneham, before the appointed time, which was yet two months to come. She wrote to Miſs Woodley to beg her contrivance, to reproach her for keeping the ſecret ſo long from her, and to thank her for having revealed it to her in ſo kind a manner at laſt—She begged alſo to be acquainted how Mr. Dorriforth (for ſtill ſhe called him by that name) ſpoke and thought of this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change in his deſtiny.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley's reply was a ſummons for her to town upon ſome pretended buſineſs, which ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided explaining, but which entirely ſilenced her ladyſhip's entreaties for her ſtay.</p>
                     <p>To her queſtion concerning Lord Elmwood ſhe anſwered, "It is a ſubject on which he ſeldom ſpeaks—he appears juſt the ſame he ever did, nor could you by any part of his conduct, conceive that any ſuch change had taken place." Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exclaimed to herſelf "I am glad he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered—if his words, looks, or manners were any thing different from what they formerly were, I ſhould not like him ſo well." And juſt the reverſe would have been the caſe, had Miſs Woodley ſent her word he was changed. The day for her leaving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and when it came, was ſo much indiſpoſed as to be forced to defer her journey for a week.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe found herſelf in London—in the houſe of her guardian—and that guardian no longer bound to a ſingle life, but <hi>enjoined</hi> to marry. He appeared in her eyes, as in Miſs Woodley's, the ſame as ever; or perhaps more endearing than ever, as it was the firſt time ſhe had beheld him with hope.—Mr. Sandford did not appear the ſame; yet he was in reality as ſurly and as diſreſpectful in his behaviour to her as uſual; but ſhe did obſerve, or ſhe did not feel his moroſe temper as heretofore—he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amiable, mild, and gentle; at leaſt ſuch was the happy medium through which ſhe ſaw him now; for good humour, like the jaundice, makes every one of its own complexion.</p>

                     <p>LORD ELMWOOD was preparing to go abroad to receive in form, the diſpenſation from his vows; it was, however, a ſubject he ſeemed carefully to avoid ſpeaking upon; and when by any accident he was obliged to mention it, it was without any marks either of ſatisfaction or concern.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner's pride, for the firſt time, began to take the alarm—while he was Mr. Dorriforth, and confined himſelf to a ſingle life, his indifference to her charms was rather an honourable, than a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful trait in his character, and in reality ſhe admired him for the inſenſibility—but on the eve of being at liberty, and on the eve of making his choice, ſhe was offended that choice was not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately fixed upon her—She had been accuſtomed
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025650_0113_0FCE9F1D09054BB0"/>
to receive the devotion of every man who ſaw her, and not to obtain it of the man from whom, of all others, ſhe moſt wiſhed it, was cruelly humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating.—She complained to Miſs Woodley, who adviſed her to have patience, but that was one of the virtues in which ſhe was the leaſt practiſed.</p>
                     <p>Encouraged, nevertheleſs, by her friend in the commendable deſire of gaining the affections of him, who poſſeſſed all her's; ſhe, however, left no means unattempted to make the conqueſt—but ſhe began with too great certainty of ſucceſs, not to be ſenſible of the deepeſt mortification in the diſappointment—nay, ſhe anticipated a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as ſhe had before anticipated her ſucceſs, and by turns felt the keeneſt emotions from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> and from deſpair.</p>
                     <p>As theſe paſſions alternately governed her, ſhe was alternately in ſpirits or dejected; in good or in ill humour; and the frequent viciſſitudes of her proſpects, at length gave to her behaviour an air of capriciouſneſs, which not all her follies had till now produced.—This was not the way to obtain the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Lord Elmwood; ſhe knew it was not; and before him ſhe was under ſome reſtriction.—Sandford obſerved this, and added to her many other failings, hypocriſy. It was plain to ſee Mr. Sandford eſteemed her leſs and leſs every day; and as he was the perſon who moſt of all influenced the opinion of her guardian, he became to her, very ſoon, an object not merely of diſlike, but of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſentiments for each other, were diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in every word and action while they were in each other's company; but ſtill in his abſence, Miſs Milner's good nature, and little malice, never ſuffered her to utter a ſentence injurious to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.—Sandford's charity did not extend thus far;

and ſpeaking of her with ſeverity one evening while ſhe was at the opera, "His meaning," as he ſaid, "was but to caution her guardian againſt her faults." Lord Elmwood replied,</p>
                     <p>"There is one fault, however, Mr. Sandford, I cannot lay to her charge."</p>
                     <p>"And what is that, my lord?" (cried Sandford eagerly) "What is that one fault, which Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has not?"</p>
                     <p>"I never," replied his lordſhip, "heard Miſs Milner, in your abſence, utter a ſyllable to your diſadvantage."</p>
                     <p>"She durſt not, my lord, becauſe ſhe is in fear of you; and ſhe knows you would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it."</p>
                     <p>"She then," anſwered his lordſhip, "pays me a much higher compliment than you do; for you freely cenſure her, and yet imagine I will ſuffer it."</p>
                     <p>"My lord," replied Sandford, "I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived now, and ſhall never take that liberty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain."</p>
                     <p>As his lordſhip always treated Sandford with the utmoſt reſpect, he began to fear he had been defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient upon this occaſion; and the diſpoſition which had induced him to take his ward's part, was likely, in the end, to prove unfavourable to her; for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sandford was offended at what had paſſed, as the only means of retribution, his lordſhip began himſelf to lament her volatile and captious propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; in which lamentation Sandford, now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his affront, joined with the heartieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, adding,</p>
                     <p>"That you, Sir, having now other cares to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy your thoughts, ought to inſiſt upon her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, or her retiring wholly into the country."</p>

She returned home juſt as this converſation was finiſhed, and Sandford the moment ſhe entered, rung for his candle to retire. Miſs Woodley, who had been at the opera with Miſs Milner, cried,</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, Mr. Sandford, are you not well; you are going to leave us ſo early?"</p>
                     <p>He replied, "No, I have a pain in my head."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, who never heard complaints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſympathy, roſe immediately from her ſeat, ſaying,</p>
                     <p>"I think I never heard you, Mr. Sandford, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of indiſpoſition before—will you accept of my ſpecific for the head-ach? indeed it is a certain relief—I'll fetch it inſtantly."</p>
                     <p>She went haſtily out of the room, and returned with a bottle, which, ſhe aſſured him, "was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Lady Luneham, and would certainly cure him."—And ſhe preſſed it upon him with ſuch an anxious earneſtneſs, that with all his churliſhneſs he could not refuſe taking it.</p>
                     <p>This was but a common-place civility, ſuch as is paid by one enemy to another every day; but the <hi>manner</hi> was the material part—the unaffected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, the attention, the good will, ſhe demonſtrated in this little incident, was that which was remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and which immediately took from Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood the diſpleaſure to which he had been juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excited, or rather transformed it into a degree of admiration. Even Sandford was not inſenſible to her behaviour, and in return, when he left the room, "wiſhed her a good night."</p>
                     <p>To her and to Miſs Woodley, who had not been witneſſes of the preceding converſation, what ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Would you have gone, my lord?" aſked Miſs Milner, highly delighted.</p>
                     <p>"Certainly," returned he, "had you invited me."</p>
                     <p>"Then from this day, my lord, I give you a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral invitation: nor ſhall any other company be admitted, but what you approve."</p>
                     <p>"I am very much obliged to you," anſwered his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"And you," continued ſhe, "who have been only accuſtomed to church-muſick, will be more than any one, enchanted on hearing the ſoft, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſounds of love."</p>
                     <p>"What raviſhing pleaſures are you preparing for me!" returned he, "I know not whether my weak ſenſes will be able to ſupport them."</p>
                     <p>She had her eyes upon him as he ſpoke this, and diſcovered in his, which were fixed upon her, a ſenſibility unexpected—a kind of faſcination, which enticed her to look on, while her eye-lids fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntarily before its mighty force; and a thouſand bluſhes crowded over her face.—He was ſtruck with theſe ſudden ſignals; haſtily recalled his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer countenance, and ſtopt the converſation.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley, who had been a ſilent obſerver for ſome time, now thought a word or two from her, would be acceptable rather than trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                     <p>"And pray, my lord," ſaid ſhe, when do you go to France?"</p>
                     <p>"To Italy, you mean,"—ſaid he, "not at all—my ſuperiors are very indulgent, for they diſpenſe with all my duties.—I ought, and meant, to have gone abroad; but as a variety of concerns require my preſence in England, every neceſſary ceremony has taken place here."</p>
                     <p>"Then your lordſhip is no longer in orders?" ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>

"No, they have been reſigned theſe five days."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I give you joy," ſaid Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>He thanked her, but added with a ſigh, "If I have given up content in ſearch of joy, I ſhall probably be a loſer by the venture.—Soon after this, he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ladies good night, and retired.</p>
                     <p>Happy as Miſs Milner found herſelf in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſhe ſaw him leave the room with infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, becauſe her heart was impatient to give a looſe to its hopes on the boſom of Miſs Woodley.—She bad Mrs. Horton immediately good night, and in her friend's apartment gave way to all the language of the tendereſt paſſion, warm with the confidence of meeting its return.—She deſcribed the ſentiments ſhe had read in Lord Elmwood's looks, and though Miſs Woodley had beheld them too, Miſs Milner's fancy heightened every glance; and her conſtruction became, by degrees, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely favourable to her own wiſhes, that had not her friend been preſent and known in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to eſtimate thoſe ſymptoms; ſhe muſt infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have thought by the joy to which they gave birth, his lordſhip had openly avowed paſſion for her.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley, therefore, thought it her duty to allay thoſe extacies, and repreſented to her, ſhe might be deceived in her hopes—or even ſuppoſing his lordſhip's inclinations tended towards her, there were yet great obſtacles between them.—"Would Sandford, who governed, or at leaſt directed his almoſt every thought and purpoſe, not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted upon this? and if he was, on what, but the moſt romantic affection on the part of Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, had Miſs Milner to depend? and his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not a man to be ſuſpected of ſubmitting to the exceſs of any paſſion." Thus did Miſs Woodley argue, for fear her friend ſhould be miſled by her wiſhes, yet in her own mind ſhe ſcarce har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025650_0118_0FCEB1D1B4140418"/>
a doubt that any thing would thwart them.—The ſucceeding circumſtance proved ſhe was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
                     <p>Another gentleman of family and fortune made overtures to Miſs Milner; and her guardian, ſo far from having his thoughts inclined towards her on his own account, pleaded this lover's cauſe even with more zeal, than he had formerly pleaded for Sir Edward and Lord Frederick; and thus at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed all thoſe plans of happineſs poor Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had meditated.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence, her melancholy humour was now predominant; and for ſeveral days ſhe ſtaid entirely at home, and yet was denied to all her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitants.—Whether this aroſe from pure melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or the ſtill lingering hope of making her conqueſt, by that ſedateneſs of manners ſhe knew her guardian admired, perhaps ſhe herſelf did not know.—Be that as it may, Lord Elmwood could not but obſerve this change, and one morning thought fit to mention, and applaud it.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley and ſhe were working together when he came into the room; and after ſitting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral minutes, and talking upon indifferent ſubjects; to which his ward replied with a dejection in her voice and manner—he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I am wrong, Miſs Milner, but I have obſerved you are lately grown more thoughtful than uſual."</p>
                     <p>She bluſhed, as ſhe always did when the ſubject was herſelf.—He continued, "Your health ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears perfectly reſtored, and yet you do not take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in your former recreations."</p>
                     <p>"Are you ſorry for that, my lord?"</p>
                     <p>"No madam, I am extremely glad; and I was going to congratulate you upon the change—but give me leave to inquire, to what lucky accident we are to attribute this alteration?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="unknown:025650_0119_0FCEB1A300CA31B8"/>
"Your lordſhip then thinks all my commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deeds, ariſe from accident; and that I have no virtues of my own."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, Miſs Milner, I think you have many." This he ſpoke emphatically; and the blood flowed to her face more than at firſt.</p>
                     <p>He reſumed—"How can I doubt of a lady's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, when her countenance gives ſuch evident proofs of them?—believe me, Miſs Milner, that in the midſt of your gayeſt follies; while you thus continue to bluſh, I ſhall reverence your internal ſenſations."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my lord, did you know ſome of them, I am afraid you would think them unpardonable."</p>
                     <p>This was ſo much to the purpoſe, Miſs Woodley found herſelf uneaſy—but ſhe needed not—Miſs Milner loved too ſincerely, to reveal it to the object.—His lordſhip anſwered,</p>
                     <p>"And did you, Miſs Milner, know ſome of mine, you might think them equally unpardonable."</p>
                     <p>She turned pale, and could no longer guide her needle—in the fond tranſports of her heart ſhe imagined, the ſenſations to which he alluded, was his love for her.—She was too much embarraſſed to reply, and he continued,</p>
                     <p>"We have all a great deal to pardon in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and I know not whether the officious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who forces, even his good advice, is not as blameable as the obſtinate one, who will not liſten to it.—And now, having made a preface to excuſe you, ſhould you once more refuſe mine, I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to give it."</p>
                     <p>"My lord," returned ſhe, "I have never yet refuſed to follow your advice, but where my own peace of mind was ſo nearly concerned, as to have made me culpable, had I complied."</p>
                     <p>"Well, madam, I ſubmit to your determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025650_0120_0FCEB1D532E3F828"/>
and ſhall never again oppoſe your inclination to remain ſingle."</p>
                     <p>This ſentence, as it excluded his ever ſoliciting for himſelf, gave her the utmoſt pain; and ſhe caſt a glance of her eye at him full of reproach.—He did not obſerve it, but went on.</p>
                     <p>"Continuing unmarried, it ſeems to have been your father's intention, you ſhould continue under my immediate care; but as I mean for the future to reſide chiefly in the country, anſwer me can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly, do you think you could be happy there, for at leaſt three parts of the year?"</p>
                     <p>After a ſhort heſitation, ſhe replied—"I have no objection."</p>
                     <p>"I am glad to hear it, he returned eagerly, for it is my earneſt deſire to have you with me—your welfare is dear to me as my own; and were we apart, continual apprehenſions would prey upon my mind."</p>
                     <p>The tear ſtarted in her eye, at the earneſtneſs with which this was ſpoken;—he ſaw it, and to ſoften it ſtill more with the ſenſe of his eſteem for her, he increaſed his earneſtneſs, while he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"If you will take the reſolution to quit London for the time I mention, there ſhall be no means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed to make the country all you can wiſh—I ſhall inſiſt upon Miſs Woodley's accompanying you; and it will not only be <hi>my</hi> ſtudy to form ſuch a ſociety as you may approve, but I am certain it will be likewiſe the ſtudy of Lady Elmwood—"</p>
                     <p>He was going on, but as if a poignard had thruſt her heart, ſhe writhed under this unexpected ſtroke.</p>
                     <p>He ſaw her countenance change—he looked at her ſtedfaſtly.</p>
                     <p>It was not a common change from joy to ſorrow, from content to uneaſineſs, which Miſs Milner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered—ſhe felt, and ſhe expreſſed anguiſh.—
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025650_0121_0FCEB1A43B87B730"/>
Lord Elmwood was alarmed and ſhocked.—She did not weep, but ſhe called Miſs Woodley to come to her, with a voice that indicated a degree of agony.</p>
                     <p>"My lord," (cried Miſs Woodley, ſeeing his conſternation, and trembling leſt he ſhould gueſs the ſecret), "My lord, Miſs Milner has again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you—you muſt not take her from London—it is that, which is the cauſe of her uneaſineſs."</p>
                     <p>He ſeemed more amazed ſtill, and ſtill more ſhocked at her duplicity than at her torture.—"Good Heaven," exclaimed he, "how am I to accompliſh her wiſhes? what am I to do? how can I judge, while ſhe will not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She leaned, pale as death, on the ſhoulder of Miſs Woodley, her eyes fixed, with a ſeeming inſenſibility to all that was ſaid, while he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,</p>
                     <p>"Heaven is my witneſs, if I knew—if I could conceive the means how to make her happy, I would ſacrifice my own happineſs to her's."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, cried Miſs Woodley with a ſmile, "perhaps I may call upon you hereafter, to fulfil your word."</p>
                     <p>He was totally ignorant what ſhe meant, nor had he leiſure from the confuſion of his thoughts to reflect upon her meaning; he nevertheleſs replied, with warmth, "Do—you will find I'll perform it.—Do—I will faithfully perform it."</p>
                     <p>Though Miſs Milner was conſcious this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not, in delicacy, ever be brought againſt him; yet the fervent and ſolemn manner in which he made it, cheered her ſpirits; and as perſons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the reflection of having in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the ſide of a table—ſtill ſhe did not ſpeak, but ſeemed overcome with ſorrow.—As her ſituation became, however, leſs alarming; her guardian's pity and affright began to take the colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; and though he did not ſay ſo, he was, and looked highly offended.</p>
                     <p>At this juncture Mr. Sandford entered.—On be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the preſent party, it needed not his ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ſee, at the firſt view, they were all uneaſy; but inſtead of the ſympathy this might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in ſome diſpoſitions, Mr. Sandford, after caſting a look at each of them, appeared in high ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>"You ſeem unhappy, my lord," ſaid he, with a ſmile.</p>
                     <p>"You do <hi>not</hi>—Mr. Sandford," replied his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord, nor would I, were I in your ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,"—returned he. "What ſhould make a man of ſenſe out of temper but a worthy object?"—And he looked at Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"There are no objects unworthy our care," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>"But there are objects on whom all care is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, your lordſhip will allow."</p>
                     <p>"I never yet deſpaired of any one, Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford."</p>
                     <p>"And yet there are perſons, of whom it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, to entertain hopes."—And he looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"Does your head ach, Miſs Milner?" Aſked Miſs Woodley, ſeeing her hold it with her hand.</p>
                     <p>"Very much," returned ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "Did you uſe all thoſe drops Miſs Milner gave you for a pain in the head?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered he, "I did."—But the queſtion at that moment ſomewhat embarraſſed him.</p>

"And I hope you found benefit from them," ſaid Miſs Milner, with great kindneſs, as ſhe roſe from her ſeat, and walked ſlowly and deſpondently out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Though Miſs Woodley followed her, ſo that Mr. Sandford was left alone with Lord Elmwood, and might have continued his unkind inſinuations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one reſtraint; yet his lips were cloſed for the preſent.—He looked down on the carpet—twitched himſelf upon his chair—and began to talk of the weather.</p>

                     <p>AS ſoon as the firſt tranſports of deſpair was over, Miſs Milner ſuffered herſelf to be once more in hope—ſhe found there were no other means to ſupport her life; and to her no ſmall joy, her friend Miſs Woodley was much leſs ſevere on the preſent occaſion than ſhe expected—No engagement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween mortals, was, in Miſs Woodley's opinion, binding like that entered into with heaven; and whatever vows Lord Elmwood had made to another, ſhe juſtly ſuppoſed, no woman's love for him equalled Miſs Milner's—it was prior to all others too, and that eſtabliſhed a claim, at leaſt to contend for ſucceſs; and in a contention, what rival would not fall before her?</p>
                     <p>It was not difficult to gueſs who this rival was; or if they were a little time in ſuſpenſe, Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſoon arrived at the certainty, by inquiring of Mr. Sandford; who, unſuſpicious why ſhe aſked, readily informed her the intended Lady Elmwood, was no other than Miſs Fenton; and that her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:025650_0124_0FCEB1D7B962B838"/>
with his lordſhip would be ſolemnized as ſoon as the mourning for the late Lord Elmwood was expired.—This laſt intelligence made Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſhudder—however, ſhe repeated it to Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, word for word.</p>
                     <p>Happy! happy, woman!" exclaimed Miſs Milner of Miſs Fenton; "ſhe has received the firſt fond impulſes of his heart, and has had the tranſcendent happineſs of teaching him to love!</p>
                     <p>"By no means," returned Miſs Woodley, finding there was no other method to comfort her; "do not ſuppoſe Lord Elmwood's marriage is the reſult of love—it is no more than a duty, a neceſſary piece of buſineſs, and this you may plainly ſee by the wife on whom he has fixed.—Miſs Fenton was thought a proper match for his couſin, and this ſame propriety, you muſt perceive, ſtill exiſts."</p>
                     <p>It was eaſy to convince Miſs Milner all her friend ſaid was truth, for ſhe wiſhed it to be ſo. "And oh!" ſhe exclaimed, "could I but ſtimulate paſſion, in the place of propriety—do you think my dear Miſs Woodley," (and ſhe looked with ſuch begging eyes, it was impoſſible not to anſwer as ſhe wiſhed,) "do you think it would be unjuſt to Miſs Fenton, were I to inſpire her deſtined huſband with a paſſion which ſhe may not have inſpired; and which I believe ſhe herſelf cannot feel?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley pauſed a minute, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "No;"—but there was a heſitation in her manner of delivery—ſhe did ſay, "No," but ſhe looked as if ſhe was afraid ſhe ought to have ſaid "Yes."—Miſs Milner, however, did not wait to give her time to recall the word, or to alter its meaning by adding others to it, but run on eagerly, and declared, "As that was her opinion, ſhe would abide by it, and do all ſhe could to ſupplant her rival."—In order, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to juſtify this determination, and ſatisfy
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:025650_0125_0FCEB1A6F55F1600"/>
the conſcience of Miſs Woodley, they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, Miſs Fenton's heart was not engaged in the intended marriage, and conſequently ſhe was indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent whether it took place or not.</p>
                     <p>Since the death of the late earl, that young lady had not been in town; nor had the preſent lord been near the ſpot where ſhe reſided ſince the week her lover died; of courſe, nothing like love could be declared at ſo early a period; and if it had been made known ſince, it muſt only have been by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or by the deputation of Mr. Sandford, whom they knew had once been in the country to viſit her; but how little he was qualified to enforce a tender paſſion, was a comfortable reflection.</p>
                     <p>Revived with theſe conjectures, of which ſome were true, and others falſe; the very next day a dark gloom overſpread their bright proſpects, on Mr. Sandford's ſaying as he entered the breakfaſt-room,</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fenton, ladies, deſired me to preſent her compliments to you."</p>
                     <p>"Is ſhe in town?" aſked Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"She came to town yeſterday morning," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Sandford, "and is at her brother's, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-ſtreet; my lord and I ſupped there laſt night, and that made us ſo late home."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip entered ſoon after, and confirmed what had been ſaid, by bowing to his ward, and telling her, "Miſs Fenton had charged him with her kindeſt reſpects."</p>
                     <p>"How does poor Miſs Fenton look?" Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton aſked Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>To which queſtion Sandford replied, "Beautiful—ſhe looks beautifully."</p>
                     <p>"She has got over her uneaſineſs, I ſuppoſe then?" ſaid Mrs. Horton—not knowing ſhe was aſking the queſtion before her new lover.</p>
                     <p>Uneaſy!" replied Sandford, "uneaſy at any trial

this world can ſend? that had been highly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of her."</p>
                     <p>"But ſometimes women do fret at ſuch things," replied Mrs. Horton innocently.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood aſked Miſs Milner—"If ſhe meant to ride, this charming day?"</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was heſitating—</p>
                     <p>"There are very different kind of women," (anſwered Sandford, directing his diſcourſe to Mrs. Horton,) "there is as much difference between ſome women, as between good and evil ſpirits."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood aſked Miſs Milner again—"if ſhe took an airing?"</p>
                     <p>She replied, "No."</p>
                     <p>"And beauty," continued Sandford, "when endowed upon ſpirits that are evil, is a mark of their greater, their more extreme wickedneſs.—Lucifer was the moſt beautiful of all the angels in paradiſe—"</p>
                     <p>"How do you know?" ſaid Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"But the beauty of Lucifer," (continued Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, in perfect neglect and contempt of her queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) "was an aggravation of his guilt; becauſe it ſhowed a double ſhare of ingratitude to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Creator of that beauty."</p>
                     <p>"Now you talk of angels," ſaid Miſs Milner, "I wiſh I had wings; and I ſhould like to fly through the park this morning."</p>
                     <p>"You would be taken for an angel in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt," ſaid Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>Sandford was angry at this little compliment, and cried, "Then inſtead of the wings, I would adviſe the ſerpent's ſkin."</p>
                     <p>"My lord," cried ſhe, "does not Mr. Sandford uſe me ill?"—Vext with other things, ſhe felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extremely hurt at this, and made the appeal almoſt in tears.</p>

                     <p>"My lord," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "you promiſed Miſs Milner to accompany her one evening to the opera; this is opera night."</p>
                     <p>"Will you go, my lord?" aſked Miſs Milner, in a voice ſo ſoft, he ſeemed as if he wiſhed, but could not reſiſt it.</p>
                     <p>"I am to dine at Mr. Fenton's to-day," he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "and if he and his ſiſter will go; and you will allow them part of your box, I will promiſe to come."</p>
                     <p>This was a condition that did not pleaſe her, but as ſhe felt a ſtrong deſire to ſee him in the company of his intended bride, (for ſhe fancied ſhe could perceive his moſt ſecret ſentiments, could ſhe once ſee them together) ſhe anſwered not ungraciouſly, "Yes, my compliments to Mr. and Miſs Fenton, and I hope they will favour me with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany."</p>
                     <p>"Then, madam, if they come, you may expect me—elſe not." And he bowed and left the room.</p>
                     <p>All the day was paſſed in anxious expectation by Miſs Milner, what would be the event of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for upon the ſkill of her penetration that evening, all her future proſpects ſhe thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.—If ſhe ſaw by his looks, his words, or aſſiduity, he loved Miſs Fenton, ſhe flattered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhe would never think of him again with hope; but if ſhe obſerved him treat her with inattention or indifference, ſhe meant to cheriſh from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the fondeſt expectations.—Againſt that ſhort

evening her toilet was conſulted the whole day; and the alternate hope and fear which fluttered at her heart, gave a more than uſual brilliancy to her eyes, and more than uſual bloom to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.—But in vain was her beauty; vain all the pains ſhe had taken to decorate that beauty; vain the many looks ſhe caſt towards her box-door to ſee it open; Lord Elmwood did not come.</p>
                     <p>The muſic was diſcord—every thing ſhe ſaw, was diſguſting—in a word, ſhe was miſerable.</p>
                     <p>She longed impatiently for the curtain to drop, becauſe ſhe was uneaſy where ſhe was—yet ſhe aſked herſelf, "Shall I be leſs unhappy at home? yes, at home I ſhall ſee Lord Elmwood, and that will be happineſs—but he will behold me with neglect, and that will be miſery.—Ungrateful man! I will no longer think of him."—She ſaid to herſelf.—Or could ſhe have thought of him without joining in the ſame idea Miſs Fenton, her anguiſh had been ſupportable; but while ſhe pictured them as lovers, the tortures of the rack give but a few degrees more pain than ſhe endured.</p>
                     <p>There are but few perſons who ever felt the real paſſion of jealouſy, becauſe few have felt the real paſſion of love; but to thoſe who have experienced them both, jealouſy not only affects the mind, but every fibre of the frame is a victim to it; and Miſs Milner's every limb ached, with agonizing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while Miſs Fenton, courted and beloved by Lord Elmwood, was preſent to her imagination.</p>
                     <p>The moment the opera was finiſhed, ſhe flew haſtily down ſtairs, as if to fly from the ſufferings ſhe experienced.—She did not go into the coffee-room, though repeatedly perſuaded by Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, but waited at the door till her carriage drew up.</p>
                     <p>Piqued—heart-broken—full of reſentment to the object of her uneaſineſs; as ſhe ſtood inattentive

to all that paſſed, a hand gently laid hold of her's, and the moſt humble and inſinuating voice ſaid, will you permit me to hand you to your carriage?" She was awaked from her reverie, and found Lord Frederick Lawnly by her ſide.—Her heart, juſt then melting with tenderneſs to another, was perhaps more acceſſible than heretofore, or burſting with reſentment, thought this the moment to retaliate. Whatever paſſion reigned that inſtant, it was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the deſires of Lord Frederick, and ſhe looked as if ſhe was glad to ſee him; he beheld this with the rapture and the humility of a lover; and though ſhe did not feel the ſlighteſt love in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſhe felt a gratitude proportionate to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility with which ſhe had been treated by her guardian, and Lord Frederick was not very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous if he miſtook this gratitude for a latent ſpark of affection. The miſtake, however, did not force from him his reſpect: he handed her to her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, bowed lowly and diſappeared. Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley wiſhed to divert her thoughts from the object which could only make her wretched, and as they rode home, by many encomiums upon Lord Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick, endeavoured to incite her to a regard for him; Miſs Milner was diſpleaſed at the attempt, and exclaimed,</p>
                     <p>"What, love a rake, a man of profeſſed gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry? impoſſible.—To me, a common rake is as odious, as a common proſtitute is to a man of the niceſt feelings.—Where can be the pride of inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſſion, fifty others can equally inſpire? or the tranſport of beſtowing favours, where the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is already cloyed by fruition of the ſelf-ſame enjoyments?"</p>
                     <p>"Strange!" cried Miſs Woodley, "that you who poſſeſs ſo many follies incident to your ſex ſhould, in the diſpoſal of your heart, have ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo contrary to women in general."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="127" facs="unknown:025650_0130_0FCEB1DCF9F52498"/>
"My dear Miſs Woodley," returned ſhe, "put in competition the languid love of a debauchee, with the vivid affections of a ſober man, and judge which has the dominion? Oh! in my calendar of love, a ſolemn lord chief juſtice, or a devout arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, ranks before a licentious king."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſmiled at an opinion which ſhe knew half her ſex would laugh at; but by the air of ſincerity with which it was delivered, ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, her late behaviour to Lord Frederick was but the mere effect of chance.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood's carriage drove to his door juſt at the time her's did; Mr. Sandford was with him, and they were both come from paſſing the evening at Mr. Fenton's.</p>
                     <p>"So, my lord," ſaid Miſs Woodley, as ſoon as they met in the apartment, "you did not come to us."</p>
                     <p>"No," anſwered his lordſhip, "I was ſorry; but I hope you did not expect me."</p>
                     <p>"Not expect you, my lord?" cried Miſs Milner, "did you not ſay you would come?"</p>
                     <p>"If I had, I certainly ſhould have come," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, "but I only ſaid ſo conditionally."</p>
                     <p>"That I am witneſs to," cried Sandford, "for I was preſent at the time, and his lordſhip ſaid it would depend upon Miſs Fenton."</p>
                     <p>"And ſhe with her gloomy diſpoſition," ſaid Miſs Milner, "choſe to ſit at home."</p>
                     <p>"Gloomy diſpoſition?" repeated Sandford, "She is a young lady with a great ſhare of ſprightlineſs—and I think I never ſaw her in better ſpirits than ſhe was this evening, my lord?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood did not ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, Mr. Sandford," cried Miſs Milner, "I meant no reflection upon Miſs Fenton's diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; I only meant to cenſure her taſte for ſtaying at home."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="128" facs="unknown:025650_0131_0FCEB1AC47D802C8"/>
"I think," replied Sandford "a much greater cenſure ſhould be paſſed upon thoſe, who prefer rambling abroad."</p>
                     <p>"But I hope, ladies, my not coming," ſaid his lordſhip, "was no cauſe of inconvenience to you; you had ſtill a gentleman with you, or I ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have come."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! yes, two gentlemen," anſwered the young ſon of Lady Evans, a lad from ſchool, whom Miſs Milner had taken along with her, and to whom his lordſhip had alluded.</p>
                     <p>"What two?" aſked Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>Neither Miſs Milner or Miſs Woodley an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                     <p>"You know, madam," ſaid young Evans, "that handſome gentleman who handed you into your carriage, and you called my lord."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! he means Lord Frederick Lawnley," ſaid Miſs Milner careleſsly, but a bluſh of ſhame ſpread over her face.</p>
                     <p>"And did he hand you to your coach?" Aſked his lordſhip, earneſtly.</p>
                     <p>"By mere accident, my lord," Miſs Woodley replied, "for the crowd was ſo great—"</p>
                     <p>"I think, my lord," ſaid Sandford, "it was very lucky you were <hi>not</hi> there."</p>
                     <p>"Had Lord Elmwood been with us, we ſhould not have had occaſion for the aſſiſtance of any other." Said Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"Lord Elmwood has been with you, madam," returned Sandford, "very frequently, and yet—"</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford," ſaid his lordſhip, interrupting him, "it is near bed-time, your converſation keeps the ladies from retiring."</p>
                     <p>"Your lordſhip's does not," ſaid Miſs Milner, "for you ſay nothing."</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe, madam, I am afraid to offend."</p>
                     <p>"But does not your lordſhip alſo hope to pleaſe?
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025650_0132_0FCEB1DEA0A36478"/>
and without riſking the one, it is impoſſible to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the other."</p>
                     <p>"I think, at preſent, the riſk of one would be too hazardous, and ſo I wiſh you a good night." And he went out of the room ſomewhat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.</p>
                     <p>"Lord Elmwood," ſaid Miſs Milner, "is very grave—he does not look like a man who has been paſſing his evening with the woman he loves."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps he is melancholy at parting from her," ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"More likely offended," ſaid Sandford "at the manner in which that lady has ſpoken of her."</p>
                     <p>"Who, I?" cried Miſs Milner, "I proteſt I ſaid nothing but—"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, madam? did you not ſay ſhe was gloomy?"</p>
                     <p>"But, what I thought—I was going to add, Mr. Sandford."</p>
                     <p>"When you think unjuſtly, you ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your thoughts."</p>
                     <p>"Then, perhaps, I ſhould never ſpeak."</p>
                     <p>"And it were better you did not, if what you ſay, is to give pain.—Do you know, madam, that my lord is going to be married to Miſs Fenton?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know that he loves her?"</p>
                     <p>"No;" anſwered Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"How, madam! do you ſuppoſe he does not?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe he does, yet I don't know it."</p>
                     <p>"Then ſuppoſing he does, how can you have the imprudence to find fault with her before him?"</p>
                     <p>"I did not—to call her gloomy, was, I knew, to praiſe her both to him and to you, who admire ſuch tempers."</p>
                     <p>"Whatever her temper is, <hi>every one</hi> admires it; and ſo far from its being what you have deſcribed,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025650_0133_0FCEB1AF5E6C5480"/>
ſhe has a great deal of vivacity which proceeds from the heart."</p>
                     <p>"No, if it proceeded, I ſhould admire it too; but it reſts there, and no one is the better for it."</p>
                     <p>"Come, Miſs Milner," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "it is time to retire; you and Mr. Sandford muſt finiſh your diſpute in the morning."</p>
                     <p>"Diſpute, madam!" ſaid Sandford, I never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with any one beneath a doctor of divinity in my life.—I was only cautioning your friend not to make light of virtues, which it would do her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hour to poſſeſs.—Miſs Fenton is a moſt amiable young woman, and worthy juſt ſuch a huſband as my Lord Elmwood will make her."</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "Miſs Milner thinks ſo—ſhe has a high opinion of Miſs Fenton—ſhe was at preſent only jeſting."</p>
                     <p>"But, madam, jeſts are very pernicious things, when delivered with a malignant ſneer.—I have known a jeſt deſtroy a lady's reputation—I have known a jeſt give one perſon a diſtaſte for another—I have known a jeſt break off a marriage."</p>
                     <p>"But I ſuppoſe there is no apprehenſion of that, in the preſent caſe?" ſaid Miſs Woodley—wiſhing he might anſwer in the affirmative.</p>
                     <p>"Not that I can foreſee," replied he.—"No, Heaven forbid; for I look upon them to be formed for each other—their diſpoſitions, their purſuits, their inclinations the ſame.—Their paſſions for each other juſt the ſame—pure—white as ſnow."</p>
                     <p>"And I dare ſay, not warmer," replied Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>He looked provoked beyond meaſure.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Miſs Milner," cried Miſs Woodley, "how can you talk thus? I believe in my heart you are only envious my lord did not offer himſelf to you."</p>
                     <p>"To her!" ſaid Sandford, affecting an air of
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025650_0134_0FCEB1E2078A09D8"/>
the utmoſt ſurpriſe, "to her? Do you think his lordſhip received a diſpenſation from his vows to become the huſband of a coquette—a—" he was going on.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Mr. Sandford," cried Miſs Milner, "I believe my greateſt crime in your eyes, is being a heretic."</p>
                     <p>"By no means, madam—it is the only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that can apologize for your faults; and had you not that excuſe, there would be none for you."</p>
                     <p>"Then, at preſent, there is an excuſe—I thank you, Mr. Sandford; this is the kindeſt thing you ever ſaid to me. But I am vext to ſee you are ſorry, you have ſaid it."</p>
                     <p>"Angry at your being a heretic?" he reſumed, "Indeed I ſhould be much more concerned to ſee you a diſgrace to our religion."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner had not been in a good humour during the whole evening—ſhe had been provoked to the full extent of her patience ſeveral times; but this harſh ſentence hurried her beyond all bounds, and ſhe aroſe from her ſeat in the moſt violent agitation, and exclaimed, "What have I done to be treated thus?"</p>
                     <p>Though Mr. Sandford was not a man eaſily inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated, he was on this occaſion evidently alarmed; and ſtared about him with ſo ſtrong an expreſſion of ſurpriſe, that it partook in ſome degree of fear.—Miſs Woodley claſped her friend in her arms, and cried with the tendereſt affection and pity, "My dear Miſs Milner, be compoſed."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner ſat down, and was ſo for a minute; but her dead ſilence was nearly as alarming to Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford as her rage had been; and he did not perfectly recover himſelf till he ſaw a flood of tears pouring down her face; he then heaved a ſigh of content that it had ſo ended, but in his heart reſolved never to forget the ridiculous affright into which he had
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025650_0135_0FCEB1B0F0BF4B38"/>
been put.—He ſtole out of the room without ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a ſyllable—But as he never retired to reſt before he had repeated a long form of evening pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo when he came to that part which ſupplicates "Grace for the wicked," he named Miſs Milner's name, with the moſt fervent devotion.</p>

                     <p>AMONG the many ſleepleſs nights Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paſſed, the preſent was not one of them; it is true ſhe had a weight of care upon her heart, even heavier than uſual, but its burthen had overcome her ſtrength; and wearied out with hopes, with fears, and at the end with diſappointment and rage, ſhe ſunk into a profound ſlumber as ſoon as ſhe was laid down—but the more forgetfulneſs had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, the greater was the force of remembrance when ſhe awoke—At firſt, ſo ſound had her ſleep been, ſhe had a difficulty in calling to mind why ſhe was unhappy; but that ſhe was unhappy, ſhe well recollected—and when the cauſe came to her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſhe would have ſlept again, but that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Though her reſt had been ſound, it had not been refreſhing; ſhe was far from well, and ſent word ſo, as an apology for not being preſent at breakfaſt. Lord Elmwood looked concerned when the meſſage was delivered; Mr. Sandford ſhook his head.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner's health is not good," ſaid Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton a few minutes after.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood laid down the newſpaper to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to her.</p>
                     <p>"To me there is ſomething very extraordinary
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025650_0136_0FCEB1E2F3BE0C48"/>
about her," continued Mrs. Horton, finding ſhe had caught his lordſhip's attention.</p>
                     <p>"So there is to me," added Sandford, with a ſarcaſtick ſneer.</p>
                     <p>"And ſo there is to me," ſaid Miſs Woodley, with a moſt ſerious face, and heart-felt ſigh.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood gazed by turns at each, as each delivered their ſentiments—and when they were all ſilent, he looked bewildered, not knowing what judgment to form from any of theſe ſentences.</p>
                     <p>Soon after breakfaſt Mr. Sandford withdrew to his own apartment; Mrs. Horton in a little time went to her's, and Lord Elmwood and Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley were left alone.—His lordſhip immediately roſe from his ſeat, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"I think, Miſs Woodley, Miſs Milner was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to blame, though I did not chooſe to tell her ſo before Mr. Sandford, in giving my Lord Frederick an opportunity of ſpeaking to her; unleſs ſhe means he ſhall renew his addreſſes."</p>
                     <p>"That, I am ſure, my lord," replied Miſs Woodley, "ſhe does not mean—and I aſſure you, my lord, ſeriouſly, it was by mere accident ſhe ſaw him yeſterday evening; or permitted him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her to her carriage."</p>
                     <p>"I am glad to hear it;" he returned quickly; "for although I am not of a ſuſpicious nature, yet in regard to her affection for him, I cannot but have my doubts."</p>
                     <p>"You need have none, my lord," replied Miſs Woodley, with a ſmile of confidence.</p>
                     <p>"And yet you muſt own her behaviour has war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted them—has it not been in this particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent, undefinable, unaccountable!"</p>
                     <p>"The behaviour of a perſon in love, no doubt," ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Don't I ſay ſo?" returned he warmly, "And is not that a juſt reaſon for my ſuſpicions?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:025650_0137_0FCEB1B23B269FB8"/>
"But is there only one man in the world on whom theſe ſuſpicions ſhould fix?" ſaid Miſs Woodley with the colour mounting into her face.</p>
                     <p>"Not that I know of—not one more than I know of," returned he, with aſtoniſhment at what ſhe had inſinuated, and yet with a perfect aſſurance ſhe was in the wrong.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I am miſtaken," replied ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, that is impoſſible too—" returned he with anxiety, "You ſhare her confidence; you are perpetually with her; and provided ſhe did not confide in you, you muſt know, muſt be acquainted with her inclinations."</p>
                     <p>"I believe I am <hi>perfectly</hi> acquainted with them," replied Miſs Woodley, with a ſignificance in her voice and manner which convinced him there was ſome ſecret to learn.</p>
                     <p>After a heſitation;</p>
                     <p>"It is far from me," replied he, "to wiſh to be entruſted with the private ſentiments of thoſe who deſired to with hold them from me, much leſs would I take any unfair means of being informed of them—to aſk any more from you, I believe, would be unfair—yet I cannot but lament, that I am not as well informed as you are.—I wiſh to prove my friendſhip to Miſs Milner, but ſhe will not ſuffer me—and every ſtep I take for her happineſs, I take in the moſt perplexing uncertainty."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſighed, but did not ſpeak.—He ſeemed to wait for her reply, but as ſhe made none, he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"If ever a breach of confidence could be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, I certainly know no occaſion that would ſo juſtly authoriſe ſuch a meaſure as the preſent.—I am not only proper from my character, but from my circumſtances to be relied upon—my intereſt, is ſo nearly connected with the intereſt, and my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs with the happineſs of my ward, that thoſe
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025650_0138_0FCEB1E475A39910"/>
principles as well as my honour, would protect her from every peril ariſing from my being truſted."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my lord," cried Miſs Woodley, with a moſt forcible accent, "<hi>you</hi> are the laſt perſon on earth, ſhe would pardon me for intruſting."</p>
                     <p>"Why ſo?" (ſaid he warmly,) "But that is the way—the perſon who is our friend we miſdoubt—where a common intereſt is concerned, we are aſhamed of drawing on a common danger—Afraid of advice, though that advice is to ſave us.—Miſs Woodley, ſaid he, (changing his voice with exceſs of earneſtneſs) do you believe that I would do any thing to make Miſs Milner happy?"</p>
                     <p>"Any thing in honour, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"She can deſire nothing farther,"—he replied in agitation—"Are her deſires ſo unwarrantable I cannot grant them?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley again did not ſpeak—and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
                     <p>"Great as my friendſhip is, there are certain bounds to it; bounds, that ſhall ſave her in ſpite of herſelf."—And he raiſed his voice.</p>

                     <p>"My lord, Miſs Milner's taſte is not a depraved one; it is but too much refined."</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean by that, Miſs Woodley? you talk myſteriouſly.—Is ſhe not afraid I will thwart her inclinations?"</p>
                     <p>"She is ſure you will, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"Then muſt not the perſon be unworthy of her?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley roſe from her ſeat, the tears trink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down her cheeks, ſhe claſped her hands, and every look, every geſture proved her alternate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and irreſolution of proceeding farther—Lord Elmwood's attention was arreſted before, but now it was fixed in a degree, which her manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"My lord," ſaid ſhe, with a tremulous voice, "promiſe me, declare to me, ſwear to me, it ſhall ever remain a ſecret in your own breaſt, and I will reveal to you, on whom ſhe has placed her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions."</p>
                     <p>This ſolemn preparation made Lord Elmwood tremble; and he ran over inſtantly in his mind all the perſons he could recollect, in order to arrive at the knowledge by thought, quicker than by words.—It was in vain he tried, and he once more turned his inquiring eyes upon Miſs Woodley.—He ſaw her ſilent and covered with confuſion.—Again he ſearched his own thoughts, nor ineffectually as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,—At the firſt glance the object was preſented, and he beheld <hi>himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The rapid emotion of varying paſſions, which immediately darted over his features, informed Miſs Woodley her ſecret was diſcovered—ſhe hid

her face, while the tears that fell down to her boſom, confirmed him in the truth of his ſuggeſtion beyond what oaths could have done.—A ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of ſilence followed, during which ſhe ſuffered tortures for the manner in which he would next ſpeak to her—two ſeconds gave her this reply:</p>
                     <p>"For God's ſake take care what you are doing—you are deſtroying my proſpects of futurity—you are making this world too dear to me."</p>
                     <p>Her drooping head was then lifted up, and as ſhe caught the eye of Dorriforth, ſhe ſaw it beam expectation, amaze, joy, ardour, love.—Nay, there was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ire, a vehemence in the quick faſcinat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rays it ſent forth, ſhe never before had ſeen—it filled her with alarm—ſhe wiſhed him to love Miſs Milner, but to love her with moderation.—Miſs Woodley was too little verſed in the ſubject to know, that, had been, not to love at all; at leaſt not the extent of breaking through engagements, and all the various obſtacles, that ſtill militated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their union.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood was ſenſible of the embarraſſment his preſence gave Miſs Woodley, and underſtood the reproaches which ſhe ſeemed to vent upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſilence.—To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and ſaid, "Do you believe me?"</p>
                     <p>"I do, my lord," ſhe anſwered trembling.</p>
                     <p>"I will make no unjuſt uſe of what I know," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, with firmneſs.</p>

                     <p>"But for what my paſſions now dictate," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "I will not anſwer.—They are confuſed—they are triumphant at preſent.—I have never yet, however, been vanquiſhed by them; and even upon this occaſion, my reaſon ſhall combat to the laſt,—that ſhall fail me, before I do wrong."</p>

He was going to leave the room—ſhe followed him, and cried—"But, my lord, how ſhall I ſee again the unhappy object of my treachery?"</p>
                     <p>"See her," replied he, "as one to whom you meant no injury, and to whom you have done none."</p>
                     <p>"But ſhe would account it ſuch, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"We are not judges of what belongs to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;"—he replied,—"I am tranſported at the tidings you have revealed, and yet, perhaps, I had better never have heard them."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was going to ſay ſomething farther, but as if incapable of attending to her, he haſted out of the room.</p>

                     <p>MISS WOODLEY ſtood for ſome time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider which way ſhe was to go.—The firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe met would inquire, why ſhe had been weeping to that exceſs her eyes were ſcarce diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? and if Miſs Milner was to aſk the queſtion, in what words could ſhe tell, or in what manner deny the truth?—To avoid her, was the firſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhe took the only method; ſhe had a hackney-coach ordered, rode ſeveral miles out of town, and returned to dinner with ſo little remains of her ſwoln eyes, that complaining of the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach was a ſufficient excuſe for them.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner was enough recovered to be preſent at dinner, though ſhe ſcarce taſted a morſel. Lord Elmwood did not dine at home, at which Miſs Woodley rejoiced, but at which Mr. Sandford ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared highly diſappointed.—He aſked the ſervants,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025650_0142_0FCEB1E8A8916810"/>
ſeveral times, "what his lordſhip ſaid when he went out?" they replied, "nothing more than that he ſhould not be at home to dinner."—"I can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine where he dines?" ſaid Sandford.—"Bleſs me, Mr. Sandford, can't you gueſs?" (cried Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who by this time was made acquainted with his intended marriage), "he dines with Miſs Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to be ſure."—"No," replied Sandford, "he is not there; I came from thence juſt now, and they had not ſeen him all day."—Poor Miſs Milner, on this, put a mouthful into her mouth; for where we hope for nothing, we receive ſmall indulgences with joy.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the anxiety and trouble under which Miſs Woodley had laboured all the morning, her heart for many weeks had not felt ſo light as it did this day at dinner—The confidence ſhe repoſed in the promiſes of Lord Elmwood—the firm reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhe had upon his delicacy and his juſtice—the unabated kindneſs with which her friend received her, while no one ſuſpicious thought, ſhe knew, had taken harbour in her boſom—and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous integrity of her own intentions, however ſhe might be miſled by her judgment, all conſpired to comfort her with the hope, ſhe had done nothing ſhe ought to wiſh recalled—But although ſhe felt thus tranquil, in reſpect to what ſhe had divulged, yet ſhe felt a great deal embarraſſed with the dread of next ſeeing Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, not having ſpirits to go abroad, paſſed the evening at home—ſhe read part of a new opera, played upon her guitar, muſed, ſighed, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally talked with Miſs Woodley, and ſo paſſed the tedious hours till near ten, when Mrs. Horton aſked Mr. Sandford to play a game at piquet, and on his excuſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

<pb n="140" facs="unknown:025650_0143_0FCEB1B9083E1798"/>
room—Miſs Milner's countenance immediately brightened, and although ſhe was in a negligent morning dreſs, and looked paler than uſual, ſhe did not look leſs beautiful—Miſs Woodley was leaning on the back of her chair to obſerve the game, and Mr. Sandford ſat reading one of the Greek Fathers at the other ſide of the fire place. Lord Elmwood as he advanced to the table bowed, not having ſeen the ladies ſince morning, or Miſs Milner that day; they returned his ſalute, and he was going up to Miſs Milner, (ſeemingly to inquire of her health,) when Mr. Sandford, laying down his book, ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"My lord, where have you been all day?"</p>
                     <p>"I have been very buſy," replied his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and walking from the card-table, went up to him.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner began to make miſtakes, and play one card for another.</p>
                     <p>"You have been at Mr. Fenton's this evening, I ſuppoſe?" ſaid Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"No, not at all to-day," replied his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"How came that about, my lord?" cried Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner played the ace of diamonds, inſtead of the king of hearts.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall call to-morrow," anſwered his lordſhip, and going with a very ceremonious air up to Miſs Milner, ſaid, "He hoped ſhe was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton begged her "To mind what ſhe was about."</p>
                     <p>"She replied, "I am much better, Sir."</p>
                     <p>He then returned to Sandford again: but never, during all this time, did his eye once encounter Miſs Woodley's, and ſhe, with equal care, avoided his.</p>
                     <p>Some cold diſhes were now brought up for
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025650_0144_0FCEB1E9B861B358"/>
ſupper—Miſs Milner loſt deal, and the game ended.</p>
                     <p>As they were arranging themſelves at the ſupper table, "Do, Miſs Milner," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "have ſomething warm for your ſupper? a chicken boiled? or ſomething of that kind? you have eat nothing all day."</p>
                     <p>With the feeling of humanity, and apparently no other ſenſation—but never did he feel philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy ſo forcibly—Lord Elmwood ſaid, "Let me beg of you, Miſs Milner, to have ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for you?"</p>
                     <p>The earneſtneſs and emphaſis with which theſe few words were pronounced, were more flattering than the fineſt turned compliment had been; her gratitude was expreſſed by bluſhes, and by aſſuring his lordſhip ſhe was now "ſo well as to be able to ſup on what was before her."—She ſpoke, however, and had not made the trial; for the moment ſhe carried a piece to her lips, ſhe laid it on her plate again, and turned paler, from the vain endeavour to force her appetite. Lord Elmwood had ever been attentive to her, but now he watched her as he would a child; and when he ſaw by her ſtruggles ſhe could not eat, he took her plate from her; gave her ſomething elſe; and all with care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his looks, as if he had been a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted boy, and ſhe his darling bird, the loſs of which, would embitter all the joy of his holidays.</p>
                     <p>This attention had ſomething about it ſo tender, ſo officious, and yet ſo ſincere, that it brought the tears into Miſs Woodley's eyes, attracted the notice of Mr. Sandford, and the obſervation of Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, while the heart of Miſs Milner overflowed with a gratitude that gave place to no ſentiment, except her love.</p>
                     <p>To relieve that anxiety her guardian expreſſed, ſhe endeavoured to appear cheerful, and that anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:025650_0145_0FCEB1BC90E33248"/>
at length, really made her ſo.—He now preſſed her to take one glaſs of wine with ſuch ſolicitude, he ſeemed to ſay a thouſand things beſide—Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſtill made his obſervations, and being unuſed to conceal his thoughts, before the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he ſaid, bluntly, "Miſs Fenton was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the other night, my lord, and yet you did not ſeem half ſo anxious about her health."</p>
                     <p>Had Sandford laid all Lord Elmwood's eſtate at Miſs Milner's feet, or preſented her with that eternal bloom which adorns the face of a goddeſs, he would have done leſs to endear himſelf to her, than by that ſingle ſentence—ſhe looked at him with the moſt benign countenance, and felt affliction that ſhe had ever offended him.</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Fenton," (Lord Elmwood replied) "has a brother with her; her health and happineſs are in his care, Miſs Milner's are in mine."</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford," ſaid Miſs Milner, "I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid I behaved very uncivilly to you laſt night; will you accept of an atonement?</p>
                     <p>"No, madam," returned he, "I accept no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation without amendment."</p>
                     <p>"Well then," ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, "ſuppoſe I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe never to offend you again, what then?"</p>
                     <p>"Why then, you'll break your promiſe," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, churliſhly.</p>
                     <p>"Do not promiſe," ſaid Lord Elmwood, "for he means to provoke you to it.</p>
                     <p>In the like converſation the evening was paſſed, and Miſs Milner retired to reſt in far better ſpirits than the morning's proſpect had given her to hope for. Miſs Woodley too, had cauſe to be well pleaſed, but her pleaſure was in a great meaſure eclipſed by the reflection, "there was ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as Miſs Fenton;" ſhe could not but fear, that in doing Miſs Milner a right, ſhe had, perhaps, done that lady a wrong—ſhe wiſhed ſhe had been

equally acquainted with her heart, as ſhe was with Miſs Milner's, and ſhe would then have acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuſtice to either; but Miſs Fenton had of late ſhunned their ſociety, and even in their company ſhe was of a temper too reſerved to diſcover her mind; Miſs Woodley was therefore obliged to act to the beſt of her judgment only, and leave all events to providence.</p>

                     <p>WITHIN a few days, in the houſe of Lord Elmwood, every thing, and every perſon wore a new face.—His lordſhip was the profeſſed lover of Miſs Milner—ſhe, the happieſt of human beings—Miſs Woodley partaking in her joy—while Mr. Sandford was lamenting with the deepeſt concern, that Miſs Fenton had been ſupplanted; and what added moſt poignantly to his ſorrow was, that ſhe had been ſupplanted by Miſs Milner.—Though a church-man, he bore his diſappointment with the impatience of one of the laity; he could hardly ſpeak to Lord Elmwood; he would not look at Miſs Milner, and was diſpleaſed with every body.—It was his intention when he firſt became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Lord Elmwood's reſolution, to quit his houſe; and as his lordſhip had, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt degree of inflexibility, reſiſted all his good counſel and advice upon this ſubject, he reſolved, in quitting him, never to be his adviſer or counſellor again.—But, in preparing to leave his friend, his pupil, his patron, and yet him, who, upon moſt occaſions, implicitly obeyed his will, the ſpiritual got the better of the temporal man, and he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſtay, leſt in totally abandoning him to the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025650_0147_0FCEB1EEF6C42058"/>
purſuit of his own paſſions, he might make his puniſhment even greater than his offence.—"My lord," ſaid he, "on the ſtormy ſea, upon which you are embarked, though you will not ſhun the rocks your faithful pilot would point out, he will, nevertheleſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lord Elmwood liked him ſincerely, and was glad he took this reſolution; yet, as ſoon as his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's reaſon and affections had once told him, he ought to break with Miſs Fenton, and marry his ward, he became ſo decidedly of that opinion, Sandford's never had the moſt trivial weight upon the ſubject, nor would he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>latter the ſuppoſed au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he poſſeſſed over him, by urging him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his houſe a ſingle day, contrary to his inclinations. Sandford beheld, with grief, his firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but finding it vain to contend, ſubmitted—not, however, with a good grace.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt all the perſons affected by this change in Lord Elmwood's marriage deſigns, Miſs Fenton was, perhaps, the leaſt—ſhe would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have married, ſhe was content to live ſingle—Mr. Sandford was the firſt who made overtures to her on the part of Lord Elmwood, and the firſt ſent to aſk her to diſpenſe with the obligation—She received both theſe propoſals with the ſame inſipid ſmile of approbation, and the ſame cold indifference at the heart.</p>
                     <p>It was a perfect knowledge of this diſpoſition in his intended wife, which had given to Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's thoughts, on matrimony, the proſpect of dreary winter; but the ſenſibility of Miſs Milner had now reverſed that proſpect to perpetual ſpring;
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025650_0148_0FCEB1EEF6C42058"/>
or the dearer variety of ſpring, ſummer, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</p>
                     <p>It was a knowledge alſo of this torpor in Miſs Fenton's nature, from which he formed the purpoſe of breaking with her; for Lord Elmwood ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained enough of the prieſt's ſanctity, to have yielded up his own happineſs, and even that of his beloved ward, rather than have plunged one heart into affliction by his perfidy. This, before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his hand to Miſs Milner, he was perfectly convinced would not be the caſe—even Miſs Fenton, herſelf, aſſured him, her thoughts were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards the joys of Heaven than earth; and as this circumſtance would, ſhe believed, induce her to retire to a convent, ſhe thought it a happy, rather than an unhappy event.—Her brother, on whom her fortune devolved, if ſhe took this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, was exactly of her opinion.</p>
                     <p>Loſt in the maze of happineſs which ſurrounded her, Miſs Milner oftentimes aſked her heart, and her heart whiſpered like a flatterer, "Yes." Are not my charms even more invincible than I ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them to be? Dorriforth, the grave, the ſanctified, the anchorite Dorriforth, by their force is animated to all the ardour of the moſt impaſſioned lover—while the proud prieſt, the auſtere guardian, is humbled, if I but frown, into the verieſt ſlave of love.—She then aſked, "Why did I not keep him longer in ſuſpenſe? he could not have loved me more, I believe; but my power over him might have been greater ſtill.—I am the happieſt of women in that affection he has proved to me, but I wonder whether it would exiſt under ill-treatment? if it would not, he does not love me as I wiſh to be loved—if it would, my triumph, my felicity, would be enhanced."—Theſe thoughts were mere phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the brain, and never by ſyſtem put into
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025650_0149_0FCEB2252C8DF9B0"/>
action; but repeatedly indulged, they were practiſed by caſual occurrences; and the dear-bought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of being beloved in ſpite of her faults, (a glory proud women ever aſpire to) was, at preſent, the ambition of Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>Unthinking woman! ſhe did not reflect, that to the ſearching eye of Lord Elmwood ſhe had faults, with her every care to conceal or overcome them, ſufficient to try all his love, and all his patience. But what female is not fond of experiments? to which, how few are there, that do not fall a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice!</p>
                     <p>Perfectly ſecure of the affections of the man ſhe loved, her declining health no longer threatened her; her declining ſpirits returned as before; and the ſuſpicions of her guardian being now changed to the liberal confidence of a doating lover, ſhe now again profeſſed all her former follies, all her faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable levities, and indulged them with leſs reſtraint than ſhe had ever done.</p>
                     <p>For a while, blinded by his paſſion, Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood encouraged and admired every new proof of her reſtored happineſs; nor till ſufferance had tempted her to proceed beyond her uſual bounds, did he remonſtrate.—But ſhe, who as his ward had been ever gentle, and (when he ſtrenuouſly oppoſed) always obedient; he now found as a miſtreſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haughty; and to oppoſition, always inſolent.—He was ſurpriſed, but the novelty pleaſed him.—And Miſs Milner, whom he tenderly loved, could put on no change, or appear in any new character that did not, for the time ſhe adopted it, ſeem to become her.</p>
                     <p>Among the many cauſes of complaint ſhe gave him, want of oeconomy in the diſpoſal of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come was one.—Bills and draughts came upon him without number, while the account, on her part of money expended, amounted but to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

dreſs ſhe ſometimes never wore; toys that were out of faſhion before they were paid for; and charities directed by the force of whim.—Another complaint was, as uſual, extreme late hours, and oftentimes company he did not approve.</p>
                     <p>She was charmed to ſee his love ſtruggling with his cenſure—his politeneſs with his anxiety—and by the light, frivolous, or reſentful manner, in which ſhe treated his admonitions, ſhe triumphed in ſhowing to Miſs Woodley, and, more eſpecially to Mr. Sandford, how much ſhe dared upon the ſtrength of his affections.</p>
                     <p>Every thing in preparation for their marriage, which was to take place at Elmwood-Houſe during the ſummer months, ſhe reſolved for the ſhort time ſhe had to remain in London, to let no occaſion paſs of taſting all thoſe pleaſures which were not likely ever to return; but which, eager as ſhe was in the purſuit, ſhe ſtill placed in no kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with thoſe ſhe hoped would ſucceed; thoſe more ſedate, and far greater joys ſhe had in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic contemplation—and often, merely to haſten on the tedious hours that intervened, ſhe varied and diverted them with the many recreations her intended huſband could not approve.</p>
                     <p>It ſo happened, and it was unfortunate it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lord Elmwood.—His lordſhip knew Sandford's failing was to think ill of Miſs Milner, he pitied him for it, and he pitied her for it—and all the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation his repreſentations gave to her real fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, affection for them both, in the heart of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth, ſtood between every other impreſſion.</p>
                     <p>But facts are glaring; and he at length beheld thoſe faults in their true colours, although pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly pointed out by the prejudice of Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as Sandford perceived his lordſhip's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, "There, my lord!" cried he, exultingly, "Did not I always ſay the marriage was an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per one? but you would not be ruled—you would not ſee."</p>
                     <p>"Can you blame me for not ſeeing," replied his lordſhip, "when you yourſelf were blind?—Had you been diſpaſſionate, had you ſeen Miſs Milner's virtues as well as her faults, I ſhould have believed, and been guided by you—but you ſaw her failings only, and therein have been equally deceived with me, who have only beheld her perfections."</p>
                     <p>"My obſervations, however, my lord, would have been of moſt uſe to you; for I have ſeen what to avoid."</p>
                     <p>"But mine have been the moſt charitable," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his lordſhip, "for I have ſeen—what I muſt always love."</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſighed, and lifted up his hands.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford," reſumed his lordſhip, with a voice and manner ſuch as he puts on, when not all the power of Sandford, or any other, can change his fixed determination, "Mr. Sandford," reſumed he, "my eyes are now open to every failing, as well as to every accompliſhment; to every vice, as well as to every virtue of Miſs Milner's; nor will I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer myſelf to be again prepoſſeſſed in her favour by your prejudice againſt her—for I believe it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion

at your unkind treatment of her, that firſt gained her my heart."</p>
                     <p>"I, my lord?" cried Sandford, "Do not load me with the burthen—with the mighty burthen of your love for her."</p>
                     <p>"Do not interrupt me," ſaid his lordſhip; "Whatever your meaning has been, the effect of your unkindneſs to her, is what I ſay,—Now, I will no longer," continued he, "have an enemy ſuch as you have been to heighten her charms, which are too tranſcendent in their native ſtate, I will hear no more complaints againſt her, but I will watch her cloſely myſelf—and if I find her mind and heart (ſuch as my ſuſpicions have of late whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered) too frivolous for that ſubſtantial happineſs I look for with an object ſo beloved; depend upon my word—the marriage ſhall yet be broken off."</p>
                     <p>"I Depend upon your word; it <hi>will</hi> then," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sandford, eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"You are unjuſt, Sir, in ſaying ſo before the trial," replied his lordſhip, "and your injuſtice ſhall make me more cautious, leſt I follow your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample."</p>
                     <p>"But, my lord—"</p>
                     <p>"My mind is made up, Mr. Sandford," returned he, interrupting him, "I am no longer engaged to Miſs Milner than ſhe ſhall deſerve I ſhould—but in my obſervations I will take care not to wrong her as you have done."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, call my obſervations wrong, when you have reflected upon them as a man, and not as a lover—diveſt yourſelf of your paſſion, and meet me upon equal ground."</p>
                     <p>"I will meet no one—I will conſult no one—my own judgment ſhall be the judge, and in a few months marry, or—<hi>baniſh me from her for ever.</hi>"</p>

There was ſomething in theſe laſt words, in the tone and firmneſs with which they were delivered, that the heart of Sandford reſted upon with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent—they bore the ſymptoms of a menace that would be executed; and he parted from his patron with congratulations upon his wiſdom, and the warmeſt aſſurances of his firm reliance on his <hi>word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood having come to this reſolution, was more compoſed than he had been for ſeveral days before; while the horror of domeſtic wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les—a family without ſubordination—a houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oeconomy—in a word, a wife without diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had been perpetually preſent to his mind.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Sandford, although he was a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, of learning, and a complete caſuiſt; yet, all the faults he himſelf committed, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely—for want of knowing better. He conſtantly reproved faults in others, and he was moſt aſſuredly too good a man not to have corrected and amended his own, had they been known to him—but they were not.—He had been for ſo long a time the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior of all with whom he lived, had been ſo buſied with inſtructing others, he had not recollected he himſelf wanted inſtructions—and in ſuch awe did his ſeverity keep all about him, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had many friends, not one told him of his failings—(except juſt now Lord Elmwood, but who, in this inſtance, as a man in love, he would not credit)—Was there not then ſome reaſon for him to ſuppoſe he had no faults?—his enemies, indeed, hinted, that he had, but enemies he never heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to: and thus, with all his good ſenſe, wanted the ſenſe to follow the rule, <hi>Believe what your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſay of you, rather than what is ſaid by your friends;</hi> this rule attended to, would make many a one amiable that is now the reverſe, and had made him, a perfect upright character.—For could an enemy,

to whom he would have liſtened, whiſper to Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford as he left Lord Elmwood's ſtudy, "Cruel, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous man! you go away with your heart ſatisfied, nay, even elated in the proſpect, that Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's hopes, on which ſhe alone exiſts; thoſe hopes which keep her from the deepeſt affliction, and cheriſh her with joy and gladneſs, will all be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed—you flatter yourſelf it is for the ſake of your friend Lord Elmwood you rejoice; becauſe he has eſcaped a danger—you wiſh him well, but there is another cauſe for your exultation which you will not ſeek to know—it is, that in his ſafety ſhall dwell the puniſhment of his ward.—For ſhame! for ſhame! forgive her faults, as this of your's needs forgiveneſs."</p>
                     <p>Had any one ſaid this, to Sandford, whom he would have credited; or had his own heart ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted it, he was a man of that rectitude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſs, he would have returned immediately to Lord Elmwood, and have endeavoured to ſtrengthen all his favourable opinions of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wife—but having no ſuch monitor as this, he walked on, highly contented, and meeting Miſs Woodley, ſaid, with an air of triumph,</p>
                     <p>"Where's your young lady?—where's Lady Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſmiled, and anſwered—ſhe was gone with ſuch and ſuch ladies to an auction.—"But why give her that title already, Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe," anſwered he, "I think ſhe will never have it."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, Mr. Sandford!" ſaid Miſs Woodley, you ſhock me!"</p>
                     <p>"I thought I ſhould," replied he, "and that is why I tell it you."</p>
                     <p>"For Heaven's ſake, what has happened?" cried ſhe.</p>
                     <p>

"Nothing new—her indiſcretions only."</p>
                     <p>"I know ſhe is imprudent," ſaid Miſs Woodley;</p>
                     <p>"I can ſee ſhe is often to blame—but then my lord ſurely loves her, and love will overlook a great deal."</p>
                     <p>"He does love her—but he has underſtanding and reſolution.—He loved his ſiſter too, tenderly loved her, and yet when he had taken the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; paſſed his word he would never ſee her again; even upon her death-bed he would not retract it—no entreaties could prevail upon him.—And now, though he maintains, and I dare ſay loves her child, yet you remember when you brought him home, he would not bear him in his ſight."</p>
                     <p>"Poor Miſs Milner!—ſaid Miſs Woodley, in the moſt pitying accents.</p>
                     <p>"Nay," ſaid Sandford, "Lord Elmwood has not yet paſſed his word, that he will never ſee her more—he has only threatened to ſay ſo—but I know enough of him, to know his threats are generally the ſame as the actions done."</p>
                     <p>"You are very good," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "to acquaint me of this in time: I may now warn Miſs Milner of it, and ſhe may behave with more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection."</p>
                     <p>"By no means,"—cried Sandford, haſtily, "What would you warn her for?—it will do her no good—beſides," added he, "I don't know whether his lordſhip does not expect ſecreſy from me on this ſubject, and if he does—"</p>
                     <p>"But, with all deference to your opinion," ſaid Miſs Woodley, (and with all deference did ſhe ſpeak) "don't you think, Mr. Sandford, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy upon this occaſion would be wicked? for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the anguiſh it may cauſe my friend, and if by adviſing her we can ſave her from—"She was going on.</p>

"You may call it wicked, madam, not to inform her of it," cried he, but I call a breach of promiſe (if I did give my promiſe, which I don't ſay I did) much more ſinful."</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe you are right; Sir," ſaid Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, with humility; "but if you have given <hi>your</hi> promiſe, I have not given mine, and therefore may divulge"—</p>
                     <p>"There now!" cried Sandford, "there is how you judge of this matter.—You judge of things as they are in reality, not what they are by conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the only way to judge of any thing.—If I did make a promiſe to Lord Elmwood—(which, I again ſay, I don't know that I did)—the promiſe was, that I would not communicate the ſecret; meaning, not tell it to Miſs Milner herſelf.—I have not; and therefore have kept my word—and in revealing it to you, I did it with a full perſuaſion you would conceal it; which confidence, on my part, binds you as much as the moſt ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you could have given."</p>
                     <p>"The fault will be mine, then, not your's, if it comes to the knowledge of Miſs Milner?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly."</p>
                     <p>"Then, as it will be my fault, do not you, Sir, be uneaſy about it."</p>
                     <p>He was going to explain again, but Miſs Milner entered, and put an end to the diſcourſe.—She had been paſſing the whole morning at an auction, and had laid out near two hundred pounds in different things ſhe had no one uſe for; but bought them becauſe they were ſaid to be cheap.—Among the reſt was a lot of books on chemiſtry, and ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin authors.</p>
                     <p>"Why, madam," cried Sandford, looking over the catalogue, where her purchaſes were marked by a pencil, "do you know what you have done? you can't read a word of theſe books."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:025650_0157_0FCEB22C829F3FD8"/>
"Can't I, Mr. Sandford? but I aſſure you, you will be vaſtly pleaſed with them when you ſee how elegantly they are bound."</p>
                     <p>"My dear," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "why have you bought china? you and Lord Elmwood have more now, than you have places to put them in."</p>
                     <p>"Very true, Mrs. Horton—I forgot that—but then you know I can give theſe away."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood was in the room at the concluſion of this converſation—he ſhook his head and ſighed.</p>
                     <p>"My lord," ſaid ſhe, "I have had a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant morning, but I wiſhed for you—if you had been with me I ſhould have bought a great many other things; but I did not like to appear unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in your abſence."</p>
                     <p>"Sandford fixed his inquiſitive eyes upon Lord Elmwood, to obſerve his countenance—his lordſhip ſmiled, but appeared thoughtful.</p>

                     <p>"What, not from me?—very well."</p>
                     <p>"If you preſent me with yourſelf, madam, it is all I aſk."</p>
                     <p>Sandford moved upon his chair, as if he ſat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy.</p>
                     <p>"Why then, Miſs Woodley," ſaid Miſs Milner, "<hi>you</hi> ſhall have the preſent.—But then it won't ſuit you—it is for a gentleman.—I'll keep it and give it to my Lord Frederick the firſt time I meet with him.—I ſaw him this morning, and he looked divinely; I longed to ſpeak to him."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley caſt, by ſtealth, an eye of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion upon Lord Elmwood's face, and trembled to behold it as red as ſcarlet.</p>

                     <p>After a ſhort time—"You all appear very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy," ſaid Miſs Milner; "I wiſh I had not come home yet."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was in agony—ſhe ſaw Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's extreme diſpleaſure, and dreaded leſt he ſhould expreſs it by ſome words he could not recall, or ſhe could not forgive—therefore, whiſpering to her ſhe had ſomething particular to ſay to her, ſhe took her out of the room.</p>
                     <p>The moment ſhe was gone, Mr. Sandford roſe nimbly from his ſeat, rubbed his hands, walked briſkly acroſs the room, then aſked his lordſhip, in a cheerful tone, "Whether he dined at home to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?"</p>
                     <p>That which had given Sandford ſpirits to ſpeak with cheerfulneſs, had depreſſed Lord Elmwood's ſo much, that he fat ſilent and dejected.—At length he anſwered, in a faint voice, "No, I believe I ſhall <hi>not</hi> dine at home."</p>
                     <p>"Where is your lordſhip going to dine?" aſked Mrs. Horton; "I thought you ſhould have had your company to-day; Miſs Milner dines at home, I believe."</p>
                     <p>"I have not yet determined where I ſhall dine," replied he, taking no notice of the concluſion of her ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>"My lord, if you mean to go to the hotel, I'll go with you, if you pleaſe." Cried Sandford, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly.</p>

                     <p>MISS WOODLEY, for the firſt time, diſobeyed the will of Mr. Sandford; and as ſoon as Miſs Milner and ſhe were alone, informed her of all he had revealed to her; accompanying the recital with every teſtimony of ſympathy and affection.—But had the genius of Sandford preſided over this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, it could not have influenced the mind of Miſs Milner to receive the intelligence, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly oppoſite to the intention of the informer. Inſtead of ſhuddering with fear at the menace Lord Elmwood had uttered, ſhe boldly ſaid, ſhe "Dared him to perform it." "He durſt not," repeated ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Why durſt not?" Said Miſs Woodley.</p>

                     <p>Thus ſhe talked on—ſometimes in anger, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times apparently jeſting—till her ſervant came to tell her dinner was ſerved. Upon entering the dining-room, and ſeeing his lordſhip's place at table vacant, ſhe ſtarted back. She was diſappointed of the pleaſure ſhe expected in dining with him; and his ſudden abſence ſo immediately after the intelligence ſhe had received from Miſs Woodley, increaſed her uneaſineſs.—She drew her chair, and ſat down with an indifference, that ſaid ſhe ſhould not eat; and as ſoon as ſhe was ſeated, ſhe put her fingers ſullenly to her lips, nor touched her knife and fork, or ſpoke a word in reply to any thing that was ſaid to her during the whole dinner.—Miſs Woodley and Mrs. Horton were both too well acquainted with the good diſpoſition of her heart, to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or any notice of this behaviour.—They dined, and wiſely ſaid nothing either to provoke or ſooth her.—Juſt as the dinner was going to be removed, a loud rap came at the door—"Who is that?" ſaid Mrs. Horton.—One of the ſervants went to the window, and anſwered, "My lord and Mr. Sandford, madam"—"Come back to dinner, as I live." Cried Mrs. Horton.—</p>

His lordſhip and Sandford entered.</p>
                     <p>"I am glad you are returned, my lord," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "for Miſs Milner would not eat a morſel."</p>
                     <p>"It was becauſe I had no appetite," returned ſhe, bluſhing like crimſon.</p>
                     <p>"We ſhould not have come back," ſaid Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, "but at the place where we went to dine, all the rooms were filled with ſmoke."</p>
                     <p>"It has been a very windy day indeed," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "and one part of this houſe, is now in a ſmother."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood put the wing of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>owl on Miſs Milner's plate, but without previouſly aſking if ſhe choſe any; yet ſhe condeſcended to eat—they ſpoke to each other too in the courſe of converſation, yet it was with a reſerve that appeared as if they had been quarrelling, and ſo felt to themſelves, though no ſuch circumſtance had happened.</p>
                     <p>About two weeks paſſed away in this kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant behaviour on both ſides; without either ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing a direct quarrel, and without either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing (except inadvertently) their ſtrong affection for each other.</p>
                     <p>During this time they were once, however, nearly becoming the deareſt friends in expreſſions, as well as in ſentiments.—This aroſe from a favour he granted in compliance to what he knew was her earneſt deſire; and, as a favour which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to the repeated requeſts of many friends, ſhe could not but eſteem the high value of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
                     <p>She and Miſs Woodley had taken an airing to ſee the poor child, young Ruſhbrook; and on their return, his lordſhip inquiring of the ladies how they had paſſed their morning, Miſs Milner frankly told him; and added, "What pain it gave her to leave

the child behind, as he ſtill cried to come away with her."</p>
                     <p>"Go for him then to-morrow," ſaid his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, "and bring him home."</p>
                     <p>"Home!" ſhe repeated with ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied he, "if you deſire it, this ſhall be his home—you ſhall be a mother, and I will, henceforward, be a father to him."</p>
                     <p>Sandford, who was preſent, looked unuſually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>our at this high token of his lordſhip's regard to Miſs Milner; yet, with reſentment on his face, he wiped a tear of joy from his eye, for the boy's ſake—his frown was the force of prejudice, his tear the force of nature.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook was brought home; and whenever Lord Elmwood wiſhed to ſhow a kindneſs to Miſs Milner, without directing it immediately to her, he took his nephew upon his knee, talked to him, and told him, "He was glad they had become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted."</p>
                     <p>In the various, though delicate, ſtruggles for power between Miſs Milner and her guardian, there was not one perſon witneſs to theſe incidents, who did not ſuppoſe, all would at laſt end in wedlock—for the moſt common obſerver perceived, ardent love was the foundation of every diſcontent, as well, as of every joy they experienced.—One great incident, however, totally reverſed the proſpect of all future accommodation.</p>
                     <p>The faſhionable Mrs. G—gave a maſhed ball; tickets were preſented to perſons of the firſt quality, and among the reſt, three were ſent to Miſs Milner.—She had never been at a maſquerade, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them with extacy—more eſpecially as a maſk being at the houſe of a woman of faſhion, ſhe did not conceive there could be any objection to her going.—She was miſtaken—the moment ſhe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

it to Lord Elmwood, he deſired her, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſternly, "Not to think of being there."—She was vext at the prohibition, but more at the manner in which it was delivered, and flatly ſaid, "She ſhould certainly go."</p>
                     <p>She expected a ſevere rebuke for this, but what alarmed her much more, he never replied a word; but looked with a reſignation which foreboded her more ſorrow, than the ſevereſt reproaches would have done—She ſat for a minute reflecting how to rouſe him from this compoſure—ſhe firſt thought of attacking him with upbraidings; then ſhe thought of ſoothing him; and at laſt of laughing at him.—This was the leaſt ſupportable of all, and yet this ſhe ventured upon.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſure your lordſhip," ſaid ſhe, "with all your ſaintlineſs, can have no objection to my being preſent at the maſquerade, provided I go as a Nun."</p>
                     <p>He made no reply.</p>
                     <p>"That is a habit," continued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Huſh,"—ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Why huſh?" cried Miſs Milner, aloud, though Miſs Woodley had ſpoken in a whiſper, "I am ſure," continued ſhe, "I am only repeating what I have read in books about nuns, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors."</p>
                     <p>"Your conduct, Miſs Milner," replied Lord Elmwood, "gives evident proofs what authors you have read; you may ſpare yourſelf the trouble of quoting them."</p>
                     <p>Her pride was hurt at this, beyond bearing; and as ſhe could not, like him, govern her anger, it fluſhed in her face, and almoſt forced the tears.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="unknown:025650_0164_0FCEB1FDFA7B3CB8"/>
"My lord," ſaid Miſs Woodley, (in a voice ſo ſoft and peaceful, it ought to have calmed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of both,) "ſuppoſe you were to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Miſs Milner? there are tickets for three, and you can then have no objection."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner's brow was immediately ſmoothed; her eye beamed hope; and ſhe fetched a ſigh in anxious expectation he would conſent.</p>
                     <p>"I go, Miſs Woodley?" he replied, with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, "Do you imagine I would play the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon at a maſquerade?"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner's face changed to its former ſtate.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſeen many grave characters, my lord," ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Miſs Woodley," cried Miſs Milner, "why perſuade Lord Elmwood to put on a maſk, juſt at the time he has ſaid it aſide?"</p>
                     <p>His patience now ſeemed to be tempted to its height, and he anſwered, "If you ſuſpect it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, you ſhall find me changed."</p>
                     <p>Pleaſed, ſhe had been able at laſt to irritate him, ſhe ſmiled with a degree of triumph, and in that humour was going to reply; but before ſhe thought of it, he abruptly left the room.</p>
                     <p>She was highly offended at this inſult, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, "From that moment ſhe baniſhed him her heart for ever." And to prove ſhe ſet both his love and anger at defiance, ſhe immediately ordered her chariot, and ſaid, ſhe "was going to ſome of her acquaintance, whom ſhe knew had tickets, and with whom ſhe would fix upon the dreſs ſhe meant to appear in at the maſquerade; for nothing, unleſs ſhe was locked up, ſhould alter the reſolution ſhe had taken, of being there." To remonſtrate at that moment, Miſs Woodley knew would be in vain; the chariot came to the door, and ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She did not return to dinner, nor till late in the evening; Lord Elmwood was at home, but never once mentioned her name.</p>
                     <p>She came home, after he had retired to bed, and in great ſpirits; the firſt time ſhe ever appeared careleſs what he might think of her behaviour:—but her whole thoughts were occupied upon the buſineſs ſhe had been about, and her dreſs engroſſed all her converſation as ſoon as Miſs Woodley and ſhe were alone.—She told Miſs Woodley, ſhe had been ſhown the greateſt variety of beautiful and becoming dreſſes ſhe had ever beheld, and yet, ſaid ſhe, "I have fixed upon a very plain one; but one I look ſo well in, you will hardly know me when I have it on."</p>
                     <p>"You are ſeriouſly then reſolved to go," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "provided you hear no more on the ſubject from your guardian?"</p>
                     <p>"Whether I do or not, Miſs Woodley, I am equally reſolved to go."</p>
                     <p>"But you know, my dear, he has deſired you not—and you uſed always to obey his commands."</p>
                     <p>"As my guardian, I certainly did obey him; and I could obey him as a huſband; but as a lover, I will not."</p>
                     <p>"Yet that is the means never to have him for a huſband."</p>
                     <p>"As he pleaſes—for if he will not ſubmit to be my lover, I will not ſubmit to be his wife—nor has he the affection I require in a huſband."</p>
                     <p>Thus, the old ſentiments were repeated as heretofore, and prevented a ſeparation till towards morning.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, for that night, dreamt leſs of her guardian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the maſquerade. On the evening of the next day it was to be; ſhe was up early, breakfaſted in her dreſſing-room, and remained there moſt of the day, buſied in all the thouſand
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:025650_0166_0FCEB2020A3E3140"/>
preparations for the night; one of which, was to take every particle of powder out of her hair, and have it curled all over in falling ringlets.—Her next care was, that her dreſs ſhould exactly fit, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play her fine perſon to the beſt advantage—it did ſo.—Miſs Woodley entered as it was trying on, and was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at the elegance of the habit, and the beautiful effect it had upon her graceful perſon; but moſt of all, ſhe was aſtoniſhed at her venturing on ſuch a character—for although it was the repreſentative of the goddeſs of Chaſtity, yet from the buſkins, and the petticoat made to feſtoon far above the ankle, it had, on the firſt glance, the appearance of a female much leſs vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.—Miſs Woodley admired the dreſs, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to it; but as ſhe admired at firſt, her objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions after had no weight.</p>
                     <p>"Where is Lord Elmwood?" ſaid Miſs Milner, "he muſt not ſee me."</p>
                     <p>"No, for heaven's ſake," cried Miſs Woodley, "I would not have him ſee you for the univerſe."</p>
                     <p>"And yet," returned the other, with a ſigh, "why am I then thus pleaſed with this dreſs? for I ſhould rather he ſhould admire me than all the world beſide, and yet he is not to ſee me in it."</p>
                     <p>"But he would not admire you thus," ſaid Miſs Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"You had better dreſs at the ladies' houſe with whom you go," ſaid Miſs Woodley; and this was agreed upon.</p>
                     <p>At dinner they learnt, his lordſhip was to go that evening to Windſor, in order to be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the king's hunt, early in the morning; and this intelligence having diſperſed Miſs Milner's fears, ſhe concluded to dreſs at home.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood appeared at dinner in an even, but not in a good temper;—the ſubject of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade was never brought up, or indeed was once
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:025650_0167_0FCEB237B8692D68"/>
in his thoughts; for though he was offended at his ward's behaviour on the occaſion, and thought ſhe committed a fault in telling him, "She would go," yet he never ſuſpected ſhe meant to do ſo, not even at the time ſhe ſaid it, much leſs that ſhe would perſiſt, coolly and deliberately, in ſo direct a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to his will.—She, for her part, flattered herſelf his going to Windſor, was intended in order to give her an opportunity of paſſing the evening as ſhe pleaſed, without his being obliged to know of it, and conſequently to complain.—Miſs Woodley, who was willing to hope as ſhe wiſhed, began to be of the ſame opinion; and, without reluctance, dreſt herſelf as a wood-nymph, to accompany her friend.</p>

"We have been alone the whole evening, my lord," replied Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"Nay," returned he, "I ſaw two chairs, with ſeveral ſervants, come out of the door as I drove up; but what livery I could not diſcern."</p>
                     <p>"We have had no creature here," repeated Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"Nor has Miſs Milner?" aſked he.</p>
                     <p>This brought Mrs. Horton to her recollection, and ſhe cried, "Oh! now I know."—And then checked herſelf as if ſhe knew too much.</p>
                     <p>"What do you know, madam?" ſaid his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſharply.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing,"—ſaid Mrs. Horton, "I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing." And ſhe lifted up her hands and ſhook her head.</p>

                     <p>"Then I know more than I wiſh to know, I am ſure, Mr. Sandford," returned ſhe, ſhrugging up her ſhoulders.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood was all impatience. "Explain, madam, explain," cried he.</p>
                     <p>"Dear my lord," ſaid ſhe, "if your lordſhip will recollect, you may juſt have the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have."</p>

                     <p>"What of that?" ſhe is not gone there?" he cried.</p>
                     <p>"I am not ſure ſhe is," returned Mrs. Horton, "but if your lordſhip ſaw two ſedan chairs going out of this houſe, I cannot but ſuſpect it muſt be Miſs Milner, and my niece, going to the maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip made no anſwer, but rung the bell violently.—A ſervant entered.—Send Miſs Milner's

                     <p>"Nay, my lord," cried Mrs. Horton, "any of the other ſervants could tell you juſt as well, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſs Milner is at home, or gone out."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not," replied he.</p>

                     <p>"Is this the night of the maſquerade?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"I don't know, my lord, upon my word; but, I believe, my lord, it is not."</p>
                     <p>Sandford, as ſoon as Lord Elmwood had aſked the laſt queſtion, run haſtily to the table, at the other ſide of the room, ſnatched ſomething from it, and returned to his place again—and as ſoon as the maid ſaid, "It was not the night of the maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade," he exclaimed, "But it is, my lord, it is—yes it is." And ſhowing a news-paper he held in his hand, pointed to the paragraph which contained the information.</p>
                     <p>"Leave the room," ſaid Lord Elmwood to the woman, "I have done with you."—She withdrew.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, here it is," repeated Sandford, with a paper in his hand.—He then read the paragraph: "<hi>The maſquerade at the honourable Mrs. G—'s this

                     <p>"They ſhould not put ſuch things in the papers," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "to tempt young women to their ruin." The word ruin, ſeemed to grate upon his lordſhip's ear, and he ſaid to the ſervant, who came to wait on him, while he ſupped, "Take the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per away."—He had not attempted to eat, or even ſit down; and he now walked backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the room, loſt in thought and care.</p>
                     <p>A little time after, one of Miſs Milner's footmen came in upon ſome occaſion, and Mr. Sandford ſaid to him, "Pray did you attend your lady to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood ſtopt himſelf ſhort in his walk, and ſaid to the ſervant, "You did?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my lord," replied he.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip walked again.</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould like to know what ſhe was dreſt in," ſaid Mrs. Horton; and turning to the ſervant, "Do you know what your lady had on?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, madam," replied the man, "ſhe was in men's cloaths."</p>
                     <p>"How?" cried Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>"You tell a ſtory to be ſure," ſaid Mrs. Horton to the ſervant.</p>
                     <p>"No," cried Sandford, "I am ſure he does not; for he is an honeſt good young man, and would not tell a lie upon any account,—would you?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood ordered Miſs Milner's woman to be again ſent up.—She came.</p>
                     <p>"In what dreſs did your lady go to the maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade?" Aſked his lordſhip, and with a look ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely moroſe, it ſeemed to command her to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in a word, and to anſwer truly.</p>
                     <p>A mind, with a ſpark of ſenſibility more than ſhe poſſeſſed, could not have equivocated with ſuch
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:025650_0171_0FCEB23D019C8960"/>
an interrogator, but her reply was, "She went in her own dreſs, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"Was it a man's or a woman's dreſs?" Aſked his lordſhip with the ſame commanding look.</p>
                     <p>"Ha, ha, my lord," (half laughing and half crying,) a woman's dreſs to be ſure, my lord."</p>
                     <p>On which Sandford cried,</p>
                     <p>"Call the footman up, and let him confront her."</p>
                     <p>He was called; but Lord Elmwood, now diſguſted with the ſcene, ſat down at the farther end of the room, and left Sandford to queſtion them.</p>
                     <p>With all the authority and conſequence of a country magiſtrate, Sandford with his back to the fire, and the witneſſes before him, began with the footman.</p>
                     <p>"In what dreſs do you ſay, you ſaw your lady, when you attended, and went along with her, to the maſquerade?"</p>
                     <p>"In men's cloaths," replied the man, boldly and firmly as before.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs my ſoul, George, how can you ſay ſuch a thing?" cried the woman.</p>
                     <p>"In what dreſs do <hi>you</hi> ſay ſhe went in?" cried Sandford to her.</p>
                     <p>"In women's cloaths, indeed, Sir."</p>
                     <p>"This is very odd!" ſaid Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"Had ſhe on, or had ſhe not on, a coat?" aſked Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir, a petticoat, replied the woman.</p>
                     <p>"Do <hi>you</hi> ſay ſhe had on a petticoat?" Said Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to the man.</p>
                     <p>"I can't anſwer exactly for that," replied he, "but I know ſhe had boots on."</p>
                     <p>"They were not boots." replied the maid, with vehemence, "indeed, Sir, (turning to Sandford) they were only half boots."</p>
                     <p>"My girl," ſaid Sandford, kindly to her, "your
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:025650_0172_0FCEB2091F3C23B8"/>
own evidence convicts her.—What has a woman to do with <hi>any</hi> boots?"</p>
                     <p>Impatient at this mummery, Lord Elmwood roſe from his ſeat, and ordered the ſervants out of the room; and then looking at his watch, found it was near one. "At what time am I to expect her at home?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not till three in the morning." An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"Three! ſix, more likely." cried Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"I can't wait with patience till that time," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his lordſhip with a moſt anxious ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"You had better go to bed, my lord," ſaid Mrs. Horton, "and by ſleeping, the time will paſs away unperceived."</p>
                     <p>"If I <hi>could</hi> ſleep, madam," returned he.</p>
                     <p>"Will you play a game of cards, my lord?" ſaid Sandford, "for I will not leave you till ſhe comes home; and though I am not uſed to ſit up all night—"</p>
                     <p>"All night," repeated his lordſhip, "ſhe durſt not ſtay all night."</p>
                     <p>"And yet, after going," ſaid Sandford, "in defiance to your commands, I ſhould ſuppoſe ſhe dares?"</p>
                     <p>"She is in good company, at leaſt, my lord," ſaid Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>"She does not know herſelf, what company ſhe is in," replied his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"How ſhould ſhe?" cried Sandford, "where every one hides his face."</p>
                     <p>Till five o'clock in the morning, in ſuch conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as this, the hours paſſed away.—Mrs. Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, indeed, retired to her chamber at two; and left the gentlemen to a graver diſcourſe, but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſtill leſs advantageous to poor Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>She, during this time, was at the ſcene of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:025650_0173_0FCEB23ED37333C8"/>
ſhe had pictured to herſelf, and all the pleaſure it gave her was, that ſhe was ſure ſhe ſhould never deſire to go to a maſquerade again.—The crowd and buſtle fatigued her—the freedom offended her delicacy—and though ſhe perceived ſhe was the firſt object of admiration in the place, yet there was one perſon ſtill wanting to admire; and the remorſe at having tranſgreſſed his injunctions for ſo trivial an entertainment, weighed upon her ſpirits, and added to its wearineſs.—She would have come away ſooner than ſhe did, but ſhe could not, with any degree of good manners, leave the company with whom ſhe went, and not till half after four were they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to return.</p>
                     <p>Day-light juſt peeped through the ſhutters of the room where his lordſhip and Sandford were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when the ſound of her carriage, and its ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtop at the door, cauſed Lord Elmwood as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to ſtart from his ſeat.—He trembled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, and looked pale.—Sandford was aſhamed to ſeem to notice it, yet he could not help aſking him, "To take a glaſs of wine."—He took it—and for once evinced he was reduced ſo low, as to be <hi>glad</hi> of ſuch a reſource.</p>
                     <p>What paſſion thus agitated Lord Elmwood at this criſis, it is hard to define.—Perhaps it was indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Miſs Milner's imprudence, and the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he felt at being on the point of revenge—per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his emotion aroſe from joy, to find ſhe was ſafe—perhaps it was perturbation at the regret he felt that he muſt upbraid her—perhaps it was one alone of theſe ſenſations, but moſt probably, it was them all combined.</p>
                     <p>She, wearied out with the tedious night's diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leſs joyous than melancholy, had fallen aſleep as ſhe rode home, and when the carriage ſtopt, came half aſleep out of it.—"Light me to my bed-chamber inſtantly," ſaid ſhe to her woman,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:025650_0174_0FCEB20A8205CAB0"/>
who waited in the hall to receive her.—But one of Lord Elmwood's valets went up to her, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "Madam, my lord deſires to ſee you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go to bed."</p>
                     <p>"Your lord, man?" cried ſhe, "Is he not out of town?"</p>
                     <p>"No, madam, my lord has been at home ever ſince you went out, and has been ſitting up with Mr. Sandford, waiting for your return."</p>
                     <p>She was wide awake inſtantly.—The heavineſs was removed from her eyes, but fear, grief, and ſhame ſeized upon her heart.—She leaned againſt her woman, as if unable to ſupport herſelf under thoſe feelings, and ſaid to Miſs Woodley:</p>
                     <p>"Make my excuſe—I can't ſee him to-night—I am unfit—indeed I cannot."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was alarmed at the thought of going to him by herſelf, and thus perhaps aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating him ſtill more; ſhe therefore ſaid, "He has ſent for you; for heaven's ſake, do not diſobey him a ſecond time."</p>
                     <p>"No, dear madam," cried her woman, "for he is like a lion—he has been ſcolding me."</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Miſs Milner, (and in a tone that ſeemed pathetic) "Then he is not to be my huſband, after all."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," cried Miſs Woodley, "if you will only be humble, and appear ſorry.—You know your power over him, and all may yet be well."</p>
                     <p>She turned her ſpeaking eyes upon her friend, the tears ſtarting from them, her lips trembling; "Do I not appear ſorry?" ſhe cried.</p>
                     <p>The bell at that moment rung furiouſly, and they mended their pace to the door of the apartment where his lordſhip was.</p>
                     <p>"No, this is only fright,"—replied Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, "Say to him you are ſorry, and beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="unknown:025650_0175_0FCE9F1048ADBDA0"/>
"I cannot," ſaid ſhe, "if Mr. Sandford is with him."</p>
                     <p>The ſervant opened the door, and ſhe and Miſs Woodley went in.—Lord Elmwood by this time was compoſed, and received her with a ſlight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his head; ſhe bowed to him in return, and ſaid, with ſome marks of humility,</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe, my lord, I have done wrong."</p>
                     <p>"You have indeed, Miſs Milner; anſwered he, "but do not ſuppoſe, I mean to upbraid you; I am, moreover, going to releaſe you from any ſuch apprehenſion <hi>for the future.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Thoſe laſt three words he ſpoke with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo ſerious and ſo determined, with an accent ſo firm and ſo decided, they pierced through her heart.—She did not however weep, or even ſigh; but her friend, Miſs Woodley, knowing what ſhe felt, exclaimed, "Oh!" as if for her.</p>
                     <p>She herſelf ſtrove with her anguiſh, and replied, (but with a faultering voice) "I expect as much, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"Then, madam, you may perhaps expect all that I intend?"</p>
                     <p>"In regard to myſelf," ſhe replied, "I ſuppoſe I do."</p>
                     <p>"Then," ſaid he, "you may expect in a few days we ſhall part."</p>
                     <p>"I am prepared for it, my lord," ſhe anſwered, and while ſhe ſaid ſo, ſunk upon a chair.</p>
                     <p>"My lord, what you have to ſay farther," ſaid Miſs Woodley, in tears, "defer till the morning. Miſs Milner, you ſee, is not able to bear it now."</p>
                     <p>"I have nothing to ſay farther," replied he, coolly, "I have now only to act."</p>
                     <p>"Lord Elmwood," cried Miſs Milner, divided between grief and anger, "you think to frighten me by your menaces, but I can part with you; heaven
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:025650_0176_0FCEB20B7861B740"/>
knows I can—your late behaviour has reconciled me to a ſeparation."</p>
                     <p>On this he was going out of the room—but Miſs Woodley, catching hold of him, cried, "Oh! my lord, do not leave her in this ſorrow—pity her weakneſs, and forgive it."—She was proceeding, and he ſeemed inclined to liſten to her, when Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford called out in ſo ſharp a tone,</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Woodley, what do you mean?" ſhe gave a ſtart, and deſiſted.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip turned to Sandford and ſaid, "Nay, Mr. Sandford, you need entertain no doubts of me; I have judged, and have deter—"</p>
                     <p>He was going to ſay determined; but Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who dreaded to hear the word, interrupted the period, and exclaimed, "Oh! could my poor father know the grief, the days of ſorrow, I have experienced ſince his death, how would he repent his fatal choice in a protector!"</p>
                     <p>This ſentence, wherein his friend's memory was recalled, with the additional alluſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                        </gap> and ſecret affection for himſelf, affected Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood much—he was moved, but aſhamed of being ſo; and as ſoon as poſſible, conquered the propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.—Yet, for a ſhort interval, he did not know whether to go out of the room or to remain in it; whether to ſpeak or to be ſilent.—At length he turned towards her and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Appeal to your father in ſome other form, in that (pointing to her dreſs) he will not know you.—Reflect upon him too in your moments of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, and let his idea controul your indiſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—not merely in an hour of contradiction call peeviſhly upon his name, only to wound the deareſt friend you have."</p>
                     <p>There was a degree of truth, and a degree of feeling, in the concluſion of this ſpeech, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed

Sandford, and he caught up one of the candles, and laying hold of his lordſhip's elbow, drew him out of the room, crying, "Come, my lord, come to your bed-chamber, it is very late—it is morning—it is time to riſe." And by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual repetition of theſe words, in a very loud voice, drowned whatever his lordſhip, or any other perſon, might have wiſhed to have ſpoken or heard.—In this manner, Lord Elmwood was taken out of the apartment, and the evening's entertainment concluded.</p>

                     <p>TWO whole days paſſed in the bittereſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe on the part of Miſs Milner, while neither one word or look from Lord Elmwood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the moſt trivial change of thoſe ſentiments he had declared on the night of the maſquerade.—Still thoſe ſentiments, or intentions, were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly delivered; they were more like intimations, than ſolemn declarations—for though he had ſaid, "He would never reproach her <hi>for the future,</hi>" and that "ſhe might expect they ſhould part," he had not poſitively ſaid they ſhould; and upon this doubtful meaning of his words, ſhe hung with the ſtrongeſt agitation of hope, and of fear.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſeeing the diſtreſs of her mind, (much as ſhe endeavoured to conceal it) entreated, nay implored, of her, to permit her to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; to ſuffer her to aſk for a private interview with Lord Elmwood, and provided ſhe found him inflexible, behave with a proper degree of ſpirit in return; but if he appeared not abſolutely averſe to a reconciliation, to offer it to him in ſo cautious a

manner, it might take place without farther uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on either ſide. But Miſs Milner peremptorily forbad this, and acknowledging to her friend every weakneſs ſhe felt on the occaſion, yet concluded with ſolemnly declaring, "That after what had paſſed between her and Lord Elmwood, <hi>he</hi> muſt be the firſt to make a conceſſion, before ſhe herſelf would condeſcend to be reconciled."</p>
                     <p>"I believe, I know Lord Elmwood's temper," replied Miſs Woodley, "and I do not think he will be eaſily induced to beg pardon for a fault, which he thinks you have committed."</p>
                     <p>"Then he does not love me."</p>
                     <p>"Pſhaw! Miſs Milner, this is the old argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—He may love you too well to ſpoil you—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider he is your guardian as well as your lover, he means alſo to become your huſband; and he is a man of ſuch nice honour, he will not give you a ſpecimen of that power before marriage, which he does not intend to ſubmit to hereafter."</p>
                     <p>"But tenderneſs, affection, the politeneſs due from a lover to his miſtreſs, demands this ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and as I now deſpair of enticing, I will oblige him to it—at leaſt I'll make the trial, and know my fate at once."</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean to do?"</p>
                     <p>"Invite my Lord Frederick to the houſe, and aſk my guardian's conſent for our immediate union; you will then ſee, what effect that has upon his pride."</p>
                     <p>"But you will then make it too late for him to be humble.—If you reſolve on this, my dear Miſs Milner, you are undone at once—you may thus hurry yourſelf into a marriage with a man you do not love, and the miſery of your whole future life may be the reſult—Or, would you force Mr. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riforth (I mean Lord Elmwood) to another duel with my Lord Frederick?"</p>

"No, call him Dorriforth—" anſwered ſhe, with the tears ſtealing from her eyes, "I thank you for calling him ſo; for by that name alone, is he dear to me."</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Miſs Milner, with what rapture did you not receive his love, as Lord Elmwood?"</p>
                     <p>"But under that title he has been barbarous; under the firſt, he was all friendſhip and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding Miſs Milner indulged herſelf in all thoſe ſoft bewailings to her friend—before Lord Elmwood ſhe maintained a degree of pride and ſteadineſs which ſurpriſed even him, who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ever thought leſs of her love for him, than any other perſon.—She now began to fear ſhe had gone too far in diſcovering her affection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make trial of a contrary method.—She determined to retrieve that haughty character which had inſpired ſo many of her admirers with paſſion, and take the chance of the effect upon this only one, to whom ſhe ever acknowledged a mutual love.—But although ſhe acted this character well—ſo well, that every one but Miſs Woodley thought her in earneſt—yet, with the niceſt and moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive anxiety, did ſhe watch even the ſlighteſt circumſtance, that might revive her hopes, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm her deſpair. Lord Elmwood's behaviour was calculated to produce the latter—he was cold, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, and perfectly indifferent.—Yet, whatever his manners now were, they did not remove from her recollection what they had been—ſhe recalled, with delight, the ardour with which he had firſt declared his paſſion to her, and the thouſand proofs he had ſince given of its reality.—From the conſtancy of his diſpoſition, ſhe depended a great deal, that thoſe ſentiments were not totally eradicated; and from the extreme deſire, which Mr. Sandford now, more than ever, diſcovered to depreciate her in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's

                     <p>But the reſerve, and indifference ſhe had ſo well aſſumed for a few days, and which might, perhaps, have effected her deſigns, ſhe had not the patience to perſevere in, without calling levity to their aid.—She viſited repeatedly without ſaying where, or with whom—kept later hours than uſual—appeared in the higheſt ſpirits; ſung, laugh'd, and never heaved a ſigh, but when ſhe was alone.</p>

                     <p>Miſs Woodley was extremely uneaſy, and with cauſe; ſhe ſaw her friend was providing herſelf with a weight of cares, ſhe would ſoon find too much for her ſtrength to bear—ſhe would have reaſoned with her, but all her arguments had long ſince proved unavailing.—She ſtrongly wiſhed to ſpeak to Lord Elmwood upon the ſubject, and (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing to her) plead her excuſe; but he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended Miſs Woodley's intention, and evidently ſhunned her.—Mr. Sandford was now the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom ſhe could ſpeak of Miſs Milner, and the delight he took to expatiate on her faults, was more ſorrow to her friend, than not to ſpeak of her at all. She, therefore, ſat a ſilent ſpectator, waiting with dread for that time, when ſhe, who now ſcorned her advice, would fly to her in vain for comfort.</p>
                     <p>Sandford had, however, ſaid one thing to Miſs Woodley, which gave her a ray of hope. During their converſation on this ſubject (not by way of conſolation to her, but as a reproach to Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood),
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025650_0181_0FCEB24601ED7FF0"/>
he one day angrily exclaimed, "And yet, notwithſtanding all his provocation, he has not come to the determination to think no more of her—he lingers and heſitates—I never ſaw him ſo weak upon any occaſion before."</p>
                     <p>This was joyful hearing to Miſs Woodley; ſtill, ſhe could not but reflect, the longer he was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this determination, the more irrevocable it would be, when once taken; and every moment ſhe paſſed, ſhe trembled leſt that ſhould be the moment, in which Lord Elmwood reſolved to baniſh Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from his heart.</p>
                     <p>Among the unpardonable indiſcretions, ſhe was guilty of during this trial upon the temper of her guardian, was the frequent mention of many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who had been her profeſt admirers, and mentioning them with partiality.—Teaſed, if not tortured by this, Lord Elmwood ſtill behaved with a manly evenneſs of temper, and neither appeared provoked on the ſubject, or inſolently careleſs.—In a ſingle inſtance, however, this calmneſs had nearly deſerted him.</p>
                     <p>Entering the drawing-room, one evening, he ſuddenly ſtarted on ſeeing Lord Frederick Lawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley there, in earneſt converſation with Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Horton and Miſs Woodley were indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and Lord Frederick was talking in an audible voice, and upon ſome indifferent ſubjects; but with that impreſſive manner, in which a man never fails to ſpeak to the woman he loves, be the ſubject what it will.—The moment Lord Elmwood ſtarted, which was the moment he entered, Lord Fred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ick aroſe.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, my lord," ſaid Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, "I proteſt I did not know you."</p>
                     <p>"I ought to entreat your lordſhip's pardon," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Lord Frederick, "for this intruſion, which an accident alone has occaſioned. Miſs Milner has
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025650_0182_0FCEB2126718CA00"/>
been nearly overturned, by the careleſsneſs of a lady's coachman, in whoſe carriage ſhe was, and therefore ſuffered me to bring her home in mine."</p>
                     <p>"I hope you are not hurt," ſaid Lord Elmwood to Miſs Milner, but his voice was ſo much affected, by what he felt, he could ſcarcely articulate the words.—Not with the apprehenſion ſhe was hurt, was he thus agitated, for the gaiety of her manner convinced him that could not be the caſe, nor did he indeed ſuppoſe any accident, ſuch as was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had occurred; but the circumſtance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſeeing Lord Frederick had taken him off his guard, and being totally unprepared, he could not conquer thoſe ſigns of ſurpriſe, and the ſhock it had given him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Frederick, who had heard nothing of his intended union with his ward, (for it was even kept a ſecret, at preſent, from every ſervant in the houſe) imputed this diſcompoſure, to the perſonal reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his lordſhip might bear him, in conſequence of their duel; for, notwithſtanding Lord Elmwood had aſſured the uncle of Lord Frederick, (who once waited upon him on the ſubject of Miſs Milner) that all reſentment was, on his part, entirely at an end; and that he was willing to conſent to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's marriage with his nephew, if ſhe herſelf would concur, yet Lord Frederick doubted the ſincerity of this, and would ſtill have had the delicacy not to have entered his lordſhip's houſe, but, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by Miſs Milner, and emboldened by his love. Perſonal reſentment was then the conſtruction he put upon Lord Elmwood's emotion on entering the room, but Miſs Milner and Miſs Woodley knew his agitation to ariſe from a far different cauſe.</p>
                     <p>After his entrance, Lord Frederick did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to reſume his ſeat, but bowing moſt reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to all preſent, took his leave; while Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner followed him, as far as the door, repeating her
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025650_0183_0FCEB2477300DAB0"/>
thanks and gratitude for his protection.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood was hurt beyond meaſure; but he had a ſecond concern, and that was, he had not the power to conceal how much he was affected.—He trembled—when he attempted to ſpeak, he ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered—he perceived his face burning with the blood that had fluſhed to it from confuſion, and thus one confuſion gave birth to another, till his ſtate was pitiable.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner with all her aſſumed gaiety and real inſolence, had not, however, the inſolence to ſeem to obſerve his ſituation; ſhe had only the confidence to obſerve it by ſtealth.—And Mrs. Horton and Miſs Woodley, having opportunely begun a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon ſome trivial occurrences, gave him time to recover himſelf by degrees—yet, ſtill it was merely by degrees, for the impreſſion this incident had made, was deep, and not eaſily to be eraſed.—The entrance of Mr. Sandford, who knew nothing of what had happened, was alſo ſome relief, and his lordſhip and he entered into converſation, which they very ſoon retired into the library to terminate.—Miſs Milner, taking Miſs Woodley with her, went directly to her own apartment, and there exclaimed to her friend, in rapture,</p>
                     <p>"He is mine—he loves me—and he is mine for ever."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley congratulated her upon believing ſo, but confeſſed, ſhe herſelf, "had her fears."</p>
                     <p>"What fears?" cried Miſs Milner, "don't you perceive he loves me?"</p>
                     <p>"I do," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "but that, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſed; and, I think, if he loves you now, he has ſtill the good ſenſe to know, he has cauſe to hate you."</p>
                     <p>"What has good ſenſe to do with love?" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Miſs Milner, "If a lover of mine ſuffers his underſtanding to get the better of his affection—"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="unknown:025650_0184_0FCEB213C5BAFEC8"/>
And the ſame arguments were again going to be repeated, but Miſs Woodley interrupted her, by requiring an explanation of her conduct, not in reſpect to her guardian, but to Lord Frederick; whom, at leaſt, ſhe muſt allow, ſhe was treating with cruelty, if ſhe only made uſe of his affection, to ſtimulate that of Lord Elmwood's.</p>
                     <p>"By no means, my dear Miſs Woodley,"—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhe—"I have, indeed, done with my Lord Frederick from this day; and he has certainly given me the proof I wanted of Lord Elmwood's love; but then, I did not engage him to this, by the ſmalleſt degree of hope.—No, do not ſuſpect me of that, while my heart was another's.—And I aſſure you, ſeriouſly, it was from the circumſtance we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that he came with me home—yet, I muſt own, that had I not had this deſign upon Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's jealouſy in idea, I would have walked on foot through the ſtreets, rather than have ſuffered his rival's civilities.—But he preſſed his ſervices ſo violently, and my Lady Evans (in whoſe chariot I was, when the accident happened) preſſed me ſo violently to accept them, that he cannot expect any farther meaning from my acquieſcence, than my own convenience."</p>

                     <p>Thus ſhe reſolved, and thus ſhe acted.—The ſevereſt judge could not have arraigned her conduct from the day ſhe received Lord Elmwood's letter, to the day of his departure.—She had, indeed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary weakneſſes, but none with which ſhe did not ſtruggle, and in general her ſtruggles were vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
                     <p>The firſt time ſhe ſaw him after the receipt of his letter, was on the evening of the ſame day—ſhe had a little concert of amateurs in muſick, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:025650_0190_0FCEB21841969208"/>
was, herſelf, ſinging and playing when he entered the room; the connoiſſeurs immediately perceived ſhe loſt the tune, but Lord Elmwood was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur in the art, and did not obſerve it.</p>
                     <p>They occaſionally ſpoke to each other during the evening, but the ſubjects were general—and though their manners every time they ſpoke, were perfectly polite, they were not tinctured with the ſmalleſt degree of familiarity.—To deſcribe his behaviour exactly, it was the ſame as his letter, polite, friendly, compoſed, and reſolved.—Some of the company ſtaid ſupper, which prevented the embarraſſment that muſt unavoidably have ariſen, had the family been by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The next morning each breakfaſted in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate apartments—more company dined with them, and in the evening, and at ſupper, Lord Elmwood was from home.</p>
                     <p>Thus all paſſed on as peaceably as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, and Miſs Milner had not betrayed one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of frailty; when, the third day at dinner, ſome gentleman of his acquaintance being at table, one of them ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"And ſo, my lord, you abſolutely ſet off on Tueſday morning?"</p>
                     <p>This was Friday.</p>
                     <p>Sandford and he both replied at the ſame time, "Yes," and Sandford, but not Lord Elmwood, looked at Miſs Milner when he ſpoke.—Her knife and fork gave a ſudden ſpring in her hand, but no other emotion witneſſed what ſhe felt.</p>
                     <p>"Ay, Elmwood," cried another gentleman at table, "you'll bring home, I am afraid, a foreign wife, and that I ſhan't forgive."</p>
                     <p>"It is his errand abroad, I make no doubt," ſaid another viſitor.</p>
                     <p>Before his lordſhip could return an anſwer, Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford cried, "And what objection to a foreigner for

a wife? do not crowned heads all marry foreigners? and who happier in the marriage ſtate than ſome kings?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood directed his eyes to the ſide of the table, oppoſite to that where Miſs Milner ſat.</p>
                     <p>"Nay," (anſwered one of the gueſts, who was a country gentleman) "what do you ſay, ladies—do you think my lord ought to go out of his own nation for a wife?" and he looked at Miſs Milner, for the reply.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley, uneaſy at her friend's being thus forced to give an opinion upon ſo delicate a ſubject, endeavoured to ſatisfy the gentleman, by anſwering to the queſtion herſelf: "Whoever my Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood marries, Sir," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "he, no doubt, will be happy."</p>
                     <p>"But what ſay you, young lady?" aſked the gentleman, ſtill keeping his eyes on Miſs Milner.</p>
                     <p>"That whoever his lordſhip marries, he <hi>deſerves</hi> to be happy," returned ſhe, with the utmoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her voice and looks; for Miſs Woodley, by replying firſt, had given her time to collect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The colour ſlew to Lord Elmwood's face, as ſhe delivered this ſhort ſentence; and Miſs Woodley flattered herſelf, ſhe ſaw a tear ſtart in his eye.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner did not look that way.</p>
                     <p>In an inſtant his lordſhip found means to change the ſubject, but that of his journey ſtill employed the converſation; and what horſes, ſervants, and carriage he took with him, was minutely aſked, and ſo accurately anſwered either by himſelf or by Mr. Sandford, that Miſs Milner, although ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her doom before, till now had received no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial account of it—and as circumſtances add to, or diminiſh all we feel, hearing theſe things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

that time, though Miſs Milner's behaviour ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the ſame, yet her looks and her voice were totally altered—for the world, ſhe could not have looked cheerfully; for the world, ſhe could not have ſpoken with a ſprightly accent; ſhe frequently began in one, but not three words had ſhe uttered, before her tones ſunk into the flatteſt dejection.—Not only her colour, but her features became changed; her eyes loſt their brilliancy, her lips ſeemed to hang without the power of motion, her head drooped, and her dreſs was wholly neglected.—Conſcious of this diſtreſt appearance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the weakneſs from whence it aroſe, it was her deſire to hide herſelf from the only object ſhe could have wiſhed to have charmed.—Accordingly, ſhe ſat alone, or with Miſs Woodley in her own apartment, as much as was conſiſtent with that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility her guardian had requeſted, and which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade her from totally abſenting herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley felt ſo acutely the torments of her friend, that had not her reaſon told her the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible mind of Lord Elmwood was fixed beyond her power to ſhake, ſhe had caſt herſelf at his feet, and implored the return of his affection and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the only means to ſave his once beloved ward from an untimely grave. But her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—her knowledge of Lord Elmwood's firm and immoveable temper; and all his grievous provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—her knowledge of his word, long ſince given to Sandford, "That if once reſolved, he would not recall his reſolution."—The certainty of the many plans that had been arranged for his travels, all agreed to convince her, that by any interference, ſhe only expoſed Miſs Milner's tendereſt love and delicacy to a contemptuous rejection.</p>
                     <p>If the converſation did not every day turn upon the ſubject of Lord Elmwood's departure—a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation he evidently avoided himſelf—yet every

day ſome new preparation for his journey, ſtruck the ear or the eye of Miſs Milner—and had ſhe beheld a frightful ſpectre, ſhe could not have ſhuddered with more horror, than when ſhe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly paſſed his large trunks in the hall, nailed and corded, ready to be ſent off to meet him at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.—At the ſight, ſhe flew from the company that happened to be along with her, and ſtole to the firſt lonely corner of the houſe to conceal her tears—ſhe reclined her head upon her hands, and bedewed them with the ſudden anguiſh that had overcome her.—She heard a footſtep advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſpot where ſhe hoped to have concealed; ſhe lifted up her eyes, and beheld Lord Elmwood.—Pride was the firſt emotion his preſence inſpired—pride, which aroſe from the humility into which ſhe was plunged.</p>
                     <p>She inſtantly ſtifled her tears, and looked at him earneſtly, as if to imply, "What now, my lord?"</p>
                     <p>He only anſwered with a bow, which expreſſed theſe words alone: "I beg your pardon." And immediately withdrew</p>
                     <p>Thus each underſtood the other's language, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either uttering a word.</p>
                     <p>The juſt conſtruction, which ſhe put upon his looks and behaviour upon this occaſion, kept up her ſpirits for ſome little time; and ſhe bleſſed heaven, repeatedly, for the ſingular favour of ſhowing to her, clearly, by this accident, his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of her ſorrows, his total indifference.</p>
                     <p>The next day was the eve of that, on which he was to depart—and the one on which ſhe was to bid adieu to Dorriforth, to her guardian, to Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; to all her hopes at once.</p>
                     <p>The moment ſhe awoke on Monday morning, the recollection, that this was, perhaps, the laſt day ſhe was ever again to ſee him, ſoftened all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:025650_0194_0FCEB21CB5E21528"/>
his yeſterday's conduct had given birth to, and forgetting his auſterity, and all ſhe once term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cruelties; ſhe now only remembered his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, his anxious tenderneſs, and his love.—She was impatient to behold him, and promiſed to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for this laſt day, to neglect no one opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being with him. For that purpoſe ſhe did not breakfaſt in her own room, as ſhe had done for ſeveral mornings before, but went into the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt-room, where all the family generally met.—She was rejoiced on hearing his voice as ſhe opened the door, yet the ſound made her tremble ſo much, ſhe could ſcarcely totter to the table.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley looked at her as ſhe entered, and was never ſo much ſhocked at ſeeing her; for never had ſhe yet ſeen her look ſo ill.—As ſhe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe made an inclination of her head to Mrs. Horton, and then to her guardian, as was her cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, when ſhe firſt ſaw them in a morning—his lordſhip looked in her face as he bowed, then turned his eyes upon the fire place, rubbed his forehead, and began talking with Mr. Sandford.</p>
                     <p>Sandford, during breakfaſt, by accident, caſt his eyes upon Miſs Milner; his attention was caught by her deathly countenance, and he looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly.—He then turned to Lord Elmwood to ſee if he was obſerving her appearance—he was not—and ſo much were her thoughts engaged on him alone, ſhe did not once perceive Sandford gazing at her.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Horton after a little while obſerved, "It was a beautiful morning."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood ſaid, "He thought he heard it rain in the night."</p>
                     <p>Sandford cried, "For his part he ſlept too well to know." And then (unaſked) held a plate of biſcuits to Miſs Milner—it was the firſt civility he had ever in his life offered her; ſhe ſmiled at the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:025650_0195_0FCEB2574A766010"/>
whimſicality of the circumſtance, but took one in return for his attention.—He looked grave beyond his uſual gravity, and yet not with his uſual ill temper. She did not eat what ſhe had ſo politely taken, but laid it down ſoon after.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood was the firſt who roſe from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and did not return to dinner.</p>
                     <p>At dinner, Mrs. Horton ſaid, "She hoped his lordſhip would, however, favour them with his company at ſupper."</p>
                     <p>To which Sandford replied, "No doubt, for you will hardly, any of you, ſee him in the morning; as we ſhall be off by ſix, or ſoon after."</p>
                     <p>Sandford was not going abroad with Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, but was to go with him as far as Dover.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words of his—"<hi>not ſee Lord Elmwood in the morning</hi>"—[never again to ſee him after this evening,] were like the knell of death to Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.—She felt the ſymptoms of fainting, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly ſnatched a glaſs of wine, which the ſervant was holding to Sandford, (who had called for wine) and drank a part of it—As ſhe returned the glaſs to the ſervant, ſhe began to apologize to Mr. Sandford for her ſeeming rudeneſs, but before ſhe could utter what ſhe meant, he ſaid, good-naturedly, "Never mind—you are very welcome—I am glad you took it."—She looked at him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, whether he had really ſpoken kindly, or iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically; but before his countenance could ſatisfy her, her thoughts were away from that trivial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, and again fixed upon Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>The moments ſeemed tedious till he came home to ſupper, and yet, when ſhe reflected for ſo ſhort a time the reſt of the evening would continue, ſhe wiſhed to defer the hour of his return, for months.—At ten o'clock he arrived, and at half after ten the family, without any viſitor, met at ſupper.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner had conſidered, that the period for
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:025650_0196_0FCEB21F052FFCD8"/>
her to counterfeit appearances, was diminiſhed now to a very ſhort one; and ſhe rigorouſly enjoined herſelf not to ſhrink from that little which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.—The certain end, that would be ſo ſoon put to this painful deception, encouraged her to ſtruggle through it with redoubled zeal; and this was but neceſſary, as her weakneſs increaſed.—She therefore liſtened, ſhe talked, and even ſmiled with the reſt of the company, nor did their vivacity ſeem to ariſe from a much leſs compulſive ſource than her own.</p>
                     <p>It was paſt twelve, when Lord Elmwood looked at his watch, and riſing from his ſeat, went up to Mrs. Horton, and taking her hand, ſaid, "Till I ſee you again, madam, I ſincerely wiſh you every happineſs."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner fixed her eyes upon the table before her.</p>
                     <p>"My lord," replied Mrs. Horton, "I ſincerely wiſh you health and happineſs likewiſe."</p>
                     <p>He then went to Miſs Woodley, and taking her hand, repeated much the ſame, as he had ſaid to Mrs. Horton.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner now trembled beyond all power of concealment.</p>
                     <p>"My lord," replied Miſs Woodley, a good deal affected, "I ſincerely hope my prayers for your happineſs may be heard."</p>
                     <p>She and Mrs. Horton were both ſtanding as well as his lordſhip; but Miſs Milner kept her ſeat, till his eye was turned upon her, and he moved ſlowly towards her; ſhe then roſe—and every one who was preſent attentive to what he would now ſay, and how ſhe ſhould receive what he ſaid, caſt their eyes upon them, and liſtened with impatience.—They were all diſappointed—he did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="194" facs="unknown:025650_0197_0FCEB258F05152E0"/>
between his.—He then bowed moſt reſpectfully, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t her.</p>
                     <p>No, "I wiſh you well;—I wiſh you health and happineſs." No "Prayers for bleſſings on her."—Not even the word "farewell," eſcaped his lips—perhaps, to have attempted any of theſe, might have choaked his utterance.</p>
                     <p>She had behaved with fortitude the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhe continued to do ſo, till the moment he turned away from her.—Her eyes then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with tears, and in the agony of her mind, not knowing what ſhe did, ſhe laid her cold hand upon the perſon next to her—it happened to be Sandford; but not obſerving it was him, ſhe graſped his hand with violence—yet he did not ſnatch it away, nor look at her with his wonted ſeverity.—And thus ſhe ſtood, ſilent and motionleſs, while his lordſhip lighted a candle, he took from the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, bowed once more to all the company, and retired.</p>
                     <p>Sandford had ſtill Miſs Milner's hand fixed upon his; and when the door was ſhut after Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, he turned his head to look in her face, and turned it with ſome marks of apprehenſion for the grief he might find there.—She ſtrove to overcome that grief, and after a heavy ſigh, ſat down, as if reſigned to the fate to which ſhe was decreed.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of following Lord Elmwood, as uſual, Sandford poured out a glaſs of wine, and drank it.—A general ſilence enſued for near three minutes.—At laſt turning himſelf round on his ſeat, towards Miſs Milner, who ſat like a ſtatue of deſpair at his ſide, "Will you breakfaſt with us to-morrow?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>She made no anſwer.</p>
                     <p>"We ſhan't breakfaſt before half after ſix," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "I dare ſay; and if you can riſe ſo early—why do."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="195" facs="unknown:025650_0198_0FCEB220A2F81660"/>
"Miſs Milner," ſaid Miſs Woodley, (for ſhe caught, eagerly, at the hope of her paſſing this night in leſs unhappineſs than ſhe had foreboded) "pray riſe at that hour to breakfaſt; Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford would not invite you, if he thought it would diſpleaſe his lordſhip."</p>
                     <p>"Not I," replied Sandford churliſhly.</p>
                     <p>"Then deſire her woman to call her," ſaid Mrs. Horton to Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, ſhe will be awake, I have no doubt," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned her niece.</p>
                     <p>"No;" replied Miſs Milner, "ſince Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood has thought proper to take his leave of me; without even ſpeaking a word; by my own deſire, never will I ſee him again." And here a flood of tears burſt forth, as if her heart burſt at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>"Why did not <hi>you</hi> ſpeak to <hi>him?</hi>" cried Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford—"pray did you bid <hi>him</hi> farewell?—and I don't ſee why one is not as much to be blamed, in that reſpect, as the other."</p>
                     <p>"I was too weak to ſay, I wiſhed him happy;" cried Miſs Milner, "but, Heaven is my witneſs, I do wiſh him ſo from my ſoul."</p>
                     <p>"And do you imagine, he does not wiſh you ſo too?" cried Sandford.—"You ſhould judge him by your own heart; and what you feel for him, imagine he feels for you, my dear."</p>
                     <p>Though "<hi>my dear</hi>" is a trivial phraſe, yet from certain people, and upon certain occaſions, it is a phraſe of infinite comfort and aſſurance.—Mr. Sandford ſeldom ſaid "my dear" to any one; to Miſs Milner never; and upon this occaſion, and from him, it was an expreſſion moſt precious.</p>
                     <p>She turned to him with a look of gratitude; but as ſhe only looked, and did not ſpeak, he roſe up, and ſoon after ſaid, with a friendly tone he had

ſeldom ſpoken with in her preſence, "I ſincerely wiſh you a good night."</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as he was gone, Miſs Milner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "However my fate may have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by the unkindneſs of Mr. Sandford, yet, for that particle of concern he has ſhown for me this night, I will always be grateful to him."</p>
                     <p>"Ay," cried Mrs. Horton, "good Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford may ſhow his kindneſs now, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from its conſequences.—Now his lordſhip is going away for ever, he is not afraid of your ſeeing him once again." And ſhe thought ſhe praiſed him by this ſuggeſtion.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Miſs Milner retired to her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, Miſs Woodley went with her, nor would leave her the whole night—but in vain did ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade her to go to reſt, ſhe abſolutely refuſed; and declared ſhe would never, from that hour, indulge the ſmalleſt repoſe.—"The part I undertook to perform," cried ſhe, "is over; I will now, for my whole life, appear in my own character, and give a looſe to the anguiſh I endure."</p>
                     <p>As day-light ſhowed itſelf, "And yet I might ſee him once again," ſaid ſhe. "I might ſee him within theſe two hours, if I pleaſed, for Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford invited me."</p>
                     <p>"If you think, my dear Miſs Milner," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "that a ſecond parting from Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, would but give you a ſecond agony, in the name of Heaven do not ſee him any more—but, if

you think your mind would be eaſier, were you to bid each other adieu in a more direct manner than you did laſt night, let us go down and breakfaſt with him.—I'll go before, to prepare him for your reception—you ſhall not unexpectedly ſurpriſe him—and I will let him know, it is by Mr. Sandford's invitation you are coming."</p>
                     <p>She liſtened with a ſmile to this propoſal, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the indelicacy of her wiſhing to ſee him, after he had taken his leave—but as Miſs Woodley, nevertheleſs, perceived ſhe was inclined to infringe this delicacy, of which ſhe had ſo proper a ſenſe, ſhe eaſily perſuaded her, it was impoſſible for the moſt ſuſpicious perſon (and Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood was far from ſuch a character) to ſuppoſe, that by paying him a viſit at that period of time, could be with the moſt diſtant idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining his heart, or of altering one reſolution he had taken.</p>
                     <p>In this opinion, Miſs Milner acquieſced, yet ſhe had not the courage to come to the determination ſhe would go.</p>
                     <p>Day-light now no longer peeped; but ſtared broad upon them.—Miſs Milner went to the look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs, breathed upon her hands and rubbed them on her eyes; put ſome powder into her hair; yet ſaid, after all, "I dare not ſee him again."</p>
                     <p>"You may do as you pleaſe," ſaid Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, "but I will. I that have lived for ſo many years under the ſame roof with him, and on the moſt friendly terms, and he going away, perhaps, for theſe ten years, perhaps for ever; I ſhould think it a diſreſpect not to ſee him to the laſt moment of his remaining in the houſe."</p>
                     <p>"Then do you go," ſaid Miſs Milner, eagerly, "and if he ſhould aſk for me, I will gladly come,

you know; but if he does not aſk for me, I will not—and pray do not deceive me"</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley gave her word not to deceive her; and ſoon after, as they heard the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants paſs about the houſe, and the clock had ſtruck ſix, Miſs Woodley went to the breakfaſt-room.</p>
                     <p>She found Lord Elmwood there in his travelling-dreſs, ſtanding penſively by the fire place—and, as he did not dream of ſeeing her, he ſtarted when ſhe entered, and with an appearance of alarm, ſaid, "Dear Miſs Woodley, what's the matter?"—ſhe replied, "Nothing, my lord; but I could not be ſatisfied without ſeeing your lordſhip once again, while I had it in my power."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you," he returned with a ſigh, and the heavieſt and moſt intelligent ſigh ſhe ever heard him condeſcend to give.—She imagined, alſo, he looked as if he wiſhed to aſk how Miſs Milner did, but would not allow himſelf the indulgence.—She was half inclined to mention her to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating in her mind whether ſhe ſhould or not, Mr. Sandford came into the room; ſaying, as he entered,</p>

juſt then, my lord, like Miſs Milner, for ſhe has not been in bed the whole night."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſpoke this in a negligent manner, and yet, Lord Elmwood echoed back the words with ſolicitude and tenderneſs, "Has not Miſs Milner been in bed the whole night?"</p>
                     <p>"If ſhe is up, why does ſhe not come and take ſome coffee?" ſaid Sandford, as he began to pour it out.</p>
                     <p>"If ſhe thought it would be agreeable," returned Miſs Woodley, "I dare ſay ſhe would" And ſhe looked at Lord Elmwood while ſhe ſpoke, though ſhe did not abſolutely addreſs him; but he made no reply.</p>
                     <p>"Agreeable!" returned Sandford, angrily, "Has ſhe then a quarrel with any body here? or does ſhe ſuppoſe any body here hears enmity to <hi>her?</hi>—Is ſhe not in peace and charity?"</p>

                     <p>Miſs Woodley left the room, and found Miſs Milner almoſt in deſpair, leſt ſhe ſhould hear Lord Elmwood's carriage drive off before her friend's return."</p>

of her complexion, ſhe bluſhed to a crimſon.—Lord Elmwood roſe from his ſeat, and brought a chair for her to ſit down.</p>
                     <p>Sandford looked at her inquiſitively, then ſipped his tea, and ſaid, "He never made tea to his own liking."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner took a cup, but had ſcarce ſtrength to hold it.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemed but at a very ſhort time they were at breakfaſt, when the carriage, that was to take his lordſhip away, drove to the door.—Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtarted at the ſound; ſo did he; but ſhe had nearly dropped her cup and ſaucer: on which Sandford took them out of her hand, ſaying,</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps you had rather have coffee?"</p>
                     <p>Her lips moved, but he could not hear what ſhe ſaid.</p>
                     <p>A ſervant came in, and told Lord Elmwood, "the carriage was at the door."</p>
                     <p>He replied, "Very well." But though he had breakfaſted, he did not attempt to move.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, riſing briſkly from his ſeat, as if it was neceſſary to go in haſte, when he did go; he took up his hat, which he had brought with him into the room, and was turning to Miſs Woodley to take his leave, when Sandford cried, "My lord, you are in a great hurry."—And then, as if he wiſhed to give poor Miſs Milner every moment he could, added, (looking about) "I don't know where I have laid my gloves."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip, after repeating to Miſs Woodley his laſt night's farewell, now went up to Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and taking one of her hands, again held it between his, but ſtill without ſpeaking—while ſhe, unable to ſuppreſs her tears as heretofore, ſuffered them to fall in torrents.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="unknown:025650_0204_0FCEB278F8211C30"/>
"What is all this?" cried Sandford, going up to them in anger.</p>
                     <p>They neither of them replied, or changed their ſituation.</p>
                     <p>"Separate this moment,"—cried Sandford—"or reſolve never to be ſeparated but by death."</p>
                     <p>The commanding and awful manner in which he ſpoke this ſentence, made them both turn to him in amazement! and almoſt petrified with the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation his words had cauſed.</p>
                     <p>He left them for a moment, and going to a ſmall book-caſe in one corner of the room, took out of it a book, and returning with it in his hand, ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Lord Elmwood, do you love this woman?"</p>
                     <p>"More than my life," replied his lordſhip, with the moſt heart-felt accents.</p>
                     <p>He then turned to Miſs Milner—"Can you ſay ſay the ſame by him?"</p>
                     <p>She ſpread her hands over her eyes, and cried, "Oh, heavens!"</p>
                     <p>"I believe you <hi>can</hi> ſay ſo;" returned Sandford, "and in the name of God, and your own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſince this is the caſe, let me put it out of your power to part."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood gazed at him with wonder! and yet, as if enraptured with the ſudden appearance of a change in his proſpects.</p>
                     <p>She ſighed with a trembling kind of extacy; while Sandford, with all the pomp and dignity of a clergyman in his official character, delivered theſe words:</p>
                     <p>"My lord, while I thought my counſel might ſave you from the worſt of misfortunes, conjugal ſtrife, I importuned you hourly; and ſet forth your danger in the light it appeared to me.—But though old, and a prieſt, I can ſubmit to think I have been in an error; and I now firmly believe, it is for the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:025650_0205_0FCE9F284E7EE448"/>
welfare of you both, to become man and wife.—My lord, take this woman's marriage vows; you can aſk no fairer promiſes of her reform; ſhe can give you none half ſo ſacred, half ſo binding; and I ſee by her looks ſhe will mean to keep them.—"And, my dear," continued he, addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her, "act but under the dominion of thoſe vows, to a huſband of ſenſe and virtue, like him, and you will be all that I, himſelf, or even Heaven can deſire.—Now then, Lord Elmwood, this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſtrain her by ſuch ties from offending you, ſhe ſhall not <hi>dare</hi> to violate."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood ſtruck his forehead in doubt and agitation; but ſtill holding her hand, he cried, "I cannot part from her."—Then feeling this reply as equivocal, he fell upon his knees, and cried, "Will you pardon my heſitation?—and will you, in marriage, ſhow me that tender love you have not ſhown me yet?—and will you, in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all my affections, bear with all my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!"</p>
                     <p>She raiſed him from her feet, and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her face, the tears with which ſhe bathed his hands, gave him confidence.</p>
                     <p>He turned to Sandford—then placing her by his own ſide, as the form of matrimony requires, gave this as a ſign for Sandford to begin the ceremony.—On which, he opened his book and married them.</p>
                     <p>While with a countenance—manner—and voice ſo ſerious, and ſo fervent, did he perform theſe rites, that the idea of jeſt, or even of lightneſs, was far from the mind of every one preſent.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Milner, covered with ſhame, ſunk on the boſom of Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>When the ring was wanting, Lord Elmwood ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it with one from his own hand, but through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the reſt of the ceremony, appeared loſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

zealous devotion to Heaven—Yet, no ſooner was it finiſhed; than his thoughts ſeemed to deſcend to this world.—He embraced his bride with all the tranſport of the fondeſt, happieſt bride-groom, and in raptures called her by the endearing name of, "wife."</p>
                     <p>"But ſtill, my lord," cried Sandford, "you are only married by your own church and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not by your wife's; or by the law of the land; and let me adviſe you not to defer that marriage long, left in the time you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, and ſhe yet refuſe to become your legal ſpouſe."</p>
                     <p>"I think there is danger," returned his lordſhip, "and therefore our ſecond marriage muſt take place to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>To this the ladies objected, and it was left to Sandford to fix their ſecond wedding, as he had done their firſt.—He, after conſideration, gave four days interval.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley then recollected, (for every one elſe had forgot it) that the carriage was ſtill at the door to convey Lord Elmwood abroad.—It was of courſe diſmiſſed—and one of thoſe great incidents of delight Miſs Milner that morning taſted, was to look out of the window, and ſee this very carriage drive from the door unoccupied.</p>
                     <p>Never was there a more rapid change from deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to happineſs—to happineſs moſt ſupreme—than was that, which Miſs Milner and Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood experienced within one ſingle hour.</p>
                     <p>The few days that intervened between this and their legal marriage, were paſſed in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful care of preparing for that happy day—yet, with all its delights inferior to the firſt; when every joy was doubled by the expected ſorrow.</p>

again; even on that <hi>very</hi> day, after the ſacred ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony was over, Miſs Milner—(with all the fears, the tremors, the ſuperſtition of her ſex)—felt an excruciating ſhock; when, looking on the ring Lord Elmwood had put upon her finger, in haſte, when he married her, ſhe perceived it was a MOURNING RING.</p>

has ſeen or heard of any of thoſe perſons, who in the foregoing volume have been introduced to his acquaintance—and now, ſuppoſing himſelf at the period of thoſe ſeventeen years, follow the ſequel of their hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>To begin with the firſt female object of this ſtory.—The beautiful, the beloved Miſs Milner—ſhe is no longer beautiful—no longer beloved—no longer—tremble while you read it!—no longer—virtuous.</p>
                     <p>Dorriforth, the pious, the good, the tender Dorriforth, is become a hard-hearted tyrant. The compaſſionate, the feeling, the juſt Lord Elmwood, an example of implacable rigour and injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley is grown old, but leſs with years than grief.</p>
                     <p>The child Ruſhbrook is become a man, and the apparent heir of Lord Elmwood's fortune; while his own daughter, his only child by his once adored Miſs Milner, he refuſes ever to ſee again, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to her mother's crimes.</p>
                     <p>The leaſt wonderful change, is the death of Mrs. Horton. Except</p>
                     <p>Sandford, who remains much the ſame as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
                     <p>We left Lady Elmwood in the laſt volume at the ſummit of human happineſs; a loving and beloved bride.—We begin this volume and find her upon her death-bed.</p>
                     <p>At thirty-five, her "Courſe was run,"—a courſe full of perils, of hopes, of fears, of joys, and at the end of ſorrows; all exquiſite of their kind, for exquiſite were the feelings of her ſuſceptible heart.</p>
                     <p>At the commencement of this ſtory, her father is deſcribed in the laſt moments of his life, with all his cares fixed upon her, his only child—how vain thoſe cares! how vain every precaution that was taken for her welfare! She knows, ſhe reflects
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:025650_0211_0FCEB28133C301D0"/>
upon this; and yet, torn by that inſtinctive power which a parent feels, Lady Elmwood on her dying day has no worldly thought, but that of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of <hi>her</hi> only child.—To every other proſpect before her, "Thy will be done" is her continual exclamation; but where the miſery of her daughter preſents itſelf, the dying penitent would there, combat the will of heaven.</p>
                     <p>To ſtate the progreſſion by which vice gains a predominance in the heart, may be a uſeful leſſon; but it is one ſo little to the ſatisfaction of moſt readers, that it is not meant to be related here, all the degrees of frailty by which Lady Elmwood fell; but inſtead of picturing every occaſion of her fall, come briefly to the events that followed.</p>
                     <p>There are, nevertheleſs, ſome articles under the former claſs, which ought not to be entirely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood, after four years paſſed in the moſt perfect enjoyment of happineſs, the marriage ſtate could give; after ſeeing himſelf the father of a beautiful daughter, whom he loved with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs nearly equal to his love for her mother, Lord Elmwood was then under the indiſpenſable neceſſity of leaving them both for a time in order to ſave from the depreciation of his ſteward, a very large eſtate in the Weſt-Indies. His voyage was tedious; his reſidence there from various accidents, prolonged from time to time, till near three years had at length paſſed away.—Lady Elmwood, at firſt only unhappy, became at laſt provoked; and giving way to that impatient, irritable diſpoſition ſhe had ſo ſeldom governed, reſolved, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

His lordſhip at this time, and for many months before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:025650_0212_0FCE9F4B8C082B70"/>
and dangerous illneſs, which a too cautious fear of her uneaſineſs had prompted him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal; and ſhe received his frequent apologies for not returning, with a ſuſpicion and reſentment they were calculated, but not intended, to inſpire.</p>
                     <p>To violent anger, ſucceeded a degree of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſtill more fatal—Lady Elmwood's heart was never formed for ſuch a ſtate—there, where all the paſſions tumultuous ſtrove by turns, one among them ſoon found the means to occupy all vacancies—that one was love.—The dear object of her fondeſt, trueſt affections, was away; and thoſe affections painted the time ſo irkſome that was paſt; ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome that, which was ſtill to come; ſhe flew from the preſent tedious ſolitude, to the dangerous ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of one, whoſe every care to charm her, could not repay her for a moment's loſs of him, whoſe abſence he ſupplied.—Or if the delirium gave her a moment's recompenſe, what were her ſufferings and remorſe, when ſhe was awakened from the fleeting joy by the unexpected arrival of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?—How happy, how tranſporting, had been that arrival a few months before!—As it had then been felicitous, it was now bitter—this word, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, weakly expreſſes—Language affords none, to deſcribe Lady Elmwood's ſenſations on being told her Lord was arrived, and that neceſſity only had ſo long delayed his return.</p>
                     <p>Guilty, but not hardened in her guilt, her pangs, her ſhame, were the more exceſſive. She fled the place at his approach; fled his houſe, never again to return to a habitation where he was the maſter. She did not, however, eſcape with her paramour, but eloped to ſhelter herſelf in the moſt dreary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; where ſhe partook of no one comfort from ſociety, or from life, but the ſtill unremitting friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Miſs Woodley.—Even her infant daughter ſhe left behind, nor would allow herſelf the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:025650_0213_0FCEB2848BCCD020"/>
of her innocent, but reproachful, ſmiles—ſhe left her in her father's houſe, that ſhe might be under his protection; parted with her, as ſhe thought for ever, with all the agonies that mothers part from their infant children: and yet even a mother ſcarcely can conceive how much more ſharp thoſe agonies were, on beholding the child ſent after her, as the perpetual outcaſt of its father.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood's love to his lady had been extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant—the effect of his hate was extravagant likewiſe. Beholding himſelf ſeparated from her by a barrier never to be removed, he vowed, in the deep torments of his revenge, not to be reminded of her by one individual object; much leſs by one ſo nearly allied to her as her child. To beſtow upon that his affections, would be, he imagined, ſtill in ſome ſort, to divide them with the mother.—Firm in his reſolution, the beautiful Matilda was, at the age of ſix years, ſent out of her father's houſe, and received by her mother with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, but with the anguiſh, of thoſe parents, who behold their offspring viſited with the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due only to their own offences.</p>
                     <p>During this tranſaction, which was performed by his lordſhip's agents at his command, he himſelf was engaged in an affair of ſtill weightier import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—that of life or death:—he determined upon his own death, or the death of the man who had wounded his honour and his happineſs. A duel with his old antagoniſt was the reſult of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; nor was the Duke of Avon (before the deceaſe of his father and eldeſt brother, Lord Frederick Lawnly) backward to render all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction that was required.—For it was no other than he, whoſe love for Lady Elmwood had ſtill ſubſiſted, and whoſe art and induſtry left no means uneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>yed to perfect his deſigns;—No other than he, (who, next to Lord Elmwood, was ever of all
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:025650_0214_0FCE9F4D2CFA5010"/>
lovers moſt prevalent in her heart,) to whom Lady Elmwood yielded her own and her huſband's future peace, and gave to his vanity a prouder triumph, than if ſhe had never given her hand in preference to another. This triumph however was but ſhort—a month only, after the return of Lord Elmwood, his Grace was called upon to anſwer for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and was left upon the ſpot where they met, ſo maimed, and defaced with ſcars, as never again to endanger the honour of a huſband. As Lord Elmwood was inexorable to all accommodation; their engagement laſted for ſome ſpace of time; nor any thing but the ſtedfaſt aſſurance that his opponent was ſtain, could at laſt have torn his lordſhip from the field, though he himſelf was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded.</p>
                     <p>Yet even during that period of his danger, while for days he laid in the continual expectation of his own death, not all the entreaties of his deareſt, moſt intimate, and moſt reſpected friends, could prevail upon him to pronounce forgiveneſs to his wife, or ſuffer them to bring his daughter to him for his laſt bleſſing.</p>
                     <p>Lady Elmwood, who was made acquainted with the minuteſt circumſtance as it paſſed, appeared to wait the news of her Lord's deceaſe with patience; but upon her brow, and in every lineament of her face it was marked, his death was an event ſhe would not for a day ſurvive—and ſhe had left her child an orphan, to have followed Lord Elmwood to the grave.—She was prevented the trial; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and from the ample and diſtinguiſhed vengeance he had obtained upon the irreſiſtible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Duke, in a ſhort time ſeemed to regain his uſual tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>He recovered, while Lady Elmwood fell ſick and lingered—poſſeſſed of youth and a good conſtitution, ſhe lingered till ten years decline brought her to that
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:025650_0215_0FCEB285B3BA37D0"/>
period, with which the reader is now going to be preſented.</p>

                     <p>IN a lonely country on the borders of Scotland, a ſingle houſe by the ſide of a dreary heath, was the reſidence of the once gay, volatile Miſs Milner. In a large gloomy apartment of this ſolitary habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (the windows of which ſcarce rendered the light acceſſible) was laid upon her death-bed, the once lovely Lady Elmwood—pale, half ſuffocated with the loſs of breath; yet her ſenſes perfectly clear and collected, which ſerved but to ſharpen the anguiſh of dying.</p>
                     <p>In one corner of the room, by the ſide of an old-faſhioned ſtool, kneels Miſs Woodley, praying moſt devoutly for her ſtill beloved friend, but in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to pray compoſedly—floods of tears pour down her furrowed cheeks, and frequent ſobs of ſorrow break through each pious ejaculation.</p>
                     <p>Cloſe by her mother's ſide, one hand ſupporting her head, the other wiping from her face the damp dew of death, behold Lady Elmwood's daughter—Lord Elmwood's daughter too—yet he far away, negligent of what either ſuffers.—Lady Elmwood turns to her often, and attempts an embrace, but her feeble arms forbid, and they fall motionleſs.—The daughter perceiving theſe ineffectual efforts, has her whole face convulſed with ſorrow; kiſſes her mother; holds her to her boſom; and hangs upon her neck, as if ſhe wiſhed to cling there, and the grave not to part them.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide the bed ſits Sandford—his hair
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:025650_0216_0FCE9F4E8A979BE0"/>
grown white—his face wrinkled with age—his heart the ſame as ever—The reprover, the enemy of the vain, idle, and wicked; but the friend, the comforter of the forlorn and miſerable.</p>
                     <p>Upon thoſe features where ſarcaſm, reproach, and anger dwelt to threaten and alarm the ſinner; mildneſs, tenderneſs, and pity beamed, to ſupport and conſole the penitent. Compaſſion changed his language, and ſoftened all thoſe harſh tones that uſed to denounce reſentment.</p>
                     <p>"In the name of God," ſaid he to Lady Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, "that God who ſuffered for you, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, knew and pitied all our weakneſſes—By him, who has given his word, 'to take compaſſion on the ſinner's tears,' I bid you hope for mercy.—By that innocence in which you once lived, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted—By the ſorrows you have known ſince your degradation, hope, in ſome degree, to have atoned—By that ſincerely which ſhone upon your youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful face when I joined your hands; thoſe thouſand virtues you have at times given proof of, you were not born to die the death of the wicked."</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke theſe words of conſolation, her trembling hand claſped his—her dying eyes darted a ray of brightneſs—but her failing voice endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, in vain, to articulate.—At length, her eyes fixing upon her daughter as their laſt dear object, ſhe was juſt underſtood to utter the word "Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
                     <p>"I underſtand you," replied Sandford, "and by all that influence I ever had over him, by my prayers, my tears," (and they flowed at the word) I will implore him to own his child."</p>
                     <p>She could now only ſmile, in thanks.</p>
                     <p>"And if I ſhould fail," continued he, "yet while I live, ſhe ſhall not want a friend or protector—all an old man like me can anſwer for"—here his tears interrupted him.</p>
                     <p>

Lady Elmwood was ſufficiently ſenſible of his words and their import, to make a ſign as if ſhe wiſhed to embrace him; but finding her life leaving her faſt, ſhe reſerved this laſt token of love for her daughter—With a ſtruggle ſhe lifted herſelf from her pillow, clung to her child—and died in her arms.</p>

                     <p>LORD ELMWOOD was by nature, and more from education, of a ſerious, thinking, and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic turn of mind. His religious ſtudies had completely taught him to conſider this world but as a paſſage to another; to enjoy with gratitude what Heaven in its bounty ſhould beſtow, and to bear with ſubmiſſion all which in its vengeance it might inflict—In a greater degree than moſt people, he practiſed this doctrine; and as ſoon as the firſt ſhock he received from Lady Elmwood's conduct was abated, an entire calmneſs and reſignation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; but ſtill of that ſenſible and feeling kind, which could never force him to forget the happineſs he had loſt; and it was this ſenſibility which urged him to fly from its more keen recollection as much as poſſible—this he alledged as the reaſon he would never ſuffer Lady Elmwood, or even her child, to be named in his hearing. But this injunction (which all his friends, and even the ſervants in the houſe who attended his perſon, had received) was, by many people, ſuſpected rather to proceed from his reſentment than his tenderneſs; nor did he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deny, that reſentment mingled with his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for prudence he called it not to remind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:025650_0218_0FCE9FD508A082E8"/>
of happineſs he could never taſte again, and of ingratitude that might impel him to hatred; and prudence he called it not to form another attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment near to his heart; more eſpecially ſo near as a parent's, which might a ſecond time expoſe him to all the torments of ingratitude, from one whom he affectionately loved.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe principles he formed the unſhaken reſolution, never to acknowledge Lady Matilda as his child, or acknowledging her as ſuch—never to ſee, hear of, or take no concern whatever in her fate and fortune. The death of her mother ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a favourable time, had he been ſo inclined, to have recalled this declaration which he had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and repeatedly made—ſhe was now deſtitute of the protection of her other parent, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his duty, at leaſt to provide her a guardian, if he did not chooſe to take that tender title upon himſelf.—But to mention either the mother or child to Lord Elmwood, was an equal offence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the ſtrongeſt terms to all his friends and houſhold; and as he was an excellent good maſter, a ſincere friend, and a moſt generous patron; not one of his acquaintance or dependants, were hardy enough to draw upon themſelves his certain diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which was violent in the extreme, by even the official intelligence of Lady Elmwood's death.</p>
                     <p>Sandford himſelf, intimidated through age, or by the auſtere, and even moroſe, manners Lord Elmwood had of late years adopted; Sandford wiſhed, if poſſible, ſome other would undertake the dangerous taſk of recalling to his lordſhip's memory, there ever was ſuch a perſon as his wife. He adviſed Miſs Woodley to indite a proper letter to him on the ſubject; but ſhe reminded him, ſuch a ſtep was ſtill more perilous in her, than any other perſon, as ſhe was the moſt deſtitute being on earth, without the benevolence of Lord Elmwood. The
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:025650_0219_0FCEB28B2C462EC8"/>
death of her aunt, Mrs. Horton, had left her ſole reliance on Lady Elmwood; and now her death had left her totally dependant upon the Earl—for her Ladyſhip, long before her deceaſe, had declared it was not her intention, to leave a ſingle ſentence behind her in the form of a will—She had no will, ſhe ſaid, but what ſhe would wholly ſubmit to Lord Elmwood's; and, if it were even his will, her child ſhould live in poverty, as well as baniſhment, it ſhould be ſo. But, perhaps, in this implicit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his lordſhip, there was a diſtant hope that the neceſſitous ſituation of his daughter might plead more forcibly than his parental love; and that knowing her abandoned of every ſupport but through himſelf, that idea might form ſome little tie between them; and be at leaſt a token of the relationſhip.</p>
                     <p>But as Lady Elmwood anxiouſly wiſhed this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple upon which ſhe acted, ſhould be concealed from his lordſhip's ſuſpicion, ſhe included her friend Miſs Woodley in the ſame fate; and thus, the only perſons dear to her, ſhe left, but at Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's pleaſure, to be preſerved from periſhing in want.—Her child was too young to adviſe her on this ſubject, her friend too diſintereſted; and at this moment they were both without the ſmalleſt means of ſupport, except through the juſtice or compaſſion of his lordſhip.—Sandford had, indeed, promiſed his protection to the daughter; but his liberality had no other ſource than from his patron, with whom he ſtill lived as uſual, except during the winter when his lordſhip reſided in town, he then moſtly ſtole a viſit to Lady Elmwood—On this laſt viſit, he ſtaid to ſee her buried.</p>
                     <p>After ſome mature deliberations, Sandford was now preparing to go to Lord Elmwood at his houſe in town, and there to deliver himſelf the news that
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:025650_0220_0FCE9FD669F685F0"/>
muſt ſooner or later be told; and he meant alſo to venture, at the ſame time, to keep the promiſe he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad made to his dying lady—but the news reached Lord Elmwood before Sandford arrived; it was announced in the public papers, and by that means came firſt to his knowledge.</p>
                     <p>He was breakfaſting by himſelf, when the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper that firſt gave the intelligence of Lady Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's death, was laid before him—the paragraph contained theſe words:</p>
                     <q>On Wedneſday laſt died, at Dring-Park, a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in Northumberland, the right honourable Counteſs Elmwood—This lady, who has not been heard of for many years in the faſhionable world, was a rich heireſs, and of extreme beauty; but although ſhe received overtures from many men of the firſt rank, ſhe preferred her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, the preſent Lord Elmwood (then the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mr. Dorriforth) to them all—and it is ſaid, they enjoyed an uncommon ſhare of felicity, till his lordſhip going abroad, and remaining there ſome time, the conſequences (to a moſt captivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young woman left without a protector) were ſuch, as to cauſe a ſeparation on his return.—Her ladyſhip has left one child, a daughter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen.</q>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood had ſo much feeling upon reading this, as to lay down the paper, and not to take it up again for ſeveral minutes—nor did he taſte his chocolate during this interval, but leaned his elbow on the table, and reſted his head upon his hand—He then roſe up—walked two or three times acroſs the room—ſat down again—took up the paper—and read as uſual.—Nor let the vociferous mourner, or the perpetual weeper, here complain of his want of ſenſibility—but let them remember Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood was a man—a man of underſtanding—of courage—of fortitude—with all, a man of the niceſt
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:025650_0221_0FCEB28C80960E10"/>
feelings—and who ſhall ſay, but that at the time he leaned his head upon his hand, and roſe to walk away the ſenſe of what he felt, he might not feel as much as Lady Elmwood did in her laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                     <p>Be this as it may, his lordſhip's ſuſceptibility on the occaſion was not ſuſpected by any one—he paſſed that day the ſame as uſual; the next day too, and the day after.—On the morning of the fourth day, he ſent for his ſteward to his ſtudy, and after talking of other buſineſs, ſaid to him,</p>
                     <p>"Is it true that Lady Elmwood is dead?"</p>
                     <p>"It is, my lord," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip looked unuſually grave, and at this reply, fetched an involuntary ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford, my lord," continued the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, "ſent me word of the news, but left it to my own diſcretion, whether I made your lordſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it or not."</p>
                     <p>"Where is Sandford?" aſked Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>"He was with my lady," replied the ſteward.</p>
                     <p>"When ſhe died?" aſked his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
                     <p>"I am glad of it—he will ſee every thing ſhe deſired done.—Sandford is a good man, and would be a friend to every body."</p>
                     <p>"He is a very good man indeed, my lord."</p>
                     <p>There was now a ſilence.—Mr. Giffard then bowing, ſaid, "Has your lordſhip any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?"</p>
                     <p>"Write to Sandford," ſaid Lord Elmwood, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating as he ſpoke, "and tell him to have every thing performed as ſhe deſired.—And whoever ſhe may have ſelected for the guardian of her child, has my conſent to act as ſuch.—Nor in one inſtance, where I myſelf am not concerned, will I contradict her will."—The tears ruſhed to his eyes as he ſaid
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:025650_0222_0FCEB25A357C3ED8"/>
this, and cauſed them to ſtart in the ſteward's—ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving which, he ſternly reſumed,</p>
                     <p>"Do not ſuppoſe from this converſation, that any of thoſe reſolutions I have long ſince taken, are, or will be, changed—they are the ſame; and ſhall continue the ſame—and your interdiction, Sir, (as well as every other perſon's) remains juſt the ſame as formerly; never to mention this ſubject to me in future."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I always obeyed you," replied Mr. Giffard, "and hope I always ſhall."</p>
                     <p>"I hope ſo too," replied his lordſhip, in a threatening accent—"Write to Sandford," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, "to let him know my pleaſure, and that is all you have to do."</p>
                     <p>The ſteward bowed and withdrew.</p>
                     <p>But before his letter arrived to Sandford, Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford arrived in town; and Mr. Giffard related to him word for word, what had paſſed between him and his lord.—Upon every occaſion, and upon every topic, except that of Lady Elmwood and her child, Sandford was juſt as free with Lord Elmwood as he had ever been; and as uſual (after his interview with the ſteward) went into his lordſhip's apartment without any previous notice. He lordſhip ſhaked him by the hand as upon all other meetings; and yet, whether his fears ſuggeſted it or not, Sandford thought he appeared more cool and reſerved with him than common.</p>
                     <p>During the whole day, the ſlighteſt mention of Lady Elmwood, or of her child, was cautiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided—and not till the evening, (after Sandford had rung for his candle to retire to reſt, it was brought, and he had wiſhed his lordſhip good night) did he dare to mention the ſubject.—He then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking leave, and going to the door—turned back and ſaid, "My lord,"—</p>
                     <p>It was eaſy to gueſs on what he was preparing to
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:025650_0223_0FCEB28DF8DDE838"/>
ſpeak—his voice failed, the tears began to trickle down his cheeks, he took out his handkerchief, and could proceed no farther.</p>
                     <p>"I thought," ſaid Lord Elmwood, angrily, "I had given my orders upon this ſubject—did not my ſteward write them to you?"</p>
                     <p>"He did, my lord," ſaid Sandford, humbly, "but I was ſet out before they arrived."</p>
                     <p>"Has he not <hi>told</hi> you my mind then?" cried his lordſhip, more angrily ſtill.</p>
                     <p>"He has;" replied Sandford,—"But"—</p>
                     <p>"But what, Sir?"—cried Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>"Your lordſhip," continued Sandford, "was miſtaken in ſuppoſing Lady Elmwood left a will; ſhe left none."</p>
                     <p>"No will? no will at all?"—ſaid his lordſhip, ſurpriſed.</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord," anſwered Sandford, "ſhe wiſhed every thing to be as you willed."</p>
                     <p>"She left me all the trouble, then, you mean?"</p>
                     <p>"No great trouble, Sir; for except two perſons, her ladyſhip has not left any one elſe to hope for your protection"</p>
                     <p>"And who are theſe two?" cried he haſtily.</p>
                     <p>"One, my lord, I need not name—the other is Miſs Woodley."</p>
                     <p>There was a delicacy and an humility, in the manner in which Sandford delivered this reply, that Lord Elmwood could <hi>not</hi> reſent, and he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Woodley, is ſhe yet living?"</p>
                     <p>"She is—I left her at the houſe I came from."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then," anſwered his lordſhip, "you muſt ſee that my ſteward provides for thoſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.—That care I leave to you—and ſhould there be any complaints, on you they fall."</p>
                     <p>Sandford bowed and was going.</p>
                     <p>

"And now," reſumed his lordſhip, in a ſtern and exalted voice, "let me <hi>never</hi> hear again on this ſubject.—You have full power to act in regard to the perſons you have mentioned; and upon you their ſituation, their care, their whole management depend—but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Then," ſaid Sandford, "as this muſt be the laſt time they are mentioned, I muſt now take the opportunity to diſburden my mind of a charge"—</p>
                     <p>"What charge?"—cried his lordſhip, moroſely interrupting him.</p>
                     <p>"Though Lady Elmwood, my lord, left no will behind, ſhe left a requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"Requeſt"—ſaid his lordſhip, ſtarting—"If it is for me to ſee her daughter, I tell you now before you aſk, I will not grant it—for by heaven (and he ſpoke and looked moſt ſolemnly) though I have no reſentment to the innocent child; and wiſh her happy, yet I will never ſee her—Never, for her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſake, ſuffer my heart to be again ſoftened by an object I might doat on.—Therefore, Sir, if that is the requeſt, it is already anſwered; my will is fixed."</p>
                     <p>"The requeſt, my lord," replied Sandford, (taking out a pocket-book from whence he drew ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral papers) "is contained in this letter; nor do I rightly know what its contents are."—And he held it out to him.</p>
                     <p>"Is it Lady Elmwood's writing?" cried his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, extremely diſcompoſed.</p>
                     <p>"It is, my lord—She called for ink and paper, and wrote it a few days before ſhe died, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined me to deliver it to you, with my own hands."</p>
                     <p>"I refuſe to read it,"—cried he, putting it from him—and trembling while he did ſo.</p>
                     <p>

"She deſired me," ſaid Sandford, (ſtill preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter) "to conjure you to read it, <hi>for her father's ſake.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood took it inſtantly.—But as ſoon as it was in his hand, he ſeemed diſtreſſed to know what he ſhould do with it—in what place, to go to read it—or how fortify himſelf againſt its contents.—He appeared aſhamed too, that he had been ſo far prevailed upon, and ſaid, by way of excuſe,</p>
                     <p>"For Mr. Milner's ſake I would do much—nay, any thing, but that to which, I have juſt now ſworn never to conſent.—For his ſake I have borne a great deal—for his ſake alone, his daughter died my wife.—You know, no other motive than reſpect for him, prevented my divorcing her.—Pray (and he heſitated) was ſhe buried with him?"</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord—ſhe expreſſed no ſuch deſire; and as that was the caſe, I did not think it neceſſary to carry the corpſe ſo far."</p>
                     <p>At the word corpſe, Lord Elmwood ſhrunk, and looked ſhocked beyond meaſure—but recovering himſelf, ſaid, "I am ſorry for it;—for he loved <hi>her</hi> ſincerely, if ſhe did not love him—and I wiſh they had been buried together."</p>
                     <p>"It is not then too late," ſaid Sandford, and was going on—but his lordſhip interrupted him.</p>
                     <p>"No, no—we will have no diſturbing of the dead."</p>
                     <p>"Read her letter then," ſaid Sandford, "and bid her reſt in peace."</p>
                     <p>"If it is in my power," returned his lordſhip, "to grant what ſhe aſks, I will—but if her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is what I apprehend, I cannot, I will not bid her reſt by complying—You know my reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and my diſpoſition, and take care how you provoke me.—You may do an injury to the very perſon you are ſeeking to befriend—the very main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

                     <p>Poor Sandford, all alarm at this menace, replied with energy, "My lord, unleſs you begin the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I never will preſume to mention it again."</p>

                     <p>AFTER Lord Elmwood had retired into his chamber, it was ſome time before he read the letter Sandford had given him.

At length he diſmiſſed his valet, and ſitting down, took the letter from his pocket.—He looked at the ſeal, but not at the direction; for he ſeemed to dread to ſee Lady Elmwood's hand-writing.—He then laid it on the table, and began again to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. He did not proceed, but taking up the letter quickly, (with a kind of effort in making the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution) broke it open. Theſe were its contents:</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>My Lord, Who writes this letter, I well know—I well know alſo to whom it is addreſſed.—I feel with the moſt powerful force both our ſituations.—nor ſhould I dare to offer you even this humble petition, but that at the time you receive it, there will be no ſuch perſon as I am in exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="225" facs="unknown:025650_0227_0FCEB293D523E168"/>
For myſelf, then, all concern will be over—but there is a care that purſues me to the grave, and threatens my want of repoſe even there.</p>
                        <p>I leave a child—I will not call her mine, that has undone her—I will not call her yours, that will be of no avail.—I preſent her before you as the grand-daughter of Mr. Milner.—Oh! do not refuſe an aſſylum even in your own houſe, to the deſtitute offspring of your friend; the laſt, and only remaining branch of his family.</p>
                        <p>Receive her into your houſhold, be her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there ever ſo abject.—I cannot write diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I would—my ſenſes are not impaired, but the powers of expreſſion are.—The unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate child in the ſcripture (a leſſon I have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died) his complaint, has made this wiſh cling ſo faſt to my heart, that without the diſtant hope of its being fulfilled, death would have more terrors than my weak mind could ſupport.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I will go to my father; how many ſervants live in my father's houſe, and are fed with plenty, while I ſtarve in a foreign land?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I do not aſk a parent's feſtive rejoicing at her approach—I do not even aſk her father to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her;—but let her live under his protection.—For her grandfather's ſake do not refuſe this—to the child of his child whom he truſted to your care, do not refuſe it.</p>
                        <p>Be her hoſt; I remit the tie of being her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.—Never ſee her—but let her ſometimes live under the ſame roof with you.</p>
                        <p>It is Miſs Milner your ward, to whom you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refuſed a requeſt, ſupplicates you—not now for your nephew Ruſhbrook, but for one ſo much more dear, that a denial—ſhe dares not ſuffer her thoughts to glance that way—She will hope—and in that hope, bids you farewell, with all the love ſhe ever bore you.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="226" facs="unknown:025650_0228_0FCEB260F854A398"/>
Farewell Lord Elmwood—and before you throw this letter from you with contempt or anger, caſt your imagination into the grave where I am lying.—Reflect upon all the days of my paſt life—the the anxious moments I have known, and what has been their end.—Behold <hi>me,</hi> alſo in my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered face there is no anxiety—no joy or ſorrow—all is over.—My whole frame is motionleſs—my heart beats no more.—Look at my horrid habitation, too,—and aſk yourſelf—whether I am an object of reſentment?</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>While Lord Elmwood read this letter, it trembled in his hand: he once or twice wiped the tears from his eyes as he read, and once laid the letter down for a few minutes. At its concluſion the tears flowed faſt down his face; but he ſeemed both aſhamed and angry they did, and was going to throw the paper upon the fire; he however ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly checked his hand, and putting it haſtily into his pocket, went to bed.</p>

                     <p>THE next morning, when Lord Elmwood and Sandford met at breakfaſt, Sandford was pale with fear for the ſucceſs of Lady Elmwood's letter—his lordſhip was pale too, but there was beſide upon his face ſomething which evidently marked he was diſpleaſed—Sandford obſerved it, and was all humbleneſs, both in his words and looks, in order to ſoften him.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the breakfaſt was removed, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip drew Lady Elmwood's letter from his pocket, and holding it towards Sandford, ſaid,</p>

"That may be of more value to you, than it is to me, therefore I give it you."</p>
                     <p>Sandford called up a look of ſurpriſe, as if he did not know the letter again.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis Lady Elmwood's letter," ſaid his lordſhip, "and I give it to you for two reaſons."</p>
                     <p>Sandford took it, and putting it up, aſked fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, "What thoſe two reaſons were?"</p>
                     <p>"Firſt," ſaid Lord Elmwood, "becauſe I think it is a rolick you may like to preſerve—my ſecond reaſon is, that you may ſhow it to her daughter, and let her know why, and on what conditions I grant her mother's requeſt."</p>
                     <p>"You do then grant it?" cried Sandford joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; "I thank you—you are kind—you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate."</p>
                     <p>"Be not too haſty in your gratitude," returned his lordſhip, "you may have cauſe to recall it."</p>
                     <p>"I know what you have ſaid," replied Sandford, "You have ſaid you grant Lady Elmwood's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt—you cannot recall theſe words, nor I my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude."</p>
                     <p>"Do you know what her requeſt is?" ſaid Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>"Not exactly, my lord—I told you before, I did not; but it is, no doubt, ſomething in favour of her child."</p>
                     <p>"I think not," replied his lordſhip. "Such as it is, however, I grant it.—But in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word—no farther; and one neglect of my commands, releaſes my promiſe totally."</p>
                     <p>"We will take care, Sir, not to diſobey them."</p>
                     <p>"Then liſten to what they are—and to you I give the charge of delivering them again.—Lady Elmwood has petitioned me in the name of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (a name I reverence) to give his grand-child the ſanction of my protection.—In the literal ſenſe, to ſuffer her to reſide occaſionally at one of my

ſeats; diſpenſing at the ſame time with my ever ſeeing her."</p>
                     <p>"And you will comply?"</p>
                     <p>"I will, till ſhe encroaches on this conceſſion, and dare to aſk for a greater.—I will, while ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids my ſight, or the giving me any remembrance of her.—But whether by deſign or by accident, I ever ſee or hear from her; that moment my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to her mother's ſupplication ceaſes, and I abandon her once more."</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſighed.—His lordſhip continued,</p>

I am ſeldom now at Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Houſe; let her daughter go there;—the few weeks or months I am down in the ſummer, ſhe may eaſily, in that extenſive houſe, avoid me—while ſhe does, ſhe lives in ſecurity—when ſhe does not, you know my reſolution."</p>
                     <p>Sandford bowed—His lordſhip reſumed.</p>
                     <p>"Nor can it be a hardſhip to obey this command—ſhe cannot lament the ſeparation from a parent whom ſhe never knew"—Sandford was going ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to prove the error of that aſſertion, but his lordſhip prevented him, ſaying, "In a word—without farther argument—if ſhe obeys me in this, I will certainly provide for her as my daughter dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my life, and leave her a fortune at my death—but if ſhe dares—"</p>
                     <p>Sandford interrupted the menace he ſaw prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for utterance, ſaying, "And you ſtill mean, I ſuppoſe, to make Mr. Ruſhbrook your heir?"</p>
                     <p>"Have you not heard me ſay ſo? And do you imagine I have changed my determination? I am not given to alter my reſolutions, Mr. Sandford; and I thought you knew I was not;—beſides will not my title be extinct, whoever I make my heir?
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:025650_0231_0FCEB2969D02D970"/>
—Could any thing but a ſon have preſerved my title?"</p>
                     <p>"Then it is yet poſſible—"</p>
                     <p>"By marrying again, you mean?—No—no—I have had enough of marriage—and Henry Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook I leave my heir. Therefore, Sir—"</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I do not preſume—"</p>
                     <p>"Do not, Sandford, and we may ſtill be friends.—But I am not to be controlled as formerly; my temper is changed of late; changed to what it was originally; till your ſcholaſtic and religious rules reformed it. You may remember, how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome it was to conquer my ſtubborn diſpoſition in my youth; then, indeed, you did; but in my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood you will find the taſk more difficult."</p>
                     <p>Sandford again repeated, "He ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume—"</p>
                     <p>To which his lordſhip again made an anſwer, "Do not, Sandford; and added, "for I have a ſincere regard for you, and ſhould be loth at theſe years to quarrel with you ſeriouſly."</p>
                     <p>Sandford turned away his head to hide his tears.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, if we do quarrel," reſumed his lordſhip, "you know it muſt be your own fault;—and as this is a theme the moſt likely of any (indeed the only one on which we can have a difference ſuch as we cannot forgive) take care never from this day to reſume it;—indeed that of itſelf, is an offence I will not pardon.—I have been clear and explicit in all I have ſaid; there can be no fear of miſtaking my meaning, therefore all future explanation is unneceſſary—nor will I permit a word, or a hint on the ſubject from any one, without ſhowing my reſentment to the hour of my death." He was going out of the room.</p>
                     <p>"But before we bid adieu to the ſubject for ever, my lord—there was another perſon whom I named to you—"</p>

                        <pb n="230" facs="unknown:025650_0232_0FCEB266496CC3F8"/>
"Do you mean Miſs Woodley?—Oh, by all means let her live at Elmwood Houſe too.—On con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I have no objection to ſee Miſs Woodley at any time—I ſhall be glad to ſee her.—Do not let <hi>her</hi> be frightened at me—to her I ſhall be the ſame I have always been."</p>
                     <p>"She is a good woman, my lord," cried Sandford, pleaſed.</p>
                     <p>"You need not tell me that, Mr. Sandford; I know her worth."—And his lordſhip left the room.</p>
                     <p>Sandford, to relieve Miſs Woodley and her lovely charge from the ſuſpenſe in which he had left them, ſet off for their habitation the next day; in order himſelf to conduct them from thence to Elmwood Houſe, and appoint ſome retired part of it for Lady Matilda, againſt the annual viſit her father paid there. But before he left London, Giffard, the ſteward, took an opportunity to wait upon him, and let him know, that his lord had acquainted him, with the conſent he had given for his daughter to be admitted at Elmwood Caſtle; and upon what reſtrictions; likewiſe that he had denounced the moſt ſevere threats, ſhould theſe reſtrictions be broken. Sandford thanked Giffard for his friendly information, which ſerved him as a ſecond warning of the circumſpection that was neceſſary; and having taken leave of his lordſhip under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence "he could not live in the ſmoke of London," he ſet out for the north.</p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to ſay with what delight Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was received by Miſs Woodley, and the hapleſs daughter of Lady Elmwood, even before he told his errand. They both loved him ſincerely; more eſpecially Lady Matilda; whoſe forlorn ſtate, and innocent ſufferings, had ever excited his compaſſion in the extremeſt degree, and had cauſed him ever to treat her with the utmoſt affection, tenderneſs,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:025650_0233_0FCEB29958AE1D80"/>
and reſpect. She knew too, how much he had been her mother's friend; for that ſhe alſo loved him; and being honoured with the friendſhip of her father, ſhe looked up to him with reverence and awe. For Matilda (with an excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, a ſedateneſs above her years, and early accuſtomed to the moſt private converſe between Lady Elmwood and Miſs Woodley) was perfectly acquainted with the whole private hiſtory of her mother; and was by her taught, that reſpect and admiration of her father's virtues which they juſtly merited."</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the joy of beholding Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, once more to cheer by his preſence their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary dwelling; no ſooner were the firſt kind greetings over, than the dread of what he might have to inform them, poſſeſſed both poor Matilda and Miſs Woodley ſo powerfully, their gladneſs was changed into affright. Their apprehenſions were far more forcible than their curioſity;—they durſt not aſk a queſtion, and even began to wiſh he would continue ſilent upon the ſubject, on which they feared to liſten. For near two hours he was ſo.—At length, after a ſhort interval from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (during which they waited with anxiety for what he might next ſay) he turned to Lady Matilda, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"You don't aſk for your father, my dear?"</p>
                     <p>"I did not know it was proper," ſhe replied, timidly.</p>
                     <p>"It is always proper," anſwered Sandford, "for <hi>you</hi> to think of him, though he ſhould never think on you."</p>
                     <p>She burſt into tears, ſaying, ſhe "<hi>did</hi> think of him, but ſhe felt an apprehenſion at mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his name,—and ſhe wept bitterly while ſhe ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="unknown:025650_0234_0FCEB267C0A35C50"/>
"Nay, do not think I reproved you," ſaid Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; "I but told you what was right."</p>
                     <p>"Nay," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "it is not for that ſhe cries thus; ſhe fears her father has not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with her mother's requeſt. Perhaps not even her letter?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, he has read it," returned Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Oh heavens!" exclaimed Matilda, claſping her hands together, and the tears falling faſter ſtill.</p>
                     <p>"Do not be ſo much alarmed, my dear," ſaid Miſs Woodley; "you know we are prepared for the worſt; and you know you promiſed your mother, whatever your fate was, to ſubmit with patience."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Matilda, "and I am prepared for every thing, but my father's refuſal to my dear mother."</p>
                     <p>"Your father has not refuſed your mother's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt," replied Sandford.</p>
                     <p>She was leaping from her ſeat with ecſtaſy.</p>
                     <p>"But," continued he, "do you know what her requeſt was?"</p>
                     <p>"Not entirely," replied Matilda, "and ſince it is granted, I am careleſs.—But ſhe told me her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerned none but me."</p>
                     <p>To explain perfectly to Matilda, Lady Elmwood's letter, and that ſhe might perfectly underſtand upon what terms ſhe was admitted into Elmwood Houſe, Sandford now read the letter to her; and repeated, as nearly as he could remember, the whole of the converſation that paſſed between Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and himſelf; not even ſparing, with an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delicacy, any of thoſe threats her father had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſhould ſhe dare to break through the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits he preſcribed—nor did he try to ſoften, in one inſtance, a word his lordſhip uttered. She liſtened ſometimes with tears, ſometimes with hope, but always with awe and terror, to every ſentence wherein her father was concerned.—Once ſhe called him cruel—then exclaimed "he
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:025650_0235_0FCEB29AC05D6628"/>
was kind;" but at the end of Sandford's intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, concluded ſhe was happy and grateful for the boon beſtowed.—Even her mother had not a more exalted and tranſcendant idea of Lord Elmwood's worth, than his daughter had formed; and this little bounty juſt obtained, had not been greater in her mother's eſtimation, than it was now in her's.—Miſs Woodley, too, ſmiled at the proſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her—ſhe eſteemed Lord Elmwood beyond any mortal living—ſhe was proud to hear what he had ſaid in her praiſe, and overjoyed at the proſpect ſhe ſhould be once again in his company; picturing, at the ſame time, a thouſand of the brighteſt hopes, from watching every emotion of his ſoul, and catching every proper occaſion to excite, or increaſe his paternal ſentiments.—Yet ſhe had the prudence to conceal thoſe vague hopes from his child, leſt a diſappointment might prove fatal; and aſſuming a behaviour not too much elated or depreſſed, ſhe adviſed they ſhould hope for the beſt, but yet, as uſual, expect and prepare for the worſt.—After taking meaſures for quitting their melancholy abode; within the fortnight they all departed for Elmwood Caſtle.—Matilda, Miſs Woodley, and even Sandford, firſt viſiting Lady Elmwood's grave, and bedewed it with their tears.</p>

                     <p>IT was on a dark evening in the month of March, that Lady Matilda, accompanied by Sandford and Miſs Woodley, arrived at Elmwood Caſtle, the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſeat of her father.—Sandford choſe the

evening; rather to ſteal into the houſe privately, than by any appearance of parade, ſuffer Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to be reminded of it by the public prints, or by any other accident.—Nor would he give the neighbours or ſervants the ſlighteſt reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the daughter of their lord was admitted into his houſe in any other ſituation than, that, which ſhe really was.</p>
                     <p>As the porter opened the gates of the avenue to the carriage that brought them, Matilda felt an awful, and yet a gladful ſenſation no terms can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.—As ſhe entered the door of the houſe, this ſenſation increaſed—and as ſhe paſſed along the ſpacious hall, the ſplendid ſtaircaſe, and many ſtately apartments, wonder! with a crowd of the tendereſt, yet moſt afflicting, ſentiments ruſhed to her heart.—She gazed with aſtoniſhment!—ſhe reflected with more.</p>
                     <p>"And is <hi>my father</hi> the maſter of this houſe?" ſhe cried—"And was my mother once the miſtreſs of this houſe?"—Here a flood of tears relieved her from a part of that burthen, which was before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Sandford, "and you are the miſtreſs of it now, till your father arrives."</p>
                     <p>"Good God!" exclaimed ſhe, "and will he ever arrive? and ſhall I live to ſleep under the ſame roof with my father?"</p>
                     <p>"My dear," replied Miſs Woodley, "have not you been told ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid ſhe, "but though I heard it with extreme pleaſure, yet the idea never ſo forcibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me as at this moment.—I now feel, as the reality approaches, this has been kindneſs ſufficient—I do not aſk for more—I am now convinced, from what this trial makes me feel, that to ſee my father, would cauſe a ſenſation, a feeling, I could not ſurvive."</p>

                        <pb n="235" facs="unknown:025650_0237_0FCEB29E420D0A28"/>
The next morning gave to Matilda more objects ſtill of admiration and wonder, as ſhe walked over the extenſive gardens, groves, and other pleaſure-grounds belonging to the houſe. She who had never been beyond the dreary, ruinate place where her deceaſed mother had choſen her reſidence, was naturally ſtruck with amazement and delight at the grandeur of a ſeat, which travellers had come for miles to ſee, and not thought their time miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                     <p>There was one object, however, among all ſhe ſaw, which attracted her attention above the reſt, and ſhe would ſtand for hours to look at it—This was a full length portrait of Lord Elmwood, eſteemed a very capital picture, and a great likeneſs—to this picture ſhe would ſigh and weep; though when it was firſt pointed out to her, ſhe ſhrunk back with fear, and it was ſome time before ſhe dared venture to caſt her eyes completely upon it. In the features of her father ſhe was proud to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the exact moulds in which her own appeared to have been modelled; yet Matilda's perſon, ſhape, and complexion were ſo extremely like what her mother's once were, that at the firſt glance ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have a ſtill greater reſemblance of her, than of her father—but her mind and manners were all Lord Elmwood's; ſoftened by the delicacy of her ſex, the extreme tenderneſs of her heart, and the melancholy of her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>She was now in her ſeventeenth year—of the ſame age, within a year and a few months, of her mother, when ſhe became the ward of Dorriforth.—She was juſt three years old when her father went abroad, and remembered ſomething of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him farewell; but more of taking cherries from his hand as he pulled them from the tree to give her.</p>
                     <p>Educated in the ſchool of adverſity, and inured
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:025650_0238_0FCEB26C391F90D0"/>
to retirement from her infancy, ſhe had acquired a taſte for all thoſe amuſements which a recluſe life affords—She was fond of walking and riding—was accompliſhed in the arts of muſic and drawing, by the moſt careful inſtructions of her mother—and as a ſcholar ſhe excelled moſt of her ſex, from the great pains Sandford had taken with that part of her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and the great abilities he poſſeſſed for the taſk.</p>
                     <p>In devoting certain hours of the day to ſtudy with him, others to muſic, riding, and ſuch recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, Matilda's time never appeared tedious at Elmwood Houſe, although ſhe neither received nor paid one viſit—for it was ſoon divulged in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood upon what ſtipulation ſhe reſided at her father's, and intimated, that the moſt prudent and friendly behaviour of the friends both of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and of herſelf, would be, to take no notice whatever that ſhe lived among them: and as Lord Elmwood's will was a law all around, ſuch was the conſequence, of his will being known or ſuppoſed.</p>
                     <p>Neither did Miſs Woodley regret the want of viſiters, but found herſelf far more ſatisfied in her preſent ſituation, than her moſt ſanguine hopes could have formed—ſhe had a companion whom ſhe loved with an equal fondneſs, with which ſhe had loved her deceaſed mother; and frequently in this charming manſion, where ſhe had ſo often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Lady Elmwood, her imagination pictured Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda as her, riſen from the grave in her former youth, health, and exquiſite beauty.</p>
                     <p>In peace, in content, though far from happineſs, the days and weeks paſſed away till about the middle of Auguſt, when preparations began to be made for the arrival of Lord Elmwood.—The week in which he was to come was at length fixed, and ſome part of his retinue was arrived before him.—When this was told to Matilda, ſhe ſtarted, and
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:025650_0239_0FCEB29F85858748"/>
looked juſt as her mother at her age oftentimes had done, when, in ſpite of her love, ſhe was conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhe had offended him, and was terrified at his approach. Sandford obſerving this, put out his hand, and taking her's, ſhook it kindly; and bade her (but it was not in a cheerful tone) "not be afraid." This gave her no confidence; and ſhe began, before his lordſhip's arrival, to ſeclude her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thoſe apartments which were allotted for her during the time of his ſtay; and in the timorous expectation of his coming, her appetite declined, and ſhe loſt all her colour.—Even Miſs Woodley, whoſe ſpirits had been for ſome time elated with the hopes ſhe had formed; on drawing near to the teſt, found thoſe hopes vaniſhed; and though ſhe endeavoured to conceal it, ſhe was replete with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.—Sandford had certainly fewer fears than either; yet upon the eve of the day on which his patron was to arrive, he was evidently caſt down.</p>
                     <p>Lady Matilda once aſked him—"Are you certain, Mr. Sandford, you made no miſtake in reſpect to what Lord Elmwood ſaid, when he granted my mother's requeſt? Are you ſure he <hi>did</hi> grant it?—Was there nothing equivocal on which he may ground his diſpleaſure, ſhould he hear I am here? Oh! do not let me hazard the being once again turned out of his houſe!—Oh! ſave me from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking him perhaps to curſe me."—And here ſhe claſped her hands together with the moſt fervent petition in the dread of what might happen.</p>
                     <p>"If you doubt my word or my ſenſes," ſaid Sandford, "call Giffard, and let him inform you;—my lord repeated the ſame words to him he did to me."</p>
                     <p>Though from her reaſon Matilda could not doubt of any miſtake from Mr. Sandford, yet her fears ſuggeſted a thouſand ſcruples; and this reference
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:025650_0240_0FCEB26DB2DD2DE0"/>
to the ſteward, ſhe received with the utmoſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, (though ſhe did not think it neceſſary to apply to him,) as it perfectly convinced her of the folly of thoſe ſuſpicions ſhe had entertained.</p>
                     <p>"And yet, Mr. Sandford," ſaid ſhe, "if it is ſo, why are you leſs cheerful than you were? I cannot help thinking but it muſt be the expectation of Lord Elmwood, which has cauſed in you this change."</p>
                     <p>"I don't know;" replied Sandford, careleſsly, "but I believe I am grown afraid of your father.—His temper is a great deal altered from what it once was—he exalts his voice, and uſes harſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the leaſt provocation—his eyes flaſh lightning, and his face is diſtorted with anger on the ſlighteſt motives—he turns away his old ſervants at a moment's warning, and no conceſſion can make their peace.—In a word, I am more at my caſe when I am away from him—and I really believe," added he with a ſmile, but with a tear at the ſame time, "I really believe I am more afraid of him in my age, than he was of me when he was a boy."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley was preſent; ſhe and Matilda looked at one another; and each ſaw the other turn pale, at this deſcription.</p>
                     <p>The day at length came on which Lord Elmwood was expected to dinner.—It had been a high gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to his daughter to have gone to the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt window of the houſe, to have only beheld his chariot enter the avenue; but it was a gratification which her fears, her tremour, her extreme ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would not permit her to enjoy.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley and ſhe ſat down that day to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their retired apartments; which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the other part of the houſe by a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; and of the door leading to the gallery, they had a key to impede any one from paſſing that way, without firſt ringing a bell; to anſwer which, was
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:025650_0241_0FCEB2A0C0EA2D38"/>
the ſole employment of a ſervant who was placed there during his lordſhip's reſidence, leſt by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident he might chance to come near that unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented part of the houſe; on which occaſion the man was to give immediate notice to his lady.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley and ſhe ſat down to dinner, but did not dine—Sandford ate, as uſual, with Lord Elmwood.—When the ſervant brought up tea, Miſs Woodley aſked him if he had ſeen his lord—The man anſwered, "Yes, Madam; and he looks vaſtly well."—Matilda wept with joy to hear it.</p>
                     <p>About nine in the evening Sandford rung at the bell, and was admitted—and never was he ſo wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come—Matilda hung upon him, as if his recent ſociety with her father had endeared her to him more than ever; and ſtaring anxiouſly in his face, ſeemed to aſk him to tell her ſomething of Lord Elmwood, and ſomething that ſhould not alarm her.</p>
                     <p>"Well—how do you find yourſelf?" ſaid he to her.</p>
                     <p>"How are you, Mr. Sandford?" ſhe returned, with a ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! very well," replied he.</p>
                     <p>"Is my lord in a good temper?" aſked Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Yes; very well," replied Sandford, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.</p>
                     <p>"Did he ſeem glad to ſee you?" aſked Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"He ſhook me by the hand," replied Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"That was a ſign he was glad to ſee you, was it not?" ſaid Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"Yes; but he could not do leſs."</p>
                     <p>"Nor more," replied ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"He looks very well, our ſervant tells us," ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Extremely well indeed," anſwered Sandford: "and, to tell the truth, I never ſaw him in better ſpirits."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="240" facs="unknown:025650_0242_0FCEB2700BAFAB30"/>
"That is well:" ſaid Matilda, and ſighed a weight of fears from her heart.</p>
                     <p>"Where is he now, Mr. Sandford?"</p>
                     <p>"Gone to take a walk about his grounds, and ſo I ſtole here the time."</p>
                     <p>"What was your converſation during dinner?"</p>
                     <p>"Horſes, hay, farming, and politics."</p>
                     <p>"Won't you ſup with him?"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall ſee him again before I go to bed."</p>
                     <p>"And again to-morrow!"—cried Matilda, "what happineſs!"</p>
                     <p>"He has viſiters to-morrow," ſaid Sandford, "coming for a week or two."</p>
                     <p>"Thank heaven!" ſaid Miſs Woodley, "he will then be diverted from thinking on us."</p>
                     <p>"Do you know," returned Sandford, "it is my firm opinion, that his thinking of ye at preſent, is the cauſe of his good ſpirits."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, heavens!" cried Matilda, lifting up her hands with rapture.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, do not miſtake me;" ſaid Sandford; "I would not have you build a foundation for joy upon this; for if he is in ſpirits that you are in this houſe—ſo near him—poſitively under his protection—yet he will not allow himſelf to think, that is the cauſe of his content—and the ſentiments he has adopted, are now become natural to him, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame as ever; nay, perhaps with greater force, while he ſuſpects his weakneſs (as he calls it) acting in oppoſition."</p>
                     <p>"If he does but think of me with tenderneſs," cried Matilda, "I am recompenſed."</p>
                     <p>"And what recompenſe would his kind thoughts be to you," ſaid Sandford, "were he to turn you out to beggary?"</p>
                     <p>"A great deal—a great deal," ſhe replied.</p>
                     <p>"But how are you to know how he has theſe
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:025650_0243_0FCEB2A247A8B950"/>
kind thoughts, while he gives you no proof of them?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Mr. Sandford; but <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> we could know them without the proof?"</p>
                     <p>"But as that is impoſſible," anſwered he, "I ſhall ſuppoſe, till the proof appears, I am miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken."</p>
                     <p>Matilda looked deeply concerned that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould conclude in her diſappointment, for to have believed herſelf thought of with tenderneſs by her father, would have alone conſtituted her happineſs.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervant came up with ſomething by way of ſupper, he told Mr. Sandford his lordſhip was returned from his walk and had inquired for him; Sandford immediately bade his companions good night, and left them.</p>
                     <p>"How ſtrange is this!" cried Matilda, when Miſs Woodley and ſhe were alone, "My father within a few rooms of me, and yet I am debarred from ſeeing him!—Only by walking a few paces I might be at his feet, and perhaps receive his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing."</p>
                     <p>"You make me ſhudder," ſaid Miſs Woodley; "but ſome ſpirits leſs fearful than mine, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps adviſe you to try the experiment."</p>
                     <p>"Not for worlds," returned Matilda; "no counſel could tempt me to ſuch temerity; and yet to entertain the thought, that it is poſſible I could do this, is a ſource of great comfort."</p>
                     <p>This converſation laſted till bed-time, and later; for they ſat up beyond their uſual hour to indulge it.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley ſlept little, but Matilda leſs—ſhe awaked repeatedly during the night, and every time ſighed to herſelf, "I ſleep in the ſame houſe with my father! Bleſſed ſpirit of my mother, look down and rejoice."</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                     <p>THE next day the whole caſtle appeared to Lady Matilda (though ſhe was in ſome degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from it) all tumult and buſtle; as was uſually the caſe while his lordſhip was there. She ſaw from her windows ſervants running acroſs the yards and park, horſes and carriages driving with fury, all the ſuite of a nobleman; and it ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to elate, at other times to depreſs her.</p>
                     <p>Theſe impreſſions however, and others of fear and anxiety, which her father's firſt arrival had excited, by degrees wore away; and after ſome ſhort time, ſhe was in the ſame tranquil ſtate ſhe enjoyed before he came.</p>
                     <p>He had viſiters, to ſtay a week or two; he paid ſome viſits himſelf for ſeveral days; and thus the time paſſed, till it was about four weeks ſince he arrived; during which, Sandford, with all his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, could never clearly diſcover whether he had once called to mind his daughter was living in the ſame houſe. He had not named her (that was not extraordinary) conſequently no one durſt name her to him; but he had not even mentioned Miſs Woodley, of whom he had ſo lately ſpoken in the kindeſt terms, and ſaid, "He ſhould take pleaſure in ſeeing her again." From theſe contradictions in Lord Elmwood's behaviour in reſpect to her, it was Miſs Woodley's plan neither to throw herſelf in his way, or avoid him. She therefore frequently walked about the houſe while he was in it, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wholly without reſtraint, but at leaſt with the ſhow of liberty. This freedom, indulged for ſome time without peril, became at laſt leſs cautious;
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:025650_0245_0FCEB2A6B95E62D8"/>
and no ill conſequences ariſing from its practice, her ſcruples gradually ceaſed.</p>
                     <p>One morning, however, as ſhe was croſſing the large hall, thoughtleſs of danger, a footſtep at a diſtance alarmed her almoſt without knowing why—ſhe ſtopped for a moment, thinking to return; the ſteps approached quicker, and before ſhe could retreat, ſhe beheld Lord Elmwood at the other end of the hall, and perceived that he ſaw her.—It was now too late to heſitate what was to be done; ſhe could not go back, and had not courage to go on; ſhe therefore ſtood ſtill.—Diſconcerted, and much affected at his ſight, (their former intimacy coming to her mind, together with the many years, and many ſad occurrences paſſed, ſince ſhe laſt ſaw him) all her intentions, all her meditated plans how to conduct herſelf on ſuch an occaſion, gave way to a ſudden ſhock—and to make the meeting yet more diſtreſſing, her very fright ſhe knew muſt ſerve to recall more powerfully to his mind, the ſubject ſhe moſt wiſhed him to forget. The ſteward was with his lordſhip, and as they came up cloſe by her ſide, Giffard obſerving him look at her earneſtly, ſaid ſoftly, but ſo as ſhe heard him, "My lord, it is Miſs Woodley." Lord Elmwood's hat was off im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and coming to her with alacrity, he took her by the hand and ſaid, "Indeed, Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, I did not know you—I am very glad to ſee you;" and while he ſpoke, ſhook her hand with a cordiality her tender heart could not bear—and never did ſhe feel ſo hard a ſtruggle as to reſtrain her tears. But the thought of Matilda's fate—the idea of awaking in his mind a ſentiment that might irritate him againſt his child, wrought more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than every other effort; and though ſhe could not reply diſtinctly, ſhe replied without weeping.—Whether he ſaw her embarraſſment, and wiſhed
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:025650_0246_0FCEB272F4C6FC80"/>
to releaſe her from it, or was in haſte to conceal his own; he left her almoſt inſtantly; but not till he had intreated ſhe would dine that very day with him and Mr. Sandford, who were to dine without other company. She curtſied aſſent, and flew to tell Matilda what had occurred. After liſtening with anxiety and joy to all ſhe told, Matilda laid hold of that hand ſhe ſaid Lord Elmwood had held, and preſſed it to her lips with love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</p>
                     <p>When Miſs Woodley made her appearance at dinner, Sandford, (who had not ſeen her ſince the invitation, and did not know of it) looked amazed!—on which his lordſhip ſaid, "Do you know, Sandford, I met Miſs Woodley this morning, and had it not been for Giffard I ſhould have paſſed her without knowing her—out Miſs Woodley, if I am not ſo much altered but that you knew me, I take it unkind you did not ſpeak firſt."—She was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſpeak even now—he ſaw it, and changed the converſation; which Sandford was happy to join, for in the preſent diſcourſe he did not feel himſelf very comfortable.</p>
                     <p>As they advanced in their dinner, Miſs Woodley's and Sandford's embarraſſment diminiſhed; while Lord Elmwood in his turn became, not embarraſſed, but abſent and melancholy.—He now and then ſighed heavily—and called for wine much oftener than he was accuſtomed.</p>
                     <p>When Miſs Woodley took her leave, his lordſhip invited her to dine with him and Sandford whenever it was convenient to her;—he ſaid many things, too, of the ſame kind, and all with the utmoſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, yet not with that warmth with which he had ſpoken in the morning—into that he had been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, while this coolneſs was the effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe came to Lady Matilda, and Sandford
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:025650_0247_0FCEB2A846D7F018"/>
had joined them, they talked and deliberated on what had paſſed.—</p>
                     <p>"You acknowledge, Mr. Sandford," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "that you think my preſence affected Lord Elmwood ſo as to make him much more thoughtful than uſual; if you imagine theſe thoughts were upon Lady Elmwood, I would never intrude again; but if you ſuppoſe I cauſed him to think upon his daughter, I cannot go too often."</p>
                     <p>"I don't ſee how he can divide thoſe two objects in his mind," replied Sandford, "and therefore you muſt e'en viſit him on, and take your chance, what reflections you may inſpire; but, be they what they will, time will take away from you that power of affecting him."</p>
                     <p>She concurred in the opinion, and occaſionally walked in his lordſhip's apartments, dined, or took coffee with him, as the accident ſuited; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved according to Sandford's preſcience, that time wore off that impreſſion her viſits firſt made.—Lord Elmwood now became juſt the ſame before her, as before others.—She eaſily diſcerned, too, through all that politeneſs which he aſſumed—he was no longer the conſiderate, the forbearing cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he formerly was; but haughty, impatient, imperious, and more than ever, implacable.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Lord Elmwood had been at his country ſeat about ſix weeks, Mr. Ruſhbrook, his nephew, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

<pb n="246" facs="unknown:025650_0248_0FCEB2DF0BA25908"/>
uncle's houſe, and by her kindneſs preſerved there—arrived from his travels, and was received by his lordſhip with all that affectionate warmth due to the man he thought worthy to make his heir. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook had been a beautiful boy, and was now an extremely handſome young man; he had made an unuſual progreſs in his ſtudies, had completed the tour of Italy and Germany, and returned home with the air and addreſs of a perfect man of faſhion—there was, beſide, an elegance and perſuaſion in his manner almoſt irreſiſtible.—Yet with all thoſe accompliſhments, when he was introduced to Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and put out his hand to take his, Sandford, with evident reluctance, gave it to him; and when Lord Elmwood aſked him in the young man's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, "if he did not think his nephew greatly improved?" He looked at him from head to foot, and muttered, "he could not ſay be obſerved it." The colour heightened in Mr. Ruſhbrook's face upon this occaſion, but he was too well bred not to be ſtill in perfect good humour.</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſaw this young man treated in the houſe of Lord Elmwood with the ſame reſpect and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as if he had been his lordſhip's ſon; and it was but probable the old prieſt ſhould make a compariſon between the ſituation of him, and of Lady Matilda Elmwood.—Before her, it was Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's meaning to have concealed his thoughts upon the ſubject, and never to have mentioned it but with compoſure; that was, however, impoſſible—unuſed to conceal his feelings; at the name of Ruſhbrook, his countenance would always change, and a ſarcaſtic ſneer, and ſometimes a frown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, force their way in ſpite of his reſolution.—Miſs Woodley, too, with all her boundleſs cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and good will, was, upon this occaſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to limit their exceſs; and they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo far as to reach poor Ruſhbrook—She even,

and in <hi>reality,</hi> did not think him handſome or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in his manners—ſhe thought his gaiety fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volouſneſs, his complaiſance affectation, and his good humour impertinence.—It was impoſſible to conceal thoſe unfavourable ſentiments entirely from Matilda; for when the ſubject aroſe, as it frequently did, Miſs Woodley's undiſguiſed heart, and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's undiſguiſed countenance, told them inſtantly.—Matilda had the underſtanding to imagine, ſhe was, perhaps, the object who had thus deformed Mr. Ruſhbrook, and frequently (though he was a ſtranger to her, and one who had cauſed her many a jealous heart-ach) frequently ſhe would ſpeak in his vindication.</p>
                     <p>"You are very good," ſaid Sandford one day to her; "you like him becauſe you know your father loves him."</p>
                     <p>This was a hard ſentence to the daughter of Lord Elmwood, to whom her father's love would have been more precious than any other bleſſing—She, however, checked the aſſault of envy, and kindly replied,</p>
                     <p>"My mother loved him, too, Mr. Sandford."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," anſwered Sandford, "he has been a grateful man to your poor mother—She did not ſuppoſe when the took him into the houſe, when ſhe intreated your father to take him, and through her careſſes and officious praiſes of him to his uncle, firſt give him that power he now poſſeſſes over him; ſhe little foreſaw, at that time, his ingratitude, and its effects."</p>
                     <p>"Very true," ſaid Miſs Woodley, with a heavy ſigh.</p>
                     <p>"What ingratitude?" ſaid Matilda; "do you ſuppoſe Mr. Ruſhbrook is the cauſe my father will not ſee me? Oh do not pay Lord Elmwood's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſo ill a compliment."</p>
                     <p>"I do not ſay he is the abſolute cauſe," returned
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:025650_0250_0FCEB2E2B3EF5578"/>
Sandford; "but if a parent's heart is void, I would have it remain ſo, till ſtored by its lawful owner—a uſurper I deteſt."</p>
                     <p>"No one can take Lord Elmwood's heart by force," replied his daughter, "it muſt, I believe, be a free gift to the poſſeſſor; and as ſuch, whoever has it, has a right to it."</p>
                     <p>In this manner ſhe would plead the young man's excuſe—perhaps but to hear what could be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>id in his disfavour, for ſecretly his name was bitter to her—and once ſhe exclaimed in vexation, on Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's ſaying Lord Elmwood and Mr. Ruſhbrook were gone out ſhooting together,</p>
                     <p>"All that pleaſure is now eclipſed, which I uſed to take in liſtening to the report of my father's gun; for I cannot now diſtinguiſh his, from his paraſite's."</p>
                     <p>Sandford, much as he diſliked Ruſhbrook—for this expreſſion which compriſed her father in the reflection, turned to Matilda in extreme anger; but as he ſaw the colour mount to her face, for what, in the ſtrong feelings of her heart, had eſcaped her lips, he did not ſay a word—and by a flood of tears that followed after, he rejoiced to ſee how much ſhe reproved herſelf.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley, vext to the heart, and provoked every time ſhe ſaw Lord Elmwood and Ruſhbrook together, and ſaw the familiar terms on which this young man lived with his benefactor, now made her viſits to his lordſhip very ſeldom.—If Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood obſerved this, he did not appear to obſerve it; and though he received her very politely when ſhe did pay him a viſit, it was always very coldly; nor did ſhe ſuppoſe if ſhe never went, he would ever aſk for her. For his daughter's ſake, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe thought it right ſometimes to ſhow her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before him; for ſhe knew it muſt be impoſſible that, with all his ſeeming indifference, Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:025650_0251_0FCEB2AD741BFF10"/>
could ever ſee her without thinking for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his child; and what one fortunate thought might ſometime bring about, was an object too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for her to ſlight.—She therefore, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining confined to her apartments near three weeks, (excepting thoſe ſhort and anxious walks ſhe and Matilda ſtole, while Lord Elmwood dined, or before he roſe in a morning) went one forenoon into his lordſhip's apartments, where as uſual, ſhe found him, Mr. Sandford, and Mr. Ruſhbrook.—After ſhe had ſat about half an hour, converſing with them all, though but very little with the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his lordſhip was called out of the room upon ſome buſineſs; preſently after Sandford; and now, not much pleaſed with the companion with whom ſhe was left, ſhe roſe and was going likewiſe, when Ruſhbrook fixed his ſpeaking eyes upon her, and cried,</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Woodley, will you pardon me what I am going to ſay?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly, Sir—You can, I am ſure, ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what I muſt forgive."—But ſhe made this reply with a diſtance and reſerve, very unlike the uſual manner of Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>He looked at her earneſtly, and cried, "Ah! Miſs Woodley, you don't behave ſo kindly to me as you uſed to do!"</p>
                     <p>"I do not underſtand you, Sir,"—ſhe replied, very gravely;—"Times are changed, Mr. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, ſince you were laſt here—you were then but a child."</p>
                     <p>"Yet I love all thoſe perſons now, I loved then;" replied he; "and ſo I ſhall for ever."</p>
                     <p>"But you miſtake, Mr. Ruſhbrook; I was not even then ſo very much the object of your affections—there were other ladies you loved better.—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you don't remember Lady Elmwood?"</p>
                     <p>"Don't I?" cried he, "Oh!" (claſping his
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:025650_0252_0FCEB2E435426E10"/>
hands and lifting up his eyes to heaven) "ſhall I ever forget her?"</p>
                     <p>That moment Lord Elmwood opened the door; the converſation of courſe that moment ended; but confuſion at the ſudden ſurpriſe was on the face of both the parties—his lordſhip ſaw it, and looked at each by turns, with a ſternneſs that made poor Miſs Woodley ready to faint; while Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, with the moſt natural and happy laugh that ever was affected, cried, "No, don't tell my lord, pray, Miſs Woodley." She was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed than before; and his lordſhip turning to him, aſked what the ſubject was.—By this time he had invented one, and continuing his laugh, ſaid, "Miſs Woodley, my lord, will to this day proteſt ſhe ſaw my apparition when I was a boy; and ſhe ſays it is a ſign I ſhall die young, and is really much affected at it."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood turned away before this ridiculous ſpeech was concluded; yet ſo well had it been acted, he did not for an inſtant doubt its truth.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley felt herſelf greatly relieved; and yet ſo little is it in the power of thoſe we diſlike to do any thing to pleaſe us, that from this very circumſtance, ſhe formed a ſtill more unfavourable opinion of Mr. Ruſhbrook than ſhe had done before.—She ſaw in this little incident the art of diſſimulation, cunning, and duplicity in its moſt glaring ſhape; and deteſted the method by which they had each eſcaped Lord Elmwood's ſuſpicion, and perhaps anger, the more, becauſe it was ſo dexterouſly managed.</p>
                     <p>Lady Matilda and Sandford were both in their turns informed of this trait in Mr. Ruſhbrook's character; and although Miſs Woodley had the beſt of diſpoſitions, and upon every occaſion ſpoke the ſtricteſt truth; yet in relating this occurrence,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:025650_0253_0FCEB2AF0080E800"/>
ſhe did not ſpeak all the truth; for every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that would have told to the young man's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>literally</hi> ſlipped her memory.</p>
                     <p>The twenty-ninth of October arrived; on which a dinner, a ball, and a ſupper, was given by Lord Elmwood to all the neighbouring gentry—the peaſants alſo dined in the park off a roaſted bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock; ſeveral caſks of ale were diſtributed, and the bells of the village rung.—Matilda, who heard and ſaw ſome part of this feſtivity from her windows, inquired the cauſe; but even the ſervant who waited upon her had too much ſenſibility to tell her, and anſwered, "he did not know." Miſs Woodley, however, ſoon learnt the reaſon, and groaning with the painful ſecret, informed her, "Mr. Ruſhbrook on that day was come of age."</p>
                     <p>"My birth-day was laſt week," replied Matilda; but not a word beſide.</p>
                     <p>In their retired apartments, the day paſſed away not only ſoberly, but almoſt ſilently; for to ſpeak upon any ſubject that did not engage their thoughts had been difficult, and to ſpeak upon the only one that did, had been afflictive.</p>
                     <p>Juſt as they were ſitting down to dinner, their bell gently rung, and in walked Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Why are you not among the revellers, Mr. Sandford?" cried Miſs Woodley, with an ironical ſneer—(the firſt her features ever wore)—"Pray, were not you invited to dine with the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Sandford; but my head aked; and ſo I had rather come and take a bit with you."</p>
                     <p>"Matilda, as if ſhe had beheld his heart as he ſpoke, clung round his neck and ſobbed on his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom: he put her peeviſhly away, crying, "Nonſenſe, nonſenſe—eat your dinner." But he did not eat himſelf.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                     <p>ABOUT a week after this, Lord Elmwood went out two days for a viſit: conſequently Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook was for that time maſter of the houſe. The firſt morning he went a ſhooting, and returning about noon, inquired of Sandford, who was ſitting in the room, if he had taken up a volume of plays left upon the table—"I read no ſuch things," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sandford, and quitted the room abruptly.—Ruſhbrook then rung for his ſervant, and deſired him to look for the book, aſking him angrily, "Who had been in the apartment? for he was ſure he had left it there when he went out."—The ſervant withdrew to inquire, and preſently returned with the volume in his hand, and "Miſs Woodley's compliments, ſhe begs your pardon, Sir, ſhe did not know the book was yours, and hopes you will excuſe the liberty ſhe took."</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Woodley!" cried Ruſhbrook, with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, "ſhe comes ſo ſedom into theſe apartments, I did not ſuppoſe it was her who had it—take it back to her inſtantly, with my reſpects, and I beg ſhe will keep it."</p>
                     <p>The man went; but returned with the book again, and laying it on the table without ſpeaking, was going away; when Ruſhbrook, hurt at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no ſecond meſſage, ſaid, "I am afraid, Sir, you did very wrong in taking this book from Miſs Woodley."</p>
                     <p>"It was not from her I took it, Sir," replied the man, "it was from Lady Matilda."</p>
                     <p>Since he had entered the houſe, Ruſhbrook had never before heard her name—he was ſhocked—confounded more than ever—and to conceal what
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:025650_0255_0FCEB2B25BB75A28"/>
he felt, inſtantly ordered the man out of the room.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Miſs Woodley and Matilda were talking over this trifling occurrence; and frivolous as it was, drew from it ſtrong concluſions of Ruſhbrook's inſolence and power.—In ſpite of her pride, the daughter of Lord Elmwood even wept at the inſult ſhe had received on this inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant occaſion; for the volume being merely taken from her at Mr. Ruſhbrook's command, ſhe felt an inſult; and the manner in which it was done by the ſervant, might contribute to the offence.</p>
                     <p>While Miſs Woodley and ſhe were upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, a note came from Ruſhbrook to Miſs Woodley, wherein he intreated that he might be permitted to ſee her.—She ſent a verbal anſwer, "She was engaged." He ſent again, begging ſhe would name her own time. But certain of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond denial, he followed the ſervant who took the laſt meſſage, and as Miſs Woodley came out of her apartment into the gallery to ſpeak to him, Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook preſented himſelf, and told the man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Ruſhbrook," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "this intruſion is inſupportable;—and deſtitute as you may think me of the friendſhip of Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood"—</p>
                     <p>In the ardour with which Ruſhbrook was waiting to expreſs himſelf, he interrupted her, and caught hold of her hand.</p>
                     <p>She immediately ſnatched it from him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew into her chamber.</p>
                     <p>He followed, ſaying, in a low voice, "Dear Miſs Woodley, hear me."</p>
                     <p>At that juncture Lady Matilda, who was in an inner room, came out of it into Miſs Woodley's.—Perceiving a gentleman, ſhe ſtopped ſhort at the door.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="254" facs="unknown:025650_0256_0FCEB2EB51A50F30"/>
Ruſhbrook caſt his eyes upon her, and ſtood motionleſs—his lips only moved. "Do not depart, Madam," ſaid he, "without hearing my apology for being here."</p>
                     <p>Though Matilda had never ſeen him ſince her infancy, there was no cauſe to tell her who it was that addreſſed her—his elegant and youthful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, joined to the incident which had juſt occurred, convinced her it was Ruſhbrook; and ſhe looked at him with an air of ſurpriſe, but with ſtill more, of dignity.</p>
                     <p>"Miſs Woodley is ſevere upon me, Madam," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "ſhe judges me unkindly; and I am afraid ſhe will prepoſſeſs you with the ſame unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſentiments."</p>
                     <p>Still Matilda did not ſpeak, but looked at him with the ſame air of dignity.</p>
                     <p>"If, Lady Matilda," reſumed he, "I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended you, and muſt quit you without pardon, I am more unhappy than I ſhould be with the loſs of your father's protection—more forlorn, than when an orphan boy, your mother firſt took pity on me."</p>
                     <p>At this laſt ſentence, Matilda turned her eyes on Miſs Woodley, and ſeemed in doubt what reply ſhe was to give.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook immediately fell upon his knees—"Oh! Lady Matilda," cried he, "if you knew the ſenſations of my heart, you would not treat me with this diſdain."</p>
                     <p>"We can only judge of thoſe ſenſations, Mr. Ruſhbrook," ſaid Miſs Woodley, "by the effect they have upon your conduct; and while you inſult Lord and Lady Elmwood's daughter by an intruſion like this, and then ridicule her abject ſtate by mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, ſuch as the preſent"—</p>
                     <p>He flew from his knees inſtantly, and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, crying, "What can I do?—What am I to ſay, to make you change your opinion of me?—
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:025650_0257_0FCEB2B3B10502E0"/>
While Lord Elmwood has been at home, I have kept at an awful diſtance; and though every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I breathed, was a wiſh to caſt myſelf at his daughter's feet; yet as I feared, Miſs Woodley, you were incenſed againſt me, by what means was I to procure an interview, but by ſtratagem or force?—This accident has given a third method, and I had not ſtrength, I had not courage, to let it paſs.—Lord Elmwood will ſoon return, and we may both be hurried to town immediately;—then how for a tedious winter, could I ſuſtain the thought that I was deſpiſed, nay perhaps conſidered as an object of ingratitude, by the only child of my deceaſed bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factreſs?"</p>
                     <p>Matilda replied with all her father's haughtineſs, "Depend upon it, Sir, if you ſhould ever enter my thoughts, it will only be as an object of envy."</p>
                     <p>"Suffer me then, Madam," ſaid he, "as an earneſt you do not think worſe of me than I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſuffer me to be ſometimes admitted into your preſence."</p>
                     <p>She ſcarcely permitted him to finiſh the period, before ſhe replied, "This is the laſt time, Sir, we ſhall ever meet, depend upon it—unleſs, indeed, Lord Elmwood ſhould delegate to you the control of me—his commands I never diſpute." And here ſhe burſt into a flood of tears.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook walked to the window, and did not ſpeak for a ſhort time—then turning himſelf to make a reply, both Matilda and Miſs Woodley were ſomewhat ſurpriſed to ſee, he had ſhed tears too.—Having conquered them, he ſaid, "I will not offend you, Madam, by ſtaying one moment longer; and I give my honour, that, upon no pretence whatever, will I preſume to intrude here again.—Profeſſions, I find, have no weight, and only by this obedience to your orders can I give a proof of
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:025650_0258_0FCEB2EC780D1348"/>
that reſpect which you inſpire;—and let the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I now feel, convince you, Lady Matilda, that, with all my ſeeming good fortune, I am not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than yourſelf."—And ſo much was he agitated while he delivered this, it was with difficulty he came to the concluſion.—When he did, he bowed with reverence, as if he had left the preſence of a deity, and went away.</p>
                     <p>Matilda immediately entered the chamber ſhe had come from, and without caſting a ſingle look at Miſs Woodley, by which ſhe might gueſs of the opinion ſhe had formed of Mr. Ruſhbrook's conduct.—The next time they met, they did not even mention his name; for they were aſhamed to own any partiality in his favour, and were too juſt to bring any ſerious accuſation againſt him.</p>
                     <p>But Miſs Woodley the day following communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the intelligence of this viſit to Mr. Sandford, who not being preſent, and a witneſs of thoſe marks of humility and reſpect which were conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the deportment of Mr. Ruſhbrook, was highly offended at his preſumption; and threatened if he ever dared to force his company there again, he would acquaint Lord Elmwood with his arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, whatever might be the event.—Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, however, aſſured him, ſhe believed he would have no cauſe for ſuch a complaint, as the young man had made the moſt ſolemn promiſe never to commit the like offence; and ſhe thought it her duty to enjoin Sandford, till he did repeat it, not to mention the circumſtance, even to Ruſhbrook himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Matilda could not but feel a regard towards her father's heir, in return for that which he had ſo fervently declared for her; yet the more favourable her opinion of his mind and manners, the more he became a proper object of her jealouſy for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Lord Elmwood, and was now conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:025650_0259_0FCEB2B4F5ADB6E8"/>
an object of greater ſorrow to her, than when ſhe believed him leſs worthy.—This, was the reverſe on his part towards her—no jealouſy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened to bar his admiration and eſteem, and the beauty of her perſon, and grandeur of her mien, not only confirmed, but improved, the exalted idea he had formed of her previous to their meeting, and which his affection to both her parents had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.—The next time he ſaw his benefactor, he began to feel a new eſteem and regard for him, for his daughter's ſake; as he had at firſt an eſteem for her on the foundation of his love for Lord and Lady Elmwood—He gazed with wonder at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's inſenſibility to his own happineſs, and longed to lead him to the jewel he caſt away, though even his own expulſion ſhould be the fatal conſequence.—Such was the youthful, warm; generous, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but unthinking mind of Ruſhbrook.</p>

                     <p>Partly therefore to indulge her hapleſs compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and partly becauſe it was a neceſſary duty, Miſs Woodley paid his lordſhip a morning viſit, and ſtaid dinner.—Ruſhbrook was officiouſly polite to her, (for that was the epithet ſhe gave his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in relating it to Lady Matilda) yet ſhe owned he had not that forward impertinence ſhe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſcovered in him, but appeared much more grave and ſedate.</p>
                     <p>"But tell me of my father," ſaid Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"I was going, my dear—but don't be concerned—don't let it vex you."</p>
                     <p>"What? what?" cried Matilda, frightened by the preface.</p>
                     <p>"Why, on my obſerving that I thought Mr. Ruſhbrook looked paler than uſual, and appeared not to be in perfect health, (which was really the caſe) your father expreſſed the greateſt anxiety imaginable; he ſaid he could not bear to ſee him look ſo ill, begged him with all the tenderneſs of a parent, to take the advice of a phyſician, and added a thouſand other affectionate things."</p>
                     <p>"I deteſt Mr. Ruſhbrook,"—ſaid Matilda, with her eyes flaſhing indignation.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, for ſhame," returned Miſs Woodley: "do you ſuppoſe I told you this, to make you hate him?"</p>
                     <p>"No, there was no occaſion for that," replied Matilda; "my ſentiments (though I had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore avowed them) were long ago formed; he was
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:025650_0261_0FCEB2B8936D3888"/>
always an object which added to my unhappineſs; but ſince his daring intruſion into my apartments, he has been an object of my hatred."</p>
                     <p>"But now perhaps I may tell you ſomething to pleaſe you," cried Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"And what is that?" ſaid Matilda, with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for the firſt intelligence had hurt her ſpirits too much to ſuffer her to liſten with pleaſure to any other.</p>
                     <p>"Mr Ruſhbrook," continued Miſs Woodley, replied to your father, "his indiſpoſition was but a ſlight nervous fever, and he would defer a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's advice till he went to London—on which his lordſhip ſaid, "And when do you expect to be there?"—he replied, "Within a week or two, I ſuppoſe, my lord." But your father anſwered, "I do not mean to go myſelf till after Chriſtmas."—"No indeed, my lord!" ſaid Mr. Sandford, with ſurpriſe: "you have not paſſed your Chriſtmas here," continued he, "theſe many a year."—"No," returned his lordſhip; "but I think myſelf more attached to this houſe at preſent, than ever I did in my life."</p>
                     <p>"You imagine then, my father thought of me, when he ſaid that?" cried Matilda eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"But I may be miſtaken," replied Miſs Woodley.—"I leave you to judge.—But I am ſure Mr. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford imagined he thought of you, for I ſaw a ſmile over his whole face immediately."</p>
                     <p>"Did you, Miſs Woodley?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; it appeared on every feature except his lips; thoſe he cloſed faſt together, for fear Lord Elmwood ſhould perceive it."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley with all her minute intelligence, did not however acquaint Matilda that Ruſhbrook followed her to the window while his lordſhip was out of the room, and Sandford half aſleep at the other end of it, and inquired reſpectfully and anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:025650_0262_0FCEB2F1F29AECF0"/>
for her Ladyſhip; adding, "It is my concern for Lady Matilda, which makes me thus indiſpoſed: I ſuffer more than her; but I am not permitted to tell her ſo, nor can I hope, Miſs Woodley, you will."—She replied, "You are right, Sir." Nor did ſhe reveal this converſation, while not a ſentence that paſſed except that, was omitted.</p>
                     <p>When Chriſtmas arrived, Lord Elmwood had many convivial days at Elmwood Houſe; but the name of Matilda was never mentioned by one of his gueſts, and moſt probably was never thought of.—During all thoſe holidays ſhe was unuſually me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but ſunk into the deepeſt dejection when ſhe was told the day was fixed on which her father was to depart for the ſeaſon.—On the morning of that day ſhe wept inceſſantly; and all her conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, "She would go to the chamber window which was fronting the door he was to paſs through to his carriage, and for the firſt time, and moſt likely for the laſt time of her life, behold him."</p>
                     <p>This deſign was ſoon forgot in another:—"She would ruſh boldly into the apartment where he was, and at his feet take leave of him for ever—She would lay hold of his hands, claſp his knees, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to ſpurn her, which would be joy in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to this cruel indifference."—In the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her grief, ſhe once called upon her mother, and reproached her memory—but the moment ſhe recollected the offence (which was almoſt inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly) ſhe became all mildneſs and reſignation. "What have I ſaid?" cried ſhe; "Dear, dear ſaint, forgive me, and behold for your ſake I will bear all with patience—I will not groan, I will not even ſigh again—this taſk I ſet myſelf to atone for what I have dared to utter."</p>
                     <p>While Lady Matilda laboured under theſe variety of ſenſations, Miſs Woodley was occupied in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing and endeavouring to calm her ſorrows—and
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:025650_0263_0FCEB2B9B558C0E8"/>
Lord Elmwood with Ruſhbrook, was prepared ready to ſet off.—His lordſhip, however, loitered, and did not once ſeem in haſte to be gone.—When at laſt he got up to depart, Sandford thought he preſſed his hand, and ſhook it with more warmth than ever he had done in his life.—Encouraged by this ſuppoſition, Sandford, with tears ſtarting in his eyes, ſaid, "my lord, won't you condeſcend to take your leave of Miſs Woodley?"—"Certainly, Sandford," replied his lordſhip, and ſeemed glad of an excuſe to ſit down again.</p>
                     <p>Impreſſed with the idea of the ſtate in which ſhe had left his only child, Miſs Woodley, when ſhe came before Lord Elmwood to bid him farewell, not pale, trembling, and in tears—Sandford, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his lordſhip's apparent kind humour, was ſhocked at the conſtruction he muſt put upon her appearance, and cried, "What, Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, are you not recovered of your illneſs yet." Lord Elmwood, however, took no notice of her looks, but after wiſhing her health and happineſs, walked ſlowly out of the houſe; turning back fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſpeaking to Sandford or ſome other perſon who was behind him, as if part of his thoughts was left behind, and he went with reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>When he had quitted the room where Miſs Woodley was; Ruſhbrook, timid before her, as ſhe had been before her benefactor, went up to her all humility, and ſaid, "Miſs Woodley, we ought to be friends; our concern, our devotion, is paid to the ſame objects, and one common intereſt ſhould teach us to be friendly."</p>
                     <p>She made no reply.—"Will you permit me to write to you when I am away?" ſaid he; "You may wiſh to hear of Lord Elmwood's health, and of what changes may take place in his reſolutions—Will you permit me?"—At that moment a
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:025650_0264_0FCEB2F338F5C980"/>
ſervant came and ſaid, "Sir, my lord is in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and waiting for you." He haſted away, and Miſs Woodley was relieved from the pain of giving him a denial.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was the chariot, with all its attendants, out of ſight, than Lady Matilda was conducted by Miſs Woodley from her lonely retreat, into that part of the houſe from whence her father had juſt departed—and ſhe viſited every ſpot where he had ſo long reſided, with a pleaſing curioſity that for a while diverted her grief.—In the breakfaſt and dining rooms, ſhe leaned over thoſe ſeats with a kind of filial piety, on which ſhe was told he had been accuſtomed to ſit. And in the library ſhe took up with filial delight, the pen with which he had been writing; and looked with the moſt curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention into thoſe books that were laid upon his reading-deſk.—But a hat, laying on one of the tables, gave her a ſenſation beyond any other ſhe experienced on this occaſion—in that trifling article of his dreſs, ſhe thought ſhe ſaw he himſelf, and held it in her hand with pious reverence.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Lord Elmwood and Ruſhbrook were proceeding on their road with hearts not leſs heavy than thoſe which they had left at Elmwood Houſe, though neither of them could ſo well as Matilda, tell the cauſe of the weight.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                     <p>YOUNG as Lady Matilda was during the life of her mother, neither her youth, nor the recluſe ſtate in which ſhe lived, had precluded her from the notice and ſolicitations of a nobleman who had
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:025650_0265_0FCEB2BB0338C4A0"/>
profeſſed himſelf her lover. Viſcount Margrave had an eſtate not far diſtant from the retreat Lady Elmwood had choſen, and being devoted to the ſports of the country, he ſeldom quitted it for any of thoſe joys which the town afforded.—He was a young man, of a handſome perſon, and was what his neighbours ſtyled "A man of ſpirit."—He was an excellent fox-hunter, and as excellent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion over his bottle at the end of the chace—he was prodigal of his fortune in all caſes where his pleaſures were concerned, and as thoſe pleaſures were moſtly ſocial, his ſporting companions and his miſtreſſes (for theſe were alſo of the plural number) partook largely of his wealth.</p>
                     <p>Two months previous to Lady Elmwood's death, Miſs Woodley and Lady Matilda were taking their uſual walk in ſome fields and lanes near to their houſe, when chance threw Lord Margrave in their way, during a thunder ſtorm in which they were ſuddenly caught; and he had the ſatisfaction to convey his new acquaintances to their home in his carriage, ſafe from the fury of the elements—Grateful for the ſervices his lordſhip had rendered them, Miſs Woodley and her charge permitted him to inquire occaſionally of their healths, and would ſometimes ſee him.—The ſtory of Lady Elmwood was known to Lord Margrave, and as he beheld her daughter with a paſſion ſuch as he had been unuſed to overcome, he indulged it with the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hope, that on the death of the mother, Lord Elmwood would receive his child, and perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him as his ſon-in-law.—Wedlock was not the plan which Lord Margrave had ever propoſed to himſelf for happineſs; but the exceſs of his love on this new occaſion, ſubdued every reſolution he had taken againſt the marriage ſtate, and not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hope for the conſummation of his wiſhes by any other means, he ſuffered himſelf to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:025650_0266_0FCEB2F712751900"/>
to that, as his only reſource.—No ſooner was the long-expected death of Lady Elmwood arrived, than his lordſhip waited with impatience to hear Lady Matilda was ſent for and acknowledged by her father; for he meant to be the firſt to lay before Lord Elmwood his pretenſions as a ſuitor.—But theſe pretenſions were founded on the vague hopes of a lover only; and Miſs Woodley, to whom he firſt declared them, ſaid every thing poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of their ſalaciouſneſs.—As to the object of his paſſion, ſhe was not only inſenſible, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inattentive to all that was ſaid to her on the ſubject.—Lady Elmwood died without ever being diſturbed with it; for her daughter did not even remember his propoſals ſo as to repeat them again, and Miſs Woodley thought it prudent to conceal from her friend, every new incident which might give her cauſe for freſh anxieties.</p>
                     <p>When Sandford and the ladies left the north and came to Elmwood Houſe, ſo much were their thoughts employed with other ideas, Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave did not occupy a place; and during the whole time they had been at their new abode, they had never once heard of him.—He had, nevertheleſs, his whole mind fixed upon Lady Matilda, and placed ſpies in the neighbourhood to inform him of every circumſtance in her ſituation.—Having imbibed an averſion to matrimony, he heard with but little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, that there was no proſpect of her ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming her father's heir; while ſuch an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gave him the hope of obtaining her, upon the illegal terms of a miſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood's departure to town forwarded this hope, and flattering himſelf that the humiliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſituation in which Matilda muſt feel herſelf in the houſe of her father, might gladly induce her to take ſhelter under any other protection, he boldly advanced as ſoon as the earl was gone, to make ſuch
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:025650_0267_0FCEB2BC90FD0B78"/>
overtures as his wiſhes and his vanity told him, could not be rejected.</p>
                     <p>Inquiring for Miſs Woodley, he eaſily gained admittance; but at the ſight of ſo much modeſty, and dignity in the perſon of Matilda, ſo much good will, and yet ſuch circumſpection in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; and the good ſenſe and proper ſpirit which were always apparent in the manners of Sandford, his lordſhip fell once more into the deſpondency, of becoming to Lady Matilda nothing more important to his reputation, than a huſband.</p>
                     <p>Even that humble hope was, however, ſometimes denied him, while Sandford ſet forth the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of troubling Lord Elmwood on ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at preſent; and while the viſcount's penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſmall as it was, diſcovered in his fair one, much more to diſcourage than to favour his wiſhes.—Plunged, however, too deep in his paſſion, to emerge from it in haſte, he meant ſtill to viſit, and wait for a change to happier circumſtances, when he was peremptorily deſired by Mr. Sandford, to deſiſt from ever coming again.</p>
                     <p>"Wherefore, Mr. Sandford?" cried his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>"For two reaſons, my lord;—in the firſt place, your viſits might be diſpleaſing to Lord Elmwood;—in the next place, I know they are ſo to his daughter."</p>
                     <p>Unaccuſtomed to be ſpoken to ſo plainly, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in a caſe where his heart was intereſted, his lordſhip nevertheleſs ſubmitted with patience; but in his own mind determined how long this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould continue—no longer than it ſerved as the means to prove his obedience, and by that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, ſecure his better reception at ſome future pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
                     <p>On his return home, cheered with the huzzas of his jovial companions, he began to conſult his
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:025650_0268_0FCEB2F875BF52B8"/>
friends, what ſcheme was beſt to be adopted for the accompliſhment of his deſires.—Some, boldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed application to the father, in defiance to the old prieſt; but that was the very laſt method his lordſhip himſelf approved, as marriage muſt inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably have followed Lord Elmwood's conſent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, though a peer, Lord Margrave was unuſed to rank with peers; and even the neceſſary formality of an interview with one of his equals, carried along with it a terror, or at leaſt a fatigue, to a ruſtic baron.—Others of his companions, adviſed ſeduction; but happily his lordſhip poſſeſſed no arts of this kind to affect a heart appendant to ſuch a mind as Matilda's.—There were not wanting among his moſt favourite counſellors, ſome who painted the triumph and gratification of force; thoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him there was nothing to apprehend under this head; as from the behaviour of Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to his child, it was more than probable he would be utterly indifferent to any violence that might be offered her.—This laſt advice ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the aid of wine; and no ſooner had the wine freely circulated, than this was always the ſcheme which appeared by far the beſt.</p>
                     <p>While Lord Margrave alternately cheriſhed his hopes and his fears in the country, Ruſhbrook in town gave way to his fears only—every day of his life made him more acquainted with the firm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken temper of Lord Elmwood, and every day whiſpered more forcibly to his own heart, that pity, gratitude, and friendſhip, ſtrong and affectionate as theſe paſſions are, are weak and cold to that, which had gained the poſſeſſion of him—he doubted, but be did not long doubt, that which he felt was love.—"And yet," ſaid he to himſelf, "it is love of hat kind, which ariſing from cauſes independant of the object itſelf, can ſcarcely deſerve this ſacred itle—Did I not love Lady Matilda before I beheld
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:025650_0269_0FCEB2BDF4ACE0E8"/>
her?—for her mother's ſake I loved her—and even for her father's.—Should I have felt the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for her, had ſhe been the child of other parents?—no. Or ſhould I have felt that ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic tenderneſs which now preys upon my health, had not her misfortunes excited it?—no."—Yet the love which is the reſult of gratitude and pity only, he thought had little claim to rank with his; and after the moſt deliberate and deep reflection, he concluded with this deciſive opinion—He had loved Lady Matilda, in <hi>whatever ſtate,</hi> in <hi>whatever circumſtances;</hi> and that the tenderneſs he felt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and the anxiety for her happineſs before he knew her, extreme as they were, were yet cool and diſpaſſionate ſenſations, compared to that which her perſon and demeanor had incited—and though he acknowledged, that by thoſe preceding ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments his heart was ſoftened, prepared, and moulded, as it were, to receive this laſt impreſſion; yet the violence of his paſſion told him genuine love, if not the baſis on which it was founded, had been the certain conſequence.—With a ſtrict ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny into his heart, he ſought this knowledge, but arrived at it with a regret that amounted to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>
                     <p>To ſhield himſelf from deſpondency, he formed in his mind a thouſand projects, depicting the joys of his union with Lady Matilda; but her father's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placability ſtood foremoſt, and confounded them all—His lordſhip was a man who made but few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions—thoſe were the effect of deliberation; and as he was not the leaſt capricious or inconſtant in his temper, they were reſolutions which no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable event could ſhake.—Love, that produces wonders—that ſeduces and ſubdues the moſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and rigid ſpirits, had in two inſtances over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the inflexibility of Lord Elmwood; he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:025650_0270_0FCEB2F9F4B76068"/>
Lady Elmwood contrary to his determination, becauſe he loved; and for the ſake of this beloved object, he had, contrary to his reſolution, taken under his immediate care young Ruſhbrook; but the magic which once enchanted away this ſpirit of immutability was no more—Lady Elmwood was no more, and the charm was broken.</p>
                     <p>As Miſs Woodley was deprived the opportunity of deſiring Ruſhbrook not to write when he aſked her the permiſſion, he paſſed one whole morning in the gratification of forming and writing a letter to her, which he thought might poſſibly be ſhown to Matilda.—As he durſt not touch upon any of thoſe circumſtances in which he was the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted, that, joined to the reſpect he wiſhed to pay the lady to whom he wrote, limited his letter to about twenty lines; yet the ſtudious manner with which theſe lines were dictated, the hope and fear they might, or might not, be ſeen and regarded by Lady Matilda, rendered the taſk an anxiety ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he could have wiſhed it to have laſted for a year; and in all this magnifying of trifles was diſcoverable, the never-failing ſymptom of ardent love.</p>
                     <p>A reply to this formal addreſs, was a reward he wiſhed for with impatience, but he wiſhed in vain; and in the midſt of his chagrin at the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſorrow little thought of, occurred, and gave him a perturbation of mind he had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore experienced.—Lord Elmwood propoſed a wife to him; and in a way ſo aſſured of his acquieſcence, that if Ruſhbrook's life had depended upon his daring to diſpute his benefactor's will, he would not have had the courage to have done ſo. There was, however, in his reply, and his embarraſſment, ſomething which his lordſhip diſcerned from a free concurrence; and looking ſtedfaſtly at him, he ſaid, in that ſtern manner which he now almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly adopted,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="269" facs="unknown:025650_0271_0FCEB2C191931988"/>
"You have no engagements, I ſuppoſe? have made no previous promiſes?"</p>
                     <p>"None on earth, my lord," replied Ruſhbrook candidly.</p>
                     <p>"Nor have you diſpoſed of your heart?"</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord," replied he; but not candidly,—nor with the appearance of candour: for though he ſpoke haſtily, it was rather like a man frightened than aſſured.—He hurried to tell the falſehood he thought himſelf obliged to tell, that the pain and ſhame might be over; but there Ruſhbrook was deceived; the lie once told was as troubleſome as in the conception, and added to his firſt confuſion, an increaſing one.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood now fixed his eyes upon him with a ſullen contempt, and riſing from his ſeat, ſaid, "Ruſhbrook, if you have been ſo inconſiderate as to give away your heart, tell me ſo at once, and tell me the object."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook ſhuddered at the thought.</p>
                     <p>"I here," continued his lordſhip, "tolerate the firſt untruth you ever told me as the falſe aſſertion of a lover; and give you an opportunity to recall it—but after this moment, it is a lie between man and man—a lie to your friend and father, and I will not forgive it."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook ſtood ſilent, confuſed, alarmed, and bewildered in his thoughts.—His lordſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,</p>
                     <p>"Name the perſon, if there is any ſuch, on whom you have beſtowed your heart; and though I do not give you the ſmalleſt hope I ſhall not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your folly, I will at leaſt not reproach you for having at firſt denied it."</p>
                     <p>To repeat theſe words in writing, the reader muſt condemn the young man, that he could heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to own he loved, if he was even afraid to name
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:025650_0272_0FCEB2FF01DABF28"/>
the object of his paſſion; but his lordſhip, in his queſtion, had made the two anſwers inſeparable, and all evaſions of the ſecond, Ruſhbrook knew would be fruitleſs, after having avowed the firſt—and how could he confeſs the latter? The abſolute orders he received from the ſteward on his return from his travels, were, "Never to mention his daughter, any more than his late wife, before Lord Elmwood."—The fault of having rudely intruded into Lady Matilda's preſence, ruſhed too upon his mind; for he did not even dare to ſay, by what means he had beheld her.—But more than all, the threatening manner, in which his lordſhip uttered this rational and ſeeming conciliating ſpeech, the menaces, the ſeverity which ſat upon his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance while he delivered thoſe moderate words, might have intimidated a man wholly independent, and leſs uſed to fear him than his nephew had been.</p>
                     <p>"You make no anſwer, Sir?" ſaid his lordſhip, after waiting a few moments for his reply.</p>
                     <p>"I have only to ſay, my lord," returned Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook, "that although my heart may be totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged, I may yet be diſinclined to the proſpect of marriage."</p>
                     <p>"May! May! Your heart <hi>may</hi> be diſengaged," repeated his lordſhip. "Do you dare to reply to me equivocally, when I have aſked a poſitive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?"</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps I am not poſitive myſelf, my lord; but I will inquire the ſtate of my mind, and make you acquainted with it very ſoon."</p>
                     <p>As the angry demeanor of his uncle affected Ruſhbrook with fear, ſo that fear, powerfully (but with proper manlineſs) expreſſed, again ſoftened the diſpleaſure of Lord Elmwood; and ſeeing and pitying his nephew's ſenſibility, he now changed his auſtere voice, and ſaid mildly, but firmly,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="271" facs="unknown:025650_0273_0FCEB2C273895C00"/>
"I give you a week to conſult with yourſelf; at the expiration of that time I ſhall talk with you again, and I command you to be then prepared to ſpeak, not only without deceit, but without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." He left the room at theſe words, and left Ruſhbrook releaſed from a fate which his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions had beheld impending that moment.</p>
                     <p>He had now a week to call his thoughts together, to weigh every circumſtance, and to determine whether implicitly to ſubmit to his lordſhip's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation for a wife, or revolt from it, and ſee ſome other more ſubſervient to his will, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his heir.</p>
                     <p>Undetermined how to act upon this great trial, which was to decide his future deſtiny, Ruſhbrook ſuffered ſo poignant an uncertainty, that he became at length ill, and before the end of the week which his uncle had allotted him for his reply, he was confined to his bed in a high fever.—His lordſhip was extremely affected at his indiſpoſition; he gave him every care he could beſtow, and even a great deal of his perſonal attendance.—This laſt favour had a claim upon the young man's gratitude, ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to every other obligation which ſince his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy his benefactor had conferred; and he was at times ſo moved by thoſe marks of kindneſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Lord Elmwood, he would form the intention of tearing from his heart every trace Lady Matilda had left there, and as ſoon as his health permitted him, obey to the utmoſt of his views, every wiſh his uncle had conceived.—Yet again, Matilda's pitiable ſituation preſented itſelf to his compaſſion, and her beauteous perſon to his love.—Divided between the claims of obligation to the father, and tender attachment to the daughter, his ſickneſs was increaſed by the tortures of his mind, and he once ſincerely wiſhed for that death, of which he was in danger, to free him from the
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:025650_0274_0FCEB2FFFB5A65A0"/>
dilemma into which his affections had involved him.</p>
                     <p>At the time his illneſs was at its height, and he lay complaining of the violence of his fever, Lord Elmwood, taking his hand, aſked him, "If there was any thing he could do for him?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, my lord, a great deal," he replied eagerly.</p>
                     <p>"What is it, Harry?" aſked his lordſhip, kindly.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my lord," replied he, "that is what I muſt not tell you."</p>
                     <p>"Defer it then till you are well," ſaid his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, fearful of being ſurpriſed, or affected by the ſtate of his health, into any promiſes which he might hereafter find, the impropriety of granting.</p>
                     <p>"And when I recover, my lord, you give me leave to reveal to you, that which I wiſh you to comply with, let it be what it will?"</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip heſitated—but ſeeing an anxiety for the anſwer, by his raiſing himſelf upon his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow in the bed, and ſtaring wildly, Lord Elmwood at laſt ſaid, "Certainly—Yes, yes," as a child is anſwered for its quiet.</p>
                     <p>That Lord Elmwood could have no idea what was the real petition which Ruſhbrook meant to preſent him, is certain; but it is certain he expected he had ſome requeſt to make, with which it might be wrong for him to comply, and therefore he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided hearing what it was; for great as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for him in his preſent ſtate, it was not of force to urge him to give a promiſe he did not mean to perform—Ruſhbrook on his part was pleaſed with the aſſurance he might ſpeak when he was reſtored to health, but no ſooner was his fever abated, and his ſenſes perfectly recovered from the ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement his malady had cauſed, than the lively remembrance of what he had hinted alarmed him,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:025650_0275_0FCEB2C3F9FFB3B8"/>
and he was even afraid to look his kind, but awful relation in the face.—Lord Elmwood's cheerfulneſs, however, on his returning health, and his undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed attention, ſoon convinced him he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear—But, alas! he found too, he had nothing to hope.—As his health re-eſtabliſhed, his wiſhes re-eſtabliſhed alſo, and with his wiſhes his deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Convinced now that his nephew had ſomething on his mind which he feared to reveal, his lordſhip no longer doubted but ſome youthful attachment had armed his heart againſt any marriage he ſhould propoſe; but he had ſo much pity for his preſent weak ſtate, to delay that farther inquiry which he had threatened before his ſickneſs, to a time when he ſhould be wholly reſtored.</p>
                     <p>It was the end of May before Ruſhbrook was able to be preſent, and partake of the uſual routine of the day—the country was now preſcribed him as the means of entire reſtoration; and as Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood deſigned to leave London ſome time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <p>DURING the illneſs of Ruſhbrook, news had been ſent of his danger from the ſervants in town, to thoſe at Elmwood Houſe, and Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda expreſſed compaſſion when ſhe was told of it—ſhe began to conceive the inſtant ſhe thought he would ſoon die, that his viſit to her had ſome merit

rather than impertinence in its deſign, and that he might poſſibly be a more deſerving man than ſhe had ſuppoſed him to be. Even Sandford and Miſs Woodley began to recollect qualifications he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, which they never had reflected on before, and Miſs Woodley in particular reproached herſelf that ſhe had been ſo ſevere and inattentive to him.—Notwithſtanding the proſpects his death pointed out to her, it was with infinite joy ſhe heard he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; nor was Sandford leſs ſatisfied; for he had treated the young man too unkindly not to dread, leſt any ill ſhould befall him;—but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was glad to hear of his reſtored health, when he was informed he was coming to Elmwood Houſe for a few weeks in the ſtyle of its maſter, Sandford, with all his religious and humane princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, could not help thinking, "that provided the lad had been properly prepared, he had been as well out of the world as in it."</p>
                     <p>He was ſtill leſs his friend when he ſaw him ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive with his uſual florid appearance; had he come pale and ſickly, Sandford had been kind to him; but in apparent good health and ſpirits, he could not form his mouth to tell him he was "glad to ſee him."</p>
                     <p>On his arrival, Matilda, who for five months had been at large, ſecluded herſelf as ſhe would have done upon the arrival of Lord Elmwood; but with far different ſenſations.—Notwithſtanding her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction on the latter occaſion, the reſidence of her father in that houſe had been a ſource of pleaſure, rather than of ſorrow to her; but from the abode of Ruſhbrook ſhe derived puniſhment alone,</p>
                     <p>When, from inquiries made to his own ſervant, who inquired again, Ruſhbrook found that on his approach Matilda had retired to her own confined apartments, the thought was torture to him; it was the hope of ſeeing and converſing with her, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:025650_0277_0FCEB2C804FC8510"/>
admitted at all times to her ſociety as the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of the houſe, that had raiſed his ſpirits, and effected his perfect cure, beyond any other cauſe; and he was hurt to the greateſt degree at this reſpect, or rather contempt, ſhown to him by her retreat.</p>
                     <p>It was, nevertheleſs, a ſubject too delicate to touch upon in any one ſenſe—an invitation for her company on his part, might carry the appearance of ſuperior authority, and an affected condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he juſtly conſidered as the worſt of all inſults.—And yet, how could he ſupport the idea that his viſit had placed the daughter of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor as a dependant ſtranger in that houſe, where in reality he was the dependant, and ſhe the the lawful heir.—For two or three days he ſuffered the torments of theſe reflections, hoping to come to an explanation of all he felt by a fortunate meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Miſs Woodley; but when that meeting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, although he obſerved ſhe talked to him with leſs reſerve than ſhe had formerly done, and even gave ſome proofs of the goodneſs of her diſpoſition, yet ſhe ſcrupulouſly avoided naming Lady Matilda; and when he diffidently inquired of her ladyſhip's health, a cold reſtraint ſpread over Miſs Woodley's face, and ſhe left him inſtantly.—To Sandford it was ſtill more difficult to apply; for though they were frequently together, they were never ſociable; and as Sandford ſeldom diſguiſed his feelings, to Ruſhbrook he was always extremely ſevere, and ſometimes unmannerly.</p>
                     <p>In this perplexed ſituation, the country air was rather of detriment than ſervice to the invalid; and had he not, like a true lover, held faſt to hope, while he could perceive nothing but deſpair; he had returned to town, rather than by his ſtay placed in a ſubordinate ſtate the object of his adoration.—But ſtill perſiſting in his hopes, he one morning met Miſs Woodley in the garden, engaged her a
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:025650_0278_0FCE9F23C92E5B68"/>
longer time than uſual in converſation, and at laſt obtained her promiſe, "She would that day dine with him and Mr. Sandford."—But no ſooner had ſhe parted from him, than ſhe repented of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and upon communicating it to Matilda, that young lady, for the firſt time in her life, darted upon her kind companion, a look of the moſt cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting reproach and haughty reſentment.—Miſs Woodley's own ſentiments had upbraided her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but ſhe was not prepared to receive ſo pointed a mark of diſapprobation from her young friend, till now, duteous and humble to her as to a mother, and not leſs affectionate. Her heart was too ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to bear this diſreſpectful and contumelious frown from the object of her long-devoted care and concern; the tears inſtantly covered her face, and ſhe laid her hands upon her heart, as if ſhe thought it would break.—Matilda was moved, but ſhe poſſeſſed too much of the manly reſentment of her father, to diſcover what ſhe felt for the firſt few minutes.—Miſs Woodley, who had given ſo many tears to her ſorrows, but never till now, one to her anger, had a ſtill deeper ſenſe of this indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, than of the anger itſelf, and to conceal what ſhe ſuffered, left the room.—Matilda, who had been till this time working at her needle, ſeemingly compoſed, now let her work drop from her hand, and ſat for a little while in a deep reverie.—At length ſhe roſe up, and followed Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley to the other apartment.—She entered grave, majeſtic, and apparently ſerene, while her poor heart fluttered with a thouſand diſtreſſing ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—She approached Miſs Woodley (who was ſtill in tears) with a ſullen ſilence; and awed by her manners, the faithful friend of her deceaſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exclaimed, "Dear Lady Matilda, think no more on what I have done—do not reſent it any longer, and on my knees I'll beg your pardon."—
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:025650_0279_0FCEB2C936544F58"/>
Miſs Woodley roſe as ſhe uttered theſe laſt words; but Matilda laid faſt hold of her to prevent the poſture ſhe offered to take, and inſtantly aſſumed it herſelf, "Oh, let this be my atonement!" ſhe cried with the moſt earneſt ſupplication.</p>
                     <p>They interchanged forgiveneſs; and as this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was ſincere, they each without reſerve gave their opinion upon the ſubject which had cauſed the miſunderſtanding; and it was agreed that an apology ſhould be ſent to Mr. Ruſhbrook, "That Miſs Woodley had been ſuddenly indiſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." Nor could this be ſaid to differ from the truth, for ſince what had paſſed, ſhe was unfit to pay a viſit.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook, who had been all the morning elated with the advance he ſuppoſed he had made in that lady's favour, was highly diſappointed, vext, and angry when this apology was delivered to him; nor did he, nor perhaps could he, conceal what he felt, although his ſevere obſerver, Mr. Sandford, was preſent.</p>
                     <p>"I am a very unfortunate man," ſaid he, as ſoon as the ſervant was gone who brought the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                     <p>Sandford caſt his eyes upon him with a look of ſurpriſe and contempt.</p>
                     <p>"A very unfortunate man indeed, Mr. Sandford," repeated he, "although you treat my complaint contemptuouſly."</p>
                     <p>Sandford made no reply, and ſeemed above mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one.</p>
                     <p>They ſat down to dinner;—Ruſhbrook ſcarce eat any thing, but drank, frequently; Sandford took no notice of either, but had a book (which was his cuſtom when he dined with perſons whoſe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was not intereſting to him) laid by the ſide of his plate, which he occaſionally looked into, as
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:025650_0280_0FCEB306678606D8"/>
the diſhes were removing, or other opportunities ſerved.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook, juſt now more hopeleſs than ever of forming an acquaintance with Lady Matilda, began to give way to the ſymptoms of deſpair; and they made their firſt attack by urging him to treat on the ſame level of familiarity that he himſelf was treated, Mr. Sandford, to whom he had till now ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with the moſt profound tokens of reſpect.</p>
                     <p>"Come," ſaid he to him as ſoon as the dinner was removed, "Lay aſide your book and be good company."</p>
                     <p>Sandford lifted up his eyes upon him—ſtared in his face—and caſt them on the book again.</p>
                     <p>"I ſay," continued Ruſhbrook, "I want a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; and as Miſs Woodley has diſappointed me, I muſt have your company."</p>
                     <p>Sandford now laid down his book upon the table, but ſtill holding his ſingers in the pages he was reading, ſaid, "And why are you diſappointed of Miſs Woodley's company?—When people expect what they have no right to hope for, they have yet the aſſurance to complain they are diſappointed."</p>
                     <p>"I had a right to expect ſhe would come," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Ruſhbrook, "for ſhe promiſed ſhe would."</p>
                     <p>"But what right had you to aſk her?"</p>
                     <p>"The right every one has, to make his time paſs as agreeably as he can."</p>
                     <p>"But not at the expence of another."</p>
                     <p>"I believe, Mr. Sandford, it would be a heavy expence to you, to ſee me hapyy; I believe it would coſt you even your own happines."</p>
                     <p>"That is a price I have not now to give," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Sandford, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e began reading again.</p>
                     <p>"What, you have already paid it away? No wonder that at your time of life it ſhould be gone.—But what do you think of my having already ſquandered mine?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="279" facs="unknown:025650_0281_0FCEB2CAB41C64A0"/>
"I don't think about you," returned Sandford, without taking his eyes from the book.</p>
                     <p>"Can you look me in the face and ſay that, Mr. Sandford?—No, you cannot—for you know you <hi>do</hi> think of me, and you know you hate me."—Here he drank two glaſſes of wine one after another; "And I can tell you why you hate me," continued he: "It is from a cauſe for which I often hate myſelf."</p>
                     <p>Sandford read on.</p>
                     <p>"It is on Lady Matilda's account you hate me, and uſe me thus."</p>
                     <p>Sandford put down his book haſtily, and put both his hands by his ſide.</p>
                     <p>"Yes," reſumed Ruſhbrook, "you think I am wronging her."</p>
                     <p>"I think you groſsly inſult her," exclaimed Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, "by this rude mention of her name; and I command you at your peril to deſiſt."</p>
                     <p>"At my peril! Mr. Sandford? Do you aſſume the authority of Lord Elmwood?"</p>
                     <p>"I do on this occaſion; and if you dare to give your tongue a freedom"—</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook interrupted him—"Why then I boldly ſay, (and as her friend, you ought rather to applaud than reſent it) I boldly ſay, my heart ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſo much for her ſituation, I am regardleſs of my own.—I love her father—I loved her mother more—but ſhe herſelf beyond either."</p>
                     <p>"Hold your licentious tongue," cried Sandford, "or quit the room."</p>
                     <p>"Licentious? Oh! the pure thoughts that dwell in her innocent mind, are not leſs ſenſual than mine towards her.—Do you upbraid me with my reſpect, my pity for her? Theſe are the ſenſations which impel me to ſpeak thus undiſguiſed, even to you, my open—no, even worſe—my ſecret enemy!"</p>

"Inſult <hi>me</hi> as you pleaſe, Mr. Ruſhbrook,—but beware how you mention Lord Elmwood's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter."</p>
                     <p>"Can it be to her diſhonour that I pity her? that I would quit the houſe, this moment, never to return, ſo ſhe ſupplied the place I withhold from her."</p>
                     <p>"Go then," cried Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"It would be of no uſe to her, or I would—But come, Mr. Sandford, I will dare do as much as you.—Only ſecond me, and I will intreat Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to be reconciled—to ſee and own her."</p>
                     <p>"Your vanity would be equal to your raſhneſs.—You intreat?—She muſt greatly eſteem thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental, favours which your intreaties gained her!—Do you forget, young man, how ſhort a time it is, ſince you were intreated for?"</p>
                     <p>"I prove I do not, while this anxiety for Lady Matilda, ariſes from what I feel on that account."</p>
                     <p>"Remove your anxiety, then, from her to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for were I to let Lord Elmwood know what has paſſed now"—</p>
                     <p>"It is for your own ſake, not for mine, if you don't."</p>
                     <p>"You ſhall not dare me to it, Mr. Ruſhbrook."—And he roſe from his ſeat: "You ſhall not dare me to do you an injury.—But to avoid the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will never again come into your company, unleſs my friend Lord Elmwood is preſent, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect me and his child from your inſults."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook roſe in yet more warmth than Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. "Have you the injuſtice to ſay I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted Lady Matilda?"</p>
                     <p>"To ſpeak of her at all, is in you an inſult.—But you have done more—you dared to viſit her—to force into her preſence, and ſhock her with your offers of ſervices which ſhe ſcorns; and of your compaſſion, which ſhe is far above."</p>
                     <p>"Did ſhe complain to you?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="281" facs="unknown:025650_0283_0FCEB2CFCAD19F70"/>
"She, or her friend, did."</p>
                     <p>"I rather ſuppoſe, Mr. Sandford, you have bribed ſome of the ſervants to reveal this."</p>
                     <p>"The ſuſpicion becomes Lord Elmwood's heir."</p>
                     <p>"It becomes the man who lives in a houſe with you."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, Mr. Ruſhbrook, for what has paſſed this day—it has taken a weight off my mind.—I thought my diſinclination to you, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ariſe from prejudice—this converſation has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved me from thoſe fears, and I thank you."—Saying this, he calmly walked out of the room, and left Ruſhbrook to reflect on what he had been doing.</p>
                     <p>Heated with the wine he had drank, (and which Sandford engaged on his book had not obſerved) no ſooner was he alone, than he became at once cool and repentant.—"What had he done?" was the firſt queſtion to himſelf.—"He had offended Sandford."—The man whom reaſon as well as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had ever taught him to treat with reſpect and even reverence.—He had groſsly offended the firm friend of Lady Matilda, and even by the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the wanton uſe of her name.—All the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts he had uttered came now to his memory; with a total forgetfulneſs of all Sandford had ſaid to provoke them.</p>
                     <p>He once thought to follow him, and beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; but the contempt with which he had been treated, more than all the anger, withheld him.</p>
                     <p>As he ſat forming plans how to retrieve the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ill as it was, which Sandford formerly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of him, he received a letter from Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, kindly inquiring after his health, and ſaying he ſhould be down early in the following week.—Never were the friendly expreſſions of his lordſhip half ſo welcome to him; for they ſerved to ſooth

                     <p>WHEN Sandford acted deliberately, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acted up to his duty; it was his duty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Ruſhbrook, and he did ſo—but he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would never "be again in his company, unleſs Lord Elmwood was preſent;"—and with all his forgiveneſs, he found an unforgiving gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the duty, of being obliged to keep his word.</p>
                     <p>The next day Ruſhbrook dined alone, while Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford gave his company to the ladies—Ruſhbrook was too proud to ſeek to reconcile Sandford with abject conceſſions, but he endeavoured to meet him as by accident, and try what, in ſuch a caſe, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive apology might effect.—For a day or two, all the ſchemes he formed on that head proved fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; he could never procure even a ſight of him.—But on the evening of the third day, taking a lonely walk, he turned the corner of a grove, and ſaw in the very path he was going, Sandford, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Miſs Woodley; and, what agitated him much more, Lady Matilda was with them.—He knew not whether to proceed, or to quit the path and palpably ſhun them. To one who ſeemed to put an unkind conſtruction upon all he ſaid and did, he knew to do either, would be to do wrong.—In ſpite of the propenſity he felt to paſs ſo near to Lady Matilda, could he have known what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would have been deemed the moſt reſpectful, whatever painful denial it had coſt him, that, he would have adopted.—But undetermined whether
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:025650_0285_0FCEB2D0B9820BC0"/>
to go forward, or croſs to another path, he ſtill walked on till he came too nigh to recede; he then, with a diffidence not affected, but felt in the moſt powerful degree, pulled off his hat; and without bowing, ſtood ſilently while the company paſſed.—Sandford walked on ſome paces before, and took no farther notice as he went by him, than juſt touching the fore part of his hat with his finger.—Miſs Woodley curtſied as ſhe followed.—But Lady Matilda made a full ſtop, and ſaid, in the gentleſt accents, "I hope, Mr. Ruſhbrook, you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly recovered."</p>
                     <p>It was the ſweeteſt muſic he ever liſtened to; and he returned with the moſt reſpectful bow, "I am better a great deal, Ma'am," and purſued his way as if he did not dare to utter another ſyllable.</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſeldom found fault with Lady Matilda; not becauſe he loved her, but becauſe ſhe ſeldom did wrong—upon this occaſion, however, he was half inclined to reprimand her; but yet he did not know what to ſay—the ſubſequent humility of Ruſhbrook had taken from the indiſcretion of her ſpeaking to him, and the event could by no means juſtify his cenſure.—On hearing her begin to ſpeak, Sandford had ſtopped; and as Ruſhbrook after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, walked away, Sandford called to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Miſs Woodley replied, "I was at a loſs what to do; when we met formerly, he always ſpoke firſt."</p>
                     <p>"And ought now," cried Sandford angrily—and then added, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, "It is certainly the duty of the ſuperior, to be the firſt who ſpeaks."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="284" facs="unknown:025650_0286_0FCEB30CC5706520"/>
"He did not look as if he thought himſelf our ſuperior," replied Matilda.</p>
                     <p>"No," returned Sandford, "ſome people can put on what looks they pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>"Then while he looks ſo pale," replied Matilda, "and ſo dejected, I can never forbear ſpeaking to him when we meet, whatever he may think of it."</p>
                     <p>"And were he and I to meet a hundred, nay a thouſand times," replied Sandford, "I don't think I ſhall ever ſpeak to him again."</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me! what for, Mr. Sandford?" cried Matilda—for Sandford, who was not a man that repeated little incidents, had never mentioned the circumſtance of their quarrel.</p>
                     <p>"I have taken ſuch a reſolution,"—anſwered he, "yet I bear him no enmity."</p>
                     <p>As this ſhort reply indicated he meant to ſay no more, no more was aſked; and the ſubject dropped.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Ruſhbrook, happier than he had been for months; intoxicated with joy at that voluntary mark of civility he had received from Lady Matilda, felt his heart ſo joyous, ſo free from every particle of malice, that he reſolved in the humbleſt manner, to make atonement for the breach of decorum he had lately been guilty of to Mr. Sandford."</p>
                     <p>Too happy at this time to ſuffer a mortification from any treatment he might receive, he ſent his ſervant to him into his ſtudy, as ſoon as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home, to beg to know, "If he might be permitted to wait upon him, with a meſſage he had to deliver from Lord Elmwood."</p>
                     <p>The ſervant returned—"Mr. Sandford deſired he would ſend the meſſage by him, or the houſe ſteward." This was highly affronting; but Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook was not in a humour to be offended, and he ſent again, begging he would admit him;—but the anſwer was, "he was buſy."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="unknown:025650_0287_0FCEB2D2340D5910"/>
Thus, defeated in his hopes of reconciliation, his new tranſports felt an allay, and the few days that remained before Lord Elmwood came, he paſſed in ſolitary muſing, and ineffectual walks and looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that path where he had met Matilda—ſhe came that way no more—nor indeed ſcarce quitted her apartment, in the practiſe of that confinement ſhe had to experience on the arrival of her father.</p>
                     <p>All her former agitations now returned. On the day he arrived ſhe wept—all the night ſhe did not ſleep—and the name of Ruſhbrook again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hateful to her.—His lordſhip came in extreme good health and ſpirits, but appeared concerned to find Ruſhbrook leſs well than when he went from town.—Sandford was now under the neceſſity of being in Ruſhbrook's company, yet he took care never to ſpeak to him but when he was obliged; or to look at him but when he could not help it.—Lord Elmwood obſerved this conduct, yet he neither wondered, or was offended at it—he had always perceived what little eſteem Sandford had ſhowed his nephew from his firſt return; but he forgave in Sandford's humour a thouſand faults he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give in no other; nor did he deem this one of his greateſt faults, knowing the claim to his partiality from another object.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley waited on Lord Elmwood as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; dined with him, and as heretofore related to the attentive Matilda all that paſſed.</p>
                     <p>About this time Lord Margrave, deprived by the ſeaſon of all the ſports of the field, felt his love for Matilda (which had been extreme while divided with the love of hunting) too violent to be ſubdued; and he reſolved, though reluctantly, to apply to her father for his conſent to their union;—but writing to Sandford this reſolution, he was once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, and charged as a man of honour, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to diſturb the tranquillity of the family, by
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:025650_0288_0FCEB30FEDEB5730"/>
any application of the kind.—To this Sandford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no anſwer; for his lordſhip, highly incenſed at his miſtreſs's repugnance to him, determined more firmly than ever, to conſult his own happineſs alone; and as that depended merely upon his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her, he cared not by what method it was effected.</p>
                     <p>About a fortnight after Lord Elmwood came into the country, as he was riding one morning, his horſe fell with him, and cruſhed his leg in ſo unfortunate a manner, as to be pronounced of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.—He was brought home in a poſt chaiſe, and Matilda heard of the accident with more grief than would, on ſuch an occaſion, appertain to the moſt fondled child.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of the pain he ſuffered, his fever was one night very high; and Sandford, who ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom quitted his apartment, went frequently to his bed-ſide; every time with the ſecret hope he ſhould hear him aſk to ſee his daughter—he was every time diſappointed; yet he ſaw him ſhake with a cordial friendſhip the hand of Ruſhbrook, as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in ſeeing thoſe he loved.</p>
                     <p>The danger in which Lord Elmwood was ſuppoſed to be, was but of ſhort duration, and his ſudden recovery ſucceeded.—Matilda who had wept, moan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and watched during the criſes of his illneſs, when ſhe heard he was mending, exclaimed (with a kind of ſurpriſe at the novelty of the ſenſation) "And this is joy that I feel!—Oh! I never till now knew, what thoſe perſons felt that experienced joy."</p>
                     <p>Nor did ſhe repine, like Mr. Sandford and Miſs Woodley, at her father's inattention to her during his malady, for ſhe did not hope like them—ſhe did not hope he would behold her, even in dying.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding his lordſhip's ſeeming indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference while his indiſpoſition continued, no ſooner was he recovered ſo as to receive the congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:025650_0289_0FCEB2D5829AA810"/>
of his friends, than there was no one perſon he evidently ſhowed ſo much ſatisfaction at ſeeing, as Miſs Woodley.—She waited upon him timorouſly, and with more than ordinary diſtaſte at his late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; when he put out his hand with the utmoſt warmth to receive her, drew her to him, ſaluted her, (an honour he had never in his life conferred before) and all with ſigns of the ſincereſt friendſhip and affection.—Sandford was preſent, and ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating the idea of Matilda with Miſs Woodley, felt his heart bound with a triumph it had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed for many a day.</p>
                     <p>Matilda liſtened with delight to the recital Miſs Woodley gave on her return, and many times while it laſted, exclaimed, "She was happy." But poor Matilda's ſudden tranſports of joy, which ſhe termed happineſs, were not made for long continuance; and if ſhe ever found cauſe for gladneſs, ſhe far oftener had motives for grief.</p>
                     <p>As Mr. Sandford was ſitting with her and Miſs Woodley one evening about a week after, a perſon rung at the bell and inquired for him; on being told of it by the ſervant, he went to the door of the apartment and cried, "Oh! is it you? Come in."—An elderly man entered, who had been for many years the head gardener at Elmwood Houſe; a man of honeſty and ſobriety, and with a large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent family of aged parents, children, and other relatives, who ſubſiſted wholly on the income ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from his place.—The ladies, as well as Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, knew him well, and they all, almoſt at once, aſked, "What was the matter?" for his looks told them ſomething diſtreſsful had befallen him.</p>
                     <p>Oh Sir!" ſaid he to Sandford, "I come to intreat your intereſt."</p>
                     <p>"In what, Edwards?" ſaid Sandford with a mild voice; for when his aſſiſtance was ſupplicated in diſtreſs, his rough tones always took a plaintive key.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="288" facs="unknown:025650_0290_0FCEB30E3A4EDD58"/>
"My lord has diſcharged me from his ſervice,"—(returned Edwards trembling, and the tears ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his eyes;) "I am undone, Mr. Sandford, unleſs you plead for me."</p>
                     <p>"I will," ſaid Sandford, "I will."</p>
                     <p>"And yet I am almoſt afraid of your ſucceſs," replied the man, "for my lord has ordered me out of his houſe this moment; and though I knelt down to him to be heard, he had no pity."</p>
                     <p>Matilda ſighed from the bottom of her heart, and yet ſhe envied this poor man who had been kneeling to her father.</p>
                     <p>"What was your offence?" cried Sandford.</p>
                     <p>The man heſitated; then looking at Matilda, ſaid, "I'll tell you, Sir, ſome other time."</p>
                     <p>"Did you name me, before Lord Elmwood?" cried ſhe eagerly, and terrified.</p>
                     <p>"No, Madam," replied he, "but I unthinkingly ſpoke of my poor lady that is dead and gone."</p>
                     <p>Matilda burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"How came you to do ſo mad a thing?" cried Sandford, with the encouragement his looks had once given him, now fled from his face.</p>
                     <p>"It was unthinkingly," repeated Edwards; "I was ſhowing my lord ſome plans for the new walks, and told him, among other things, that her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had many years ago approved of them."—'Who?' cried he.—Still I did not call to mind, but repeated, 'Lady Elmwood, Sir, while you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.'—As ſoon as theſe words were delivered, I ſaw my doom in his looks, and he commanded me to quit his houſe and ſervice that inſtant."</p>
                     <p>"I am afraid," ſaid Sandford, ſitting down, "I can do nothing for you."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir, you know you have more power over my lord than any body—and perhaps you may be able to ſave me and all mine from miſery."</p>
                     <p>"I would if I could," replied Sandford quickly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="289" facs="unknown:025650_0291_0FCEB2D6B675CD90"/>
"You can but try, Sir."</p>
                     <p>Matilda was all this while drowned in tears; nor was Miſs Woodley much leſs affected—Lady Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood was before their eyes—Matilda beheld her in her dying moments; Miſs Woodley ſaw her as the gay ward of Dorriforth.</p>
                     <p>"Aſk Mr. Ruſhbrook," ſaid Sandford, "prevail on him to ſpeak; he has more power than I have."</p>
                     <p>"He has not enough, then," replied Edwards, "for he was in the room with my lord when what I have told you happened."</p>
                     <p>"And did he ſay nothing?" aſked Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir; he offered to ſpeak in my behalf, but my lord interrupted him, and ordered him out of the room—he inſtantly went."</p>
                     <p>Sandford now obſerving the effect which this narration had on the two ladies, led the man to his own apartments, and there aſſured him he durſt not undertake his cauſe; but that if time or chance ſhould happily make an alteration in his lordſhip's diſpoſition, he would be the firſt to try to replace him—Edwards was obliged to ſubmit; and before the next day at noon, his pleaſant houſe by the ſide of the park, his garden, and his orchard, which he had occupied above twenty years, were cleared of their old inhabitant, and all his wretched family.</p>

                     <p>THIS melancholy incident perhaps affected Matilda and all the friends of the deceaſed Lady Elmwood, beyond any other that had occurred ſince her death. A few days after this circumſtance, Miſs Woodley, in order to divert the diſconſolate

mind of Lady Matilda, (and perhaps bring her ſome little anecdotes, to conſole her for that which had given her ſo much pain) waited upon Lord Elmwood in his library, and borrowed ſome books out of it.—He was now perfectly well from his fall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with the ſame politeneſs as uſual, but, of courſe, not with that particular warmth he had received her juſt after his illneſs.—Ruſhbrook was in the library at the ſame time; he ſhowed to her ſeveral beautiful prints, which his lordſhip had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from London, and appeared anxious to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and give tokens of his eſteem and reſpect for her. But what gave her pleaſure beyond any other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, that after ſhe had taken (by the aid of Ruſhbrook) about a dozen volumes from different ſhelves, and had laid them together, ſaying ſhe would ſend her ſervant to fetch them, Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood went eagerly to the place where they were, and taking up each book, examined attentively what it was.—One author he complained was too light, another too depreſſing, and put them on the ſhelves again; another was erroneous, and he changed it for a better; and thus he warned her againſt ſome, and ſelected other authors; as the moſt cautious preceptor culls for his pupil, or a fond father for his darling child.—She thanked him for his attention to her, but her heart thanked him for his attention to his daughter.—For as ſhe herſelf never received ſuch a proof of his care ſince all their long acquaintance, ſhe reaſonably ſuppoſed Matilda's reading, and not hers, was the object of his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                     <p>Having in theſe books ſtore of comfort for poor Matilda, ſhe eagerly returned with them; and in reciting every particular circumſtance, made her conſider the volumes almoſt like preſents from her father.</p>
                     <p>The month of September was now arrived, and
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:025650_0293_0FCEB2D855242F88"/>
Lord Elmwood, accompanied by Ruſhbrook, went to a ſmall ſhooting ſeat about twenty miles diſtant from Elmwood Caſtle, for a week's particular ſport.—Matilda was once more at large; and one beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful forenoon, about eleven o'clock, ſeeing Miſs Woodley walking on the lawn before the houſe, ſhe haſtily took her hat to join her; and not waiting to put it on, went nimbly down the great ſtair-caſe with it hanging on her arm.—When ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended a few ſtairs, ſhe heard a footſtep walking ſlowly up; and (from what emotion ſhe could not tell,) ſhe ſtopt ſhort, half reſolved to return back.—She heſitated a ſingle inſtant which to do—then went a few ſteps farther till ſhe came to the ſecond landing place; when, by the ſudden winding of the ſtair-caſe,—Lord Elmwood was immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her!</p>
                     <p>She had felt ſomething like affright before ſhe ſaw him—but her reaſon told her ſhe had nothing to fear, as he was far away.—But now the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſtranger whom ſhe had never before ſeen; an air of authority in his looks as well as in the ſound of his ſteps; a reſemblance to the portrait ſhe had ſeen of him; a ſtart of aſtoniſhment which he gave on beholding her; but above all—her <hi>fears</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed her it was him.—She gave a ſcream of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror—put out her trembling hands to catch the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrades on the ſtairs for ſupport—miſſed them—and fell motionleſs into her father's arms.</p>
                     <p>He caught her, as by that impulſe he would have caught any other perſon falling for want of aid.—Yet when he found her in his arms, he ſtill held her there—gazed on her attentively—and once preſſed her to his boſom.</p>
                     <p>At length, trying to eſcape the ſnare into which he had been led, he was going to leave her on the ſpot where ſhe fell, when her eyes opened, and ſhe
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:025650_0294_0FCEB31441ECA918"/>
uttered, "Save me!"—Her voice unmanned him.—His long-reſtrained tears now burſt forth—and ſeeing her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lapſing into a ſwoon again, he cried out eagerly to recall her.—Her name did not however come to his recollection—nor any name but this—"Miſs Milner—dear Miſs Milner."</p>
                     <p>That ſound did not awake her; and now again he wiſhed to leave her in this ſenſeleſs ſtate, that not remembering what had paſſed, ſhe might eſcape the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>But at this inſtant Giffard, with another ſervant, paſſed by the foot of the ſtairs; on which, Lord Elmwood called to them—and into Giffard's hands delivered his apparently dead child; without one command reſpecting her, or one word of any kind; while his face was agitated with ſhame, with pity, with anger; with paternal tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>As Giffard ſtood trembling, while he relieved his lord from this hapleſs burthen; his lordſhip had to unlooſe her hand from the ſide of his coat, which ſhe had caught faſt hold of as ſhe fell, and graſped ſo cloſely, it was with difficulty releaſed.—On tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hand away his lordſhip trembled—faltered—then bade Giffard do it.</p>
                     <p>"Who, I, my lord, I ſeparate you?" cried he.—But recollecting himſelf, "My lord, I will obey your commands, whatever they are." And ſeizing her hand, pulled it with violence—it fell—and her father went away.</p>
                     <p>Matilda was carried to her own apartments, laid upon the bed, and Miſs Woodley called to attend her, after liſtening to the recital of what had paſſed.</p>
                     <p>When Lady Elmwood's old and affectionate friend entered the room, and ſaw her youthful charge lying pale and ſpeechleſs, yet no father by to comfort or ſooth her, ſhe lifted up her hands to heaven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, with a flood of tears, "And is this the end of thee, my poor child?—Is this the end of all
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:025650_0295_0FCEB2DC88BE9238"/>
our hopes—of thy own fearful hopes—and of thy mother's ſupplications?—Oh! Lord Elmwood! Lord Elmwood!"</p>
                     <p>At that name Matilda ſtarted, and cried, "Where is he?—Is it a dream, or have I ſeen him?"</p>
                     <p>"It is all a dream, my dear," ſaid Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"And yet I thought he held me in his arms," ſhe replied, "I thought I felt his hands preſs mine—Let me ſleep and dream it again."</p>
                     <p>Now thinking it beſt to undeceive her, "It is no dream, my dear," returned Miſs Woodley.</p>
                     <p>"Is it not?" cried ſhe, ſtarting up and leaning on her elbow—"Then I ſuppoſe I muſt go away—go for ever away."—</p>
                     <p>Sandford now entered.—Having been told the news, he came to condole.—But at the ſight of him Matilda was terrified, and cried, "Do not reproach me, do not upbraid me—I know I have done wrong—I know I had but one command from my father, and that I have diſobeyed."</p>
                     <p>Sandford could not reproach her, for he could not ſpeak;—he therefore only walked to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and concealed his tears.</p>
                     <p>That whole day and night was paſſed in ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic grief, in alarm at every ſound, leſt it ſhould be a meſſenger to pronounce Matilda's deſtiny.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood did not ſtay upon this viſit above three hours at Elmwood Houſe; he then ſet off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for the ſeat he had left; where Ruſhbrook ſtill remained, and from whence his lordſhip had merely come by accident, to look over ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings he wanted diſpatched to town.</p>
                     <p>During his ſhort continuance here, Sandford cautiouſly avoided his preſence; for he thought, in a caſe like this, what nature would not of herſelf do, no art, no arguments of his could effect—and to nature and to providence he left the whole—What theſe two powerful principles brought about,

                           </opener>
                           <p>MY Lord, above a twelvemonth ago, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me he had permitted his daughter to reſide in his houſe; but at the ſame time he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, the grant was under a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, which if ever broken, I was to ſee his then determination (of which he alſo acquainted me) put in execution. In conſequence of Lady Matilda's indiſpoſition, Madam, I have ventured to delay this notice till morning.—I need not ſay with what concern I now give it, or mention to you, I believe, what is forfeited. My lord ſtaid but a few hours yeſterday after the unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance on which I write, took place; nor did I ſee him after, till he was in his carriage; he then ſent for me to the carriage door, and he told me he ſhould be back in two days time, and added, 'Remember your duty.' That duty, I hope, Madam, you will not require I ſhould mention in more direct terms. As ſoon as my lord returns, I have no doubt but he will aſk me if it is fulfilled, and I ſhall be under the greateſt apprehenſion ſhould his commands not be obeyed.</p>
                           <p>If there is any thing wanting for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your and Lady Matilda's departure, you have but to order it, and it is at your ſervice—I

mean likewiſe any caſh you may have occaſion for. I ſhould preſume to add my opinion where you might beſt take up your abode; but with ſuch advice as you will have from Mr. Sandford, mine would be but aſſuming.</p>
                           <p>I would alſo have waited upon you, Madam, and have delivered myſelf the ſubſtance of this letter; but I am an old man, and the changes I have been witneſs to in my lord's houſe ſince I firſt lived in it, has increaſed my age many years; and I have not the ſtrength to ſee you upon this occaſion.—I loved my deceaſed lady—I love my lord—and I love their child—nay, ſo I am ſure does my lord himſelf; but there is no accounting for his reſolutions, or for the alteration his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition has lately undergone.</p>
                           <p>I beg your pardon, Madam, for this long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, and am, and ever will be (while you and my lord's daughter are ſo) your afflicted humble ſervant,</p>

                     <p>When this letter was brought to Miſs Woodley, ſhe knew what it contained before ſhe opened it, and therefore took it with an air of reſignation—yet though ſhe gueſſed the momentous part of its contents, ſhe dreaded in what words it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; and having now no great good to hope for, hope, that will never totally expire, clung at this criſis to little circumſtances, and ſhe hoped moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently the terms of the letter might not be harſh, but that Lord Elmwood had delivered his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in gentle language. The event proved he had; and loſt to every important comfort, ſhe felt grateful to him for this ſmall one.</p>
                     <p>Matilda, too, was cheered by this letter, becauſe ſhe expected ſomething worſe; and the laſt line
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:025650_0298_0FCEB373807CEC78"/>
where Giffard ſaid he knew "his lordſhip loved her," ſhe thought repaid her for the purport of the other part.</p>
                     <p>Sandford was not ſo eaſily reſigned or comforted—he walked about the room when the letter was ſhown to him—called it cruel—ſtifled his tears, and wiſhed to ſhow his reſentment only—but the former burſt through all his endeavours, and he ſunk into grief.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the fortitude of Matilda, which came to her aſſiſtance on the firſt onſet of this trial, ſufficient to arm her, when the moment came ſhe was to quit the houſe—her father's houſe—never to ſee that, or him again.</p>
                     <p>When word was brought that the carriage was at the door, which was to convey her from all ſhe held ſo dear, and ſhe ſaw before her the proſpect of a long, youthful and healthful life, in which miſery and deſpair were all ſhe could diſcern; that deſpair ſeized her at once, and gaining courage from it, ſhe cried,</p>
                     <p>"What have I to fear if I diſobey my father's commands once more? he cannot uſe me worſe. I'll ſtay here till he returns—again throw myſelf in his way, and then I will not faint, but plead for mercy. Perhaps were I to kneel to him—kneel, like other children, and beg his bleſſing; he would not refuſe it me."</p>
                     <p>"You muſt not try," ſaid Sandford mildly.</p>
                     <p>"Who?" cried ſhe, "ſhall prevent my flying to my father? have I another friend on earth to go to? have I one relation in the world but him? This is the ſecond time I have been commanded out of the houſe. In my infant ſtate my cruel father turned me out; but then he ſent me to a mother—now I have none; and I will ſtay with him."</p>
                     <p>Again the ſteward ſent to let them know the coach was waiting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="297" facs="unknown:025650_0299_0FCEB3402BF49428"/>
Sandford now, with a determined countenance, went coolly up to Lady Matilda, and taking her hand, ſeemed reſolved to lead her to the carriage.</p>
                     <p>Accuſtomed to be awed by every ſerious look of his, ſhe yet reſiſted this; and cried, "Would <hi>you</hi> be the miniſter of my father's cruelty?"</p>
                     <p>"Then," ſaid Sandford ſolemnly to her, "fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well—from this moment you and I part. I will take my leave, and do you remain where you are—at leaſt till you are forced away. But I'll not ſtay to be turned out—for it is impoſſible your father will ſuffer any friend of yours to continue here, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this diſobedience. Adieu."</p>
                     <p>"I'll go this moment," ſaid ſhe, and roſe haſtily.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley took her at her word, and hurried her immediately out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Sandford followed ſlow behind, with the ſame ſpirits as if he had followed at her funeral.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe came to that ſpot on the ſtairs, where ſhe had met her father, ſhe ſtarted back; and ſcarcely knew how to paſs it. When ſhe had—"There he held me," ſaid ſhe, "and I thought I felt him preſs me to his heart, but I now find I was miſtaken."</p>
                     <p>As Sandford came forward to hand her into the coach, "Now you behave well;" ſaid he, "by this behaviour, you do not entirely cloſe all proſpect of reconciliation with your father."</p>
                     <p>"Do you think it is not yet impoſſible?" cried ſhe, claſping his hand. "Giffard ſays he loves me," continued ſhe, "and do you think he might yet be brought to forgive me?"</p>
                     <p>"Forgive you?" cried Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"Suppoſe I was to write to him, and intreat his forgiveneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Do not write yet," ſaid Sandford with no cheering accent.</p>
                     <p>The carriage drove off—and as it went, Matilda
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:025650_0300_0FCE9F2E15E6E730"/>
leaned her head from the window, to ſurvey Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood Houſe from the roof to the bottom. She caſt her eyes upon the gardens too—upon the fiſh-ponds—the coach-houſes even, and all the offices ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining—which as objects ſhe ſhould never ſee again—ſhe gazed at, as objects of importance.</p>

                     <p>RUSHBROOK, who, at twenty miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, could have no conjecture what had paſſed at Elmwood Houſe, (during the ſhort viſit Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood made there) went that way with his dogs and gun, in order to meet his lordſhip's chariot on its return, and ride with him back—he did ſo—and getting into the carriage, told my lord eagerly the ſport he had had during the day; laughed at an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that had befallen one of his dogs, and for ſome time did not perceive but that his lordſhip was perfectly attentive. At length, obſerving he anſwered more negligently than uſual to what he ſaid, Ruſhbrook turned his eyes quickly upon him and cried,</p>
                     <p>"My lord, are you not well?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; perfectly well, I thank you, Ruſhbrook," replied his lordſhip, and leaned back againſt the carriage.</p>
                     <p>"I thought, Sir," returned Ruſhbrook, "you ſpoke languidly; I beg your pardon."</p>
                     <p>"I have the head-ach a little," anſwered he; then taking off his hat, bruſhed the powder from it, and as he put it on again, fetched a moſt heavy ſigh; which no ſooner had eſcaped him, than, to drown its ſound, he ſaid briſkly,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="299" facs="unknown:025650_0301_0FCEB3413A66AF00"/>
"And ſo you tell me you have had good ſport to-day?"</p>
                     <p>"No, my lord, I ſaid but indifferent."</p>
                     <p>"True, ſo you did. Bid the man drive faſter—it will be dark before we get home."</p>
                     <p>"You will ſhoot to-morrow, my lord?"</p>
                     <p>"Certainly."</p>
                     <p>"How does Mr. Sandford do, Sir."</p>
                     <p>"I did not ſee him."</p>
                     <p>"Not ſee Mr. Sandford, my lord?—but he was out, I ſuppoſe—for they did not expect you at Elmwood Houſe."</p>
                     <p>"No, they did not."</p>
                     <p>In ſuch converſation Ruſhbrook and his uncle continued till the end of their journey. Dinner was then immediately ſerved, and his lordſhip now appeared much in his uſual ſpirits; at leaſt not ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any cauſe for their abatement, Ruſhbrook did not obſerve any alteration.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood went however earlier to bed than ordinary, or rather to his bed-chamber; for though he retired ſome time before his nephew, when Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook paſſed his chamber-door it was open; and he not in bed, but ſitting in a muſing poſture, as if he had forgot to ſhut it.</p>
                     <p>When Ruſhbrook's valet came to attend his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſaid to him,</p>
                     <p>"I ſuppoſe, Sir, you do not know what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at Elmwood Houſe?"</p>
                     <p>"For heaven's ſake, what?" cried Ruſhbrook.</p>
                     <p>"My lord has met Lady Matilda," replied the man.</p>
                     <p>"How? Where? What's the conſequence?"</p>
                     <p>"We don't know yet, Sir; but all the ſervants ſuppoſe, her ladyſhip will not be ſuffered to remain there any longer."</p>
                     <p>"They all ſuppoſe wrong," returned Ruſhbrook haſtily; "my lord loves her I am certain, and this
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:025650_0302_0FCE9F2F0C1BC310"/>
event may be the happy means, of his treating her as his child, from this day."</p>
                     <p>The ſervant ſmiled and ſhook his head.</p>
                     <p>"Why, what more do you know?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing more than I have told you, Sir; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that his lordſhip took no kind of notice of her ladyſhip, that appeared like love."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook was all uneaſineſs and anxiety to know the particulars of what had paſſed; and now Lord Elmwood's inquietude, which he had but ſlightly noticed before, came full to his obſervation. He was going to aſk more queſtions, but he recollected that Lady Matilda's misfortunes were too ſacred, to be talked of thus familiarly by the ſervants of the family; beſides, it was evident this man thought, and but naturally, it might not be for his maſter's intereſt, the father and the daughter ſhould be united; and therefore would certainly give to all he ſaid, the oppoſite colouring.</p>
                     <p>In ſpite of his prudence, however, and his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy towards Matilda, Ruſhbrook could not let his valet leave him till he had inquired, and learned all the circumſtantial account of what had happened; except, indeed, the order received by Giffard;—which being given after his lordſhip was in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and in conciſe terms, the domeſtics who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him (and from whom this man had gained his intelligence) were of that unacquainted.</p>
                     <p>When the valet had left Ruſhbrook alone, the perturbation of his mind was ſo great, that he was at length undetermined whether to go to bed, or to ruſh into his uncle's apartment, and at his feet beg for that compaſſion upon his daughter, which he feared he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad denied her. But then again, to what dangers did he not expoſe himſelf by ſuch a ſtep? Nay, he might perhaps even injure her whom he wiſhed to ſerve; for if his lordſhip was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unreſolved, whether to forgive or to reſent
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:025650_0303_0FCEB342B279C4A8"/>
this diſobedience to his commands, another's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference might enrage and determine him on the latter.</p>
                     <p>This conſideration was ſo weighty, it reſigned Ruſhbrook to the ſuſpenſe he muſt endure till the morning; when he flattered himſelf, that by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every look and motion of Lord Elmwood's, his penetration would be able to diſcover the ſtate of his heart, and how he meant to act.</p>
                     <p>But the morning came, and he found all his pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing curioſity was of no avail; his lordſhip did not uſe one word, one look, or action that was not cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary.</p>
                     <p>On firſt ſeeing him, Ruſhbrook bluſhed at the ſecret with which he was entruſted; then contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated the joy he ought to have known in claſping in his arms a child like Matilda—whoſe tenderneſs, reverence, and duty, had deprived her of all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation at his ſight; which was in Ruſhbrook's mind an honour, that rendered him ſuperior to what he was before.</p>
                     <p>They were in the fields all the day as uſual; Lord Elmwood now cheerful, and complaining no more of the head-ach.—Yet once being ſeparated from his nephew, Ruſhbrook croſſed over a ſtile into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother field, and found him ſitting by the ſide of a bank, his gun laying by him, and he loſt in thought. He roſe on ſeeing him, and proceeded to the ſport as before.</p>
                     <p>At dinner, he ſaid he ſhould not go to Elmwood Houſe the next day, as he had appointed, but ſtay where he was three or four days longer.—From theſe two ſmall occurrences, Ruſhbrook would fain have extracted ſomething by which to judge the ſtate of his mind; but upon the teſt, that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible—he had caught him muſing many a time before; and as to his prolonging his ſtay, that might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The three or four days for their abode where they were, being paſſed, they both returned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Elmwood Houſe.—Ruſhbrook thought he ſaw his uncle's countenance change as they entered the avenue, yet he did not appear leſs in ſpirits; and when Sandford joined them at dinner, his lordſhip went with his uſual cheerfulneſs to him, (and, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sandford ſaid, "How do you do, my lord?" cheerfully in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; but put both his hands into his boſom, and walked to the other ſide of the room. Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood did not ſeem to obſerve this affront—nor was it done as an affront—it was merely what poor Sandford felt; and he felt he could <hi>not</hi> ſhake hands with him.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook ſoon learnt the news that Matilda was gone, and Elmwood Houſe was to him a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert—he ſaw about it no real friend of hers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept poor Sandford, and to him Ruſhbrook knew himſelf now, more diſpleaſing than ever; and all the overtures he made to him to be friends, he at this time found more and more ineffectual.

                     <p>Though Sandford's frequent viſits ſoothed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, they could not comfort her; for he had no conſolation to beſtow ſuited to her mind—her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had given no one token of regret for what he had done.

                     <p>LORD ELMWOOD had now allowed Ruſhbrook a long vacation, in reſpect to his anſwer upon the ſubject of marriage; and the young man vainly imagined, his lordſhip's intentions upon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject were entirely given up.

                     <p>"Then, my lord"—(cried Ruſhbrook, in the greateſt agitation both of mind and body) "Your daughter"—</p>
                     <p>The reſolution his lordſhip had taken (and on which he had given his word to his nephew not to interrupt him) immediately gave way.—The colour roſe in his face—his eyes darted lightning—and his hand was lifted up with the emotion, that word had created.</p>
                     <p>"You promiſed to hear me, my lord?" cried Ruſhbrook, "and I claim your promiſe."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip now ſuddenly overcame his violence of paſſion, and ſtood ſilent and reſigned to hear him; but with a determined look, expreſſive of the vengeance that ſhould enſue.</p>
                     <p>"Lady Matilda," reſumed Ruſhbrook, "is an object that wreſts from me the enjoyment of every bleſſing your kindneſs beſtows. I cannot but feel myſelf as her adverſary—as one who has ſupplanted her in your affections—who ſupplies her place, while ſhe is exiled, a wanderer, and an orphan."</p>
                     <p>His lordſhip took off his eyes from Ruſhbrook, during this laſt ſentence, and caſt them on the floor.</p>

                     <p>Again the colour flew to Lord Elmwood's face; and again he could hardly reſtrain himſelf from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his indignation.</p>

                     <p>Ruſhbrook now trembled more than ever, and looked pale as death; for the ardour of ſpeaking being over, he waited his ſentence, with leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of mind than he expected he ſhould.</p>
                     <p>"You diſapprove my conduct, it ſeems?" ſaid Lord Elmwood, "and in that, you are but like the reſt of the world—and yet, among all my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, you are the only one who has dared to inſult me with your opinion. And this you have not done inadvertently; moreover knowingly, willingly, and deliberately. But as it has been my fate to be uſed ill, and ſevered from all thoſe perſons to whom my ſoul has been moſt attached; with leſs regret I can part from you, than was this my firſt trial."</p>
                     <p>There was a truth and a pathetic <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He felt he deſerved all he was going to ſuffer, and he fell upon his knees, not

ſo much to deprecate the doom he ſaw impending, as thus humbly to acknowledge it was his due.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood, irritated by this poſture, as a ſign of the preſumptuous hopes he might be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, ſuffered now his anger to break through all bounds; and raiſing his voice, he cried in a rage,</p>
                     <p>"Leave my houſe, Sir, Leave my houſe inſtantly, and ſeek ſome other home."</p>
                     <p>Juſt as theſe words were begun, Sandford opened the library door; was witneſs to them, and to the imploring ſituation of Ruſhbrook. He ſtood ſilent with amaze!</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook aroſe, and feeling in his mind a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, that he might never from that hour, behold his benefactor more; as he bowed to him in token of obedience to his commands, a ſhower of tears covered his face; but Lord Elmwood, unmoved, fixed his eyes upon him, which purſued him with their enraged looks to the end of the room. Here he had to paſs Sandford; who, for the firſt time in his life, took hold of him by the hand, and ſaid to Lord Elmwood, "My lord, what's the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?"</p>
                     <p>"That ungrateful villain," cried his lordſhip, "has dared to inſult me. Leave my houſe this moment, Sir."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook made an effort to go, but Sandford ſtill held his hand; and ſaid to Lord Elmwood,</p>
                     <p>"He is but a boy, my lord, and do not give him the puniſhment of a man."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook now ſnatched his hand from Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's, and threw it with himſelf upon his neck; where he indeed ſobbed like a boy.</p>
                     <p>"You are both in league," exclaimed Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>
                     <p>"Do you ſuſpect me of partiality to Mr. Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook?" ſaid Sandford, advancing nearer to his lordſhip.</p>

Ruſhbrook had now gained the point of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the room; but the hope that privilege in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired (while he ſtill harboured all the juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions for his fate) gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, perhaps, to a more exquiſite ſenſation of pain, than deſpair would have done. He ſtood ſilent—confounded—hoping he was forgiven—fearing he was not.</p>
                     <p>As Sandford approached ſtill nearer to Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, he continued, "No, my lord, I know you do not ſuſpect me, of partiality to Mr. Ruſhbrook—has any part of my behaviour ever diſcovered it?"</p>
                     <p>"You now then," replied his lordſhip, "only interfere to provoke me."</p>
                     <p>"If that were the caſe," returned Sandford, "there have been occaſions, when I might have done it more effectually—when my own heart-ſtrings were breaking, becauſe I would not provoke, or add to what you ſuffered."</p>
                     <p>"I am obliged to you, Mr. Sandford," ſaid his lordſhip mildly.</p>
                     <p>"And if, my lord, I have proved any merit in a late forbearance, reward me for it now; and take this young man from the depth of deſpair in which I ſee he is ſunk, and ſay you pardon him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood made no anſwer—and Ruſhbrook drawing ſtrong inferences of hope from his ſilence, lifted up his eyes from the ground, and ventured to look in his face; he found it compoſed to what it had been, but ſtill ſtrongly marked with agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He caſt his eyes away again, in confuſion.</p>
                     <p>On which his lordſhip ſaid to him—"I ſhall poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone your complying with my orders, till you think fit once more to provoke them—and then, not even Sandford; ſhall dare to plead your excuſe."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook bowed.</p>
                     <p>"Go, leave the room, Sir."</p>
                     <p>He inſtantly obeyed.</p>
                     <p>While Sandford, turning to Lord Elmwood,

ſhook him by the hand, and cried, "My lord, I thank you—I thank you very kindly, my lord—I ſhall now begin to think I have ſome weight with you."</p>
                     <p>"You might indeed think ſo, did you know how much I have pardoned."</p>
                     <p>"What was his offence, my lord?"</p>
                     <p>"Such as I would not have forgiven you, or any other earthly being beſides himſelf; but while you were ſpeaking in his behalf, I recollected there was a gratitude ſo extraordinary in the hazards he ran, that almoſt made him pardonable."</p>
                     <p>"I gueſs the ſubject then," cried Sandford; "and yet I could not have ſuppoſed"—</p>

                     <p>TO the great relief of Ruſhbrook, Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood that day dined from home, and he had not the confuſion to ſee him again till the evening.—previous to this, Sandford and he met at dinner; but as the attendants were preſent, nothing paſſed on either ſide reſpecting the incident in the morning. Ruſhbrook, from the peril which had ſo lately threatened him, was now in his perfect, cool, and diſpaſſionate ſenſes; and notwithſtanding the real tenderneſs which he bore to the daughter of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, he was not inſenſible to the comfort of finding himſelf, once more in the poſſeſſion of all thoſe enjoyments he had forfeited, and for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment loſt.</p>
                     <p>As he reflected on this, to Sandford he felt the
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:025650_0314_0FCEB31F0672E4E8"/>
firſt tie of acknowledgment—but for his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he knew he ſhould have been at that very time of their meeting at dinner, away from Elmwood Houſe for ever—and bearing on his mind a ſtill more painful recollection; the burthen of his kind pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's continual diſpleaſure. Filled with theſe thoughts, all the time of dinner he could ſcarce look at his companion, without his eyes ſwimming in tears of gratitude, and whenever he attempted to ſpeak to him, gratitude choaked his utterance.</p>
                     <p>Sandford on his part behaved juſt the ſame as ever; and to ſhow he did not wiſh to remind Ruſhbrook of what he had done, he was juſt as uncivil as ever.</p>
                     <p>Among other things, he ſaid, "He did not know Lord Elmwood dined from home, for if he had, he ſhould have dined in his own apartment."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook was ſtill more obliged to him for all this, and the weight of obligations with which he was oppreſſed, made him long for an opportunity to relieve himſelf by expreſſions. As ſoon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the ſervants were all withdrawn, he began:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Sandford, whatever has been your opinion of <hi>me,</hi> I take pride to myſelf, that in my ſentiments towards <hi>you,</hi> I have always diſtinguiſhed you for that humane and diſintereſted character, you have this day proved."</p>
                     <p>"Humane and diſintereſted," replied Sandford, "are two flattering epithets for an old man going out of the world, and who can have no temptation to be otherwiſe."</p>
                     <p>"Then ſuffer me to call your actions generous and compaſſionate, for they have ſaved me"—</p>
                     <p>"I know, young man," cried Sandford, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him, "you are glad at what I have done, and that you find a gratification in telling me you are; but it is a gratification I will not indulge you with—therefore ſay another ſentence on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and" (he aroſe from his ſeat) "I'll leave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

room, and never come into your company again whatever your uncle may ſay to it."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook ſaw by the ſolemnity of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he was ſerious, and poſitively aſſured him he would never thank him more; on which Sandford <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ook his ſeat again, but he ſtill frowned, and it was many minutes before he conquered his ill humour. As his countenance became leſs ſour, Ruſhbrook fell from ſome general topics he had eagerly ſtarted in order to appeaſe him, and ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"How hard is it to reſtrain converſation from the ſubject of our thoughts; and yet amidſt our deareſt friends, and among perſons who have the ſame diſpoſitions and ſentiments as our own, their minds fixed upon the ſelf-ſame objects, is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint practiſed—and thus ſociety, which was meant for one of our greateſt bleſſings, becomes inſipid, nay, oftentimes more weariſome than ſolitude."</p>
                     <p>"I think, young man," replied Sandford, "you have made pretty free with your ſpeech to-day, and ought not to complain of the want of toleration on that ſcore."</p>
                     <p>"I do complain," replied Ruſhbrook; "for if toleration was more frequent, the favour of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it would be leſs."</p>
                     <p>"And your pride, I ſuppoſe, is above receiving a favour."</p>
                     <p>"Never from thoſe I eſteem; and to convince you of it, I wiſh this moment to requeſt a favour of you."</p>
                     <p>"I dare ſay I ſhall refuſe it. However—what is it?"</p>
                     <p>"Permit me to ſpeak to you upon the ſubject of Lady Matilda?"</p>
                     <p>Sandford made no anſwer, conſequently did not forbid him—and he proceeded.</p>
                     <p>"For her ſake—as I ſuppoſe Lord Elmwood may have told you—I this morning raſhly threw, myſelf into the predicament from whence you releaſed me—for her ſake, I have ſuffered much—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

I have hazarded a great deal, and am ſtill ready to hazard more."</p>
                     <p>"But for your own ſake, do not," returned Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford drily.</p>
                     <p>"You may laugh at theſe ſentiments as romantic, Mr. Sandford, but if they are, to me they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs natural."</p>
                     <p>"But what ſervice are they to be, either to her, or to yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>"They are painful to me, and to her would be but impertinent, were ſhe to know them."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhan't inform her of them, ſo do not trouble yourſelf to caution me againſt it."</p>
                     <p>"I was not going—you know I was not—but I was going to ſay, that from no one ſo well as from you, could ſhe be told my ſentiments, without the danger of her reſenting the liberty."</p>
                     <p>"And what impreſſion do you wiſh to give her, from her becoming acquainted with them?"</p>
                     <p>"The impreſſion, that ſhe has one ſincere friend—that upon every occurrence in life, there is a heart ſo devoted to all ſhe feels, ſhe can never ſuffer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſympathy of another—nor ever can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, and all his fortunes to unite for her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, without his ready and immediate compliance."</p>
                     <p>"And do you imagine, that any of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, or any of her neceſſities, would ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon her to put you to the trial?"</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not."</p>
                     <p>"What, then, are the motives which induce you to wiſh her to be told of this?"</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook pauſed.</p>
                     <p>"Do you think," continued Sandford, "the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence will give her any ſatisfaction?"</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not."</p>
                     <p>"Will it be of any to yourſelf?"</p>
                     <p>"The higheſt in the world."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo all you have been urging upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, is, at laſt, only to pleaſe yourſelf."</p>

"You wrong my meaning—it is ſhe—her merit which inſpires my deſire of being known to her—it is her ſufferings, her innocence, her beauty"—</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſtared—Ruſhbrook proceeded: "It is her"—</p>
                     <p>"Nay ſtop where you are," cried Sandford; "you are arrived at the zenith of perfection in a woman, and to add one qualification more, would be an anti-climax."</p>
                     <p>"Oh!" cried Ruſhbrook with warmth, "I loved her before ever I beheld-her."</p>
                     <p>"Loved her!" cried Sandford, with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "You are talking of what you do not intend."</p>
                     <p>"I am, indeed," returned he in confuſion, "I fell by accident on the word love."</p>
                     <p>"And by the ſame accident, ſtumbled on the word beauty; and thus by accident, am I come to the truth of all your profeſſions."</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook knew he loved; and though his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had ſprung from the moſt laudable motives, yet was he aſhamed of it, as of a vice—he roſe, walked about the room, and did not look Sandford in the face for a quarter of an hour. Sandford, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, he had judged rightly, and yet unwilling to be too hard upon a paſſion, which he readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved muſt have had many noble virtues for its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, now got up and walked away, without ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing in cenſure, though not a word in its approbation.</p>
                     <p>It was in the month of October, and juſt dark, at the time Ruſhbrook was left alone; yet from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation of his mind, ariſing from the ſubject on which he had been talking, he found it impoſſible to remain in the houſe, and therefore walked into the fields; but there was another inſtigation, more powerful than the neceſſity of walking; it was the allurement of paſſing along that path where he had laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Here he retraced his own ſteps repeatedly, his whole imagination engroſſed with her idea, till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rance, to dread the confuſion and embarraſſment he ſhould endure, on the next meeting with his lordſhip. He hoped Sandford might be preſent, and yet he was now, almoſt as much aſhamed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him as his uncle, whom he had ſo lately of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
                     <p>As loath to leave the ſpot where he was, as to enter the houſe, he remained there till he conſidered it would be ill manners in his preſent humiliated ſituation, not to ſhow himſelf at the uſual ſupper hour, which was immediately.</p>
                     <p>As he laid his hand upon the door of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to open it, he was ſorry to hear by Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's voice, he was in the room before him; for there was ſomething much more conſpicuous and diſtreſſing, in entering where he already was, than had his lordſhip come in after him. He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, however reaſſured, by overhearing his uncle laugh and ſpeak in a tone expreſſive of the utmoſt good humour to Sandford, who was with him.</p>
                     <p>Yet again, he felt all the awkwardneſs of his own ſituation; but making one courageous effort, opened the door and entered. His lordſhip had been away half the day, had dined abroad, and it was neceſſary to take ſome notice of his return; Ruſhbrook there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bowed humbly, and what was more to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, he looked humbly. Lord Elmwood made a ſlight return to the ſalutation, but continued the recital he had begun to Sandford; and then ſat down to the ſupper table—ſupped—and paſſed the whole evening without ſaying a ſyllable, or even
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:025650_0319_0FCEB35487F50490"/>
caſting a look in remembrance of what had paſſed in the morning. Or if there was any token, that ſhowed he remembered the circumſtance at all, it was the putting his glaſs to his nephew's when Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook called for wine, and drinking at the time he did.</p>

                     <p>THE repulſe Lord Margrave received, did not diminiſh the ardour of his purſuit; for as he was no longer fearful of reſentment from the Earl, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever treatment his daughter might receive, he was determined the anger of Lady Matilda, or of her female friend, ſhould not impede his pretenſions.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this reſolution, he laid the plan of an open violation of all right, all power, and to bear away that prize by force, which no art was likely to procure. He concerted with two of his favourite companions, but their advice was, "one ſtruggle more of fair means." This was totally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his lordſhip's will, for he had much rather have encountered the piercing cries of a female in the laſt agonies of diſtreſs, than the fatigue of her ſentimental harangues, or elegant reproofs, ſuch as he had the ſenſe to underſtand, but not the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Stimulated, however, by his friends to one more trial; in ſpite of the formal diſmiſſion he had twice received, he intruded another viſit on Lady Matilda at the farm. Provoked beyond bearing at ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling aſſurance, Matilda refuſed to come into the room where he was, and Miſs Woodley alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, and expreſſed her ſurpriſe at the little attention he had paid to her explicit deſire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="318" facs="unknown:025650_0320_0FCEB323322D3ED0"/>
"Madam," replied the nobleman, "to be plain with you, I am in love."</p>
                     <p>"I do not the leaſt doubt it, my lord," replied Miſs Woodley, "nor ought you to doubt the truth of what I advance, when I aſſure you, you have not the ſmalleſt reaſon to hope your love will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; for Lady Matilda is reſolved <hi>never</hi> to liſten to your paſſion."</p>
                     <p>"That man," he replied, "is to blame, who can relinquiſh his hopes, upon the mere reſolution of a lady."</p>
                     <p>"And that lady would be wrong," replied Miſs Woodley, "who ſhould entruſt her happineſs in the care of a man, who can think thus meanly of her, and of her ſex."</p>
                     <p>"I think highly of them all," returned his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; "and to convince you in how high an eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I hold her ladyſhip in particular, my whole fortune is at her command."</p>
                     <p>"Your abſenting yourſelf from this houſe, Lord Margrave, ſhe would conſider as a much greater mark of your reſpect."</p>
                     <p>A long converſation, equally unintereſting as this, enſued; till the unexpected arrival of Mr. Sandford put an end to it. He ſtarted at the ſight of Lord Margrave; but his lordſhip was much more affected at the ſight of him.</p>
                     <p>"My lord," ſaid Sandford boldly to him, "have you received any encouragement from Lady Matilda, to authoriſe this viſit?"</p>
                     <p>"None, upon my honour, Mr. Sandford; but I hope you know how to pardon a lover?"</p>
                     <p>"A rational one I do—but you, my lord, are not ſuch, while you perſecute the pretended object of your affection."</p>

Sandford was uncertain whether he underſtood his meaning—but his lordſhip, provoked at his ill reception, felt a triumph in not detaining him long in doubt, and proceeded thus:</p>
                     <p>"For the diſcarded daughter of Lord Elmwood, cannot expect the ſame propoſals which I made while ſhe was acknowledged, and under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her father."</p>
                     <p>"What propoſals then, my lord?" aſked Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford haſtily.</p>
                     <p>"Such," replied his lordſhip, "as the Duke of Avon made to her mother."</p>
                     <p>Miſs. Woodley quitted the room that inſtant. But Sandford, who never felt reſentment but to thoſe in whom he ſaw ſome virtue, calmly replied,</p>
                     <p>"My lord, the Duke of Avon was a gentleman, a man of elegance and breeding; and what have you to offer in recompence for your defects in theſe?"</p>
                     <p>"My wealth," replied he, "oppoſed to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence."</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſmiled, and anſwered,</p>
                     <p>"Do you ſuppoſe that wealth can be eſteemed, which has not been able to make you reſpectable? What is it which makes wealth valuable? Is it the pleaſures of the table? the pleaſures of living in a fine houſe? or riding in a fine coach? Theſe are pleaſures a lord enjoys, but in common with his valet. It is the pleaſure of being conſpicuous, which makes riches deſirable—but if we are conſpicuous only for our vice and folly, had we not better remain in poverty?"</p>
                     <p>"You are beneath my notice."</p>
                     <p>"I truſt I ſhall continue ſo—and that your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will never again condeſcend to come where I am."</p>
                     <p>"A man of rank condeſcends to mix with any ſociety, when a pretty woman is his object."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I have a book here in my pocket, which I am eager to read; it is an author who ſpeaks

ſenſe and reaſon—will you pardon the impatience I feel for ſuch company; and permit me to call your carriage?"</p>

                     <p>"And yet, I queſtion, if Ruſhbrook is a happy man," ſaid Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"He cannot be otherwiſe," returned Matilda, "if he is a man of underſtanding."</p>
                     <p>"He does not want for that," replied Sandford; although he has certainly many indiſcretions."</p>
                     <p>"But which Lord Elmwood, I ſuppoſe," ſaid Matilda, "looks upon with tenderneſs."</p>

<pb n="321" facs="unknown:025650_0323_0FCEB356F3BF96D0"/>
thought as indifferently of Mr. Ruſhbrook as you can do) yet now I will venture to aſk you, whether you do not think he wiſhes Lady Matilda much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than ſhe is?"</p>
                     <p>"I have heard him ſay ſo," anſwered Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"It is a ſubject," returned Lady Matilda, "which I did not imagine you, Mr. Sandford, would have permitted to have been lightly mentioned, in your preſence."</p>
                     <p>"Lightly!—Do you ſuppoſe, my dear, we turned your ſituation into ridicule?"</p>
                     <p>"No, Sir,—but there is a ſort of humiliation in the grief to which I am doomed, that ought ſurely to be treated with the higheſt degree of delicacy by my friends."</p>
                     <p>"I don't know on what point you fix real deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; but if it conſiſts in ſorrow, the young man gives a proof he poſſeſſes it, for he ſhed tears when I laſt heard him mention your name."</p>
                     <p>"I have more cauſe to weep at the mention of his."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps ſo—But let me tell you, Lady Matilda, "your father might have preferred a more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy object."</p>
                     <p>"Still had he been to me," ſhe cried, "an object of envy. And as I frankly confeſs my envy of Mr. Ruſhbrook, I hope you will pardon my malice, which is, you know, but a conſequent crime."</p>
                     <p>The ſubject now turned again upon Lord Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave; and all of them being firmly perſuaded, this laſt reception would put an end to every farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion from his lordſhip, they treated his pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he himſelf, with the contempt they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired—but not with the caution they deſerved.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                     <p>THE next morning early, Mr. Sandford re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Elmwood Houſe, but with his ſpirits de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:025650_0324_0FCEB326F41363F0"/>
and his heart overcharged with ſorrow.—He had ſeen Lady Matilda, the object of his viſit, but he had beheld her conſiderably altered in her looks and in her health; ſhe was become very thin, and inſtead of the moſt beautiful bloom that uſed to ſpread her cheeks, her whole complexion was of a deadly pale—her countenance no longer expreſſed hope or fear, but a fixed melancholy—ſhe ſhed no tears, but was all ſadneſs. He had beheld this, and he had heard her inſulted by the licentious propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of a nobleman, from whom there was no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to be demanded, becauſe ſhe had no friend to vindicate her honour.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook, who ſuſpected where Sandford was gone, and imagined he would return that day, took his forenoon's ride, ſo as to meet him on the load a few miles diſtance from the caſtle; for ſince his perilous ſituation with Lord Elmwood, he was ſo fully convinced of the general philanthropy of Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's character, that in ſpite of his churliſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he now addreſſed him, free from that reſerve to which his rough behaviour had formerly given birth. And Sandford on his part, believing he had formed an illiberal opinion of Lord Elmwood's heir (though he took no pains to let him know that opinion was changed) yet reſolved to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution upon every occaſion that offered.</p>
                     <p>Their mutual greetings when they met, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceremonious but cordial; and Ruſhbrook turned his horſe and rode back with Sandford; yet, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by his reſpect and tenderneſs for Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda, rather than by fear of the rebuffs of his companion, he had not the courage to name her, till their ride was juſt finiſhed, and they came within a few yards of the houſe—incited then by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion he might not ſoon again enjoy ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it an opportunity, he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Sandford, if I gueſs where

you have been, and if any curioſity forces me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for Miſs Woodley's and Lady Matilda's health?"</p>
                     <p>He named Miſs Woodley firſt, to prolong the time before he mentioned Matilda—for though to name her gave him extreme pleaſure, yet it was a pleaſure intermingled with confuſion and pain.</p>
                     <p>"They are both very well," replied Sandford, "at leaſt they did not complain they were ſick."</p>
                     <p>"They are not in ſpirits, I ſuppoſe?" <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"No, indeed," replied Sandford, ſhaking his head.</p>
                     <p>"No new misfortune has happened, I hope!" cried Ruſhbrook, for it was plain to ſee Sandford's ſpirits were unuſually caſt down.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing new," returned he, "except the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of a young nobleman."</p>
                     <p>"What nobleman?" cried Ruſhbrook.</p>
                     <p>"A lover of Lady Matilda's," replied Sandford.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook was petrified.—"Who? what lover, Mr. Sandford?—explain?—"</p>
                     <p>They were now arrived at the houſe: and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, without making any reply to this queſtion, ſaid to the ſervant who took his horſe, "He has come a long way this morning; take care of him."</p>
                     <p>This interruption was torture to Ruſhbrook, who kept cloſe to his ſide, in order to obtain a farther explanation; but Sandford, without attending to him, walked negligently into the hall, and before they advanced many ſteps, they were met by Lord Elmwood.</p>
                     <p>All farther information was for the preſent, now wholly put an end to.</p>
                     <p>"How do you do, Sandford?" ſaid his lordſhip with extreme kindneſs; as if he thanked him for the journey which he ſuſpected he had been taking.</p>
                     <p>"I am indifferent well, my lord," replied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he, with a face of deep concern, and a tear in his eye, partly in gratitude for his lordſhip's civility, and partly in reproach for his cruelty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="324" facs="unknown:025650_0326_0FCEB32B43DA7728"/>
It was not now till the evening, that Ruſhbrook had an opportunity of renewing the converſation, which had been ſo barbarouſly interrupted.</p>
                     <p>In the evening, no longer able to ſupport the ſuſpenſe in which he was; without fear or ſhame he followed Sandford to his chamber at the time of his retiring, and intreated of him, with all the anxiety he ſuffered, to reveal to him what he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to, when he made mention of a lover, and inſolence to Lady Matilda.</p>
                     <p>Sandford ſeeing his emotion, was angry he had inadvertently mentioned the ſubject; and putting on an air of ſurly importance, deſired if he had any buſineſs with him, to call in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Exaſperated at ſo unexpected a reception, and at the pain of his diſappointment, Ruſhbrook replied, "He treated him cruelly, nor would he ſtir out of his room, till he had received a ſatisfactory anſwer to his queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"Then bring your bed," replied Sandford "for you muſt paſs your whole night here."</p>
                     <p>He found it vain to think of obtaining any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence by threats, he therefore ſaid in a timid perſuaſive manner,</p>
                     <p>"Did you, Mr. Sandford, hear Lady Matilda mention my name?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes," replied Sandford, a little better recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him.</p>
                     <p>"Did you tell her what I declared to you?" he aſked with more diffidence ſtill.</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Sandford.</p>
                     <p>"It is very well, Sir," returned he vexed to the heart.—Yet again wiſhing to ſooth him,</p>
                     <p>"You certainly, Mr. Sandford, know what is for the beſt—yet I intreat you will give me ſome farther account of the nobleman you named?"</p>
                     <p>"I know what is for the beſt," replied Sandford, "and I won't."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="325" facs="unknown:025650_0327_0FCEB35AD32A6710"/>
Ruſhbrook bowed, and immediately left the room.—He went apparently ſubmiſſive, but the moment he ſhowed this ſubmiſſion, he took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of paying a viſit himſelf to the farm where Lady Matilda reſided; and of learning either from Miſs Woodley, the people of the houſe, the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or perhaps from Lady Matilda's own lips, the ſecret which the obſtinacy of Sandford had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him.</p>
                     <p>He ſaw all the dangers of this undertaking, but none appeared ſo great as the danger of loſing her he loved, by the influence of a rival—and though Sandford had named "inſolence," he was in doubt whether what had appeared ſuch to him, was ſuch in reality, or would be conſidered as ſuch by her.</p>
                     <p>To prevent his abſence being ſuſpected by Lord Elmwood, he immediately called his groom, ordered his horſe, and giving thoſe ſervants concerned, a ſtrict charge of ſecrecy, and ſome frivolous pretence to apologiſe for his not being preſent at breakfaſt (reſolving to be back by dinner) he ſet off that night, and arrived at an inn about a mile from the farm, at the break of day.</p>
                     <p>The joy he felt when he found himſelf ſo near to the beloved object of his journey, made him thank Sandford in his heart, for the unkindneſs which had ſent him thither.—But new difficulties aroſe, how to accompliſh the end for which he came;—he learnt from the people of the inn, that a lord with a fine equipage had viſited at the farm, but who he was, or for what purpoſe he went, no one could inform him.</p>
                     <p>Miſerable to return with the ſame doubts unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, with which he ſet out, and yet afraid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to extremities that might be conſtrued into preſumption, he walked diſconſolately (almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractedly) about the fields, looking repeatedly at his watch, and wiſhing the time to ſtand ſtill, till he was ready to go back with his errand compleated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="326" facs="unknown:025650_0328_0FCEB32D0298C3B0"/>
Every field he paſſed, brought him nearer to the houſe on which his imagination was fixed; but how, without forfeiting every appearance of that very reſpect he ſo powerfully felt, could he attempt to enter it?—he ſaw the indecorum, reſolved not to be guilty of it, and yet walked on till he was within but a ſhort orchard of the door. Could he then retreat?—he wiſhed he could; but he now found he had proceeded too far, to be any longer maſter of himſelf.—The time was urgent; he muſt either be bold, and venture her diſpleaſure; or by diffidence during one moment, give up all his hopes perhaps for ever.</p>
                     <p>With that ſame diſregard to conſequences, which actuated him when he dared to ſupplicate Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in his daughter's behalf, he at length went eagerly to the door and rapped.</p>
                     <p>A ſervant came—he aſked to "ſpeak with Miſs Woodley, if ſhe was quite alone." He was ſhown into an apartment, and Miſs Woodley entered to him.</p>
                     <p>She ſtarted when ſhe beheld who it was; but as he did not ſee a frown upon her face, he caught hold of her hand, and ſaid perſuaſively,</p>
                     <p>"Do not be offended with me.—If I mean to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, may I forfeit my life in atonement."</p>
                     <p>"Poor Miſs Woodley, glad in her ſolitude to ſee any one from Elmwood Houſe, forgot his viſit was an offence till he put her in mind of it; ſhe then ſaid with ſome reſerve,</p>
                     <p>"Tell me the purport of your coming, Sir, and perhaps I may then have no cauſe to complain?"</p>
                     <p>"It was to ſee Lady Matilda," he replied, "or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o hear of her health. It was to offer her my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices—it was, Miſs Woodley, to convince her, if poſſible, of my eſteem."</p>
                     <p>"Had you no other method, Sir?" ſaid Miſs Woodley, with the ſame reſerve.</p>
                     <p>"None;" replied he, "or with joy I ſhould have
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:025650_0329_0FCEB35C47F75268"/>
embraced it; and if you can inform me of any other, tell me I beſeech you inſtantly, and I will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Miſs Woodley heſitated.</p>
                     <p>"You know of no other means, Miſs Woodley," he cried.</p>
                     <p>"And yet I cannot commend this," ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>"Nor do I. Do not imagine, becauſe you ſee me here, I approve my conduct; but reduced to this neceſſity, pity the motives that have urged it."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley did pity them; but as ſhe would not own ſhe did, ſhe could think of nothing elſe to ſay.</p>
                     <p>At this inſtant a bell rung from the chamber above.</p>
                     <p>"That is Lady Matilda's bell," ſaid Miſs Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; "ſhe is coming to take a ſhort walk.—Do you wiſh to ſee her?"</p>
                     <p>Though it was the firſt wiſh Ruſhbrook had, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She had ſtept beyond the door of the apartment, when perceiving a viſitor, ſhe haſtily withdrew.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook, animated, though trembling at her preſence, cried, "Lady Matilda, do not avoid me, till you know I deſerve ſuch a puniſhment."</p>
                     <p>She immediately ſaw who it was, and returned back with a proper pride, and yet a proper polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in her manner.</p>
                     <p>"I beg your pardon, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "I did not know you, and I was afraid I intruded upon Miſs Woodley and a ſtranger."</p>
                     <p>"You do not then conſider me as a ſtranger, Lady Matilda? and that you do not, requires my warmeſt acknowledgments."</p>
                     <p>She ſat down, as if overcome by ill ſpirits and ill health.</p>

Miſs Woodley now aſked Ruſhbrook to ſit—for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"No, Madam," replied he, with confuſion, "not unleſs her ladyſhip gives me permiſſion."</p>
                     <p>Lady Matilda ſmiled, and pointed to a chair—and all the kindneſs which Ruſhbrook during his whole life had received from Lord Elmwood, never inſpired half the gratitude, which this ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of civility from his daughter excited.</p>
                     <p>He ſat down with the confeſſion of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon every feature of his face.</p>
                     <p>"I am not well, Mr. Ruſhbrook," ſaid Matilda, languidly; "and you muſt excuſe any want of eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette, you meet with at this houſe?"</p>

                     <p>"You are not well, indeed, Lady Matilda," ſaid Ruſhbrook, gazing upon her with the moſt tender reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Oh!" cried ſhe, interrupting him, and the tears now guſhed in torrents.</p>
                     <p>"Nay, do not let me add to your uneaſineſs," reſumed he, "while I am attempting to alleviate it. Inſtruct me what I am to do to ſhow my eſteem and reſpect, rather than permit me thus unguided,

to ruſh upon what you may miſterm, cruelty or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley went to Matilda, took her hand, then wiped the tears from her eyes, while Matilda reclined againſt her, wholly regardleſs of Ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook's preſence.</p>
                     <p>"If I have been the leaſt inſtrumental to this ſorrow,"—ſaid Ruſhbrook, with a face as much agitated as his mind.</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid Miſs Woodley in a low voice, "you have not—ſhe is often thus."</p>
                     <p>"Yes," ſaid Matilda, raiſing her head, "I am frequently ſo weak I cannot reſiſt the ſmalleſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to grief. But do not make your viſit long, Mr. Ruſhbrook," ſhe continued, "for I was juſt then thinking, that ſhould Lord Elmwood hear of this attention you have paid me, it might be fatal to you." Here ſhe wept again, as bitterly as before.</p>
                     <p>"There is no probability of his hearing of it, Madam," Ruſhbrook replied; "or if there was, I am perſuaded he would not reſent it; for yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, when I am confident he knew Mr. Sandford had been to ſee you, he received him on his return with unuſual marks of kindneſs."</p>
                     <p>"Did he?" ſaid ſhe—and again ſhe lifted up her head; and her eyes for a moment beamed with hope and joy.</p>
                     <p>"There is ſomething which we cannot yet define," ſaid Ruſhbrook, "that Lord Elmwood ſtruggles with; but when time ſhall have eradicated"—</p>

                     <p>She put out her hand—which he knelt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but did not raiſe it to his lips—he held the boon too ſacred—and only looking earneſtly upon it, as it lay pale and wan in his, he breathed a ſigh over it, and withdrew.</p>

For after all I have done for my nephew, it would be a pity to forſake him at laſt; and yet, that is but too likely, if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes me."</p>
                     <p>"Sir," replied Sandford, "I will ſpeak to him."</p>

                     <p>"My lord, I will uſe my endeavours for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare. But what is the ſubject on which he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to comply with your deſires?"</p>

                     <p>Here Ruſhbrook communicated his having been to ſee Lady Matilda, for which Sandford reproved him, but in leſs ſevere terms than his reproofs were in general delivered; and Ruſhbrook by his intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, now gained the intelligence who the nobleman was who had addreſt Matilda, and on what views; but was reſtrained to patience by Sandford's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and threats.</p>
                     <p>Upon the ſubject of this marriage Sandford met his patron, without having determined exactly what to ſay, but reſted on the temper in which he ſhould find his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>At the commencement of the converſation he ſaid, "Ruſhbrook begged for time."</p>
                     <p>"I have given him time, have I not," cried Lord Elmwood, "What can be the reaſon of his thus trifling with me?"</p>
                     <p>Sandford replied, "My lord, young men are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently romantic in their notions of love, and think it impoſſible to have a ſincere affection where their own inclinations do not firſt point out the choice."</p>
                     <p>"If he is in love,' anſwered his lordſhip, "let him take the object, and leave my houſe and me for ever. Nor under this deſtiny need he be pitied; for genuine love will make him happy in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in poverty, or in ſickneſs; it makes the poor man happy as the rich, the fool bleſt as the wiſe."—The ſincerity with which Lord Elmwood had loved, was expreſſed more than in words, as he ſaid this.</p>
                     <p>"Your lordſhip is talking," replied Sandford, "of the paſſion in its moſt refined and predominant ſenſe; while I may poſſibly be ſpeaking of a mere phantom, that has led this young man aſtray."</p>
                     <p>"Whatever it be," returned Lord Elmwood, "let

him and his friends weigh the caſe well, and act for the beſt—ſo ſhall I."</p>
                     <p>"His friends, my lord! What friends, or what friend has he on earth but you?"</p>
                     <p>"Then why will he not ſubmit to my advice; or himſelf give me ſome ſubſtantial reaſon why he cannot?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe there may be friendſhip without fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity—and ſo it is between him and you."</p>
                     <p>"That cannot be; for I have condeſcended to talk to him in the moſt familiar terms."</p>
                     <p>"To condeſcend, my lord, is <hi>not</hi> to be familiar."</p>
                     <p>"Then come, Sir, let us be on an equal footing through you. And now ſpeak out <hi>his</hi> thoughts freely, and hear mine in return."</p>
                     <p>"Why then he begs for a reſpite for a year or two."</p>
                     <p>"On what pretence?"</p>
                     <p>"To me it was a preference to a ſingle life—but I ſuſpect it is—what he imagines to be love—for ſome object whom he thinks your lordſhip would diſapprove for his wife."</p>
                     <p>"He has not then, actually confeſſed this to you?"</p>
                     <p>"If he has, it was drawn from him by ſuch means, I am not warranted to ſay ſo in direct words."</p>
                     <p>"I have entered into no contract, no agreement on his account with the friends of the lady I have pointed out," ſaid Lord Elmwood; "nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond implications have paſſed betwixt her family and myſelf at preſent; and if the perſon on whom he has fixed his affections, ſhould not be in a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation abſolutely contrary to my wiſhes, I may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, confirm his choice."</p>
                     <p>That moment Sandford's courage prompted him to name Lady Matilda, but his diſcretion oppoſed—however, in the various changes of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the conflict, it was plain to diſcern he wiſhed to ſay more than he dared.</p>

The inclination he made with his knees bent to the ground, ſtopped Lord Elmwood inſtantly. But though it broke in upon his words, it did not alter one angry look—his eyes darted, and his lips trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with indignation.</p>

The family conſiſted of but few perſons, all of whom ran inſtantly to the doors and opened them; on which two men ruſhed in, and with the plea of ſaving Lady Matilda from the pretended flames, caught her in their arms, and carried her off; while all the deceived people of the houſe, running ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to ſave themſelves, paid no regard to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, till looking for the cauſe for which they had been terrified, they perceived the ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, and the fatal conſequences.</p>

                     <p>IT was not with Sandford, as it had lately been with Ruſhbrook under the diſpleaſure of Lord Elm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:025650_0342_0FCEB33B28C71258"/>
—to the latter his lordſhip behaved, as ſoon as their diſſention was over, as if it had never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened—but to Sandford it was otherwiſe; and that reſentment which he had repreſſed at the time of the offence, lurked in his heart, and dwelt upon his mind for ſeveral days; during which, he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided exchanging a word with him, and gave every other demonſtration of his anger.</p>
                     <p>Sandford, who was experienced in the cruelty and ingratitude of the world, yet could not without difficulty brook this ſeverity, this contumely, from a man, for whoſe welfare, ever ſince his infancy, he had laboured; and whoſe happineſs was ſtill more dear to him, in ſpite of all his faults, than any other perſon's.—Even Lady Matilda was not ſo dear to Sandford as her father—and he loved her more that ſhe was Lord Elmwood's child, than for any other cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the old man, incenſed beyond bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was on the point of ſaying to his patron, "How in my age, dare you thus treat the man, whom in his youth you reſpected and revered?"</p>
                     <p>Sometimes inſtead of anger, he felt the tear, he was aſhamed to own, ſteal to his eye, and even fall down his cheek.—Sometimes he left the room, half determined to leave the houſe—but theſe were all but half determinations; for he knew him with whom he had to deal too well, not to know he might be provoked to greater anger yet; and that ſhould he once raſhly quit his houſe, the doors moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably would be ſhut to him for ever.</p>
                     <p>In this humiliating and degraded ſtate (for even many of the domeſtics could not but obſerve their lord's diſpleaſure) Sandford paſſed three days, and was beginning the fourth, when ſitting with his lordſhip and Ruſhbrook juſt after breakfaſt, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant entered, ſaying as he opened the door to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body who followed, "You muſt wait till you have my lord's permiſſion."</p>
                     <p>

This attracted their eyes to the door, and a man meanly dreſſed, walked in, following cloſe to the ſervant.</p>
                     <p>The latter turned, and ſeemed again to deſire the perſon to retire, but all in vain; he ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward regardleſs of his oppoſer, and in a great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, cried,</p>
                     <p>"My lord, if you pleaſe, I have buſineſs with you, provided you will chooſe to be alone."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood, ſtruck with the ſtranger's earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, bade the ſervant leave the room; and then ſaid to him,</p>
                     <p>"You may ſpeak before theſe gentlemen."</p>
                     <p>The man inſtantly turned pale, and trembled—then, to prolong the time before he ſpoke, went to the door to ſee if it was ſhut—returned—yet ſtill trembling, ſeemed unwilling to ſay his errand.</p>
                     <p>"What have you done," cried Lord Elmwood, "that you are in this terror? What have you done, man?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, my lord," replied he, "but I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid I am going to offend you."</p>
                     <p>"Well, no matter;" (anſwered his lordſhip careleſsly) "only go on, and let me know your buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>The man's diſtreſs increaſed—the water came to his eyes—and he cried in a voice of grief and of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright—"Your child, my lord!"</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook and Sandford ſtarted; and looking at Lord Elmwood, ſaw him turn white as death.—In a tremulous voice he inſtantly cried,</p>
                     <p>"What of her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" and roſe from his ſeat.</p>
                     <p>Encouraged by the queſtion, the poor man gave way to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I ſaw her, my lord, taken away by force—two ruffians ſeized and carried her away, while ſhe

ſcreamed in vain to me for help, and tore her hair indiſtraction,"</p>
                     <p>"Man, what do you mean?" cried his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Lord Margrave," returned the ſtranger, "we have no doubt has formed the plot—he has for ſome time paſt beſet the houſe where ſhe lived; and when his viſits were refuſed, he threatened this.—Beſides, one of his ſervants attended the carriage; I ſaw, and knew him."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood liſtened to the laſt part of this account with ſeeming compoſure—then turning haſtily to Ruſhbrook, he ſaid,</p>
                     <p>"Where are my piſtols, Harry?"</p>
                     <p>Sandford roſe from his ſeat, and forgetting all the anger between them, caught hold of his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's hand, and cried, "Will you then prove your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a father?"</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood only anſwered, "Yes," and left the room.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook followed, and begged with all the earneſtneſs he felt, to be permitted to accompany his uncle.</p>
                     <p>While Sandford ſhaked hands with the farmer a thouſand times.</p>
                     <p>And he, in his turn, rejoiced as if he had already ſeen Lady Matilda reſtored to liberty.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook in vain intreated Lord Elmwood; he laid his commands upon him not to ſtir from the caſtle; while the agitation of his own mind was too great to obſerve the rigour of his ſentence upon his nephew.</p>
                     <p>During the haſty preparations for his lordſhip's departure, Sandford received from Miſs Woodley the ſad intelligence of what had happened;—but he returned an anſwer to recompenſe her for all ſhe had undergone.</p>
                     <p>Within a few hours Lord Elmwood ſet off, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by his guide the farmer, and other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants

                     <p>LORD MARGRAVE, black as this incident in his ſtory muſt make him to the reader, ſtill nurſed in his conſcience a reſerve of virtue, to keep him in peace with himſelf. It was his deſign to plead, to argue, to implore, nay even to threaten, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he put his threats in force; and with this and the following reflection he reconciled, as moſt bad men can, what he had done, not only to the laws of humanity, but to the laws of honour.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſtolen a woman certainly;" ſaid he to himſelf, "but I will make her happier than ſhe was in that humble ſtate from whence I have taken her. I will even," ſaid he, "now ſhe is in my power, win her affections—and when, in fondneſs, ſhe ſhall hereafter hang upon me, how will ſhe thank me for this little trial, through which ſhe will have paſſed to happineſs?"</p>
                     <p>Thus did his lordſhip huſh his remorſe, while he waited impatiently at home, in expectation of his prize.</p>
                     <p>Half expiring with her ſufferings, in body as well as in mind, about twelve o'clock the next night Matilda arrived; and felt her ſpirits revive by the ſtill greater ſufferings that awaited, for her increaſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>errors now rouſed her from that death-like weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, brought on by fatigue.</p>
                     <p>Lord Margrave's houſe, to which he had gone
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:025650_0346_0FCEB33D72C81B58"/>
previous to this occaſion, was ſituated in the lonely part of a well-known foreſt, not more than twenty miles diſtant from London: this was an eſtate he rarely viſited; and as he had but few of his ſervants here, it was a place which he ſuppoſed would be leſs the object of ſuſpicion in the preſent caſe, than any other of his ſeats. To this, then, Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda was conveyed, a moſt ſuperb apartment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted her, and one of his lordſhip's confidential females placed to attend upon her, with all reſpect and aſſurances of ſafety.</p>
                     <p>Matilda looked in this woman's face, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eeing ſhe bore the features of her ſex, while her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reached none of thoſe worthleſs characters of which this perſon was a ſpecimen, ſhe imagined none of thoſe could look as ſhe did, and therefore found conſolation in her ſeeming tenderneſs. She was even prevailed upon (by her promiſes to ſit by her ſide and watch) to throw herſelf on the bed, and ſuffer a few minutes ſleep—for ſleep to her was ſuffering; her fears giving birth to dreams terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as her waking thoughts.</p>
                     <p>More wearied than refreſhed with her ſleep, ſhe roſe at break of day, and refuſing to admit of an article in the change of dreſs, ſhe perſiſted to ſit in the torn diſordered habit in which ſhe had been dragged away; nor would ſhe taſte a morſel of all the delicacies that were prepared for her.</p>
                     <p>Her attendant for ſome time obſerved the moſt ſubmiſſive and reverential awe; but finding this had not the effect of gaining compliance to her advice, ſhe varied her manners, and began by leſs ſervile means to attempt an influence. She ſaid her orders were to be obedient, while ſhe herſelf was obeyed—at leaſt in circumſtances ſo material as the lady's health, of which ſhe had the charge as a phyſician, and expected equal compliance from her patient—food and freſh apparel ſhe preſcribed as the only
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:025650_0347_0FCEB36D96732D58"/>
means to prevent death; and even threatened her invalid with ſomething worſe, a viſit from Lord Margrave, if ſhe continued obſtinate.</p>
                     <p>Now loathing her for the deception ſhe had prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, more, than had ſhe received her thus at firſt, Matilda hid her eyes from the ſight of her; and when ſhe was obliged to look, ſhe ſhuddered.</p>
                     <p>This female at length thought it her duty to wait upon her worthy employer, and inform him the young lady in her truſt would certainly die, unleſs there were means employed to oblige her to take ſome nouriſhment.</p>
                     <p>Lord Margrave, glad of an opportunity that might apologize for his intruſion upon Lady Matilda, went with eagerneſs to her apartment, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf at her feet, conjured her if ſhe would ſave his life, as well as her own, to ſubmit to be conſoled.</p>
                     <p>The extreme diſguſt and horror his preſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, cauſed Matilda for a moment to forget all her weakneſs, her want of health, her want of power; and riſing from the place where ſhe ſat, ſhe cried, and with her voice elevated,</p>
                     <p>"Leave me, my lord, or I'll die in ſpite of all your care; I'll inſtantly expire with grief, if you do not leave me."</p>
                     <p>Accuſtomed to the tears and reproaches of the ſex, though not of any like her, his lordſhip treated with contempt thoſe menaces of anger, and ſeizing her hand, carried it to his lips.</p>
                     <p>Enraged, and overwhelmed with ſorrow at the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, ſhe cried, (forgetting every other friend ſhe had,) "Oh! my dear Miſs Woodley, why are you not here to take my part?"</p>

<pb n="346" facs="unknown:025650_0348_0FCEB37BB9E916A8"/>
now ruſhed ſo forcibly on Matilda's mind, ſhe ſhed a ſhower of tears, thinking how much he felt, and would continue to feel, for her ſituation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was now quite night again; and near to that hour ſhe came firſt to the houſe.—Lord Margrave, though at ſome diſtance from her, remained ſtill in her apartment; while her female companion had ſtolen away. His inſenſibility to her lamentations, the agitated looks he ſometimes caſt upon her, her weakly and defenceleſs ſtate, all conſpired to fill her mind with horror.</p>
                     <p>He ſaw her apprehenſions pictured in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted face, diſheveled hair, and the whole of her forlorn appearance,—yet, notwithſtanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſolves, he could not reſiſt the deſire of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all her dreadful expectations.</p>
                     <p>He once again approached her, and was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to take her hand; when the report of a piſtol on the ſtaircaſe, and a confuſion of perſons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling towards the apartment deterred him.</p>
                     <p>He ſtarted—but looked more ſurpriſed than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed; while her alarm augmented; for ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this tumult was ſome experiment to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date her into ſubmiſſion. She therefore wrung her hands, and lifted up her eyes to heaven in the laſt agony of deſpair, when one of Lord Margrave's ſervants entered, and haſtily cried,</p>
                     <p>"Lord Elmwood, Sir."</p>
                     <p>That moment her father entered—and with the unreſtrained fondneſs of a parent, folded her in his arms.</p>

                     <p>His lordſhip interrupted him,—"Would you make me an executioner? The law ſhall be your only antagoniſt."</p>
                     <p>Matilda, quite exhauſted, yet upheld by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tranſport ſhe had felt, walked, as her father led her, out of this wretched dwelling—more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable than the cottage built with clay.</p>

                     <p>When ſhe awoke, inſtead of the uſual melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proſpect before her view, ſhe heard the voice of the late dreadful Lord Elmwood, tenderly ſaying,</p>

"We will go no farther to-night, the fatigue is too much for her;—order beds here directly, and ſome proper perſons to ſit up and attend her."</p>
                     <p>She could only turn to him with a look of love and duty; her tongue could not utter a ſentence.</p>
                     <p>In the morning ſhe found her father by the ſide of her bed.—He inquired, "If ſhe was in health ſufficient to purſue her journey, or if ſhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main where ſhe was?"</p>
                     <p>"I am able to go with you," ſhe anſwered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</p>
                     <p>"Nay," replied he, "perhaps you ought to ſtay here till you are better?"</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>am</hi> better," ſaid ſhe, "and ready to go with you."—Half afraid he meant to ſend her from him.</p>
                     <p>He perceived her fears, and replied, "Nay if you ſtay, ſo ſhall I—and when I go, I ſhall take you along with me to my houſe."</p>

                     <p>When Matilda was ready to join her father in the next room, ſhe felt a tremour ſeize her, that made it almoſt impoſſible to appear before him.—No other circumſtance now depending to agitate her heart, ſhe felt more forcibly its embarraſſment at meeting on terms of eaſy intercourſe, him, whom ſhe had been uſed to think of, but with that diſtant reverence and fear, which his ſeverity had excited; and ſhe knew not how to dare to ſpeak, or look on him with that freedom her affection warranted.</p>
                     <p>After ſeveral efforts to conquer theſe nice and refined ſenſations, but to no purpoſe, ſhe went at laſt to his apartment.—He was reading; but as ſhe entered, put out his hand and drew her to him.—Her tears wholly overcame her.—He could have intermingled his—but aſſuming a grave counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he commanded her to deſiſt from exhauſting her ſpirits; and, after a few powerful ſtruggles, ſhe obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Before the morning was over, ſhe experienced the extreme joy of ſitting by her father's ſide as they drove to town, and receiving during his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a thouſand proofs of his love, and tokens of her laſting happineſs.</p>
                     <p>It was now the middle of November, and yet as Matilda paſſed along, the fields to her delighted eye appeared green; the trees in their bloom; and every bird ſeemed to ſing the ſweeteſt muſic—Never to her, did the ſun riſe upon a morning ſuch as this—never did her imagination compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the human heart could feel happineſs ſo true as her's.</p>
                     <p>On arriving at the houſe, there was no abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her felicity—all was reſpect and duty on the part of the domeſtics—all paternal care on the

part of Lord Elmwood;—and ſhe ſeemed to be at that ſummit of her wiſhes which annihilates hope, but that the proſpect of ſeeing Miſs Woodley and Mr. Sandford, ſtill kept this pleaſing paſſion in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence.</p>

                     <p>RUSHBROOK was detained at Elmwood Houſe during all this time, more from the friendly perſuaſions, nay even prayers, of Sandford, than by the commands of Lord Elmwood. He had, but for Sandford, followed his uncle, and expoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his ſevereſt anger, rather than have endured a ſtate of the moſt piercing inquietude, ſuch as he ſuffered till the news arrived of Lady Matilda's ſafety.—He indeed had little elſe to fear from the known, firm, and courageous character of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the expedition with which he undertook his journey; but lover's fears are like thoſe of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and no argument could perſuade either him or Miſs Woodley (who had now ventured to come to Elmwood Houſe) but that Matilda's peace of mind might be for ever deſtroyed before ſhe was ſet at liberty.</p>
                     <p>The ſummons from Lord Elmwood for their coming to town, was received by each of this party with delight; but the impatience to obey it was in Ruſhbrook ſo violent, it was painful to himſelf, and extremely troubleſome to Sandford; who wiſhed, from his regard to Lady Matilda, rather to delay, than hurry their journey.</p>
                     <p>"You are to blame," ſaid he to him and to Miſs Woodley, "to wiſh by your arrival, to divide with Lord Elmwood that tender tie, with which obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:025650_0353_0FCEB37553645B00"/>
conferred ever binds the donor.—At preſent there is no one with him to ſhare in the care and protection of his daughter, and he is under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of diſcharging the duty himſelf; accuſtomed to this, it may become ſo powerful he cannot throw it off, even if his former reſolutions ſhould urge him to it.—While we remain here, therefore, Lady Matilda is ſafe with her father; but it would not ſurpriſe me, if on our arrival (eſpecially if we are precipitate) he ſhould place her again with Miſs Woodley at a diſtance."</p>
                     <p>To this forcible conjecture, they ſubmitted for a few days, and then moſt gladly ſet out for town.</p>
                     <p>On their arrival, they were met, even at the door of the ſtreet, by Lady Matilda; and with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of joy, they did not ſuppoſe her features could have worn.—She embraced Miſs Woodley! hung upon Sandford!—and to Mr. Ruſhbrook, who from his conſcious love only bowed at an humble diſtance, ſhe held out her hand with every look and geſture of the tendereſt eſteem.</p>
                     <p>When Lord Elmwood joined them, he welcomed them all moſt ſincerely; eſpecially Sandford; with whom he had not ſpoken for many days before he left the country, merely for his alluding to the wretched ſituation of his daughter.—And Sandford (with his fellow-travellers) now ſaw his lordſhip treat that daughter with all the eaſy, natural fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if ſhe had lived with him from her infancy. He appeared, however, at times, under the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that the propenſity of man to jealouſy, might give Ruſhbrook a pang at this dangerous ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val in his love and fortune—for though his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip remembered well the hazard he had once ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to befriend Matilda, yet the preſent unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited reconciliation was ſomething ſo unlooked for, it might be a trial too much for his generoſity, to
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:025650_0354_0FCEB380F47D60C0"/>
remain wholly diſintereſted on the event. Slight as was this ſuſpicion, it did Ruſhbrook injuſtice.—He loved Lady Matilda too ſincerely; he loved her father's happineſs, and her mother's memory too faithfully, not to be rejoiced at all he was witneſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> did the ſecret hope that whiſpered to him, "There every bleſſing might one day be mutual," increaſe the pleaſure he found, in beholding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda happy.</p>
                     <p>Unexpected affairs, in which Lord Elmwood had been for ſome time engaged, diverted his attention for a while from the marriage of his nephew; nor did he at this time find his diſpoſition ſufficiently ſevere to exact from the young man a compliance with his wiſhes, at the cruel alternative of being for ever diſcarded.—He felt his mind, by the late incident, too much ſoftened for ſuch harſhneſs; he yet wiſhed for the alliance he had propoſed; for he was more conſiſtent in his character, than to ſuffer the ſudden tenderneſs his daughter's danger had awakened, to derange thoſe plans ſo long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; and never for a moment did he indulge—for perhaps it had been an indulgence—the idea of replacing her exactly in that ſituation to which ſhe was born, to the diſappointment of all his nephew's expectations.</p>
                     <p>Milder now in his temper than he had been for years before, and knowing he could be no longer irritated upon the ſubject of his daughter, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip once more reſolved to truſt himſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with Ruſhbrook on the ſubject of marriage, meaning at the ſame time to mention Matilda as an opponent from whom he had nothing to fear. But for ſome time before Ruſhbrook was called to his private audience, he had by his unwearied attention, endeavoured to impreſs upon Matilda's mind, the ſofteſt ſentiments in his favour.—He ſucceeded—but not as he wiſhed.—She loved him as her friend,

her couſin, her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ter-brother, but not as a lover.—The idea of love never once came to her thoughts; and ſhe would ſport with Ruſhbrook like the moſt harmleſs child; while he, all impaſſioned, could with difficulty reſiſt telling her, what ſhe made him ſuffer.</p>
                     <p>At the meeting between him and Lord Elmwood, to which he was ſent for to give his final anſwer on that ſubject which had once nearly proved ſo fatal to him; after a thouſand fears, much confuſion and embarraſſment, he at length frankly confeſſed his "Heart was engaged, and had been ſo, long before his lordſhip offered to direct his choice."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood deſired to know "on whom he had placed his affections?"</p>
                     <p>"I dare not tell you, my lord,"—returned he, infinitely confuſed; but Mr. Sandford can witneſs their ſincerity, and how long they have been fixed."</p>
                     <p>"Fixed!" cried his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>"Immoveably fixed, my lord; and yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is as unknowing of it to this moment, as you yourſelf have been; and I ſwear ever ſhall be ſo, without your permiſſion."</p>
                     <p>"Name the object," ſaid Lord Elmwood, anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I dare not—the laſt time I named her to you, you threatened to abandon me for my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance."</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood ſtarted.—"My daughter!—Would you marry her?"</p>
                     <p>"But with your approbation, my lord; and that"—</p>
                     <p>Before he could proceed a word farther, his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip left the room haſtily—and left Ruſhbrook all terror for his approaching fate.</p>
                     <p>Lord Elmwood went immediately into the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Sandford, Miſs Woodley, and Matilda
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:025650_0356_0FD02D504BDD4EC8"/>

                     <p>"Ruſhbrook has offended me beyond forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Go, Sandford, to the library, where he is, and tell him this inſtant to quit my houſe, and never dare to return."</p>
                     <p>Miſs Woodley lifted up her hands and ſighed.</p>
                     <p>Sandford roſe ſlowly from his ſeat to execute his office.</p>
                     <p>While Lady Matilda, who was arranging her muſic-books upon the inſtrument, ſtopped from her employment ſuddenly, with her face bathed in tears.</p>
                     <p>A general ſilence enſued, till Lord Elmwood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming his angry tone, cried, "Did you hear me, Mr. Sandford?"</p>
                     <p>Sandford now, without a word in reply, made for the door—but there Matilda impeded him, and throwing her arms about his neck, cried,</p>
                     <p>"Dear Mr. Sandford, do not."</p>
                     <p>"How!" exclaimed her father.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw the frown that was impending, and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards him, took his hand fearfully, and knelt at his feet.—"Mr. Ruſhbrook is my relation," ſhe cried in a pathetic voice, "my companion, my friend—before you loved me, he was anxious for my happineſs, and often viſited me to propoſe ſome kindneſs. I cannot ſee him turned out of your houſe without feeling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Lord Elmwood turned aſide to conceal his ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—then raiſing her from the floor, he ſaid, "Do you know what he aſked of me?"</p>
                     <p>"No,"—anſwered ſhe in the utmoſt ignorance, and with the utmoſt innocence painted on her face.</p>
                     <p>"But whatever it is, my lord, though you do not grant it, yet pardon him for aſking."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps <hi>you</hi> would grant him what he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted?" ſaid his lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>

"Moſt willingly—was it in my gift."</p>
                     <p>"It is," replied he, "And go to him in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and hear what he has to ſay;—for on your will his fate ſhall depend."</p>
                     <p>Like lightning ſhe flew out of the room; while even the grave Sandford ſmiled at the idea of their meeting.</p>
                     <p>Ruſhbrook, with his fears all verified by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which his uncle had left him, ſat with his head reclined againſt a book-caſe, and every limb extended with the deſpair that had ſeized him.</p>
                     <p>Matilda nimbly opened the door and cried, "Mr. Ruſhbrook, I am come to comfort you."</p>
                     <p>"That you have always done," ſaid he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What is it you want?" ſaid ſhe, "What have you aſked of my father that he has denied you?"</p>
                     <p>"I have aſked for that," replied he, "which is dearer to me than my life."</p>
                     <p>"Be ſatisfied then," returned ſhe, "for you ſhall have it."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Matilda! it is not in your power to beſtow."</p>
                     <p>"But his lordſhip has told me, it <hi>ſhall</hi> be in my power; and has deſired me to give, or to refuſe it you, at my own pleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"O Heavens!" cried Ruſhbrook in tranſport, "Has he?"</p>
                     <p>"He has indeed—before Mr. Sandford and Miſs Woodley.—Now tell me what your petition is?"</p>
                     <p>"I aſked him," cried Ruſhbrook, trembling, "for a wife."</p>

"Yes," ſhe exclaimed: "Heaven is my witneſs. But it gives me concern to think we muſt part."</p>
                     <p>"Then let us be joined," cried he, falling at her feet, "till death alone can part us."</p>
                     <p>All the ſenſibility, the reſerve, the pride, with which ſhe was ſo amply poſſeſſed, returned to her that moment. She ſtarted, and cried, "Could Lord Elmwood know for what he has ſent me?"</p>
                     <p>"He did," replied Ruſhbrook—"I boldly told him of my preſumptuous love, and he has yielded to you alone, the power over my happineſs or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.—Oh! do not doom me to the latter."</p>
                     <p>Whether the heart of Matilda, ſuch as it has been deſcribed, <hi>could</hi> ſentence him to miſery, the reader is left to ſurmiſe—and if he ſuppoſes that it did not, he has every reaſon to ſuppoſe their wedded life was a life of happineſs.</p>
