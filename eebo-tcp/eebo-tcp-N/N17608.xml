            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>Our feet ſhall ſtand within thy gates, O Jeruſalem, whither the tribes go up; the tribes of the Lord unto the teſtimony of Iſrael.

Peace be within thy walls, and proſperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions ſake I will now ſay, peace be within thee. Becauſe of the Houſe of the Lord our God, I will ſeek thy good.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN theſe words the Pſalmiſt expreſſes, in ſtrong and beautiful language, his love of his country, and the reaſons on which he founded it; and my preſent deſign is, to take occaſion from them to explain the duty we owe to our country, and the nature, foundation, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022814_0004_0FBA67656A128200"/>
proper expreſſions of that love to it which we ought to cultivate.</p>
            <p>I RECKON this a ſubject particularly ſuitable to the ſervices of this day, and to the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of our deliverance at the Revolution from the dangers of popery and arbitrary power; and ſhould I, on ſuch an occaſion, be led to touch more on political ſubjects than would at any other time be proper in the pulpit, you will, I doubt not, excuſe me.</p>
            <p>THE love of our country has, in all times, been a ſubject of warm commendations; and it is certainly a noble paſſion; but, like all other paſſions, it requires regulation and direction. There are miſtakes and prejudices by which, in this inſtance, we are in particular danger of being miſled.—I will briefly mention ſome of theſe to you, and obſerve,</p>
            <p>FIRST, That by our country is meant, in this caſe, not the ſoil, or the ſpot of earth on which we happen to have been born; not the foreſts and fields, but that community of which we are members; or that body of companions and friends and kindred who are aſſociated with us
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022814_0005_0FBA676AB0A34370"/>
under the ſame conſtitution of government, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the ſame laws, and bound together by the ſame civil polity.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, It is proper to obſerve, that even in this ſenſe of our country, that love of it which is our duty, does not imply any conviction of the ſuperior value of it to other countries, or any particular preference of its laws and conſtitution of government. Were this implied, the love of their country would be the duty of only a very ſmall part of mankind; for there are few countries that enjoy the advantage of laws and governments which deſerve to be preferred. To found, therefore, this duty on ſuch a preference, would be to found it on error and deluſion.—It is however a common deluſion.—There is the ſame partiality in countries, to themſelves, that there is in individuals. All our attachments ſhould be accompanied, as far as poſſible, with right opinions.—We are too apt to confine wiſdom and virtue within the circle of our own acquaintance and party. Our friends, our country, and, in ſhort, every thing related to us, we are diſpoſed to overvalue. A wiſe man
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022814_0006_0FBA676DA5166280"/>
will guard himſelf againſt this deluſion. He will ſtudy to think of all things as they are, and not ſuffer any partial affections to blind his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. In other families there may be as much worth as in our own. In other circles of friends there may be as much wiſdom; and in other countries as much of all that deſerves eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem; but, notwithſtanding this, our obligation to love our own families, friends, and country, and to ſeek, in the firſt place, their good, will remain the ſame.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, It is proper I ſhould deſire you particularly to diſtinguiſh between the love of our country and that ſpirit of rivalſhip and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which has been common among nations.—What has the love of their country hitherto been among mankind? What has it been but a love of domination; a deſire of conqueſt, and a thirſt for grandeur and glory, by extending ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, and enſlaving ſurrounding countries? What has it been but a blind and narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, producing in every country a contempt of other countries, and forming men into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and factions againſt their common
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022814_0007_0FBA676F40BF73B8"/>
rights and liberties? This is the principle that has been too often cried up as a virtue of the firſt rank: a principle of the ſame kind with that which governs clans of <hi>Indians,</hi> or tribes of <hi>Arabs,</hi> and leads them out to plunder and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre. As moſt of the evils which have taken place in private life, and among individuals, have been occaſioned by the deſire of private intereſt overcoming the public affections; ſo moſt of the evils which have taken place among bodies of men have been occaſioned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their own intereſt overcoming the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of univerſal benevolence: and leading them to attack one another's territories, to encroach on one another's rights, and to endeavour to build their own advancement on the degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all within the reach of their power—What was the love of their country among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but a wretched partiality to themſelves, and a proud contempt of all other nations? What was the love of their country among the old <hi>Romans?</hi> We have heard much of it; but I cannot heſitate in ſaying that, however great it appeared in ſome of its exertions, it was, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, no better than a principle holding toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a band of robbers in their attempts to cruſh all liberty but their own. What is now the love
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022814_0008_0FBA6770ABFA54D0"/>
of his country in a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Ruſſian?</hi> Can it be conſidered as any thing better than a paſſion for ſlavery, or a blind attachment to a ſpot where he enjoys no rights, and is diſpoſed of as if he was a beaſt?</p>
            <p>LET us learn by ſuch reflections to correct and purify this paſſion, and to make it a juſt and rational principle of action.</p>
            <p>IT is very remarkable that the founder of our religion has not once mentioned this duty, or given us any recommendation of it; and this has, by unbelievers, been made an objection to Chriſtianity. What I have ſaid will entirely remove this objection. Certain it is, that, by inculcating on men an attachment to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Chriſtianity would, at the time it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, have done unſpeakably more harm than good. Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> would have been an excitement to war and inſurrections; for they were then in eager expectation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ſoon (as the favourite people of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) the lords and conquerors of the earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the triumphant reign of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> Among the <hi>Romans,</hi> likewiſe, this principle had, as I have juſt obſerved, exceeded its juſt bounds, and rendered them enemies to the peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind. By inculcating it, therefore,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022814_0009_0FBA6772400AAE60"/>
Chriſtianity would have confirmed both Jews and Gentiles in one of the moſt pernicious faults. Our Lord and his Apoſtles have done better. They have recommended that UNIVERSAL BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NEVOLENCE which is an unſpeakably nobler principle than any partial affections. They have laid ſuch ſtreſs on loving all men, even our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and made an ardent and extenſive charity ſo eſſential a part of virtue, that the religion they have preached may, by way of diſtinction from all other religions, be called the Religion of Benevolence. Nothing can be more friendly to the general rights of mankind; and were it duly regarded and practiſed, every man would conſider every other man as his brother, and all the animoſity that now takes place among con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending nations would be aboliſhed. If you want any proof of this, think of our Saviour's parable of the good Samaritan. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> were two rival nations that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a hatred of one another the moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The deſign of this parable was to ſhew to a <hi>Jew,</hi> that even a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all men of all nations and religions, were included in the precept, THOU SHALT LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF.</p>
            <p>BUT I am digreſſing from what I had chiefly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022814_0010_0FBA6773B7274728"/>
in view; which was, after noticing that love of our country which is falſe and ſpurious, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature and effects of that which is juſt and reaſonable. With this view. I muſt deſire you to recollect that we are ſo conſtituted that our affections are more drawn to ſome among mankind than to others, in proportion to their degrees of nearneſs to us, and our power of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful to them. It is obvious, that this is a circumſtance in the conſtitution of our natures which proves the wiſdom and goodneſs of our Maker; for had our affections been determined alike to all our fellow-creatures, human life would have been a ſcene of embarraſſment and diſtraction. Our regards, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, begin with ourſelves; and every man is charged primarily with the care of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Next come our families, and benefactors, and friends; and after them, our country. We can do little for the intereſt of mankind at large. To this intereſt, however, all other intereſts are ſubordinate. The nobleſt principle in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the regard to general juſtice, and that good-will which embraces all the world.—I have already obſerved this; but it cannot be too often repeated. Though our immediate attention muſt be employed in promoting our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022814_0011_0FBA67754320B860"/>
own intereſt and that of our neareſt connexions; yet we muſt remember, that a narrower intereſt ought always to give way to a more extenſive intereſt. In purſuing particularly the intereſt of our country, we ought to carry our views be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it. We ſhould love it ardently, but not excluſively. We ought to ſeek its good, by all the means that our different circumſtances and abilities will allow; but, at the ſame time, we ought to conſider ourſelves as citizens of the world, and take care to maintain a juſt regard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rights of other countries.</p>
            <p>THE enquiry by what means (ſubject to this limitation) we may beſt promote the intereſt of our country, is very important; and all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of this diſcourſe ſhall be employed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering it, and in exhorting you to manifeſt your love to your country, by the means I ſhall mention.</p>
            <p>THE chief bleſſings of human nature are the three following:—TRUTH—VIRTUE—and LIBERTY.—Theſe are, therefore, the bleſſings in the poſſeſſion of which the intereſt of our country lies, and to the attainment of which our love of it ought to direct our endeavours. By the diffuſion of KNOWLEDGE it muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a country of <hi>Barbarians:</hi> by the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022814_0012_0FBA6777242E63E0"/>
practice of religious VIRTUE, it muſt be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from a country of <hi>gamblers, Atheiſts,</hi> and <hi>libertines:</hi> and by the poſſeſſion of LIBERTY, it muſt be diſtinguiſhed from a country of <hi>ſlaves.</hi>—I will dwell for a few moments on each of theſe heads:</p>
            <p>OUR firſt concern, as lovers of our country, muſt be to <hi>enlighten</hi> it.—Why are the nations of the world ſo patient under deſpotiſm?—Why do they crouch to tyrants, and ſubmit to be treated as if they were a herd of cattle? Is it not becauſe they are kept in darkneſs, and want knowledge? Enlighten them and you will elevate them. Shew them they are <hi>men,</hi> and they will act like <hi>men.</hi> Give them juſt ideas of civil government, and let them know that it is an expedient for gaining protection againſt injury and defending their rights, and it will be impoſſible for them to ſubmit to governments which, like moſt of thoſe now in the world, are uſurpations on the rights of men, and little better than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances for enabling the <hi>few</hi> to oppreſs the <hi>many.</hi> Convince them that the Deity is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and benevolent as well as omnipotent Being, who regards with equal eye all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and connects his favour with nothing but an honeſt deſire to know and do his will; and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022814_0013_0FBA677C17983110"/>
that zeal for myſtical doctrines which has led men to hate and haraſs one another, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated. Set religion before them as a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſervice, conſiſting not in any rites and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but in worſhipping God with a pure heart, and practiſing righteouſneſs from the fear of his diſpleaſure and the apprehenſion of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture righteous judgment, and that gloomy and cruel ſuperſtition will be aboliſhed, which has hitherto gone under the name of religion, and to the ſupport of which civil government has been perverted.—Ignorance is the parent of bigotry, intolerance, perſecution and ſlavery.—Inform and inſtruct mankind, and theſe evils will be excluded.—Happy is the perſon who, himſelf raiſed above vulgar errors, is conſcious of having aimed at giving mankind this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Happy is the Scholar or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher who at the cloſe of life can reflect that he has made this uſe of his learning and abilities: but happier far muſt he be, if at the ſame time he has reaſon to believe he has been ſucceſsful, and actually contributed, by his inſtructions, to diſſeminate among his fellow-creatures juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of themſelves, of their rights, of religion, and the nature and end of civil government. Such were <hi>Milton, Locke, Sidney, Hoadly,</hi> &amp;c. in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022814_0014_0FBA677FE8DF7870"/>
this country; ſuch were <hi>Monteſquieu, Fenelon, Turgot,</hi> &amp;c. in France. They ſowed a ſeed which has ſince taken root, and is now growing up to a glorious harveſt. To the information they conveyed by their writings we owe thoſe revolutions in which every friend to mankind is now exulting.—What an encouragement is this to us all in our endeavours to enlighten the world? Every degree of illumination which we can communicate muſt do the greateſt good. It helps to prepare the minds of men for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their rights, and haſtens the overthrow of prieſtcraft and tyranny.—In ſhort, we may, in this inſtance, learn, our duty from the conduct of the oppreſſors of the world. They know that light is hoſtile to them, and therefore they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keep men in the dark. With this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention they have appointed licenſers of the preſs; and, in Popiſh countries, prohibited the reading of the Bible. Remove the darkneſs in which they envelope the world, and their uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations will be expoſed, their power will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and the world emancipated.</p>
            <p>THE next great bleſſing of human nature which I have mentioned, is VIRTUE. This ought to follow knowledge, and to be directed by it. Virtue without knowledge makes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022814_0015_0FBA678136ABFCA8"/>
and knowledge without virtue makes devils; but both united elevates to the top of human dignity and perfection.—We muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we would ſerve our country, make both theſe the objects of our zeal. We muſt diſcourage vice in all its forms; and our endeavours to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten muſt have ultimately in view a reformation of manners and virtuous practice.</p>
            <p>I MUST add here, that in the practice of virtue I include the diſcharge of the public duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. By neglecting theſe, we may injure our country eſſentially. But it is melancholy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that it is a common neglect among us; and in a great meaſure owing to a cauſe which is not likely to be ſoon removed: I mean, the defects (may I not ſay, the abſurdities?) in our eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed codes of faith and worſhip. In foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, the higher ranks of men, not diſtinguiſhing between the religion they ſee eſtabliſhed and the Chriſtian religion, are generally driven to irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and infidelity. The like evil is produced by the like cauſe in this country; and if no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our eſtabliſhed formularies can be brought about, it muſt be expected that religion will go on to loſe its credit, and that little of it will be left except among the lower orders of people, many of whom, while their ſuperiors give up all religion, are
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022814_0016_0FBA6783CDB97D20"/>
ſinking into an enthuſiaſm in religion lately revived.</p>
            <p>I HOPE you will not miſtake what I am now ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or conſider it as the effect of my prejudices as a Diſſenter from the eſtabliſhed church. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint I am making, is the complaint of many of the wiſeſt and beſt men in the eſtabliſhed church itſelf, who have been long urging the neceſſity of a reviſal of its Liturgy and Articles. Theſe were framed above two centuries ago, when Chriſtendom was juſt emerging from the ignorance and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the dark ages. They remain now much the ſame they were then; and, therefore, cannot be properly adapted to the good ſenſe and liberality of the preſent times.—This imperfection, however, in our public forms of worſhip, affords no excuſe to any perſon for neglecting public worſhip. All communities will have ſome religion; and it is of infinite conſequence that they ſhould be led to that which, by enforcing the obligations of virtue and putting men upon loving inſtead of damning one another, is moſt favourable to the intereſt of ſociety.</p>
            <p>IF there is a Governor of the world, who directs all events, he ought to be invoked and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; and thoſe who diſlike that mode of worſhip which is preſcribed by public authority, ought (if they can find no worſhip <hi>out</hi> of the church which they approve) to ſet up a ſeparate worſhip for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022814_0017_0FBA678516FE3B00"/>
and by doing this, and giving an example of a rational and manly worſhip, men of weight, from their rank or literature, may do the greateſt ſervice to ſociety and the world. They may bear a teſtimony againſt that application of civil power to the ſupport of particular modes of faith, which obſtructs human improvement, and perpetuates error; and they may hold out an inſtruction which will diſcountenance ſuperſtition, and at the ſame time recommend religion, by making it appear to be (what it certainly is when rightly underſtood) the ſtrongeſt incentive to all that is generous and worthy, and conſequently the beſt friend to public order and happineſs.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY is the next great bleſſing which I have mentioned as the object of patriotic zeal. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from knowledge and virtue, and together with them completes the glory of a community. An enlightened and virtuous country muſt be a free country. It cannot ſuffer invaſions of its rights, or bend to tyrants.—I need not, on this occaſion, take any pains to ſhew you how great a bleſſing liberty is. The ſmalleſt attention to the hiſtory of paſt ages, and the preſent ſtate of mankind, will make you ſenſible of its importance. Look round the world, and you will find almoſt every country, reſpectable or contemptible, happy or miſerable,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022814_0018_0FBA6788A8507328"/>
a fruitful field or a frightful waſte, according as it poſſeſſes or wants this bleſſing. Think of <hi>Greece,</hi> formerly the ſeat of arts and ſcience, and the moſt diſtinguiſhed ſpot under heaven; but now, having loſt liberty, a vile and wretched ſpot, a region of darkneſs, poverty, and barbarity.—Such reflections muſt convince you that, if you love your country, you cannot be zealous enough in promoting the cauſe of liberty in it. But it will come in my way to ſay more to this purpoſe preſently.</p>
            <p>THE obſervations I have made include our whole duty to our country; for by endeavouring to lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eralize and enlighten it, to diſcourage vice and to promote virtue in it, and to aſſert and ſupport its liberties, we ſhall endeavour to do all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make it great and happy.—But it is proper that, on this occaſion, I ſhould be more explicit, and exemplify our duty to our country by obſerving farther, that it requires us to obey its laws, and to reſpect its magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government (as I have before obſerved) is an inſtitution of human prudence for guarding our perſons, our property, and our good name, againſt invaſion; and for ſecuring to the members of a community that liberty to which all have an equal right, as far as they do not, by any overt act, uſe it to injure the liberty of others. Civil
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022814_0019_0FBA678D1BFAB070"/>
laws are regulations agreed upon by the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for gaining theſe ends; and civil magiſtrates are officers appointed by the community for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting theſe laws. Obedience, therefore, to the laws and to magiſtrates, are neceſſary expreſſions of our regard to the community; and without this obedience the ends of government cannot be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or a community avoid falling into a ſtate of anarchy that will deſtroy thoſe rights and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that liberty, which government is inſtituted to protect.</p>
            <p>I WISH it was in my power to give you a juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the importance of this obſervation. It ſhews the ground on which the duty of obeying ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil governors ſtands, and that there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes in this caſe which ought to be avoided.—Theſe extremes are adulation and ſervility on one hand; and a proud and licentious contempt on the other. The former is the extreme to which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general have been moſt prone; for it has oftener happened that men have been too paſſive than too unruly; and the rebellion of Kings againſt their people has been more common, and done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> miſchief, than the rebellion of people againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> 
               <hi>them,</hi> by giving them
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022814_0020_0FBA678E864CE658"/>
improper ideas of their ſituation; and it debaſes thoſe who offer it, by manifeſting an abjectneſs founded on improper ideas of <hi>themſelves.</hi> I have lately obſerved in this kingdom too near approaches to this abjectneſs. In our late addreſſes to the King, on his recovery from the ſevere illneſs with which God has been pleaſed to afflict him, we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more like a herd crawling at the feet of a maſter, than like enlightened and manly citizens rejoicing with a beloved Sovereign, but at the ſame time conſcious that he derives all his conſequence from themſelves. But, perhaps, theſe ſervilities in the language of our late addreſſes ſhould be pardoned, as only <hi>forms</hi> of civility and expreſſions of an overflow of good-nature. They have, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a dangerous tendency. The potentates of this world are ſufficiently apt to conſider themſelves as poſſeſſed of an inherent ſuperiority, which gives them a right to govern, and makes mankind <hi>their own;</hi> and this infatuation is almoſt every where foſtered in them by the creeping ſycophants about them, and the language of flattery which they are continually hearing.</p>
            <p>CIVIL governors are properly the ſervants of the public; and a King is no more than the firſt ſervant of the public, created by it, maintained by it, and reſponſible to it: and all the homage paid him, is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022814_0021_0FBA6790EF8EE570"/>
due to him on no other account than his relation to the public. His ſacredneſs is the ſacredneſs of the community. His authority is the authority of the community; and the term Majeſty, which it is uſual to apply to him, is by no means <hi>his own</hi> majeſty, but the MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE. For this reaſon, whatever he may be in his private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; and though, in reſpect of perſonal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not equal to, or even far below many among ourſelves—For this reaſon, I ſay (that is, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the community and its firſt magiſtrate), he is entitled to our reverence and obedience. The words MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY are rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him; and there is a reſpect which it would be criminal to withhold from him.</p>
            <p>You cannot be too attentive to this obſervation. The improvement of the world depends on the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it: nor will mankind be ever as virtuous and happy as they are capable of being, till the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it becomes univerſal and efficacious. If we forget it, we ſhall be in danger of an idolatry as groſs and ſtupid as that of the ancient heathens, who, after fabricating blocks of wood or ſtone, fell down and worſhipped them.—The diſpoſition in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to this kind of idolatry is indeed a very mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſubject of reflection.—In TURKEY, millions of human beings adore a ſilly mortal, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022814_0022_0FBA679274D0FF00"/>
to throw themſelves at his feet, and to ſubmit their lives to his diſcretion.—In RUSSIA, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people are only a STOCK on the lands of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, or appendages to their eſtates, which, like the fixtures in a houſe, are bought and ſold with the eſtates.—In SPAIN, in GERMANY, and under moſt of the governments of the world, mankind are in a ſimilar ſtate of humiliation. Who, that has a juſt ſenſe of the dignity of his nature, can avoid execrating ſuch a debaſement of it?</p>
            <p>HAD I been to addreſs the King on a late oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I ſhould have been inclined to do it in a ſtyle very different from that of moſt of the addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and to uſe ſome ſuch language as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:—<q>I rejoice, Sir, in your recovery. I thank God for his goodneſs to you. I honour you not only as my King, but as almoſt the only lawful King in the world, becauſe the only one who owes his crown to the choice of his people.—May you enjoy all poſſible happineſs.—May God ſhew you the folly of thoſe effuſions of adulation which you are now receiving, and guard you againſt their effects.—May you be led to ſuch a juſt ſenſe of the nature of your ſituation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch wiſdom, as ſhall render your reſtoration to the government of theſe kingdoms a bleſſing to it, and engage you to conſider your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as more properly the <hi>Servant</hi> than the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> of your people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:022814_0023_0FBA67946D91D138"/>
BUT I muſt not forget the oppoſite extreme to that now taken notice of; that is, a diſdainful pride, derived from a conſciouſneſs of equality, or, perhaps, ſuperiority, in reſpect of all that gives true dignity to men in power, and producing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them, and a diſpoſition to treat them with rudeneſs and inſult. It is a trite obſervation, that extremes generally beget one another. This is particularly true in the preſent caſe. Perſons juſtly informed on the ſubject of government, when they ſee men dazzled by looking up to high ſtations, and obſerve loyalty carried to a length that implies ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſervility: ſuch perſons, in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, are in danger of ſpurning at all public authority, and throwing off that reſpectful demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to perſons inveſted with it, which the order of ſociety requires. There is undoubtedly a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deference and homage due to civil magiſtrates, on account of their ſtations and offices; nor can that man be either truly wiſe or truly virtuous, who deſpiſes governments, and wantonly <hi>ſpeaks evil of his rulers;</hi> or who does not, by all the means in his power, endeavour to ſtrengthen their hands, and to give weight to their exertions in the diſcharge of their duty.—<hi>Fear God,</hi> ſays St. Peter. <hi>Love the brotherhood. Honour all men. Honour the King.</hi>—<hi>You muſt needs,</hi> ſays St. Paul, <hi>be ſubject to rulers, not only for wrath</hi> (that is, from the fear of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022814_0024_0FBA6797708C48A0"/>
the penalties annexed to the breach of the laws) <hi>but for conſcience ſake. For rulers are miniſters of God, and revengers for executing wrath on all that do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER expreſſion of our love to our country is defending it againſt enemies. Theſe enemies are of two ſorts, internal and external; or domeſtic and foreign. The former are the moſt dangerous, and they have generally been the moſt ſucceſsful. I have juſt obſerved, that there is a ſubmiſſion due to the executive officers of government, which is our duty; but you muſt not forget what I have alſo obſerved, that it muſt not be a blind and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſubmiſſion. Men in power (unleſs better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than is common) are always endeavouring to extend their power. They hate the doctrine, that it is a TRUST derived from the people, and not a <hi>right</hi> veſted in themſelves. For this reaſon, the tendency of every government is to deſpotiſm; and in this the beſt conſtituted governments muſt end, if the people are not vigilant, ready to take alarms, and determined to reſiſt abuſes as ſoon as they begin. This vigilance, therefore, it is our duty to maintain. Whenever it is withdrawn, and a people ceaſe to reaſon about their rights and to be awake to encroachments, they are in danger of being enſlaved, and their <hi>ſervants</hi> will ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their <hi>maſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I NEED not ſay how much it is our duty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022814_0025_0FBA67999E846890"/>
our country againſt foreign enemies. When a country is attacked in any of its rights by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, or when any attempts are made by ambitious foreign powers to injure it, a war in its defence becomes neceſſary: and, in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to die for our country is meritorious and noble. Theſe <hi>defenſive</hi> wars are, in my opinion, the only juſt wars. <hi>Offenſive</hi> wars are always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; and to ſeek the aggrandizement of our country by them, that is, by attacking other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, in order to extend dominion, or to gratify avarice, is wicked and deteſtable. Such, however, have been moſt of the wars which have taken place in the world; but the time is, I hope, coming, when a conviction will prevail, of the folly as well as the iniquity of wars; and when the nations of the earth, happy under juſt governments, and no longer in danger from the paſſions of Kings, will find out better ways of ſettling their diſputes; and beat (as Iſaiah propheſies) <hi>their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AMONG the particulars included in that duty to our country, by diſcharging which we ſhould ſhew our love to it, I will only further mention praying for it, and offering up thankſgivings to God for every event favourable to it. At the preſent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we are called upon to expreſs, in this way, our love to our country. It is the buſineſs of this day
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022814_0026_0FBA679CE607E6A0"/>
and of the preſent ſervice; and, therefore, it is neceſſary that I ſhould now direct your attention to it particularly.</p>
            <p>WE are met to thank God for that event in this country to which the name of THE REVOLUTION has been given; and which, for more than a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, it has been uſual for the friends of freedom, and more eſpecially Proteſtant Diſſenters, under the title of the REVOLUTION SOCIETY, to celebrate with expreſſions of joy and exultation.—My high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued and excellent friend, who addreſſed you on this occaſion laſt year, has given you an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting account of the principal circumſtances that attended this event, and of the reaſons we have for rejoicing in it. By a bloodleſs victory, the fetters which deſpotiſm had been long preparing for us were broken; the rights of the people were aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a tyrant expelled, and a Sovereign of our own choice appointed in his room. Security was given to our property, and our conſciences were eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated. The bounds of free enquiry were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; the volume in which are the words of eternal life, was laid more open to our examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that <hi>aera</hi> of light and liberty was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among us, by which we have been made an example to other kingdoms, and became the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors of the world. Had it not been for this deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the probability is, that, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022814_0027_0FBA67A100C39A38"/>
thus diſtinguiſhed, we ſhould now have been a baſe people, groaning under the infamy and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of popery and ſlavery. Let us therefore, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thankſgivings to God, the author of all our bleſſings. <hi>Had he not been on out ſide, we ſhould have been ſwallowed up quick, and the proud waters would have gone over our ſouls. But our ſouls are eſcaped, and the ſnare has been broken. Bleſſed then be the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</hi> cxxivth Pſalm.</p>
            <p>IT is well known that King James was not far from gaining his purpoſe; and that probably he would have ſucceeded, had he been leſs in a hurry. But he was a fool as well as a bigot. He wanted courage as well as prudence; and, therefore, fled, and left us to ſettle quietly for ourſelves that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government which is now our boaſt. We have particular reaſon, as Proteſtant Diſſenters, to rejoice on this occaſion. It was at this time we were reſcued from perſecution, and obtained the liberty of worſhipping God in the manner we think moſt acceptable to him. It was then our meeting houſes were opened, our worſhip was taken under the protection of the law, and the principles of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration gained a triumph. We have, therefore, on this occaſion, peculiar reaſons for thankſgiving—But let us remember that we ought not to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy ourſelves with thankſgivings. Our gratitude,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022814_0028_0FBA67A2E8C3BEC8"/>
if genuine, will be accompanied with endeavours to give ſtability to the deliverance our country has obtained, and to extend and improve the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which the Revolution has bleſt us—Let us, in particular, take care not to forget the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Revolution. This Society has, very properly, in its Reports, held out theſe principles, as an inſtruction to the public. I will only take notice of the three following:</p>
            <p>FIRST; The right to liberty of conſcience in religious matters.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY; The right to reſiſt power when abuſed. And,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY; The right to chuſe our own gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; to caſhier them for miſconduct; and to frame a government for ourſelves.</p>
            <p>ON theſe three principles, and mere eſpecially the laſt, was the Revolution founded. Were it not true that liberty of conſcience is a ſacred right; that power abuſed juſtifies reſiſtance; and that civil authority is a delegation from the people—Were not, I ſay, all this true, the Revolution would have been not an ASSERTION, but an INVASION of rights; not a REVOLUTION, but a REBELLION. Cheriſh in your breaſts this conviction, and act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its influence; deteſting the odious doctrines of paſſive obedience, non-reſiſtance, and the divine right of kings—doctrines which, had they been
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022814_0029_0FBA67A4684B1FE0"/>
acted upon in this country, would have left us at this time wretched ſlaves—doctrines which imply, that God made mankind to be oppreſſed and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and which are no leſs a blaſphemy againſt him, than an inſult on common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>I WOULD farther direct you to remember, that though the Revolution was a great work, it was by no means a perfect work; and that all was not then gained which was neceſſary to put the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the ſecure and complete poſſeſſion of the bleſſings of liberty.—In particular, you ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that the toleration then obtained was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. It included only thoſe who could declare their faith in the doctrinal articles of the church of England. It has, indeed, been ſince extended, but not ſufficiently; for there ſtill exiſt penal laws on account of religious opinions, which (were they carried into execution) would ſhut up many of our places of worſhip, and ſilence and impriſon ſome of our ableſt and beſt men.—The TEST LAWS are alſo ſtill in force; and deprive of eligibility to ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and military offices, all who cannot conform to the eſtabliſhed worſhip. It is with great pleaſure I find that the body of Proteſtant Diſſenters, though defeated in two late attempts to deliver their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from this diſgrace to it, have determined to perſevere. Should they at laſt ſucceed, they will have the ſatisfaction, not only of removing from

                        </gap>, in their late ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications for a repeal of the Teſt Laws, they have been oppoſed by Mr.</hi> Pitt. <hi>He has contended that, on account of their not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and worſhipping as the Church of England does, they ought to be excluded from that eligibility to public offices which is the right of other citizens, and conſequently denied a</hi> complete <hi>toleration; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, however, their integrity and reſpectability, but reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning it only the more neceſſary on that account to defend the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal church againſt them. Such ſentiments in theſe times can do no honour to any man, much leſs to a ſon of the late Lord</hi> Chatham, <hi>whoſe opinion of toleration and Proteſtant Diſſenters may be learnt from the following account.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In</hi> 1769 <hi>and</hi> 1772, <hi>the miniſters among the Diſſenters applied to Parliament for relief from the obligation they were then under to ſubſcribe the doctrinal articles of the Church of England in order to be entitled to a toleration, and both times ſucceeded in the Houſe of Commons, in conſequence of Lord</hi> North'<hi>s neutrality, but were defeated in the Houſe of Lords, in conſequence of an oppoſition from the Epiſcopal Bench. They perſevered, however; the Biſhops repented; and a third application proved ſucceſsful in both houſes. In the debate occaſioned in the Houſe of Lords by the</hi> ſecond <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, Dr Drummond, the Archbiſhop of York, having called the Diſſenting Miniſters men of cloſe ambition, Lord</hi> Chatham <hi>ſaid, that this was judging uncharitably; and that whoever brought ſuch a charge againſt them, without proof, defamed. Here he pauſed; and then went on</hi>—<q>
                        <hi>The Diſſenting Miniſters are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as men of cloſe ambition. They are ſo, my Lords; and their ambition is to keep</hi> cloſe <hi>to the college of fiſhermen, not of cardinals, and to the doctrine of inſpired apoſtles, not to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of intereſted and aſpiring biſhops. They contend for a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual creed, and ſcriptural worſhip. We have a Calviniſtic creed, a Popiſh liturgy, and an Arminian clergy. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation has laid open the ſcriptures to all. Let not the Biſhops ſhut them again. Laws in ſupport of eccleſiaſtical power are pleaded for, which it would ſhock humanity to execute. It is ſaid, that religious ſects have done great miſchief, when they were not kept under reſtraint: but hiſtory affords no proof that ſects have ever been miſchievous, when they were not oppreſſed and perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ruling church.</hi>

                     <hi>See the Parliamentary Debates,</hi> 1772.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In one of his letters to me, not long after this debate, dated Burton-Pynſent, January</hi> 16, 1773, <hi>he expreſſes himſelf in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words:</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>In writing to you, it is impoſſible the mind ſhould not go of itſelf to that moſt intereſting of all objects to fallible men</hi>—Toleration. <hi>Be aſſured, that on this ſacred and unalienable right of mankind, and bulwark of truth, my warm wiſhes will always keep pace with your own. Happy, if the times had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us to add hopes to our wiſhes.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022814_0031_0FBA67A866232B18"/>
I conſider that in Scotland the eſtabliſhed church is defended by no ſuch teſt—that in Ireland it has been aboliſhed—that in a great neighbouring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try it has been declared to be an indefeaſible right of all citizens to be equally eligible to public offices—that in the ſame kingdom a profeſſed Diſſenter from the eſtabliſhed church holds the firſt office in the ſtate—that in the Emperor's dominions <hi>Jews</hi> have been lately admitted to the enjoyment of equal privileges with other citizens—and that in this very country, a Diſſenter, though excluded from the power of <hi>executing</hi> the laws, yet is allowed to be employed in <hi>making</hi> them.—When, I ſay, I conſider ſuch facts as theſe, I am diſpoſed to think it impoſſible that the enemies of the repeal of the Teſt Laws ſhould not ſoon become aſhamed, and give up their oppoſition.</p>
            <p>BUT the moſt important inſtance of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022814_0032_0FBA67ACB34E1438"/>
ſect ſtate in which the Revolution left our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is the <hi>inequality of our repreſentation.</hi> I think, indeed, this defect in our conſtitution ſo groſs and ſo palpable, as to make it excellent chiefly in form and theory. You ſhould remember that a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation in the legiſlature of a kingdom is the <hi>baſis</hi> of conſtitutional liberty in it, and of all legitimate government; and that without it a government is nothing but an uſurpation. When the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is fair and equal, and at the ſame time veſted with ſuch powers as our Houſe of Commons poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, a kingdom may be ſaid to govern itſelf, and conſequently to poſſeſs true liberty. When the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is partial, a kingdom poſſeſſes liberty only partially; and if extremely partial, it only gives a <hi>ſemblance</hi> of liberty; but if not only extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely partial, but corruptly choſen, and under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt influence after being choſen, it becomes a <hi>nuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and produces the worſt of all forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—a government by corruption, a government carried on and ſupported by ſpreading venality and profligacy through a kingdom. May heaven preſerve this kingdom from a calamity ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! It is the point of depravity to which abuſes under ſuch a government as ours naturally tend, and the laſt ſtage of national unhappineſs. We are, at preſent, I hope, at a great diſtance from it. But it cannot be pretended that there are no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards it, or that there is no reaſon for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and alarm.</p>
            <p>The inadequateneſs of our repreſentation has
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022814_0033_0FBA67AE2BB70270"/>
been long a ſubject of complaint. This is, in truth, our fundamental grievance; and I do not think that anything is much more our duty, as men who love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heir country, and are grateful for the Revolution, than to unite our zeal in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get it redreſſed. At the time of the American war, aſſociations were formed for this purpoſe in LONDON, and other parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and our preſent Miniſter himſelf has, ſince that war, directed to it an effort which made him a favourite with many of us. But all attention to it ſeems now loſt, and the probability is, that this inattention will continue, and that nothing will be done towards gaining for us this eſſential bleſſing, till ſome great calamity again alarms our fears, or till ſome great abuſe of power again provokes our reſentment; or, perhaps, till the acquiſition of a pure and equal repreſentation by other countries (while we are mocked with the ſhadow) kindles our ſhame.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the conduct by which we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our gratitude for the Revolution.—We ſhould always bear in mind the principles that juſtify it. We ſhould contribute all we can towards ſupplying what it left deficient; and ſhew ourſelves anxious about tranſmitting the bleſſings obtained by it to our poſterity, unimpaired and improved.—But, brethren, while we thus ſhew our patriotic zeal, let us take care not to diſgrace the cauſe of patriotiſm, by any licentious, or immoral conduct.—Oh! how earneſtly do I wiſh that all who profeſs zeal in this
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022814_0034_0FBA67AFAF1348E8"/>
cauſe, were as diſtinguiſhed by the purity of their morals, as ſome of them are by their abilities; and that I could make them ſenſible of the advantages they would derive from a virtuous character, and of the ſuſpicions they incur and the loſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they ſuffer by wanting it.—Oh! that I could ſee in men who oppoſe tyranny in the ſtate, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of the tyranny of low paſſions in themſelves; or, at leaſt, ſuch a ſenſe of ſhame, and regard to public order and decency as would induce them to <hi>hide</hi> their irregularities, and to avoid inſulting the virtuous part of the community by an open exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of vice!—I cannot reconcile myſelf to the idea of an immoral patriot, or to that ſeparation of private from public virtue, which ſome think to be poſſible. Is it to be expected that—But I muſt forbear. I am afraid of applications, which many are too ready to make, and for which I ſhould be ſorry to give any juſt occaſion.</p>
            <p>I HAVE been explaining to you the nature and expreſſions of a juſt regard to our Country. Give me leave to exhort you to examine your conduct by what I have been ſaying. You love your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and deſire its happineſs; and, without doubt, you have the greateſt reaſon for loving it. It has been long a very diſtinguiſhed and favoured coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Often has God appeared for it, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Let us ſtudy to ſhew ourſelves worthy of the favour ſhewn us.—Do you practice virtue your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſtudy to promote it in others? Do you obey the laws of your country, and aim at doing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:022814_0035_0FBA67B17A50B9E8"/>
your part towards maintaining and perpetuating its privileges? Do you always give your vote on the ſide of public liberty; and are you ready to pour out your blood in its defence? Do you look up to God for the continuance of his favour to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and pray for its proſperity; preſerving, at the ſame time, a ſtrict regard to the rights of other countries, and always conſidering yourſelves more as citizens of the world than as members of any particular community? If this is your temper and conduct you are bleſſings to your country, and were all like you, this world would ſoon be a heaven.</p>
            <p>I AM addreſſing myſelf to Chriſtians. Let me, therefore, mention to you the example of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour. I have obſerved, at the beginning of this diſcourſe, that he did not inculcate upon his hearers the love of their country, or take any notice of it as a part of our duty. Inſtead of doing this, I obſerved that he taught the obligation to love all mankind, and recommended univerſal benevolence, as (next to the love of God) our firſt duty; and, I think, I alſo proved to you, that this, in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the world at that time, was an inſtance of incomparable wiſdom and goodneſs in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. But we muſt not infer from hence, that he did not include the love of our country in the number of our duties. He has ſhewn the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by his example. It appears that he poſſeſſed a particular affection for his country, though a very wicked country. We read in Luke x. 42, that when, upon approaching <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in one of his
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022814_0036_0FBA67B66F42D8B0"/>
laſt journies to it, he beheld it, he wept over it, and ſaid, <hi>Oh! that thou hadſt known (even thou, at leaſt in this thy day) the things that belong to thy peace.</hi>—What a tender ſolicitude about his country does the lamentation over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> imply, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſame goſpel, chap. xiii. and 34. <hi>Oh! Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them who are ſent to thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her brood under her wings, but ye would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT may not be improper farther to mention the love St. Paul expreſſed for his country, when he declared, that, for the ſake of his brethren and kinſmen, he could even wiſh himſelf <hi>accurſed from Chriſt.</hi> (Rom. ix. 3.) The original words are an ANATHEMA <hi>from Chriſt;</hi> and his meaning is, that he could have been contented to ſuffer <hi>himſelf</hi> the calamities which were coming on the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, were it poſſible for him, by ſuch a ſacrifice of himſelf, to ſave them.</p>
            <p>It is too evident that the ſtate of this country is ſuch as renders it an object of concern and anxiety. It wants (I have ſhewn you) the grand ſecurity of public liberty. Increaſing luxury has multiplied abuſes in it. A monſtrous weight of debt is crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling it. Vice and venality are bringing down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it God's diſpleaſure. That ſpirit to which it owes its diſtinctions, is declining; and ſome late events ſeem to prove that it is becoming every day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of its liberties.—It wants, therefore, your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022814_0037_0FBA67B9D8661FD0"/>
ſervices; and, for the ſake of the diſtinctions it has ſo longed enjoyed; for the ſake of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and companions, and all that ſhould be dear to a free people, we ought to do our utmoſt to ſave it from the dangers that threaten it; remembering, that by acting thus, we ſhall promote, in the beſt manner, our own private intereſt, as well as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our country; for when the community proſpers, the individuals that compoſe it muſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with it.—But, ſhould that not happen, or ſhould we even ſuffer in our ſecular intereſt by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to promote the intereſt of our country, we ſhall feel a ſatisfaction in our own breaſts which is preferable to all this world can give; and we ſhall enjoy the tranſporting hope of ſoon becoming mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a perfect community in the heavens, and having <hi>an entrance miniſtered to us, abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may reaſonably expect, that I ſhould now cloſe this addreſs to you. But I cannot yet diſmiſs you. I muſt not conclude without recalling, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to your recollection, a conſideration to which I have more than once alluded, and which, probably, your thoughts have been all along anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating: A conſideration with which my mind is impreſſed more than I can expreſs. I mean, the conſideration of the favourableneſs of the preſent times to all exertions in the cauſe of public liberty.</p>
            <p>WHAT an eventful period is this! I am thankful that I have lived to it; and I could almoſt ſay,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022814_0038_0FBA67BC6CA2C9D0"/>
               <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi> I have lived to ſee a diffuſion of knowledge, which has undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuperſtition and error—I have lived to ſee the rights of men better underſtood than ever; and nations panting for liberty, which ſeemed to have loſt the idea of it.—I have lived to ſee THIRTY MILLIONS of people, indignant and reſolute, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at ſlavery, and demanding liberty with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible voice; their king led in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch ſurrendering himſelf to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.—After ſharing in the benefits of one Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, I have been ſpared to be a witneſs to two other Revolutions, both glorious.—And now, methinks, I ſee the ardour for liberty catching and ſpreading; a general amendment beginning in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs; the dominion of kings changed for the dominion of laws, and the dominion of prieſts giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to the dominion of reaſon and conſcience.</p>
            <p>BE encouraged, all ye friends of freedom, and writers in its defence! The times are auſpicious. Your labours have not been in vain. Behold king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, admoniſhed by you, ſtarting from ſleep, breaking their fetters, and claiming juſtice from their oppreſſors! Behold, the light you have ſtruck out, after ſetting <hi>America</hi> free, reflected to <hi>France,</hi> and there kindled into a blaze that lays deſpotiſm in aſhes, and warms and illuminates <hi>Europe!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TREMBLE all ye oppreſſors of the world! Take warning all ye ſupporters of ſlaviſh governments, and ſlaviſh hierarchies! Call no more (abſurdly and wickedly) REFORMATION, innovation. You cannot now hold the world in darkneſs. Struggle no longer againſt increaſing light and liberality. Reſtore to mankind their rights; and conſent to the correction of abuſes, before they and you are deſtroyed together.</p>
