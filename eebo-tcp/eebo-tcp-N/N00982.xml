            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for the winning of Souls?</hi> Entreat of God, the Father of Lights, That He would by His good Spirit, suggest into your minds, <hi>What you may do for Him, &amp; for Souls?</hi> And then, Think, and Think again! <hi>Thinking for Souls</hi> is a great step to the <hi>winning of Souls.</hi> It may be, thy <hi>Soul,</hi> O Servant of God, will not be so Barren of <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi> but that thou wilt <hi>Think</hi> of something to be done Oh!

               <p>But, <hi>What may be done?</hi> I will mention a <hi>Second</hi> Thing: which being joyned unto the <hi>First,</hi> will render it the more Significant and Effectual. Tis This: That we may <hi>win Souls,</hi> we must set a right Estimate upon the <hi>worth of Souls.</hi> A SOUL, a SOUL; Oh, Let the Sound of it, with us, be so big, as to drown the Sound of a whole <hi>World.</hi> A SOUL, Tis a mighty Thing!

The <hi>Soul,</hi> Tis an <hi>Angel in Flesh;</hi> or, at least, by Sanctity it may be made one. How stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous are the <hi>Capacities</hi> of the <hi>Soul!</hi> Tis capable of Conversing with the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Enjoying of Him. A SOUL; The <hi>Blood</hi> of the Son of God Himself, He did not look upon it as thrown away, when it was paid and shed as a <hi>Ransome</hi> for <hi>Souls!</hi> The Soul, if it be Converted unto God, it will come to be with Christ, in <hi>Fulness of Joyes &amp; Pleasures for evermore.</hi> But if that Soul go Christless, and Graceless out of the world, it sinks down into such Miseries, that thy Heart is all Stone, O man, if thou art not struck with horror at them; if thou Cry not out, <hi>O Lord, my Flesh Trembles, I am Afraid of thy Judgments!</hi> Christian, Canst thou make such Reflections, without longing to be, <hi>A winner of Souls?</hi> Methinks, were we under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of such Thoughts, our Compassion for Souls, would make us with some Anguish to groan after the <hi>winning of Souls.</hi> We should be loth any <hi>Soul</hi> in the world, should miscarry; and every <hi>Soul</hi> within our own

               <p>But still; <hi>What may be done?</hi> Thirdly, and I might have said, <hi>Firstly;</hi> There is this to be done. <hi>Praying for Souls</hi> is a main stroke is the <hi>winning of Souls.</hi> If once the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> be poured out upon a <hi>Soul,</hi> that <hi>Soul</hi> is <hi>wun</hi> immediately; and never any <hi>Soul</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
