            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Other Side of the Queſtion: OR, A DEFENCE OF THE LIBERTIES of NORTH-AMERICA, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A Certain Friendly Addreſs to all reaſonable Americans, was juſt now put into my hands. Some people perhaps have read it, for I am told it was publiſhed ſix days ago; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after peruſing, it ſeems proper to make a ſhort anſwer to this performance: not becauſe it is well written, or becauſe there is the leaſt danger any man will become a proſelyte to the doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; but for the following reaſons, which candor obliges me to mention.</p>
            <p>FIRST. I anſwer this pamphlet, for the very purpoſe which alone the pamphlet itſelf is likely to effect,—to encourage the paper manufactory.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. I anſwer it for the ſake of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who muſt be ſadly out of pocket, by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch woeful performances: And therefore he is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013381_0003_0F905742C57523F8"/>
hereby requeſted to print this in a large type, and the like, ſo as to make the moſt on't.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY. I write, becauſe from the futility of the author's reaſoning, no body elſe may think it worth the trouble. And if ſo, why then he would very naturally conclude that he had written an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unanſwerable treatiſe, which concluſion might inflate the poor creature's vanity, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to tempt him into other imprudencies of the ſame kind. The public thanks therefore will be my due, for removing, or at leaſt preventing a common nuſance.</p>
            <p>LASTLY. I am prompted to this undertaking out of regard to the fair-ſex. For many weak women may be exceedingly frighted by that awful compound of threats, and texts, and homilies.</p>
            <p>Now then, gentle reader, having told thee the origin. I ſhall next acquaint thee with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this new acquaintance, which my Maſter James hath introduced to thy hand.—I will not, as is too common with controverſial people, whether politic, or polemic: I will not, I ſay, uſe any acrimonious expreſſions, againſt this unhappy author; for whoſe weakneſſes and wanderings, I have the utmoſt pity and compaſſion. On the contrary, I ſhall treat him with the greateſt gentleneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, owing in ſome meaſure to my very great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for the Clergy, one of which he is, as I have been informed. And truly the frequent quotations from ſcripture, together with the illiberal language contained in his pamphlet, will naturally lead folks to believe ſo. For it unfortunately happens, that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013381_0004_0F905742E1D9C198"/>
the generality of theſe Gentlemen, from an ungain habit they acquire by abuſing the poor Devil, are too apt to vilify and aſperſe their neighbours. Some exceptions there are, it muſt be acknowledged, which may be attributed to this; that a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals have kept better company, and ſeen more of the polite world, than the reſt of their order. But alack and alas! I fear me our author is not one of theſe rare birds, for the houſehold proverbs and tales with which his piece is interlarded, (if I may venture on ſomething like his own language) make the odds at leaſt a pound to a penny againſt him.</p>
            <p>And now reader, if by chance thou art a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, or Congregationaliſt, or other Diſſenter from the Epiſcopalian Church, to which I myſelf belong; permit me to a pologize for the rude and opprobrious terms made uſe of againſt you by our author. Theſe things ought in common charity to be forgiven, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they ſeem to have proceeded from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and the want of better language.—And do not, I beſeech you, conclude too haſtily againſt his brethren, I have ſeveral friends and acquaintance among them, who are really Gentlemen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is my earneſt deſire, that if in the hurry of compoſition (for I have but three days to write this in the midſt of other affairs) if I ſay any thing ſhould fall from my pen, which can be conſtrued a reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Clergy, it is my deſire that it ſhould be inſtantly erazed.—I honour them much for their piety, learning, and ſtrictly loyal attachment to our Sovereign.</p>
            <p>An old Mathematician (I think they call him Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes) had ſuch confidence in his art and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013381_0005_0F9057439A72CC38"/>
as to declare he would move the earth itſelf if he could get a place to ſtand on. But pleaſe your worſhips, while he was upon the thing which was to be moved, had he worked his heart out, 'twould not have budged an inch.—In imitation of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable ſcrew-driver, may we not lay down the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing logical maxim. A man may prove impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities if you will concede his poſtulata.—Thus, in order to demonſtrate that black is white, or in other words, that black and white are the ſame thing, I aſk only this admiſſion; that there is no difference between them.</p>
            <p>He who in converſation with half a dozen friends, ſhould in a ſimilar manner begin any argument whatever, by affirming the thing to be proved, would he not raiſe a laugh at his expence? Now, all Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica contends for rights, which we aver to have been invaded, violated, deſtroyed, and a certain writer attempts to prove this conteſt, treaſonable and rebellious; what ſhall we think of a writer, who begins an addreſs on this ſubject, not to half a dozen, or half a hundred but to all <hi>reaſonable</hi> Americans, with the following propoſition? <q>Of all the ſubjects of Great-Britain, thoſe who reſide in the American colonies, are and might ſtill be enjoying the benefits of an equitable and free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</q> As to his quotation from an "excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent writer," it may ſhew the Gentleman's reading, but can never help his a gument; and therefore I ſhall paſs it over ſilence, to the examination of thoſe excellencies, which he himſelf hath fabricated.</p>
            <p>If by the term, ſubjects of Great-Britain, he means ſubjects to the King of Great-Britain, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013381_0006_0F9057445A6DA7D0"/>
ſubordinate to the Parliament of that Kingdom, it is an inaccuracy, which, conſidering what follows, may be eaſily forgiven. But if theſe words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inſinuate, that the people of America are ſubject to laws made by the Parliament of Great-Britain, in all caſes whatever, then we ſhall find, that the firſt ground this great Archimedes intends to fix his reaſoning machine on, is what follows. Americans are ſubject to the will of a Parliament which they have no vote in chooſing, and being ſo ſubject, enjoy a free and equitable conſtitution. To which I have only two ſmall exceptions: firſt, theſe are the very points to be proved, and ſecondly, they involve a flat contradiction. Now then, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing theſe things admitted, after all, twiſt them and turn them as you pleaſe, ſtill muſt you come back in a circle to the place from whence you ſet out; ſtill luckleſs Philoſopher you grovel on the earth.</p>
            <p>Shortly after follows another falſe propoſition. America contributes but a ſmall proportion to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the public expences. This for argument ſake, I will grant. I will grant what I ſuppoſe he meant; namely, that America contributes but little to <hi>defray</hi> the public expences which other folks ſupport. I am not captious in my temper, nor do I mean to cavil about words, for then I ſhould never have done.</p>
            <p>Then comes a page about Moſes, thunder, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, darkneſs and deſtruction. As theſe things are quite out of my way, I ſhall not meddle with them; but proceed to the next, the ſcope of which ſeems to be this, Whether parliament hath been right
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013381_0007_0F905745AEF9CD78"/>
or wrong, we are bound by the laws of Heaven to obey its mandates. And in quality of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we muſt be ſubject to the Miniſters, be they who they will, for conſcience ſake. Let who will be King, our author is Vicar of Bray. To eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date all which doctrines he obſerves that if the greateſt tyrant on earth Nero for inſtance) ſhould uſurp and eſtabliſh a domination over us, the harſheſt and moſt cruel, yet ſo heinous is the offence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing an eſtabliſhed government, that a due regard for the rights and liberties of mankind, would prompt us to a peaceable ſubmiſſion. To this ſubmiſſion we are enjoined, it ſeems, by the Chriſtian religion; and to diſturb or threaten ſuch a government, is an unpardonable crime, and has been conſidered as ſuch, in every age and nation of the world. All which is mighty reaſonable. Wherefore it follows clearly, that thoſe perſons who within theſe four or five centuries, contended for, and by degrees eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed our glorious conſtitution. <q>A frame of government, ſays our author, which has always been the wonder of the world, under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of which, the ſubjects of Great-Britain are the happieſt people on earth</q> I ſay, thoſe perſons who have rendered theſe Britiſh ſubjects ſo happy, and tranſmitted to them all the rights and privileges they enjoy, thoſe perſons, according to the above doctrine, muſt be damned to all eternity for their pains.—This may be religion, I am ſure it is not common ſenſe. But be that matter as it will, I ſhall not heſitate to declare, in imitation of honeſt Sir Toby; I had rather truſt God Almighty with my ſoul, than the Britiſh Parliament with my eſtate. Moreover, for the HONOUR of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I do entreat all other Sectaries to believe, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013381_0008_0F90574629F378B0"/>
very few of its members hold the ſame creed with this writer.</p>
            <p>However, having introduced Nero, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and the Grand Turk, in company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; he deſcends from his pulpit, leaves theſe dignified perſonages to ſhift for themſelves, and opens the deſign of his pamphlet: which he tells us, is not religion, <q>but to conſider how far the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the colonies is to be condemned or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the maxims of ſound policy and prudence.</q> For it ſeems pretty well ſettled even in his idea, that notwithſtanding that ſame Chriſtian ſyſtem he talks of <q>our temporal intereſt and ſafety, are conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which all will regard;</q> in which opinion I do moſt heartily concur with him.</p>
            <p>After this follows a little more declamation, which you may ſee if you have the pamphlet, if not, ſend for it to the Bookſellers, and you will find a ſort of ſyllogiſm to ſhew; that reſentment is unjuſtifiable, and complaint unreaſonable, if our legal rights have not been invaded.—Legal rights,—and why that term, legal rights? Do you mean, my Reverend Sir, that any right (that of taxing ourſelves for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if it be not confirmed by ſome ſtatute law, is not a legal right; and therefore an invaſion of ſuch right, will neither juſtify reſentment, nor authoriſe complaint? I am afraid you do,—and yet I hope not; for this alſo is one point to be proved in ſupport of your hypotheſis In the name of America I deny it. But if you mean to ſpeak fairly, and if by <hi>legal rights</hi> you mean what you ought to make your own argument concluſive, namely, thoſe rights which we are entitled to by the eternal laws of right reaſon;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013381_0009_0F905748E826AFC0"/>
then the remainder of your taſk will be to ſhew, that our rights have not been invaded, and if that can be done, then to be ſure our complaints are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>Now then let us ſee what the Friendly Addreſs ſays upon this ſubject. Why the firſt obſervation is, that the duty on tea is no tax; for unleſs we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it we don't pay the duty, therefore it is quite in our option, whether we will pay it or no. What can be more equitable?—I remember, about twelve years ago, there was a madman in the Philadelphia hoſpital, who imagined himſelf monarch of the country thereabouts; and among other wild projects, ſuch as might be expected from a creature in that ſituation, he had one to tax the air. But may it pleaſe your Majeſty, will ſuch a tax be right? Air was always common and free, in the time of your Majeſty's royal progenitors and predeceſſors. Will not your ſubjects think this an arbitrary law, like the poll tax? Arbitrary! cried the prince, enraged; and like the poll tax too! What rebels! Why, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they breathe, they don't pay the duty, therefore it is quite in their option whether they will pay it or no. What can be more equitable. I pitied the poor man becauſe he was mad.</p>
            <p>But you ſay tea is a luxury. In ſome reſpects it may be ſo. And how, and where, ſhall we draw a line, between the luxuries and the conveniences of life? Or by what right can the one be taken away, which will not affect the other? Thoſe who may rightfully deprive us of luxuries, by the ſame rule may as rightfully deprive us of conveniences too. And if in the plenitude of that power, which our
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013381_0010_0F9057490C8E2068"/>
author ſo apoſtolically hath conferred, they ſhould deign to leave unto us the neceſſaries of life, pray by what ſtandard ſhall we determine theſe neceſſaries?</p>
            <l>—Our baſeſt beggars,</l>
            <l>Are in the pooreſt things ſuperfluous.</l>
            <l>Allow not nature more than nature needs,</l>
            <l>Man's life is cheap as beaſt's.</l>
            <p>But to return.—Our author next ſuppoſes, that he is arguing with ſome honeſt American, who ſhould deny the right of Parliament to lay this duty on tea. To obviate this he quotes precedent. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can is then ſuppoſed to obſerve, that the precedent itſelf was wrong, wherefore no right could originate from it; but that together with other ſimilar wrongs, it ought to be done away. So is the argument ſtated by himſelf. And he then, upon a ſuppoſition that this tea duty is quite diſtinct from a tax at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſhew, that Parliament had a right to levy it, merely as a regulation of trade. Pray read the eighth and and ninth pages—Have you read them?—Why now your honour, I will undertake to confute every thing contained there. I will undertake to ſhew, that the author's reaſoning does not apply to his purpoſe or ſubject, any more than the words Denmark and Ruſſia, which as you ſee are printed in large Italicks.—But what will it ſignify to take up ſo much of your attention; when it is very like you had better be thinking on ſome other affair. His conſequence may be well ſupported on rational ground; though, to his misfortune, he could not diſcover it. The right of Great-Britain to <hi>regulate</hi> the trade of the colonies, ſhall be admitted.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013381_0011_0F90574997E31CC0"/>
But that the duty on tea is a <hi>regulation</hi> of trade and not a tax; this is the very matter in controverſy.</p>
            <p>We are now arrived at the confutation of one of Mr. Locke's arguments; which, ſays our author, "appears to me weak and ſophiſt cal."—The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as quoted by himſelf, ſtands thus: "If parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament has a right to take from us one penny with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our conſent, it has a right to ſtrip us of our whole property." To confute which he obſerves, "A right to do what is reaſonable, implies not a right to do what is unreaſonable." And after a ſhort ſimilitude about father and ſon, he ſays, <q>Caſes may happen, in which it would be reaſonable for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to take from us ſome ſmall matter, though we were unwilling to part with it; but the caſe can hardly be ſuppoſed, in which it would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to take from us every thing, unleſs we ſhould have forfeited it.</q> And ſo concludes, "There can be no right to do wrong."—And this is the confutation.—I was ſome time puzzled to make any thing of it; but by comparing one part with another, we may at leaſt gueſs that he means what follows: By the words, reaſonable to take from us, &amp;c. I preſume he intends, a right to take from us. For, reaſonable, in the proper ſenſe of the word, will not anſwer his purpoſe at all; becauſe if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the propoſition, it will be as <hi>reaſonable</hi> for the Legiſlature of this province to take from the people of England, a ſmall matter without <hi>their</hi> conſent. But that any ſuch right could exiſt, the author of the Addreſs would hardly allow. Throughout this admirable confutation therefore, let us ſubſtitute right for reaſonable, and wrong for unreaſonable, and then it will ſtand thus: <hi>A right to do what is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013381_0012_0F90574D16521898"/>
right, implies not a right to do what is wrong. To take from us one penny without our conſent is right, but to ſtrip us of our whole property is wrong. Therefore, Parliament may have a right to take from us one penny, without our conſent, which is right; but this right does not neceſſarily imply, that Parliament has a right to ſtrip us of our whole property, which is wrong. Therefore Mr. Locke's argument is confuted.</hi> And in the ſame way I will undertake to confute Euclid's Elements, from one end to the other.—Examine this argument, this fine argument. It reſts upon the aſſertion, that in ſome caſes Parliament may have a right to take a ſmall matter from us without our conſent, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion is the very thing denied. And ſo the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's wits and faculties, after prancing and curvet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through a whole ſection, bring him not one inch nearer the end of his journey, than he was when he firſt ſet out.</p>
            <p>So here again he labours at a diſtinction between the duty on tea, and a tax. But as to any difference between them, that you know is quite another affair. No matter for the difference, provided there be a diſtinction. May it pleaſe your Reverence, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are at a loſs for matter to vamp up into the ſhape of another Addreſs; I have a dozen or two ſuch diſtinctions, which are very heartily at your Reverence's ſervice, very heartily I do aſſure you.</p>
            <p>Ah! what have we here? Another diſſertation on the Britiſh right of regulating American trade? Yes. Here it is, hip and thigh, import and export, back ſtroke and fore ſtroke; bleſſings on us, I ſay. What a pity it is, that our author would not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſimple aſſertion here, as he has done in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013381_0013_0F90574E9CC3BD30"/>
thoſe inſtances, which really required proof. Moſt unfortunately, in endeavouring to eſtabliſh what we would readily grant; he lays his foundation on argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which would overthrow every principle of American liberty. I declare, reader, it is not my intention to cheat you, by re-printing quotations from the Addreſs. But unleſs you have bought it, I do not know how otherwiſe to manage matters.</p>
            <p>The ſame want of penetration, which led our author to imagine Mr. Locke's argument weak and ſophiſtical, now bewilders him with a Jack O'Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, in the ſhape of the word Engliſhmen. His drift is to ſhew, we may be bound by laws we do not conſent to, and yet poſſeſs all the rights of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men. For, ſays he, Engliſhmen can have no right to be exempted from the authority of an Engliſh Parliament. After this he blunders a little about majority and minority, hints at virtual repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and ſays ſomething of Engliſh American ground. To anſwer which at once, thoſe who do not immediately perceive the fallacy, are deſired to conſider, that the perſons who make laws for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, are to be bound by them when they have done. And that no exiſtence whatever, except Almighty God, can have a natural right to make laws binding on others, which the law-maker is exempt from. True it is ſuch power may be uſurped, or through politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal neceſſity conceded. Uſurped as the Britiſh power of taxing America, conceded as the power of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating trade, which after ſuch conceſſion, becomes a right. Greater rights they cannot have; unleſs ſome mode can be invented, to incorporate us into the grand legiſlature of the empire, on conſtitutional principles. But let us examine his Engliſh argument.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013381_0014_0F90574ED98F80B8"/>
The word Engliſh above, is printed in Italicks, and ſeparated from the word, men. In reading the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, leave out <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the argument is gone. Now I do aver, and will maintain, that to conſent to laws binding upon us, is one of thoſe rights which we enjoy as men, and not merely as Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. In quality of rational and free agents, we enjoy it. A right granted by our Creator, when he formed us of the clod. That great charter by which he confirmed it, may be read in the human frame: A charter ſealed with the breath of life. To this right every man is and muſt be entitled; it is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an inſeperable appendage to our exiſtence, and altho' the Engliſh law hath ſecured it to the Engliſh ſubject, yet a Frenchman or Turk is as much enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to it, by the law of nature. That this title hath not been ratified by political inſtitutions, is <hi>his</hi> misfortune, and <hi>I</hi> am ſorry for it.</p>
            <p>So you ſee, reader, all this trouble might have been ſpared, if the poor creature had not moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily laid hold of that ſaid word. Engliſh: which indeed from the face of his performance, he does not appear to underſtand. The laſt part of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument we are now upon, ariſes from a fact I am not inclined to diſpute, though I do not believe it. He avers that we have been offered repreſentatives in the Common's Houſe, if we would ſend them over. Be this as it may, I agree with him that we have done wiſely in not accepting the offer if ever it was made. Or in other words, to have accepted it, would have been folly. Now then hear him. "After refuſing it, they have no reaſon to complain." That is to ſay, becauſe we have <hi>not</hi> committed folly, we have no right to complain of injuſtice, Yet this is an Addreſs to all <hi>reaſonable</hi> Americans.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013381_0015_0F90574FA7949568"/>
The next attempt of this maſterly Addreſs, is to impeach the validity of thoſe compacts, which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral colonies have made with the crown. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts can be conſidered in no other light, than as covenants by the King, in conſideration of ſettling the deſart; that he would protect the ſettlers and their dependants, in the enjoyment of their natural rights. If his Majeſty chuſes to withdraw this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection—be it ſo. The King can do no wrong. But I wiſh there had been a lineal warrantee from his miniſters. Some of them are of noble deſcent, and I have ſo high an opinion of the honour of Britiſh Peers, that I believe few of them would infringe ſuch ſolemn agreements. However, ſuppoſe the King ſhould withdraw this protection,—Are our rights therefore annihilated? No. Thoſe rights were conferred by the King of Kings, and no earthly Potentate can take them away.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince I ſaw a Letter from a Veteran, to the Officers of the Army at Boſton: I pray the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to receive my thanks, for the great pleaſure enjoyed in the reading of it. I think I could eaſily perceive in it, the traces of that manly, generous, brave, and free diſpoſition; which mark the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Soldier and the Gentleman.</p>
            <l>If, to his ſhare ſome little errors fall,</l>
            <l>View his kind heart, and you forgive them all.</l>
            <p>I am almoſt afraid to return immediately to the Addreſs, becauſe compariſons are odious. Make none, gentle reader, I beſeech thee; but obſerve out author here inſinuates, that he hath ſhewn, "that in reality no proper <hi>right</hi> of the colonies is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013381_0016_0F9057505F4A44E8"/>
by the late act of Parliament." Pray now, how hath he ſhewn it? Why by three aſſertions, neither of which is in the leaſt proved, as I took occaſion to obſerve before in treating of them reſpectively.—The firſt is, that the duty on tea is no tax. The ſecond, that if a tax, it is a ſmall one, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath a right to take from us a ſmall matter without our conſent. And the third, that a man may be rightfully bound by laws which he does not, and cannot aſſent to.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the main pillars of this formidable argument; not one of which hath the leaſt ſolidity: And therefore the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent author, fearful perhaps of their inſtability, before he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to charge us with ſedition, privy conſpiracy and rebellion, to anathematiſe us for falſe doctrine, hereſy, and ſchiſm; or to reproach us for hardneſs of heart, and contempt of his word and command; reverts to his original conſiderations, about pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and policy, on what he calls the ſuppoſition, and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans the fact, that we have been really injured.</p>
            <p>But theſe conſiderations, do not ſeem to be well conſidered; becauſe he takes it for granted in the firſt inſtance, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Boſton were criminal in deſtroying the tea. And the word Boſton, ſome how or other faſcinating his imagination, he is hurried away with a torrent of invectives. The deſtruction of the tea, ſays he, <q>was a compound of the groſſeſt injury and inſult, an act of the higheſt inſolence to government, ſuch as mildneſs itſelf cannot overlook or forgive.</q> The only fault of all this and ſome more of the ſame kind is, that it is rather miſplaced; for it would anſwer tolerably well in a ſermon againſt blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Let me intreat the reader's attention to a ſimple tale: Thoſe who are inclined to doubt it, will find unqueſtionable evidence in a pamphlet, called, A true State of the Proceedings in the Parliament of Great-Britain, and in the Province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the year 1761, 1762, 1763, the duteous conduct of the Maſſachuſetts, was exemplary and acknowledged.—In 1764, the ſtamp-act was threatened, and a duty impoſed for raiſing a revenue in America. The Houſe of Repreſentatives reſolved, that it is unconſtitutional, to take their money without their conſent. In 1765, the ſeveral Aſſemblies petitioned againſt the ſtamp-act; which they had no right to do, becauſe—<hi>it was a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013381_0017_0F90575119BC64E8"/>
Money Bill:</hi> conſequently the petitions were diſregarded, and the bill was paſſed. The Maſſachuſetts then propoſed a Congreſs of Delegates from the ſeveral Aſſemblies; and the Congreſs petitioned the King: but the Congreſs was an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional body; wherefore our gracious maſter (that year) was afflicted with a great deafneſs. In 1766, the Aſſembly petitioned againſt their Governor, one Francis Bernard, for aſſuming, with his Council, the powers of legiſlation. This accuſation was very juſt, and therefore to make it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinent. A Non-importation in America, opened the ears of the Parliament in England; and in 1766, the Stamp Act was repealed. In 1767, another revenue act paſſed; whereupon the Aſſembly of that province preſented a petition at the foot of the throne; and wrote to the other Aſſemblies to join in it, which was a piece of great preſumption. In 1768, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was ordered to reſcind the reſolve, by which thoſe letters had been written, on pain of diſſolution; which peremptory mandate produced a petition, and alſo a letter to the ſecretary of ſtate.—About the ſame time ſome ſeamen were preſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an act of parliament; the people of Boſton petitioned their governor on this affair; but his Excellency had no buſineſs to interfere in the Admiral's department. A veſſel alſo was ſeized in a manner which irritated the mob, and they were ſuch ſcoundrels as to reſent the inſult; conſequently they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of treaſon and rebellion, for drubbing the worthy collector. An army was ſent there immediately, but then there was an act of parliament againſt quartering them on the people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the governor iſſued his commiſſion, to diſpenſe with the act, for a royal martyr had done ſo before him. The people then petitioned the governor to call an aſſembly; this was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, for buſineſs could better be done without one. Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in this, they appointed a convention, the members whereof irritated by what they called their wrongs, preſented another humble petition to the King; wherefore in 1769, the troops, out of a juſt contempt for their puſilanimity, ſhot three brace by way of ſtarting the covey. But it was impoſſible his Majeſty's troops could have been the aggreſſors; therefore there muſt have been an inſurrection of the people. This was clearly the caſe alſo from judge Oliver's narration; yet near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred credible witneſſes, had the impudence to ſwear, that his narration was falſe. Conſequently to repair the breach in his character, it was neceſſary that he ſhould be appointed Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Governor, which happened accordingly. In 1769, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly preſented another petition, againſt their governor Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013381_0018_0F9057524E9C91F0"/>
He prorogued the Aſſembly, went to England immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, obtained an order for a hearing on the petition upon the 28th of February, and got the prorogation of the Aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the 14th of March. Notwithſtanding all this, the Aſſembly never ſupported their charge with any proof; becauſe the prorogations rendered it impoſſible; conſequently the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was groundleſs, vexatious and ſcandalous, as every body will eaſily ſee. In the year 1772, 1773, the Aſſembly took the liberty to petition again, which was at leaſt forward and ill-bred, wherefore no notice was taken of what they alledged. In De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 1773, the dutiable Tea arrived. I have during the courſe of this ſtory, omitted many things which were thought very grievous by the people of the Maſſachuſetts bay, for the ſake of brevity, and becauſe the recital of all their complaints might poſſibly inflame mens minds at this dangerous juncture; a thing I would wiſh to avoid, for I have great reſpect for the clergy.</p>
            <p>In December 1773, the dutiable Tea arrived at Boſton. It was evident that if this commodity was landed, there would be many purchaſers among the governors creatures. Prudence therefore required, that it ought to be ſent back. The gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor would not permit this, and the neceſſity was then clear, either that the Tea muſt be deſtroyed, or the act ſubmitted to. Wearied out with long oppreſſion, and driven to deſperation by repeated inſults, a few daring men went diſguiſed to the ſhip and deſtroyed the Tea.—Upon this tale I ſhall make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it needs none. But to relieve the reader's attention, I will mention an incident of a more lively complexion:—Two young gentlemen found a cat ſitting peaceably in one corner of the parlour: She was a gentle animal, and a good mouſer. Young men love fun, ſo they ſhut the door and windows, and ferreted her about, till ſhe and they were hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily tired: At length, in a violent leap from her perſecutors, the cat fell in the midſt of an elegant ſet of china: to loſe a China cup and ſawcer, by means of a vile cat, was too much to be patiently borne, and poor puſs was murdered for not ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering up the chimney.</p>
            <p>Now after this digreſſion, let us return to the pamphlet, and ſee what is ſaid about the puniſhment of this crime, which mildneſs itſelf could neither overlook nor forgive. A very mild puniſhment ſays he, for it was only ſhutting up the port. Now
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013381_0019_0F905752CAEB45D8"/>
ſhutting up the port, was, as we all know, only deſtroying the trade; and that is only a trifle, as we ſhall ſee by and by. <q>Surely, (cries our author) none who have as high a ſenſe of public guilt as of private, can think this puniſhment too ſevere for the crime, conſidered under all its aggravations. For no people are entitled to the uſe of any advantage, which they wantonly abuſe to the injury of others.</q> Theſe obſervations are calculated to ſhew the equity of the port bill; let us ſee then, whether our author hath fortunately ſtumbled upon ſound reaſon in this inſtance, after failing ſo often.—The advantage which the Boſtonians are deprived of, is their trade; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their trade muſt be the thing which they wantonly abuſed. Now, by what figure of ſpeech, the deſtruction of the Tea can be called a matter of trade, or what kind of trade it is, I am at a loſs to conceive.—Do not ſay, that this is a verbal criticiſm. Such things I reſerve for authors of greater perſpicuity. The equity of every puniſhment depends of its relation to the crime. Now allowing, that the deſtroyers of the Tea, were guilty of a violent outrageous riot; I ſhall be glad to know, what kind of relation there is in the nature of things, between a riot commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thirty or forty men, and the ruin of many honeſt tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by a total ſupenſion of that commerce on which they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Yet this is a MILD and a JUST puniſhment. I have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly exhibited the delinquencies of this people; were I to give them a name, nothing but that love of peace which ſanctifies every means to obtain it, nothing but that ſhould prevent me, from branding their conduct as a tameneſs under inſults which provoke them.</p>
            <p>The next attempt of our worthy pamphleteer is to ſhew, that <q>the puniſhment of the Boſtonians, was not haſty and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</q> He reaſons thus: In common caſes, a criminal ought to be heard; but this is an uncommon caſe; courts of juſtice ought not to condemn unheard, but the legiſlature may. Now let us ſcrutinize the intrinſic value of theſe ſuggeſtions. A fellow ſteals a ſheep, or a horſe, or raviſhes your wife, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders your father. Juſtice holds up on high her equal ſcales; ſhe cries out aloud to the human heart, let him be heard in his defence; rather ninety-nine guilty eſcape, than one innocent periſh: but ſhould a man burn the tooth-pick of a court miſtreſs, or prevent the prime miniſter from piſſing in his pocket, or deſtroy ſome muſty Tea, to ſave his eſtate; in ſuch uncommon caſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if ninety-nine innocent are to ſuffer, leſt one guilty eſcape; in ſuch uncommon caſe the maxim is, let them not be heard. Do you ask why? The anſwer is plain: If ſuffered to make a defence,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013381_0020_0F90F4BF3897BF48"/>
they cannot be convicted.—So much for the caſe: Now for the tribunal.—If a man commits any of the crimes firſt mentioned againſt the known laws of the land, ſubject to a certain penalty, the maxim is, let him be heard. But as to the laſt ſort, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a new law, in a new mode, both framed after the fact committed, policy is of opinion, that they ſhould not be heard, leſt the varlets ſhould except to her mode of proceedings againſt them. All which is addreſſed to the <hi>reaſonable</hi> Americans.</p>
            <p>But (ſays he in the next paragraph) to involve the innocent with the guilty, is an inconvenience which always <hi>neceſſarily</hi> attends puniſhments inflicted on a people, whether by God or man. And again, it was <hi>politically</hi> impoſſible to ſelect the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Boſton from the guilty. We all remember the ſtory of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is an excellent leſſon to the Princes of the earth. The inhabitants of theſe cities, infamous by their vices to the laſt degree, became ſo obnoxious to the Supreme Being, that in anger, he reſolved to deſtroy them. Yet had there been five men, only five men, who walked uprightly before God; had only five ſuch men dwelt in Sodom and Gomorrah, no fire had deſcended from Heaven to conſume them. But alas! Becauſe among thirty thouſand ſouls in Boſton, thirty have offended; in vain ſhall the multitude plead innocence, as an exemption from ruin. Bluſh Humanity! This is thy political neceſſity, which muſt hereafter juſtify the laying that defenceleſs town in aſhes, and drenching it in the blood of its inhabitants.</p>
            <l>—Merciful Heaven!</l>
            <l>Thou rather with thy ſharp, and ſulph'rous bolt,</l>
            <l>Split'ſt the unwedgeable, and gnarled oak,</l>
            <l>Than the ſoft myrtle. Yea, but man, proud man!</l>
            <l>Dreſt in a little brief authority;</l>
            <l>Moſt ignorant of what he's moſt aſſur'd,</l>
            <l>His glaſſy eſſence: Like an angry ape,</l>
            <l>Plays ſuch fantaſtick tricks before high Heaven,</l>
            <l>As makes the Angels weep.</l>
            <p>Becauſe thirty have offended, a whole colony is puniſhed. And for what offence? An offence ſo ſmall, ſo diſproportionately puniſhed, that the general voice of the continent hath declared, that they ſuffer in the cauſe of American liberty. Here our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor begins to leave the paths of logic, and to enter the alleys of Billingſgate. Beneath his forming hand, American liberty ſtarts forth a monſter of licentiouſneſs. And in his idea, to ſcreen our miſerable fellow-creatures from that PUBLIC JUSTICE
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013381_0021_0F90575415DAE8E0"/>
which hath been created for them; is giving ſhelter to the raving enthuſiaſt, who hath murdered his prince.—Bold metaphors and florid language, are the magnificent trappings of reaſon and truth; and when falſhood or folly is thus arrayed, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes at once our indignation and contempt.</p>
            <p>But neither bold metaphors, nor yet bold language, ſerve ſome cauſes ſo well as bold aſſertions. I have heard of lawyers, who by the aſſiſtance of that invincible front which is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive privilege of their profeſſion, frame evidence as they go along, and ſpeak fluently on facts which never exiſted. In like manner and in humble imitation, to evince the propriety of the act, for new modelling the government of Maſſachuſets; our author ſcruples not to affirm, that <q>no privileges are curtailed by the act, but ſuch as had been abuſed and forfeited, over and over, to the great injury and diſturbance of that province, as well as to the diſhonour and reproach of the nation.</q> The inſtitutions of this act, as to their matter I do not object to; for it hath long been my opinion, that the government of that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony was in its form and complection, too like a Republic, for the true ſpirit of our conſtitution. But as to the manner; even ſuppoſing theſe regulations to be a decree ſubſtantially juſt, and made by a court having proper juriſdiction, ſtill there is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt impropriety.—It is, and while I have exiſtence, it ſhall be my ſentiment; that no man, no body of men, in any cauſe, before any tribunal, can be legally affected by any determination, where an opportunity is not given, for making a defence. Had this been done in the preſent inſtance, perhaps his Majeſty's Miniſters would not have deemed them ſo criminal, as they now do. But waving this idea, I am ſure the author of the Addreſs at leaſt, after the pointed aſſertions he has made, ought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon juſtice to have ſhewn, how the privileges he ſpeaks of had been <hi>abuſed and forfeited.</hi> This, however he thought it prudent to omit.—</p>
            <p>That Adminiſtration is irritated with Boſton, that it hath cauſe to be irritated, I freely acknowledge: And <hi>this</hi> is the cauſe of the anger they feel, and the revenge they have taken. The people of that town, and the colony it belongs to, have been forward and active, in ſtating and demanding, their rights and liberties; they have addreſſed, petitioned, and remonſtrated to Miniſters, Parliament, and King; they have ſounded the alarm, when the enemy attacked our privileges; and they have been the grand obſtacle to an American tyranny. If to do thus
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013381_0022_0F905754399BE108"/>
is a forfeiture of privileges; if to do thus is an abuſe of them, who would hold ſuch privileges on ſuch tenure? Moſt readily do I grant, that it was a diſhonour and a reproach to the nation, and its rulers too; that they ſo often made uſe of their right to petition and to remonſtrate. Great was the cauſe, or ſuch fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent complaints would not have been obtruded. For this was their guilt, this was their impertinence;—ſuffering they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Quebec Act. On this ſubject I ſhall not minutely follow our author, for the ſubſtance of what he ſays, being levelled at the following propoſitions of the Congreſs; that the government of Canada is rendered arbitrary, that the people are deprived of trial by jury, and that the Roman Catholick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is eſtabliſhed; if I ſhall be able to ſhew that theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions are true, then what he hath ſaid to the contrary, will be of no avail. And firſt, what can be more arbitrary than this? A Governor and Council appointed by, and dependent on the Crown, are the legiſlature of a whole region. They may ſit at home, and frame edicts for the extremeſt parts of that vaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, without any one check from the people. They may tax the colony as they pleaſe, or hand it over to be fleeced by the Britiſh Commons. They may invent new crimes, and affix to them ſuch new penalties, and make them cognizable before ſuch new Courts, as they ſhall think meet at their ſovereign will and pleaſure, they may ſeize and impriſon any member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity; or elſe more certainly and entirely, to ruin and oppreſs him, they may cauſe ſome minion of power to inſtitute an action for his whole ſubſtance, and try him and condemn him, by the arbitrary principles, and more arbitrary judges of the civil law. For, in the ſecond place, it is clear to a demonſtration, that trials by jury cannot be had there now; and it is equally clear that they never can exiſt hereafter, unleſs the Governor and Council chuſe to riſk and diminiſh their power, by introducing this free and generous branch of Engliſh juriſprudence. How probable it is that they will thus put a curb on their own wantonneſs, I leave any man in his ſenſes to determine. But thirdly, it is not civil tyranny alone, which is planted in Quebec, to overſhadow that immenſe country. From the ſame poiſonous root, ariſes the moſt horrible religious tyranny, that my mind is capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.—What eſtabliſhment can any religion have in any country on earth, unleſs it be a legal proviſion for the ſupport of its clergy? Look thro' Europe. See if Popery is in any other manner eſtabliſhed in any one country, than by payment of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013381_0023_0F905754D636E7A8"/>
tythes, and protection of Prieſts. Is not this an eſtabliſhment? Is it not more? Is it not an encouragement? He who would go farther, muſt reſort to fire and ſword; the arguments of thoſe barbarous ages and nations, whoſe annals diſguſt humanity. But the objection is, that when any man is converted, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty may if he pleaſes, encourage the Proteſtant Clergy as he pleaſes, out of the tythes paid before to the Roman Prieſt. Allowing this argument to have weight, which indeed it has not; pray what likelihood is there that any man will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? Proteſtantiſm is the tender child of freedom and ſcience: How then can it exiſt in the bold boſom of ignorant deſpotiſm? Without the patronage of one earthly friend. Without a ſingle rag to cover its nakedneſs. In ancient days the Romiſh Church was a firm barrier againſt the incroachments of Royal prerogative. The Clergy dependent on the Pope as their univerſal head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the menaces of kingly power. Thus were popular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges in thoſe times frequently protected by popular ſuperſtition. Our Miniſters by a refinement of modern policy, have adopted the Church of Rome as a twin-ſiſter to the Church of England. Our ſubtle Miniſters have placed the King of England in the ſame ſituation with the Roman pontiff Every dignitary of the Church is dependent on him, beſides which he hath full power to appoint ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Courts, with ſuch juriſdictions as he ſhall think meet. Thus, all the bigotry, all the ſuperſtition of a religion abounding in both, beyond any which the world hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; all, all is in his Royal hand to be uſed at his Royal will and pleaſure. To this full ſupremacy over their ſouls, are joined the fulleſt temporal powers, both legiſlative and judicial; ſo that like the ancient Patriarchs, he is King, Prieſt and Prophet. To finiſh the dreadful ſyſtem, add all the executive powers of the State, and encircle the whole with a ſtanding army, 'tis then compleat. Theſe are facts? And whenever a wicked monarch in vengeance ſhall ariſe; then ſhall we behold him, the civil and religious tyrant, of a province which extends over half the Continent of America. Such is the tendency of the Canada Bill. View it, conſider it, ponder upon it, in the cooleſt, moſt temporate diſpoſition; behold its conſequences, and the mild eye of reaſon will be clouded with a tear.</p>
            <p>The next part of the Addreſs is to ſhew, that the other Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies need not trouble their heads about Boſton or Quebec. As to what he ſays about Quebec. I believe with him, that there is no intention of introducing Popery into the other colonies. Our Miniſters, or rather Maſters, have more underſtanding than
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013381_0024_0F905759710076D0"/>
to entertain ſo wild an opinion. Nor would I perſwade man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to become Knights Errant, and wantonly undertake the quarrels, and fight the battles of other people. But I will leave it to any man, nay, I would almoſt appeal to the author of the addreſs himſelf, to determine; whether a country has not great reaſon to fear the loſs of its liberties, when ſurrounded by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſlaves; eſpecially when thoſe ſlaves are inbued with principles inimical to it, and united together in one common intereſt, profeſſion and faith, under one common head, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by all the weight of a large empire. Does not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence give additional force to every ſolicitous apprehenſion?</p>
            <p>His ideas about Boſton amount to this: that we ſhould act like wiſe foxes, for fear of being docked: or, in plain Engliſh, view with unconcern the deſtruction of that capital, without daring to interpoſe for its preſervation. I beg pardon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating a vulgar ſtory: A Scotchman upon his arrival at an inn filled with travellers, crept into bed between an Engliſhman and an Iriſhman: towards the morning the Engliſhman was awaked by an inundation from his new bed-fellow, <q>zounds, ſays he, what are you about?</q> Hoot, hoot, mon, cried the politic Scot, <q>lye down quiet; I have done worſe to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the author of the addreſs tells us: the diſpute with Great-Britain is <hi>de lana caprina.</hi> I learnt a little Latin at ſchool, ſo with the help of my ſcholarſhip, and from what follows, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that this means goats wool:—That this to ſay, all the grievances America has laboured under for a dozen years paſt, amount to a meer trifle; which is ſo ſhockingly abſurd, that it would be ridiculous to honour it with the ceremony of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
            <p>As to the thought of eſtabliſhing a republic in America, breaking off our connexion with Great-Britain, and becoming independent: I conſider it as the moſt vain, empty, ſhallow, and ridiculous project, that could poſſibly enter into the heart of man. I do not believe there are five hundred on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who have the leaſt pretenſions to common ſenſe, and who would not riſque their deareſt blood, to prevent ſuch meaſures: This ſuppoſition, therefore, and what relates to it, I conſider meerly as an introduction to his cenſures on the Congreſs. Theſe cenſures ſeem to be the main buſineſs and intention of the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. If therefore in the avowed purpoſe of it (a conſideration
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013381_0025_0F90575ABB5C9820"/>
of the oppoſition in America on principles of prudence and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy) I ſhall be able to ſhew; that the author is much miſtaken in condemning thoſe meaſures which the Congreſs hath adopted; then all his declamation upon that ſubject, will be as the idle wind, which paſſeth away and is heard no more.</p>
            <p>The firſt reflections he caſts on this reſpectable body, are far adopting the Suffolk reſolves. The aſperity and bitterneſs which appears in this part of the pamphlet, are to be attributed to the great warmth of the reverend compoſer. Reproaches from an angry man are eaſily forgiven; and that meekneſs of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition which attends the miniſters of peace, will I hope mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the unchriſtian tranſports of our authors zeal, as ſoon as his miſtakes are diſcovered. By a member of the Congreſs, whoſe honor and veracity ſtand unimpeached, I am authorized to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the Congreſs did not adopt the Suffolk reſolves. That theſe reſolves were never ſo much as read for debate; and that upon the common reading, the ſenſe of that body was, that it was proper to recommend moderate and pacific conduct, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by firmneſs and reſolution. The language of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in conſequence of this determination<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is as follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved unanimouſly,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we thoroughly approve the wiſdom and fortitude, with which oppoſition has been hitherto conducted; and earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a perſeverance in the ſame firm and temperate conduct, as expreſſed in the reſolution &amp;c. Now then I appeal to the world, whether this is the cordial approbation of an independent government. Whether it is a tranſport of joy on the news of revolt. Whether it is a league with the worſt enemies of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, ſurely it is not. The fair reputation of thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who compoſed the Congreſs, render ſuch imputations almoſt unpardonable. It is a duty therefore incumbent on the author of the Addreſs, to make ſome public acknowledgement; many did indeed expect that ſome conſtitution would have been pointed out, to ſecure and eſtabliſh the freedom of America, and the ſovereignty of that ſupreme legiſlature, which ought certainly to govern the whole empire. This is a conſummation devoutly to be wiſhed for, but it is not the work of a moment. Beſides, it might have been thought preſumptuous in them to undertake what is properly the buſineſs of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the reſpective legiſlatures of the Continent. Why
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013381_0026_0F90575AE16C7520"/>
then are thoſe perſons, who have generouſly devoted their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the Public, why are they to be cenſured, for a ſin of omiſſion; which at any rate is pardonable on the ſcore of human infirmity?</p>
            <p>Much paper is conſumed in the Addreſs, to paint thoſe horrors which await on civil war. To this I have no objection. For there is not a creature living, to whom ſuch a proſpect is more terrible than myſelf. And I dare ſay, a candid deſcription of my own feelings on the ſubject, would convey as genuine marks of deteſtation for that horrible cataſtrophe, as the laboured pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the author before us. But I ſee no reaſons for ſuch appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. Neither do I think that man a friend to either coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who ſpeaks of war between them except in the ſtile of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. To imagine that America can cope with Great Britain, is the exceſs of ſtupidity. And even if we were capable of the conteſt, were we certain of obtaining victory, I ſhould pray that the hand in which I hold my pen, might wither e'er it drew the ſword.—But let not the dread of power, draw off our attention from the purſuit of freedom. Let us in every inſtance follow that example which our author recommends. In imitation of the inhabitants of Rye; whenever either duty to the mother country, or enthuſiaſm in the cauſe of humanity, ſhall hurry us beyond the true line, of patriotiſm or obedience, let us take the earlieſt opportunity to retract our errors, and acknowledge our miſtakes.—Reſiſtance againſt oppreſſion, is the undoubted privilege of mankind; but civil reſiſtance alone, is juſtifiable in civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>I come now to what our author hath ſaid of the non-importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreement.—This he likens to the cutting off an arm, for a ſore on one of the fingers. Similies are very agreeable and proper, where they tend to throw light on the ſubject.—Now, if a man hath a ſore on his finger, he will naturally put a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to it. If the finger grows worſe, and he grows timid, he ſends for a ſurgeon. If the topical applications of the ſurgeon are inefficacious, and a gangrene enſues, the parts are ſcarified, and the bone cleanſed. If this fails of ſucceſs, and corruption ſpreads along the limb, and threatens the vitals, the only hope which remains is from amputation. True it is, the patient may looſe much blood by the inciſion of his arteries, and death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may be the conſequence. But by undergoing it he has a chance for life, and otherwiſe his caſe is deſperate. As an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013381_0027_0F90575CF8F39700"/>
in ſuch difficult emergencies, the ſcriptures tell us, if thy member offendeth thee, cut it off, and caſt it away.</p>
            <p>Now, reader, let me entreat your patience a little while longer. Pray obſerve. The liberties of this country have been infringed in an article of trade. Common ſenſe informs us, that if one impoſition is admitted, another will follow. Petitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, have been preſented in vain. When we refuſed the dutiable commodity, it was almoſt forced upon our accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. No hope therefore remains from common efforts. And the queſtion is reduced to this ſhort alternative: Which is moſt advantageous, commerce or freedom? One or the other, we muſt forego. The one for a time, or the other forever. I will wave the common obſervation, which is level to the loweſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that without freedom trade cannot flouriſh. But I muſt beg leave to examine, from reaſon and experience, Whether a ceſſation of trade will not procure us relief?</p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident, than that the trade between Britain and the northern colonies, brings yearly very large ſums of money to the latter. That the balance of all the other trade ſhe enjoys, is on the whole againſt her. And that her annual expences amount to an enormous ſum, great part whereof is paid into foreign countries, as intereſt for the national debt Is it not then equally evident, that a ſuſpenſion of her commerce with us, muſt greatly diſtreſs her? And to heighten this diſtreſs, what can be more effectual than to embarraſs her trade with the iſlands? Every good heart would wiſh to avoid this, and it is not our ſmalleſt misfortune, that to make men reaſon, we muſt make them feel. Happy would it be if the authors of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, were the only ſufferers. To effect this deſirable purpoſe we had but one way, which was to injure the revenue, in ſuch manner as to hold them up to the reſentment of the nation; and this has been done.—The wiſeſt meaſures may fail, but theſe at leaſt promiſe ſucceſs.—Great-Britain may indeed very eaſily put an entire ſtep to all our commerce. But this (if we may believe the Addreſs) is a mild puniſhment on Boſton. And if ſo, why cannot we all undergo it? No, ſays he, inflicted on all of us, it would be very ſevere. It would ſo, but I truſt not laſting. Will a ſtoppage of our trade, pay the debts we owe in England? Will ſhutting up our ports, breed ſailors for the navy of Britain? Millions in Europe are fed by the American plough; while bread can be purchaſed on this continent will they ſtarve? Will the Monarchs of France and Spain ſee their
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013381_0028_0F90575E486ADC88"/>
ſubjects periſh, that Americans may be reduced to ſlavery? All theſe things may happen, and after all, this country is capable of ſupporting its inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Great are the difficulties we labour under, and many are the obſtacles we muſt ſurmount. For the road to freedom and virtue, is not ſtrewed with flowers, but ſprinkled with thorns. Perhaps our fortitude is not equal to the taſk, if ſo, we deſerve the conſequences. But remember, that the mother-country muſt ſuffer with her colonies: Remember, that a Non-Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation has once procured a redreſs of our grievances. Remember that Concord is the parent of ſucceſs. Remember, that the worſt which can poſſibly befal us, even at the laſt, is that very ſlavery which we muſt now reſiſt or ſubmit to. O AMERICANS! theſe conſiderations are ſubmitted to you. Attend, and way the God of wiſdom, who foreknoweth all human events, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you, as is moſt comformable to the myſterious intentions of his Divine Providence. For the good of his creatures, muſt be the will of him who is infinite goodneſs.</p>
