            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS well known, to all that know the ancient <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>only People,</hi> which the God of <hi>Heaven</hi> then had on <hi>Earth,</hi> That the Lord by His <hi>Laws</hi> required His People, to offer their <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> unto Him. Yea, The <hi>Firſt Sons</hi> of men that ever were <hi>Born</hi> into the World, actually and practically acknowledged their Obligations to offer their <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> unto the Lord. And the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> themſelves found the <hi>Tradition,</hi> of paying their <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> unto the Lord, ſo agreeable unto the <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in them, that even among the <hi>Pagans</hi> alſo, it was a Note of the Higheſt <hi>Profanity,</hi> for any to Refuſe the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. Yea, a famous Writer among them writes of a People ſo Irreligious &amp; Atheiſtical, that God had not their <hi>First Fruits,</hi> which, he ſayes, <hi>Were by a Sudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſo ſtrangely deſtroy'd, that there were no Remainders, either of the Perſons, or of their Houſes, Left.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Obſerved, That a dreadful <hi>Deſolation</hi> is in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ways continually carrying off the <hi>Young men</hi> of this Country; And it may be concluded, That the moral cauſe of this woful <hi>Deſolation</hi> is, becauſe our <hi>Young People</hi> do no more offer their <hi>First Fruits</hi> unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>The obſcure Author of the Short Sermon, here Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, was willing to beſpeak the <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>Young People</hi> of his Flock, for their Glorious Lord; and he made ſome freſh and ſad Inſtances of <hi>Deſolation</hi> among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> and the <hi>Argument</hi> of his Doing it.

Death</hi> in no <hi>Caſe</hi> at all. <hi>All Ages</hi> from a ſad Experience have given us a full Demonſtration of it; That perſons are Seized by Death at <hi>all Ages. Young men</hi> Dy as well as <hi>Old men</hi>; yea, more Dy while <hi>Young men,</hi> than ever come to be <hi>Old men.</hi> We ſay, There are <hi>Skins</hi> of all Ages in the Market, and <hi>Skulls</hi> of all ſizes in <hi>Golgotha.</hi> Yea, more Dy before <hi>Thirty,</hi> than after <hi>Sixty.</hi> And that which puts a doleful Accent on this Remark is, That <hi>Young men</hi> may Dy very <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly</hi>; and as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, and as <hi>Jobs</hi> did, <hi>In a moment they go down to the Grave. Death</hi> does not always make a ſlow Diſpatch, by ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, upon <hi>Young men</hi>; it ſometimes Diſpatches them with a <hi>ſudden</hi> Violence. The <hi>Thunder,</hi> and the <hi>Whirlwind,</hi> that overwhelm'd the Sons of <hi>Job,</hi> is not more <hi>ſudden</hi> in its violence. There are numberleſs <hi>Accidents,</hi> by which the <hi>Angels of Death,</hi> do their Excution <hi>at once,</hi> when they have a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to take <hi>Young men</hi> into their Hands. <hi>Drowning</hi> is one of thoſe <hi>Accidents,</hi> than which there is none more frequent; Thus is <hi>the Lamp of Young men put out</hi>!

In the Forenoon <hi>Young men</hi> may think themſelves likely to Live yet ſome ſcores of years; In the Afternoon ſomething befals them, whereupon the Report ſhall come, <hi>The Young men are Dead.</hi>
