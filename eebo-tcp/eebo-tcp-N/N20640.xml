            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Don Iſidor de Haro!—Good Heavens!—Young man, recollect yourſelf—ſay—what Don Iſidor de Haro?—Is he of this country, or how long has he lived in it?</p>
               <p>As to his native country, I cannot ſay any thing with certainty, returned the young man; but I believe he is a Caſtilian by birth—He has been here but a ſhort time, yet in that ſhort time has gained the affections of all ranks of people.</p>
               <p>Here the old man of the cottage took up the account with—It is only two years ſince Don Iſidor came here to take poſſeſſion of the caſtle and eſtate of Duerro, which he honourably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the affection of our good king, as a reward for his ſervices:—where he came from I know not, but I have heard that he was all his life before in the wars.</p>

No one, whatever his condition may be, paſſes without calling at the caſtle; and it is a part of the young gentleman Alphonſo's buſineſs to watch leſt they ſhould accidentally paſs by, and to bring them home with him, from whence they generally carry away a good ſupply of clothes and food.

               <p>NEXT morning the Pilgrim, after having beſtowed on his hoſts a hearty benediction, and his thanks for their hoſpitable ſhelter, took his leave, and proceeded on his way towards the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Duero. It was little leſs than a quarter of a league from the cottage to the avenue; and as he walked very ſlowly, deeply immerſed in thought, the day was advanced when he got to the gate of it.

Addreſſing the old man with a mixture of reſpect, admiration, and pity, he ſaid, I hope, Senor, you have not been long ſitting in this place, ſo unworthy your reverend appearance and years; ſhould it be ſo, I ſhall have to accuſe myſelf of an unpardonable neglect, for which I ſhould certainly receive a ſevere reproof from Don Iſidor.

               <p>As they proceeded along—Is Don Iſidor at home, my dear? interrogated the old man—No, Senor, he has been abroad for ſome days, but all the ſervants have directions to obey punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally my orders in my father's abſence, and you ſhall be well treated though he be not at home.

Upon which the Pilgrim turning to his young friend ſaid, Let me not, I beſeech you, young gentleman, detain you from your pleaſures. Though the days of youth are paſt with me, I well remember the painfulneſs of reſtraint; and I already feel too great an intereſt in your heart, to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of loſing any ſhare of it by taxing your kindneſs too ſeverely.</p>
               <p>Indeed, returned the youth, the delight I feel in attending you would more than compenſate for the loſs of any pleaſure.

Juanico was able, he would be as generous as the firſt nobleman in Spain.</p>
               <p>Alphonſo left the ſtranger and Father Thomas in diſcourſe, while he attended his duty in the menage—When that was diſpatched, he impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently returned, and found he had finiſhed his breakfaſt. The whole day he employed in ſhewing him the gardens, woods, vineyards and caſtle: the armoury particularly attracted the old man's attention—he looked with an eye of ſkilful curioſity at every part, each in its turn.

undeſcribable ſenſation thrilled to the old man's heart. He ſeized Alphonſo in his arms, held him for ſome time claſped in his embrace, and wept. Alphonſo wept too—he could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Next morning, while Alphonſo and his new friend were engaged in the armoury, the tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of horſes announced the arrival of Don Iſidor. Father Thomas met and retired with him into his cloſet: as ſoon as permiſſion was granted him, Alphonſo flew to embrace his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when the mutual manifeſtations of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were over, O father, ſaid Alphonſo, I have got you a viſitor in the houſe.—So I have been told by Father Thomas, my dear; I entirely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of your behaviour to him, and thank you for ſo very honourably repreſenting me in my abſence: I am the more pleaſed with your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, becauſe he is ſo very poor a man.</p>
               <p>Poor! repeated Alphonſo—ſurely, father, you miſtake—he is not poor—I never ſaw a grander man in my life.</p>

His dreſs! No indeed, ſaid Alphonſo, I took no notice of his dreſs: if it be poor, as you ſay, I am ſure I am ſorry for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I cannot help loving him. And turning to Don Iſidor, I reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him as much—almoſt as much as if it was yourſelf:—then he has ſuch a commanding air—and he talks ſo grandly of war, and honour, and courage, and armour, that I am ſure he would delight you.</p>
               <p>What Alphonſo ſays is not entirely void of foundation, ſaid Father Thomas.</p>
               <p>Well, then, ſaid Don Iſidor, tell your friend that I kiſs his hands, and ſhall be glad to ſee him by and by in the great hall.</p>
               <p>He is there now, ſaid Alphonſo; I hear the ſound of his harp.</p>
               <p>Then let us go to him, my dear.</p>
               <p>On their entering into the hall, the old man roſe, and, with a deportment majeſtic beyond expreſſion, ſaluted Don Iſidor; who, on his part, received him, not with that arrogant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

a perſon of my humble appearance in his caſtle will ſubject Don Alphonſo to the imputation of raſhneſs, or me to the cenſure of forward intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Don Iſidor may be aſſured, that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the youth (flattering though it was) ſhould not have been accepted, had not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal report perſuaded me that it would have been approved by his father.</p>
               <p>Venerable Senor, returned Don Iſidor, I hope you will find that your opinion, and the report which gave it birth, are not entirely miſplaced. My boy, whoſe whole life has been one continued ſeries of acts the moſt grateful to my feelings, has never done one more productive of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me than procuring me the honour of your company. I am not, continued he, a man of much ceremony. And ſhall therefore only tell you, that my gueſts are, to all intents of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, maſters of this caſtle; and I beg that you will co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>When Don Iſidor retired to his apartment, he could not help reflecting on the extraordinary appearance of the ſtranger. Pilgrims and itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant bards he had often ſeen, but never one that at all reſembled this, in whom he imagined he could diſtinguiſh the remains of the warring and the defaced ruins of the man of dignity. That he was of a rank far above his preſent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027101_0020_0FD33AFB17E1DC70"/>
ſeeming, he had not the ſmalleſt doubt; but what that rank had been, or how he had fallen from it, he could not conceive, and he feared to enquire: even conjecture was loſt in the wide field of calamitous events. While he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed in this confuſion of thoughts, Alphonſo entered. There is ſomething, my child, ſaid Don Iſidor, in this old veteran's manners, which exacts more than common reſpect, and beſpeaks him of ſuperior rank, though fallen. I confeſs an invincible curioſity to know who and what he is; but, as the recollection of ſuch things muſt be painful, I will rather content myſelf with ignorance of the matter than indulge my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at the riſk of giving a ſingle pang to his aged heart: I will therefore be ſilent on the ſubject, unleſs he chooſes of his own accord to diſcloſe himſelf to me. At all events, the great hall is a place where the difficulty he may have to be communicative muſt be increaſed by the frequent entrance of ſervants. I wiſh, my dear, to acquit myſelf to you of a vice which I have ſo often and ſo vehemently reprobated to you, and therefore declare, that not idle curioſity, but an anxious deſire to heal, if poſſible, the wounds that fortune may have inflicted on him, induces me to this; I will therefore direct one of the ſervants to wait upon him with my reſpects, and inform him that I ſhall be obliged to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:027101_0021_0FD33B0198D30E88"/>
Then, Sir, ſaid Alphonſo, I had better go myſelf: will it not appear more reſpectful?</p>
               <p>Thank you for your hint, my child, ſaid Don Iſidor: you ſpeak my very ſoul.</p>
               <p>Alphonſo was not long away, when he returned leading in the old man in the ſame manner as he had led him up the avenue. Don Iſidor was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at perceiving that he had brought his harp with him. Being ſeated at the deſire of Don Iſidor, he proceeded, without a word, to tune his harp, while his face exhibited marks of ſtrong emotions, and ſeemed pregnant with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary events. Don Iſidor would not break in upon him. After a ſhort prelude, he began to play, accompanying it with his voice. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly had ſet her ſtamp on every note he ſung. Don Iſidor, who heedfully attended, to catch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Hence he ſkilfully turned to the happy ſtate of Don Iſidor, whoſe armour hung up at once a monument of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

his eyes, which before had loſt their functions in attention to the ſong, on the old man, whoſe face, glowing with the awakened enthuſiaſm of his ſpirit, beamed with the glories of the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and the bard. In mute amazement he for a while gazed, tracing the lineaments of a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance familiar to him, yet unknown—thrice he eſſayed to ſpeak, but, loſt in ſurmiſe, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doubt, as often faltered. At length, with difficulty maſtering the tumult within him, he ſaid, Ah, Sire! am I miſtaken, or do I behold—do I ſee the once beloved and ever revered—the glorious—Unfortunate Baron de Rayo! interrupted the old man.</p>
               <p>Don Iſidor had barely ſtrength ſufficient to riſe and throw his arms about the Baron's neck—there, locked in a firm embrace, he held him for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Why it is, I know not, but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a truth, that, from the inſtant I beheld him, I felt myſelf ſo tied to him by the ſtrongeſt cords of affection, that to ſeparate him from me would be to tear every ligament of my heart aſunder.—But I delay my promiſed hiſtory; and much I fear that the pain ſome paſſages of it cannot fail to give you, will be but poorly requited by the gratification of your curioſity.</p>

Heaven, I buried the remembrance of all my loſſes; and failing in male iſſue, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined never to marry again, I adopted the ſon of my ſiſter, the young Henry Gonſalvo, reared him as my own, and hoped, by my influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the king, to get the title and honours of the old houſe of Rayo entailed upon him and his iſſue.</p>
               <p>At this time your father, the younger brother of a reſpectable branch of our houſe, beſpoke my patronage for you—I took you to my caſtle, and, fancying that I ſaw in you the dawnings of future greatneſs, determined to train you early up to arms. Your progreſs and unfolding powers juſtified my hopes; nor can I recollect many paſſages of my life that pleaſed me more than beholding, in the brotherly conteſts of emulation between you and my Henry, the victory hang now on this ſide now on that, till both were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; for ſo perfect was the equality between you at the cloſe of ten years, in which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued together under my eye, that it remained doubtful which excelled in vigour, dexterity, and martial ardour; or which in tenderneſs, fidelity, and mutual attachment. I looked upon you both with pride—with hope—and flattered myſelf that in each I ſaw a ſecond ſelf ariſing. But what was my exultation, when, our glorious king Alphonſo calling me to the war <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>When our moſt beloved monarch, the friend and patron of our houſe, and the father of his people, died at the fatal ſiege of the Mooriſh fort Gibraltar, I retired in deſpondence and grief, and brought Gonſalvo with me; while you, arreſted by a thirſt for glory, and diſdaining a life of inactive dependance, remained behind. We returned—Henry loaded with honours, and I exulting in the reflection, that the reputation of our family, for ages celebrated in the field, and diſtinguiſhed for valour and loyalty, was likely to ſuffer no diminution in the hands of its new repreſentative.</p>
               <p>We had not been long at home, when I had the additional ſatisfaction to perceive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

communication as I thought would ſerve to ſtrengthen their flame, without conſuming their affection. Every thing turned out correſpondent to my intentions. Henry, fearful of the event, retired to his father's houſe, and from thence gave me, by letter, a diſcloſure of his paſſion, with many expreſſions of apprehenſion; and above all, deprecating my ſuſpicions of perfidy and breach of hoſpitality in having paid his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes privately to my daughter. I ſpoke to Maria with all the delicacy I could; though I already knew, deſired to be made the friendly confidant of her ſentiments; and aſſured her that my conſent ſhould not be wanting to make her happy. Overſpread wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But recollecting himſelf, he exclaimed—This ſhould not be—but ſad remembrance will obtrude itſelf.</p>
               <p>A tear fell from Don Iſidor, and the Baron reſumed his ſtory.</p>

was the legitimate ſon of our lamented king Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo; and I thought it my duty to defend him, without examining the merits of his cauſe. Gonſalvo and I accordingly ſet out to join the royal ſtandard. I will not enlarge upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt the tyrant's whole conduct gave us: it however ſerved to leſſen, if not entirely remove the regret I felt at finding you had long been a follower of the fortunes of Henry Count Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamare, his brother. You were right, as it has turned out; but I acted upon principles of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and allegiance, and find my conſolation in the conſciouſneſs of intentional rectitude. To be ſuccinct, we overcame the rebellion, and Gonſalvo and I returned to our peaceful caſtle, with no other reward or compenſation for our pains than the laurels we gathered in the field, which, under ſuch banners as we fought beneath, were withered ere they could be plucked.</p>
               <p>Immediately on our return, the nuptials of my children were celebrated with all the pomp and dignity becoming their illuſtrious houſe; and my happineſs ſoon received further augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Henry's announcing to me the pregnancy of his wife. The wiſhed for yet dreaded moment at length arrived, and gave to our fond arms a noble boy: here my ſoul ſeemed to recline, and reſt itſelf as after a long fatiguing journey. The child was ſcarcely a minute from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

over him, anticipating the opening of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and drawing to myſelf, in fancy's flattering colours, the picture of his future form; the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſymmetry of thoſe limbs, then in a ſtate of ſhapeleſs, helpleſs inaction; the fire of that ſpirit then repoſed in torpid apathy; and the variouſly expreſſive beauties of that face, which then exhibited no trace of ſenſation, ſave the tranſitory impreſſions of accidental pain, or the paſſing dimples of an unmeaning ſmile.</p>
               <p>A ſhort time after this Peter again called us forth. His reiterated breaches of faith, his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and exactions, raiſed up againſt him a formidable power, headed by Henry Count Tranſtamare, aſſiſted by the renowned Bertrand Gueſclin. I thought it our duty to attend him, nor could we, however willing at ſuch a time to remain at home, decline the ſummons without tarniſhing, or at leaſt hazarding our fame. We therefore prepared to depart; and the young child, which was named after me, Alphonſo, was put out to nurſe in a village near the caſtle, my daughter being determined to attend her huſband to Cordova. From this reſolution, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever extraordinary, nothing could diſſuade her; and every thing being done that could render the journey convenient to her, we ſet out, and, without any incident worthy of relation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the inhabitants to the deſperate meaſure of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring openly againſt him. We were, however, treated with every mark of diſtinction by the gentry round the place; and the ſingular heroiſm and conjugal affection of Maria raiſed her ſo high in every one's eſteem, and gained her ſuch uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſpect, that her condition was rendered much more tolerable than we could poſſibly have hoped for.</p>
               <p>Among thoſe who were moſt forward in doing honour to our family, was the Marquis de Puna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lada, a man of an illuſtrious houſe, and high in favour with the king: he had formerly been acquainted with Gonſalvo, and now renewed his intimacy with a zeal that gave us the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as the capricious and violent temper of the king made the condition of all thoſe who were not favourites, either immediately or collaterally, extremely precarious and diſagreeable. We had little time for the cultivation of this intimacy. Henry was ordered off on a ſervice of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger and difficulty; and I was ordered, together with all the elder Barons, to remain with the army at the ſiege, in order that the king might avail himſelf of our counſels—while Maria retired with the Counteſs Dalmado to the city of Eceja, to wait the return of her huſband.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not interrupt the thread of my ſtory with a detail of the operations of the army, which perhaps you already know as well as I: but tell you, that here I was informed that you

had periſhed with the other adherents of Count Tranſtamare, with whom the tyrant broke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith ſo wickedly at Toledo. Something, no doubt the ſtings of a guilty conſcience, fretted Peter, and inwardly preyed upon him: naturally ill-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he grew daily worſe, and the noble loyalty of ſubjects never was put to ſo ſevere a trial as in adhering to the cauſe of that weak, worthleſs tyrant.</p>
               <p>For a conſiderable time I had heard nothing from Gonſalvo or my daughter; I began to feel an uneaſineſs unuſual to me, at a neglect for which I was utterly unable to account, when one day I was put under arreſt, and hurried before the king.</p>
               <p>Unconſcious of having committed any offence to merit ſuch a groſs indignity, I was buſied in forming conjectures on the ſtrange event; when going through the camp to the king's pavilion, I heard a herald pronouncing my ſon, Henrico Gonſalvo, a traitor. More at a loſs than before, I diſmiſſed the enquiry into the cauſes from my mind, and only looked to the conſequences, which I determined to endure with that unſhaken fortitude and dignity that became a noble Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the royal pavilion, I found Peter ſeated on his throne, a number of the nobility around him, and, as uſual, the Marquis de Puna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lada at his right hand, in conference with him, while his face appeared convulſed with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

of all the horrid paſſions that ſhake human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtruggling for the maſtery of his ſoul. Perceiving me, he turned abruptly from the Marquis de Punalada, and, addreſſing himſelf to me, ſternly ſaid—When foul rebellion ſtains the branches of a family, and well-founded ſuſpicion falls upon the chief ſtock, what reparation does juſtice to an injured monarch demand—what meaſures do his ſecurity require? Say, Baron de Rayo! I ſpeak to you.</p>
               <p>When treaſon or diſloyalty is proved againſt the houſe of Rayo, my liege lord, returned I, myſelf will be the firſt to pronounce the ſentence of the ſevereſt rigour, and call the execution of it juſtice.</p>
               <p>That baſe diſſimulation (interrupted Peter furiouſly) which, under the plau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>None, anſwered I, but the diſloyal and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ever found an enemy in, or had cauſe to fear danger from, our houſe—and who but your majeſty dares accuſe us of it? Let the villain ſlanderer, be he who he may, come forth, and my life ſhall be the pledge that I refute the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

family of Rayo to claim from the crown of Caſtile.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou then, diſſembler as thou art, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the king, pretend ignorance? Why fled thy rebel ſon, and joined the cauſe of Tranſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare? Knoweſt thou nought of this? or wilt thou preſume to ſay, that he who knew no thought but thine, who moved but by thy guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and yielded to no impulſe but the impulſe of thy ſpirit, ſhould have taken ſuch a ſtep without thy knowledge and concurrence? Thy nephew too preceded him in his rebellion: but he has paid the forfeit of his crime, and ſo ſhalt thou; we will ſhew the proud Rayo that to offend us is ſome danger, and that, as we raiſed, ſo we can lay his honours in the duſt.</p>
               <p>Gracious God! what was my indignation!—Rage for ſome time deprived me of ſpeech, almoſt of ſenſe.

Yet, ere I go, ſaid I, let me, in preſence of theſe noble barons, exculpate myſelf from a charge the bare thoughts of which raiſe in my ſoul ſcorn, abhorrence, and indignation. Here my feelings, like a torrent ſuddenly contracted, overbore my reaſon, and I added, Diſclaiming all attachment and reſpect to him who wrongs me, and aims a deadly blow at my well-earned ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, I declare that merely to ſatisfy my peers I ſtoop to this vindication. Though Peter may have his own reaſons for doubting the allegiance of any of his ſubjects, the virtues of Rayo might ſhield him from the charge of diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>I then turned to the knights and nobles. Peter, weak, wicked creature, biting his lips with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal agitation—My lord, ſaid I, why my ſon has diſappeared I cannot conjecture, nor did I know that event (if it has happened, which I yet doubt) till I came into this preſence: that he has gone over to the army of our adverſaries I cannot believe, as I know that his allegiance to the throne was equal to my own.

My daughter! Mother of God, exclaimed I, is it poſſible? What new wonders are yet for me to hear? what new myſteries to be unfolded? The barons ſeemed ſtruck with my emotion.</p>
               <p>Yet, my lords, rejoined I, let me turn to my own conduct, and ſhew that I am abuſed.</p>
               <p>At the time that this war broke out, and the king called upon his people to riſe in arms, my years might have exempted me, without impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from the ſervices of war. Grown grey in the ſervice of ſucceſſive kings, dignified with honours, and covered with the rewards of a monarch who knew how to eſtimate my ſervices, I might have ſtayed at home and enjoyed the repoſe neceſſary to my years. Did I then come forth at theſe years to tarniſh all the glories of a well-ſpent life, act the baſe diſſembler's part, and play the hoary fool? I aſk you, my lords, is it poſſible? Yet am I without proof, enquiry, or even a full knowledge of the charge againſt me, treated as a criminal, a criminal againſt myſelf, my fortunes, and my family. Obſerve, my lords, how this ſtory hangs together: if we had determined on the project of which we ſtand accuſed, what hindered us from executing it in a manner, and at a time more ſuitable to our views? Why delay the deſertion to that time and place which alone could render it hazardous? Why ſhould I be left behind? The cloud of myſtery which hangs over it diſqualifies me from ſpeaking as I would do.—But my part muſt

               <p>Here the king broke off my diſcourſe; and, riſing furiouſly, ordered me into confinement. I was hurried out of the pavilion, and the next day was conducted under a ſtrong guard, and lodged a cloſe and ſolitary priſoner in a cell in the tower of Siguenca.</p>
               <p>For a long time I was utterly incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or of entering into an inveſtigation of this unaccountable turn in our affairs: all within was wild chaos, confuſion, and uproar. Time at length began to calm the perturbations of my mind, and the tumults within gradually ſubſided into deliberation I found myſelf, however, as much at a loſs as before—In vain did I turn over every incident of my life, that could, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O my Maria! O my Henry! would I exclaim, where are you, my comforts? Do you ſtill live, or has the ruffian hand of barbarous power aſſailed your precious lives? O gracious Lord of all, if it be ſo, give the guilty to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance

               <p>Thus, day after day and month after month elapſed: having no diverſity of incidents to chequer exiſtence, I had no objects by which to meaſure time, and was uncertain what number of years I paſſed in that dreary manſion. Loſing all hope of reviſiting the world, I almoſt loſt all deſire too, and had laid my account with ending my days in that diſmal priſon; when one night I was viſited by a dream or viſion, and to this hour I cannot determine which. Methought, as I lay in my bed, Gonſalvo called to me. I looked up, and beheld him pale, emaciated, with every appearance of wildneſs and diſtraction in his face and air; I looked at him and wept; then ſtretched forth my hands to embrace him: he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Next morning the impreſſion of this phantaſm was ſo ſtrong upon my ſenſes, that I was almoſt at a loſs to determine whether it was a reality or a dream: while I was in a train of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation on it, the keeper of the priſon entered my chamber—I aſked him whether any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               <p>The coincidence of the dream with this my deliverance made an impreſſion on me difficult to conceive, impoſſible to be deſcribed, I thought I ſaw the finger of Providence pointing out the way to ſome ſtrange and momentous revelation. The tumult of my feelings, ſurpriſe, joy, aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and ſuſpenſe, was more than my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled ſtate could ſupport. I was ſcarcely able to move, and for ſome days was unable to leave Siguenca: when at length I was able, I was at a loſs what way to go; but at laſt determined to ſeek the Marquis de Punalada, of whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for Gonſalvo I entertained no doubt, and who would therefore be moſt likely to give me information of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So recommending myſelf to the Almighty, and beſeeching him to endue me with ſtrength and patience, I again turned my back on Andaluſia. Not being able to travel in the ſtate ſuitable to my rank, the little means I poſſeſſed being juſt exhauſted, and moreover recollecting that it might be prudent for me to paſs as much as poſſible unnoticed, I entered the town of Cordova, equipped myſelf as you ſee, and then proceeded on my journey, living occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally at convents, and on the beneficence of the hoſpitable people of the country. My way was long; and as I walked ſlowly, and was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reſt frequently, it was a conſiderable time before I got to the banks of the Ebro. The night before I reached them, I was viſited by a dream nearly reſembling that which I had in the priſon of Siguenca: Gonſalvo came in as before, and repeated the words, Sire, ſeek my loſt child! As before, I ſtrove to embrace him, when methought he turned from me, uttering a ſigh that ſeemed to ſhake his frame to pieces.—We can no more, he ſaid, and walked away from me; when methought a ghaſtly wound on his head yawned and diſcovered his brains, and the blood ran in a torrent down his back:—My ſoul, which till that minute was a ſtranger to the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027101_0042_0FD33B3C11F820D0"/>
impreſſions of fear, ſunk with horror at the ſight—I trembled, gave a loud and hollow groan, and awoke in an agony.—I ardently longed for the return of day. It came, and brought no conſolation—My dream had baniſhed every gleam of comfort from my ſoul, and left nothing there but gloom, horror, and darkneſs—yet ſhall I own to you, that at intervals the pride of the warrior broke in upon my reveries, and painted to me imaginary proſpects of revenge!</p>
               <p>I traverſed the banks of the Ebro for many leagues, enquiring in vain for the Marquis de Punalada, till I came near that part which once owned me for its lord; a place I ſhould above all others have avoided, were it not for the hopes of ſeeing my grandchild, or at leaſt hearing of him—an indulgence which I deferred only for the purpoſe of being firſt ſatisfied about his father and mother. As I approached, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I felt all the torments of ſuſpenſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. At length, however, I arrived within a ſhort way of the caſtle. It was evening when I knocked at the door of the firſt peaſant's cottage within the boundaries of the lordſhip of Montalto. A ſtranger appeared, who rudely demanded my buſineſs. I told him I deſired to ſee Juan, the man of the houſe. If you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

it was once his, but thank God and my maſter, it is now mine. And pray who is your maſter? The Marquis de Punalada. The Marquis de Punalada! Yes, the Marquis de Punalada. The Baron de Rayo, its former owner, has been put to death for high treaſon, and the king gave that caſtle yonder, and this eſtate, to my maſter: it is not above three days ſince he left it, and went to his other eſtate in Andaluſia. O Heavens! what were my feelings!—How I ſupported them I know not. The circumſtance that Punalada, the ſpecious friend of Gonſalvo, rather than any other perſon, ſhould have got poſſeſſion of our confiſcated property, ſtruck like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, full of reſentment at my abuſe (as I ſuppoſe he thought of himſelf), lifted his arm to ſtrike me—I ſmote him to the ground, and retired. Proceeding haſtily to the next cottage, which was that in which my grandſon was nurſed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an anſwer there to nearly the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>Apprehending that the peaſant, recovering, might collect a number of his lord's vaſſals to aſſiſt him, and fall upon me, in which caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance or expoſtulation would be equally vain, I turned into a wood, and, by a well known path, arrived at a village out of the power of the lord
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027101_0044_0FD33B3F35765720"/>
of the caſtle of Montalto; and calling at a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> my lodging for the night. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined upon getting the beſt information I could, and above all to find out where my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was lodged, I prevailed upon the ſon of my hoſt to go to the caſtle and the contiguous vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and make the neceſſary enquiries. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſoon, and brought me an account that there was not one of the former inhabitants liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the lordſhip; that all were put out, and replaced by ſtrangers; nor could it be found where any of them went.</p>
               <p>You will allow that nothing could be now added to the meaſure of my afflictions; it was already running over. Loſt, then, I exclaimed—loſt indeed, my Gonſalvo! My Maria! loſt is thy child! I fear, yourſelves too!

Here, ſtifled with rage, and burſting with the ſwellings of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, I fell on the floor in a ſtate of inſenſibility,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:027101_0045_0FD33B48A1C9E318"/>
to which a languor ſucceeded that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability tended to ſave me from the more acute effects of my paſſion. The good people of the cottage, much affected with my emotions, uſed every little art to conſole me, execrating the wretches who could aim a blow at a head ſo white as mine. Urged by their repeated ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, I at length took ſome food and went to bed: here, ſleep, which uſually flies from the touch of the unhappy, led on by fatigue, viſited me. Still I was haunted with the former dream, with little variation; and determined to purſue, as far as I could, the admonition. I therefore firſt repaired to Toledo, to enquire of the chief officers of Henry Tranſtamare's army, whether Gonſalvo had gone over; and after a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute inveſtigation, found that no ſuch event had ever taken place: I thereupon reſolved to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf to the direction of Providence, and ſearch for my children, either till I found them or loſt my life. Under this determination I firſt viſited the court of Navarre, then that of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; thence croſſed Spain over again to the kingdom of Arragon: finding no trace any where of the objects of my purſuit, I formed the deſperate reſolution of going to the Mooriſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of Grenada, on the bare poſſibility of Gonſalvo's having been by ſome unlucky means enſlaved by the Infidels. Two years weary tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, ſupported by the alms of the charitable,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:027101_0046_0FD33B4A5DB8D748"/>
could not deter me from my purpoſe: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turned my face that way, and proceeded, ſupported by the hope which the frequent viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my dream had inſenſibly inſpired me with. The ſecond night I took up my lodging among the charitable fathers of a Franciſcan monaſtery. I informed them of my intention, giving them at the ſame time my reaſons for it, and diſcloſing to them the whole of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. One of them, a grave, wiſe and learned man, undertook to diſſuade me from it: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the diſappearance of my ſon and daughter happened in a place and at a time that the Moors could not, by any poſſibility, have been inſtrumental to it: he ſaid, that he thought the much greater probability was, that they had been, for ſome hidden purpoſe, cut off by the cruel hand of Peter; and that by going to Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, I ſhould only bring down additional miſery on myſelf, and loſe the ſmall probability there was of recovering or finding out my grandchild; and he finally adviſed (in which all agreed with him) that I ſhould rather go to Toledo, apply to the Archbiſhop, and through him get an order of government to ſearch for them. I perceived that the eagerneſs of my deſires had confounded my judgment, and that I had, in the flame of purſuit, overlooked ſeveral material objections to my plan. That night I went to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Methought I immediately went forth on the deſired ſearch—I walked with difficulty up a ſteep hill: at length I thought I got into a field where two armies were drawn out in preparation for engagement; the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded a charge, the martial clangour filled my ſoul with a tranſport not to be deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I wielded my lance, and was heſitating which ſide of the ſcales I ſhould throw my weight into, when methought you, Sir Iſidor, ſtept forward to me and ſaid, Noble Rayo, Iſidor de Haro will give your children to your arms or periſh in the attempt: with that I thought you vaniſhed, but ſoon returned, and advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me ſmiling, preſented me a golden hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met in which was laid my child, my Alphonſo: I ſuddenly graſped the helmet, and ſnatched the child to my boſom, when looking down, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the helmet falling had killed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who lay bleeding in agony on the ground.

               <p>I aroſe early next morning and ſet forward on my way to the court of Henry, with an intention to aſcertain the fact, whether you were dead or not; and I confeſs I was ſtartled at the apparent paſt derangement of my mind, which could ſo long have dwelt upon my miſery without thinking of ſo obvious a remedy as this probably offered.

Don Alvarez, I had frequent opportunities of converſing with Donna Iſabella, and found that her mind was as highly gifted with wit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with knowledge, as her perſon was with beauty.—Not to trouble you with a detail of minute circumſtances, intereſting only to the parties concerned; we conceived a reciprocal tenderneſs for each other, and I obtained her conſent to demand her in marriage from her father, and to that end to aſk the aſſiſtance of Don Alvarez; but as her father was of a very high rank and proud diſpoſition, and I at the time but a ſoldier of fortune, it was determined that I ſhould wait until my ſervices entitled me to rank, which in the ſcene we were then going to, was likely ſoon to happen. We privately plighted our faith to each other, and parted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Whatever his private feelings on my opening the buſineſs to him might have been, he affected to take my propoſal in good part, but told me that to the King and Queen Dowager Maria I muſt make my ſuit, as they had honoured the young lady with their patronage, and had taken to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the taſk of providing for her a ſuitable alliance.</p>

               <p>I was much ſurpriſed to ſee the king knit his brows, and diſcover manifeſt marks of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure during the latter part of my ſpeech.—When I had done, Don Iſidor de Haro, ſaid he, we have been pleaſed with thy ſervices to our royal father, and have given thee proofs of our approbation—but think no more of this lady as you value our favour—we have already provided her with a ſuitable match—our royal word i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This opportunity ſoon offered. I informed her of the king's reſolution—of my determination to retire, and wait for a more favourable time to complete our wiſhes: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured her to be firm in rejecting any propoſals of marriage from another quarter, and aſſured her that it was my determination to take her from under the tyrant's power or periſh in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.

               <p>When I reached Toro, where Henry was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his forces, he received me with open arms, expreſſed an earneſt wiſh that Baron Rayo and Gonſalvo would ſhake off their attachment to the tyrant, and join him; but aſſured me, that as he well knew the refined principle upon which the Baron adhered to the reigning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and the rigid honour and integrity which governed his actions—let the event of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt be what it would, he and his family ſhould be protected.

thus tyrannically cut off from every thing that could render life ſupportable to me; I was ſtung to the quick at the thoughts of Iſabella's being put into the hands of a rival; and as ſtrength increaſed, the vigour of my mind increaſing alſo, I began to examine the grounds of my deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and found that much of it was owing to a momentary awe, impreſſed upon me by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and known relentleſs nature of the tyrant Peter, and the conſequent depreſſion of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: I began to cenſure my too eaſy acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, bluſhed for the meanneſs of my conduct, and heartily ſcorned myſelf for the abject dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of the duty I owed to my own happineſs, and to the faith I plighted to my Iſabella. All allegiance to Peter was caſt off—my fortunes were inſeparably connected with thoſe of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamare, which, though at preſent clouded, were far from extinguiſhed; the wickedneſs of Peter himſelf being a more powerful engine in his favour than all the hoſts of France. With this proſpect, ſuch as it was, I thought I ſhould be content, could I only get poſſeſſion of my Iſabella. I ſhould have told you, that on the rupture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Queen Mother and Peter, ſhe retired to her father's houſe: one difficulty only there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay in my way, but that was to all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance an almoſt inſuperable one; the probability being, that as Peter had cruſhed the confederacy, her father would not merely refuſe his conſent, but uſe every ſtratagem to deliver me up to the

tyrant: I determined, however, to leave no means uneſſayed on my part, and to truſt the reſt to the affection of my Iſabella and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Providence.</p>
               <p>Having thus adjuſted the matter in my mind, I recroſſed the Guadiana, and, diſguiſed in the dreſs of a common Piſano, turned by the moſt unfrequented ways back through Spain towards Talavera, at a ſmall diſtance from which, but where particularly I did not know, her father had his abode. After ſome days weary travelling, I found myſelf near Talavera; and, in order to get proper information, determined to ſtop at the firſt cottage I came to. It was not long till one offered of a moſt inviting appearance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>In a fit of rapture, I threw my arms round my faithful Pierrot, whoſe joy was nearly as great as my own, and who, while I was dreſſing myſelf, told me, in his disjointed conſequential manner, at which I ſhould on another occaſion have laughed, that the nurſe mentioning her young lady's name, and he aſking her, if ſhe ever heard of mine, declared, that I had been almoſt the only ſubject of converſation between them for ſome time; and that ſhe ſpoke of me as of a perſon already her huſband.</p>

She had not long retired, when we heard the outer door open, and a perſon enter—a confuſed, indiſtinct buzzing of female voices ſucceeded, and continued for ſome minutes; at length I heard a well-known voice—a voice more raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my ears than ſeraphs ſongs. Is it poſſible! gracious God, is it poſſible! Is my Iſidor in this

houſe?—Unable to contain myſelf, I burſt from the room, and caught her in my arms—Yes, my love, my faithful, my adored Iſabella, your Iſidor is here; and this bleſſed, joyful interview is more than a recompenſe for ages of affliction. Oh my Iſabella, didſt thou but know what pangs, what ſufferings mine have been!</p>
               <p>Here I was interrupted by the old woman with, I do not know, young Senor, what your ſufferings may have been, but many and many a tear has my young lady here, in this very ſpot, ſhed over your name; and even I, who did not know you, was fain to keep her company—ſhe did ſo take on—But, Lord, Sir! I hope you will go fighting no more—fighting is a woundy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, unchriſtian like thing, and no luck can come of it; and then my lady trembles ſo at the very thoughts of it, that I wonder how you could have the heart to ſet about it.</p>
               <p>The old woman's gabble was a very ſeaſonable relief to Iſabella, who had ſunk into my arms in a ſoft, ſpeechleſs delirium of joy and ſurpriſe—As ſoon as cool reflection reſumed its ſeat, I told her every thing that occurred, as I have already told it to you, and deſired her advice upon the ſteps neceſſary to be taken to ſecure our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The diviſion between Queen Maria and her ſon Peter, ſhe ſaid, had not altered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the latter: and ſhe candidly confeſſed, that ſhe had received her father's poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to entertain Gareias <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhe was convinced all attempts to alter his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would be vain, and that my diſcovering myſelf would certainly be attended with utter ruin. Under thoſe circumſtances, ſhe ſaid ſhe was at a loſs what to adviſe—but knowing my honour, and convinced of my ſincerity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, was willing to adopt any meaſure that I ſhould preſcribe to her.</p>
               <p>We now called the old nurſe into conſultation, and after ſome deliberation it was agreed, that we ſhould be married the next morning at the cottage, and that the enſuing night ſhe ſhould leave her father's unobſerved and join me at the cottage, whence we ſhould immediately depart, and take ſhelter in Arragon, till I could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence where Count Tranſtamare had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Early next morning the old woman diſpatched her huſband to a neighbouring village for a prieſt, who lived there, to prevail on him to come to the cottage and perform the ceremony; and, in the mean time, ſent away a young lad, her ſon, to the town of Talavera, under pretence of getting medicines for her gueſt, who feigned ſickneſs for the purpoſe, in order that he ſhould be no interruption, nor ſuſpect what was going forward.

was wanting now but the bride: with eager eyes I traced the path ſhe was to come—I grew uneaſy—then impatient—at laſt my heart ſunk into deſpair.—At length ſhe appeared—Oh my Iſabella! ſaid I, in a tone of tender reproach, my heart was dying within me—the day was ſo far advanced, I began to fear you were detained. Thou dear impatient, ſaid ſhe, doſt thou know that it is not yet eight o'clock? Such are the thorny feelings, ſuch the hopes and fears of true love. But why do I trouble you with a fooliſh detail of uſeleſs in intereſting trifles?</p>
               <p>Oh, proceed with it, ſaid the Baron—be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, be particular—the moſt refined intellectual ſenſation, the moſt exquiſite delight, is that which ariſes from a nice inveſtigation of the virtuous paſſions. Always an admirer of beauty—always the friend of love—age has not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my admiration of the one, nor my eſteem for the other; and I declare, that no part of your ſtory has afforded me ſo much pleaſure as the deſcription of your paſſion and fondneſſes for your amiable Iſabella.</p>
               <p>Ah, Baron! returned Don Iſidor, amiable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! had you but known her—had that bliſs but been reſerved for me, to ſee you claſp her in your fond parental arms, and beſtow your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>Hold, Iſidor, interrupted the baron—Have I not griefs enough already? Would'ſt thou that this too was added to the load? Alas! I fear,

nay I feel, that I ſhall but too much deplore her loſs upon the ſtrength of thy deſcription; to loſe her, when known, might have been too much:—but go on, my child! I interrupt you.</p>
               <p>To proceed, we were married in preſence of the old couple, their daughter, who attended on Iſabella, and my honeſt Pierrot; who, perhaps, in exceſs of joy fell not ſhort of ourſelves: he muſed, he capered, he cried and laughed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; and when the knot was tied, his reaſon overcome by the overflowing of his heart, he dropped on his knees as Iſabella's feet, and, ſnatching her hand, kiſſed it as if he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it—wept till he wetted it—and called her his maſter's ſaviour!</p>
               <p>The prieſt gave me a proper certificate of our marriage, and departed, after having given us the moſt ſolemn aſſurances of ſecrecy. Iſabella returned to her father's houſe, and I retired to my room in a ſtate of delicious tranſport that I was before a ſtranger to.

of the king his father's memory. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being extremely ill and weak after her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-in, it was thought expedient to put the child out to nurſe; and as we were to go to France, and it was neceſſary to leave the child behind, we diſpatched Pierrot to Iſabella's old nurſe at Talavera, to procure one ſhe could depend on there, in order to be under her eye. The child accordingly was given to the woman ſent by her with Pierrot, and who went back attended again by him, furniſhed with a ſufficient ſum for three years expences, to be delivered to the old woman for reimburſement.</p>
               <p>The anguiſh at parting with this dear firſt pledge of our loves was unutterable; my wife's particularly was ſo extreme, that ſhe could ſcarce ſupport it, and ſhe proceeded to Paris with a heart foreboding an eternal ſeparation from her child.</p>
               <p>Of the various fortunes of Count Tranſtamare, in his ſtruggling for the throne with Peter, as you muſt already know them, I need not inform you, more particularly as it would break in upon the thread of my ſtory; ſuffice it to ſay, I was with him in all, and even when domeſtic ſorrow made me unfit for the world, I attended him.</p>
               <p>The ſun of my bridal roſe with brightneſs, but was, alas! eclipſed in its meridian—My wife had two children in the three years following the birth of Alphonſo, who both died infants: in the fifth year ſhe again proved pregnant—fatally

               <p>WHEN Alphonſo withdrew after dinner, he was accoſted by Pierrot with, Don Alphonſo—ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by a ſignificant wink and beck of his hand, as who ſhould ſay, Follow me—I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to communicate to you. Alphonſo follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Pierrot led him through the yard—then looking about to ſee if the place was ſufficiently ſecure from obſervation, he led him into the garden; thence again, with the ſame precaution, into the vineyard, and thence into the field of exerciſe; then leading him into the very middle, as remote as poſſible from any place of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where liſteners might ſtand, leſt poſſibly ſome perſon might be there to hear what he was about to ſay—taking Alphonſo by a button, and ſtaring full in his face, with a look of infinite ſagacity and importance, he ſaid in a whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, Don Alphonſo, do you know this oh! harper in the great hall?

How ſhould my father know him, ſince he has not ſeen him many hours? I will tell you what it is, maſter—but to be ſure it may by a ſilly thing I am going to ſay—No matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the youth, ſay it, whatever it may be.—Well, then, to be ſure, I may be wrong—but my mind miſgives me ſtrangely.—What would you ſay? Don't fear—I ſhall never mention it, ſpeak out. As I hope for mercy, the ſight of the old harper made my hair ſtand on end; nay, the thought of him now makes my blood run in my body, and I wiſh he was well away from the houſe. Why, what doſt thou mean? ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo. I mean that—but—well I don't know how to ſay it. Say it, be what it may, returned Alphonſo. Well, your honour has often heard Don Iſidor talk of the Baron de Rayo—he was a good man to be ſure, but that is no matter—I don't like to have any thing to do with the dead! Well, you muſt know that this Baron within—I—I mean he that's like him—he, I ſay, was in the tower of Siguenca for high treaſon—put there by that villain Peter; and there he died, or, as ſome ſay, was put to death, by the orders of that devil in grain, whom Chriſt pardon!—Don Iſidor took on ſo about him, and uſed to ſigh and groan for him; and no wonder, for he was a father to him.

ſaid he, clapping one hand on the top of his head, and the other under his chin, is this head I hold in my hands, mine or not? Certainly it is, Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot. Then, as ſure as it is, the old harper in the hall is the ghoſt of the Baron Rayo, who died in the tower of Siguenca—it is at leaſt his fetch! Body o' me!

Lord! your honour's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who does not fear the devil himſelf (St. John be our guard!) was as much afraid of the Baron as a mouſe of a cat—he was ſo grand; and it ſurpriſes me that Don Iſidor does not know him, for all his coarſe great coat, leathern belt, and long beard; but to be ſure he is blinded by ſome charm. For my part, I know not what to do—I am afraid to tell Don Iſidor, and I am afraid to let him remain unknown in the houſe, for God and his Holineſs the Pope alone can tell what his deſigns may be—and though he was dearly fond of maſter, when alive, who knows how the other world may turn his heart!</p>
               <p>Pierrot, ſaid Alphonſo, keep this ſecret entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to yourſelf; on no account, let it go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I will go in and take proper means to find all out, and let you know—mean time, be ſecret, I charge you.</p>

               <p>Alphonſo immediately flew into Don Iſidor's cloſet, to diſcloſe to him and the Baron the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation between him and Pierrot; and in order to make them more cheerful, he told them the whole as it paſſed, but in a manner ſo pleaſant and humorous, that they both, for the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Baron recollected the name of Pierrot, when Don Iſidor mentioned him in his ſtory, but as he was ſince advanced into years, he did not notice him when attending at dinner. It was agreed however to undeceive him with regard to the Baron's death—to let him know the truth, and bind him down to ſecrecy. For this purpoſe he was called into the cloſet: as ſoon as he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Baron advanced towards him, and with a deep and tremendous tone ſaid to him, Friend, this youth informs me—Here Pierrot ſtood tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed with horror—his face pale, his noſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Yes, yes, your honour, ſaid Pierrot, haſtily—I did ſay to Don Alphonſo, as how I thought that your worſhip was—was—ſomething—that is a little like the deceaſed worthy Baron de Rayo. Here the Baron took his hand, which he, his mouth yawning wide with exceſs of horror, endeavoured to withdraw, and preſſing it gently, ſaid, And why not the Baron himſelf, Pierrot?

Well, then, ſaid Don Iſidor, you now know the Baron to be living, and have no further cauſe for fear; ſo make it your buſineſs to ſee that he is properly attended, and ſerved with the reſpect ſuitable to his dignity.

               <p>Not at all, returned the Baron; he fears not men, becauſe his ſenſes are competent to judge of the danger, and apportion the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to it; in which caſe a boldneſs of nature gives him confidence, and make him eſtimate his own proweſs at the higheſt: but, in the caſe of ſpirits, his ſoul inſtinctively confeſſes the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of ſuch beings, from falſe conception, or early habit; attributes to them miſchievous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; while, being out of the compaſs of his ſenſe, he cannot eſtimate their power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fears them.

               <p>The early part of John's reign afforded the young Alphonſo, ample occaſion to diſplay his military talents:—in various encounters with the forces of Portugal, he carried victory along with him in almoſt every engagement. And on the deſertion of one of John's chief confidential offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whoſe intelligence and knowledge of the Caſtilian army's ſituation might have given a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided advantage to the enemy, he purſued him to the hoſtile army, broke through a large body of them who ſurrounded the fugitive, ſeized him, and bore him through them triumphantly on his ſaddle, back to the Caſtilian camp: when this prodigy of valour and proweſs was announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the king, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Stung to the quick at the progreſs Alphonſo made in the king's affections, and burning with envy of his ſuperior accompliſhments, he conceived the moſt implacable hatred againſt him, and wiſhed for nothing ſo much as the deſtruction of his new rival his chagrin became viſible; his mother queſtioned him upon it, and he heſitated not to tell her the cauſe.

               <p>It was a cuſtom with the king to make parties of hunting, in which the ladies and gentlemen of the court attended him; on ſuch occaſions they generally entered a great way into the depths of the foreſts, where game was moſt plenty, and there pitched tents for their accommodation. As it was now the ſeaſon, the king ordered prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be made, invited a number of the gentry to attend him, among the reſt Alphonſo, Don Rodrigo and his mother. On the firſt day of hunting a large boar was ſtarted, which the king purſued, and overtaking, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The king mean-time had diſenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf: Alphonſo, by a ſudden and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpring, got from the boar before he could make another effort, and meeting him with his ſpear killed him on the ſpot.

With difficulty he anſwered, If hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo worthleſs a thing as the life of Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, to ſave that on which the glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a nation depend, lays any claim to merit, I am overpaid by the ſucceſs of the attempt: do not then heap on me a weight I cannot ſupport, by thanking me for doing that which was my duty.

To this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigo objected, that his doing ſo might raiſe ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious in the mind of John, for that he was ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Alphonſo, nothing leſs than poſitive evidence could ſhake him in his favour.</p>
               <p>The mother aware of this circumſtance, as well as her ſon, how thought that an anonymous let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be the beſt and ſafeſt way to try the temper of the king on the buſineſs.

                  <p>A ſon of that traitor to the crown of Caſtile, the fugitive Henrico Gonſalvo, is now, under the falſe name of De Haro, near your ſacred perſon: the old viper has eluded juſtice—cruſh the young one ere it ſting you.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as the king received this letter, his eſteem for Alphonſo directly ſuggeſted to him the truth, that it was the work of ſome envious enemy; he therefore ſent for Don Juan de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla, and, firſt ſhewing him the letter, told him his ſentiments of it.</p>

               <p>Alphonſo appearing much concerned, Don Juan earneſtly enquired if the plan was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to him.</p>

The king then preſenting him a paper to be delivered to Don Juan, and putting a coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ring upon his finger, bid him adieu.</p>
               <p>He waited on Don Juan immediately; who reading the paper, told him that it was an order to pay him two thouſand plaſtres for the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his journey.</p>

               <p>Then, ſaid Pierrot, if it muſt be ſo, it muſt be ſo; come on, then—do as you like; it ſhall never be ſaid that Pierrot lagged behind; or that, when hell was broke looſe, he could not ſtand fire as well as another.—No, no, if Pierrot be not as well able as e'er an Alphonſo in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

in which he had ſpent his night, and cloſe to them, a building which, from having a belfry, he concluded to be a convent: beyond this, he thought he ſaw, though indiſtinctly, marks of unuſual cultivation; he therefore diſmounted, and with much pains clambered up the rocks behind, from whence he could perceive a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent caſtle, with turrets, moa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I will go though it were to the mouth of hell—But I would almoſt as ſoon loſe my life at once—nay, I am ſure I ſhould never live to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you again. Well, then, generous Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot, returned Alphonſo, I will not command, nor even permit you to go; but we will ride up through the wood to thoſe goatherds who ſit on the hill beyond it, and they perhaps will inform us. Overjoyed to be releaſed from the viſit to the caſtle, Pierrot approved of the propoſal with alacrity, and they arrived at the verge of the wood, which was ſo thick, that a perſon on horſeback could not make way through it; they therefore rode along it, and at laſt came to a path or rather narrow road, which from its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſeemed to lead up the hill: by this path, after many windings and turnings, he got to the open ſpace on the top, where he ſaw, not far from him the goatherds ſitting at their breakfaſt. He rode up to and accoſted them with his uſual courteſy, which they returned by inviting him to take a ſhare of their fare. He felt himſelf not diſinclined to eat, and alighting ſat down cheerfully to a meal of bread and oranges, with ſome poor wine: while he was making a hearty repaſt upon thoſe, he enquired what the name of that beautiful valley was, and whoſe was the caſtle? when the eldeſt of the goatherds obliged him with the following <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Goatherd's Story.</head>
               <p>I AM now old, and have all my life followed the buſineſs of a goatherd, and of courſe muſt have ſeen vaſt numbers of beautiful places; but never have I ſeen any place to equal in beauty this very ſpot of Valleſanto; and this, Senor, all men will tell you, was its reputation time out of mind; and the richneſs of its paſtures, the coolneſs of its air, the plenty of its proviſions, the content of its inhabitants, the ſanctity of its convent, and the virtues of the family who were lords of it, made it the topic of converſation in all neighbouring parts. The preſent lord of all the country you ſee round is the Marquis de Punalada, almoſt as old as myſelf: he came to the poſſeſſion of the eſtate and caſtle at an early age, and, was beloved by all who knew him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his fame was not confined to this valley, for there were few in Spain who did not hear of and acknowledge his greatneſs. He married a lady his equal in rank, reputation, and fortune; but in charity, piety, and all the virtues that diſtinguiſh Chriſtians, ſuperior to all the men and women of her day. They lived long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the greateſt happineſs, and had two children, a ſon and a daughter; and all the poor
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027101_0127_0FD33BEFAD16E860"/>
rejoiced in the proſpect of finding one day, in the virtues of the children, a continuation of the advantages they had already derived from the charity of their forefathers. Soon after the birth of thoſe children, the Marquis was called on by the king to attend him to the wars—ſo he went, leaving his lady and family behind him, and from that time Valleſanto began to decay. Captivated by the king's favour, he grew proud, and forgot his good lady and children at home. However, at laſt he did come—but ſo different a man in his conduct from what he had been, that no one would have believed him to be the ſame perſon.—The dear Marchioneſs took it ſorely to heart, and died ſuddenly—and he again was ſo affected at her death that he hid from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, betook himſelf entirely to the convent, and many ſaid that he was going to take the cow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> However, after ſome time he quitted it, and took his children to a diſtant part where the king had given him a large eſtate; and then there were reports that my lady's ſpirit appeared at night, and made the caſtle uneaſy to him: be that as it may, he came here but ſeldom, and for years the children remained at his other eſtate. However, at laſt he removed them here; and the cauſe that was aſſigned for it was ſo extraordinary, that it I had not had it from one of his own domeſtics I ſhould not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

—it was with a picture! It was ſaid to be the picture of ſome man dead God knows how long. However, this did not ſatisfy the young lady, but ſhe muſt go to a Hadador,<note n="*" place="bottom">A fortune-teller.</note> who told her, that whenever ſhe ſhould ſee a man who reſembled that picture, the houſe of Puna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lada would tumble to the ground. Some of her attendants informed the Marquis of this predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in conſequence of which he hurried her off here, and ſhut her up in a chamber of the caſtle, where ſhe was watched with the utmoſt vigilance: no one had acceſs to her but the Marquis, the Father Prior of the convent, her brother, and ſome old domeſtics; for, having in his fury ordered the picture to be burnt, he had nothing to give the ſervants as a guide; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, had he kept the picture, he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all comers with it, and ſo perhaps kept off danger. As misfortunes ſeldom come alone, the Marquis perceived a new turn in the caſtle, which threatened not only ſorrow but ſhame: in ſhort, he found that my young lord, his ſon, had fallen violently in love with his ſiſter, and was abandoned enough to make odious propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to her. The unhappy young lady, to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herſelf, told the Marquis, who directly put her into the convent; while he himſelf, racked with ſome inward affliction, ſhut himſelf from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> intercourſe but with the Padre Prior. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time people gave their tongues a looſe, and talked ſtrangely; the place, even the convent,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027101_0129_0FD33BF2AC7F5798"/>
was ſaid to be haunted; a chapel, in which maſs was ſometimes celebrated, was ſhut up and let to run to ruin: in ſhort, Senor, nothing but misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, affliction, and bad luck, has for many years attended the family and the place; and the neighbouring goatherds have forſaken the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley upon account of frightful appearances that haunt it.</p>
               <p>Do you mind that, Senor? interrupted Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot—Why, good man, as his worſhip and I were laſt night—Alphonſo darted an angry look at him, and he was ſilent.</p>
               <p>As for matter of that, continued the goatherd, who obſerved Alphonſo, the man can tell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new, ſo your honour need not have any ſcruples—there is more talk than you think of—and in truth the Marquis is now for his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wickedneſs, and moroſeneſs, more diſliked and ſuſpected than he ever was beloved; for though we of this place be poor, we have clear conſciences, and worſhip God and our Redeemer, and ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Caſtilians, thank God, are good Chriſtians, and would not barter with the devil, though they were to gain worlds and their wealth by the bargain. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this ſtrange ſtory, the young man, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the devil—abandoning all ſenſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and virtue, and running counter to the courſe of nature, finding himſelf unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on his ſiſter to indulge an inceſtuous paſſion

for him, determined to enjoy her by force or ſtratagem; and to this end, with large gifts and great promiſes, bribed a ſervant who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her to aid his deſigns, and, as ſhe ſince confeſſed, to put a ſleepy doſe in her drink, and let him in at night.—As God, who directs things for the protection of the innocent and the puniſhment of the guilty, would have it, all his plans turned to his own ruin. Her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was in the uppermoſt ſtory of the convent, and looked into a court-yard: by means of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe bribes he found his way into the yard, while his accomplice, the lady's ſervant maid, let down a ladder made of ſilk, which he had ſupplied her with, and which ſhe faſtened above to one of the iron bars of the window. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended—but juſt as he got near the window, the ladder gave way, he tumbled headlong down, and was caught on the pikes of the rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing below—meantime the jade above threw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In the morning his lordſhip was found dead—the Marquis was with difficulty prevented from ſlaying himſelf: an enquiry was ſet on foot, and the holy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood extorted from the wretch a confeſſion. Soon after the Marquis brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>

By the time that the goatherd had finiſhed his ſtory Don Alphonſo had eaten his breakfaſt; when riſing, and in the moſt courteous terms thanking them for their hoſpitality, and the old man in particular for his ſtory, he mounted his horſe, and being directed in his road, took his departure, having ordered Pierrot to give each of them a piece of money, and the old man five.</p>
               <p>They had not gone far, when Pierrot taking advantage of his maſter's indulgence began—And now, Senor, what think you of this ſame Marquis de Punalada? Is it not better a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times to be dead than lead ſuch a life as he does? And I warrant he is more careful of it too than you or I of ours, and ſo it ſeems by his watching—and does not that ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The greateſt king in Chriſtendom could not give life to a frog or a blade of graſs—what muſt he be then who takes away the life of a Chriſtian? Yet, God help us! ſuch is the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the world, that nothing gets a man ſo great a name as killing another—and the more he kills, and greater is his honour, as you call

it! Ah, Don Alphonſo! quit this life of war, and lead one of bleſſed peace, as a true Chriſtian ſhould do.</p>
               <p>Upon my word, Pierrot, I muſt allow that you apophthegmatize moſt ingeniouſly, but I cannot ſee how that which you have ſaid could ariſe from the ſubject we were talking of.</p>
               <p>What! Does not your honour think that the Marquis has been guilty of murder? The way he lives—the haunting of the place—beſides, while the old man was telling you his ſtory, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of the goatherds told me as much as made my blood run cold—I may be wrong to be ſure, but I would not for all the eſtates and caſtles in Andaluſia have the conſcience of the Marquis.</p>
               <p>At laſt they got into the high road, and early that evening arrived at Cordova. Here Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo found himſelf divided between two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and debated with himſelf whether he ſhould directly proceed to court to the king, or go to his father's, to throw himſelf at his feet, and, in conformity to the monition in the dream, to conſult the Baron. After ſome deliberation, he determined to truſt rather to the tenderneſs of a father than the caprice of a court, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly went ſtraight to Burgos, from whence he diſpatched the two following letters by Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot:</p>

               <p>Alphonſo was received with every mark of tenderneſs by the king, who informed him, that the author of the anonymous letter was too wary to fall into the trap projected for him—but that he was fully convinced Don Rodrigo and his mother were at the bottom of it. In little more than a week after he had diſpatched the letters to his father and the Baron, he had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſeeing them at Burgos.

Don Iſidor was delighted—he once again ſaw that Baron Rayo that uſed at once to impreſs him with love and awe; and his ſoul again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the pleaſing neceſſity of obedience. All ſhall be done, Baron, ſaid he: need I ſay that my hand, heart, and life, are devoted to the accompliſhment of your deſire? Yes, yes, ſaid the Baron, ſtriding acroſs the room; the ſtains, the ſorrows, the diſgraces, the murders, that have brought the houſe of Rayo to the ground, though they cannot be repaired, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged—moſt horribly revenged—and this arm ſhall be the inſtrument!</p>
               <p>But, dear Baron, interrupted Don Iſidor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this riſing choler—overcome thoſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which indulged may perhaps be the means of fruſtrating your views.</p>

               <p>Don Iſidor was ſilent—Alphonſo felt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual trepidation.—The Baron ſeemed to tread in air.</p>
               <p>Pierrot was again ſent back to Duero, with a letter to Father Thomas, who in eight days more returned, together with Juanico, to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos.

               <p>ON the fifth day they arrived at the entrance of the valley, juſt as the ſun was half-way dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped behind the weſtern hill on which Alphonſo and his ſervant had before breakfaſted with the goatherds. Don Iſidor looked about him as he advanced, wrapt in delight with the beauty of the ſcene—Never, ſaid he, have I ſeen any thing to equal it! They came to a little rill of water clear as the pureſt cryſtal, which ran towards the river—in ſome places forming the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting pools, deep, pellucid, and ſheltered by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This, ſaid he, only this was wanting to make Valleſanto more than terreſtrial; let us croſs it at this ſhallow ford, and ſhelter us from obſervation in yonder clump of trees, while I point out to you the ſituation of the place—They accordingly croſſed the brook, rode up to the clump, in the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Into this, after having diſmounted, they entered, and led their horſes. Alphonſo then brought the Baron, Don Iſidor, and Father Thomas forth, and pointed out to them the perpendicular an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular rock—the moat—and the wood in which was buried the ſcene of their intended opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—The bell tolled—'twas for veſpers—They returned to the thicket, where Father Thomas ſaid maſs, and all joined in prayer.

exclaimed the Baron in a tone of terrific intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity—then turning to them—Haſte you, let us forward—we are called. At length they came near the wall. Beyond this, ſaid Alphonſo, is the pathway—it is difficult to find it—never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I think I cannot fail of knowing it. They walked ſlowly on: I ſee a light, ſaid Don Iſidor in a low voice—let us ſtop—we may be diſcovered.—I ſee it too, ſaid the Baron, but fear it not—it is friendly, let us get on. He then advanced, and broke through the buſhes, his vigour and alacrity ſurpriſing the reſt who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: Father Thomas brought up the rear. Let me, ſaid Alphonſo, go firſt and find out the paſſage. He groped along the wall and ſound out the narrow entrance.—Here it is, ſaid he, follow me.

The Baron then lighted his lamp, and with Father Thomas looked around—This, ſaid the prieſt, is the weſt: here muſt have been the great entrance, and lo! it is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up—This then, ſaid he, moving on, is the north; and what ſhould bring this pile of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh here, I cannot gueſs, for over it there is no mark of ruins.—That we will ſee, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, let us remove it. He then drew a maſſy Mooriſh ſabre from his ſide, and fell to work looſening the rubbiſh, while Alphonſo and Don Iſidor drew it away—At length the ſabre met re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance—What can this be? ſaid the Baron. He worked with his hand, and felt till he found a large chink—he put in the ſabre and raiſed it up—It was a large ſtone—Here have been much pains taken, ſaid he, to jam thoſe ſtones together. By this time he had got to the level of the floor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Baron picked away a layer of ſtones, and found another: he groped again to find a chink but all was ſolid—Alphonſo knelt down and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected it cloſely: it was an immenſe ſtone of four feet in ſurface. We muſt raiſe it, ſaid the Baron: ſee if there be any the ſmalleſt opening in which to inſinuate the point of the ſabre.—I cannot perceive one, ſaid Alphonſo, but here I ſee the upper part of a regular arch.—Where? ſaid the Baron.—Here, juſt where you removed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Having made a way for their hands, they all exerted their ſtrength, lifted it up on one end, and thence turned it over. Underneath was a flight of ſtone ſtairs going downward, filled with rubbiſh. As one only could work in ſo narrow a place, an affectionate ſcuffle enſued who that one ſhould be—Alphonſo and Don Iſidor both inſiſting on the Baron's yielding it to them. They were interrupted by a noiſe—they liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—a ſigh which ſeemed to burſt the boſom that it ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Baron worked with redoubled ardour, throwing up the rubbiſh that obſtructed the ſtairs—Alphonſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him with aſtoniſhment; the alacrity of youth and the ſtrength of Hercules ſeemed united in him.—Here is a door, ſaid he.

Here, ſaid Father Thomas.—Don Iſidor took the knife and deſcended: he cut for ſome time: the impatient Baron ſnatched it from him; the wood ſlew in ſhowers of ſplinters from his hands. At length they made room for their hands, and the Baron, Don Iſidor, and Alphonſo tore it open: it was faſtened by a chain hooked to a ponderous ſtone within.

There muſt be ſome other way that we have not yet ſeen, into this paſſage, ſaid the Baron; for the door by which we entered, as well as this, are bolted on the inſide. They looked attentively on either ſide, and ſaw none. Let us open this then, ſaid the Baron. He opened it, and they found a large extenſive ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern filled with dead bodies in various ſtages of diſſolution, ſome mouldered to duſt, ſome half conſumed, and ſome again in a more offenſive ſtate, of putrefaction, lying on their backs with

Hardly were thoſe words pronounced when their ears were aſſailed with a violent rattling of armour behind them: they ſtarted, and looked round them into the paſſage they had come through. Gracious God! exclaimed Alphonſo, there is the figure. I ſee it, ſaid the Baron, looking at it with a fixed and undiſmayed attention—I ſee it—Oh Iſidor, doſt thou not?—The tears rolled in torrents down his cheeks: he could no more, but uttered a groan that ſeemed to have rent his ſoul from its tenement.

active mind and piercing eye of Alphonſo ended the difficulty: he found a low door, which like the firſt ſhut on the inſide, but was opened with leſs pains: the foul and condenſed air ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth blew out the lamp, and they were again in darkneſs: the young marrow of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo froze with horror, and even Don Iſidor was diſmayed.—The Baron again ſtruck a light, by which they found that they were in a ſmall vault, arched over head, and low.—Alphonſo ſtruck his foot againſt ſomething hard: he took it up: 'twas a ſhort ſabre, the blade of which was ruſty all over, but a large ſpot near the end of the edge emboſſed with a large raiſed incruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ruſt—Take that, ſaid the Baron to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thomas, and keep it by you.

               <p>However, ſaid Don Iſidor, though unlikely, it is not impoſſible: is it not better to proceed by ſuch temperate means as may inſure our work at leaſt from further miſchief? I ſay then, we muſt deſire the interference of the king, and even this muſt be done with caution, for Don Rodrigo is nephew and preſumptive heir to the Marquis; and his mother, who is above all women crafty, may by circumſpection diſcover, and by addreſs defeat us. My advice therefore is, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Burgos, and that Alphonſo gain a private audience of the king, and prevail upon him to grant you a hearing, in which caſe there does not remain a doubt of juſtice being done.</p>
               <p>Father Thomas and Alphonſo added the weight of their opinion to this advice, and the Baron agreed. Meantime, ſaid Don Iſidor, let us take ſome refreſhment, remain here this night to reſt, and early to-morrow ſet forward on our journey.</p>

One day ſauntering down a long lobby in the caſtle, the Marquis ſuddenly opened a room door juſt facing him, ſcreeched, and almoſt fell into fits at the ſight of him.

               <p>I cannot account for it, ſaid Don Iſidor, but I feel a propenſity which I cannot overcome, to go towards the caſtle and take a view of it.

               <p>As ſoon as they had dined, they departed for the caſtle: as they approached it they ſaw, or thought they ſaw, the country become more gloomy; and their imagination, influenced by their opinion of the Marquis, viewed it as a place out off from the goods of Providence, where graſs grew not, and where the affrighted earth drew back into her womb her natural produce, as fearful to truſt it to the hands of ſuch a monſter. They rode along the walls, and perceived that they were ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched behind a deep ditch, over which as they advanced they found a draw bridge drawn up: paſſing further on, they obſerved that the wall turned to the ſouthward, and continuing their route along it ſaw that it joined that of the priory. They turned back again, and as they approached the draw-bridge obſerved three men walking on the wall: on their nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, Don Iſidor courteouſly ſaluting them inquired to whom that noble caſtle belonged.

Young gentleman, ſaid he, though I ſhould be ſorry to break in upon the arrangements or treſpaſs on the privileges of the caſtle, I cannot help entreating that you would have the goodneſs to direct us in the road to Cordova, from which, I know not how, we have inſenſibly diverged; and as the roads about here are rather intricately croſſed and mixed with each other, you would conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the favour by deſcending, and inſtructing us particularly how we may avoid going again aſtray.

The Baron felt a lively emotion of tenderneſs towards him—Don Iſidor not leſs—while Father Thomas had all thoſe ſenſations that a good heart meliorated by Chriſtianity may be ſuppoſed to feel for vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue groaning under oppreſſion.

in the negative, let me be acquitted of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional ingratitude to my protector. I have never gone ſo far before, and I confeſs I am aſtoniſhed to think by what irreſiſtible power your notice of me exacts a confeſſion which I have never made to any one. The Marquis has been kind to me—I owe him every thing, yet am not happy. Why, my child? ſaid the Baron earneſtly. I wiſh, replied the youth, to ſerve my king, and be a ſoldier; but I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: the Marquis (for what reaſon I cannot tell) is averſe to it—it is his will I ſhould not go, and I muſt ſubmit.—Apprehending, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that I have formed a deſign to depart for that purpoſe, without his permiſſion, he has ordered me to keep within the walls of the caſtle, and aſſigned me a guard: but he need not; I think obedience to his will a duty, and no earthly conſideration ſhall make me guilty of a breach of it. Nothing could equal their aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the noble ſentiments and ingenuous ſpirit of ſo young a man. The Baron gazed upon him as if his eyes had loſt their wonted motion—Don Iſidor took him by the hand, preſſed it, and ſaid—Unhappy parents, whoever they are, to have loſt ſuch a ſon; and happy he who has acquired ſuch a one, even by adoption!</p>

Here his colour ſhifted to a deadly pale, and a tear guſhed in ſpite of him from his eyes, while every muſcle of his face ſeemed agitated. In ſhort, Sirs, continued he, to be plain, the Marquis has of late ſo treated me, that every tie of affection is broken, and the only ligament which now remains to bind me to him is gratitude; a bond which no true Chriſtian can break. I truſt that God will grant me the grace never to violate it. Thus have I, Senors, ſeduced by an unaccountable feeling which draws me to you with reſiſtleſs force, deviated from my accumſtomed maxims of ſilence.

My child, for I will call you ſo, ſaid he, I am old, and can inſtruct you; therefore hear me attentively: hope not that time, reaſon, or moral or religious ſentiment can work any change in the Marquis's heart in thy favour. To uſe the helpleſs orphan of his protection with inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and put bonds upon his mind and perſon, ſhews him to poſſeſs a ſoul either naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, or labouring under ſome malignant ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion or hidden animoſity which broods in his heart, but dares not appear: and truſt me, youth, man in intercourſe with man ſeldom reſts at the firſt ſtage of good or evil; but where he confers an unmerited benefit, or offers an unprovoked injury, carries the folly of the one act, or the wickedneſs of the other, to extremes—Never did I know a man that did not delight in foſtering the worſt briar that he had planted; never do I remember a man who could forgive the innocent he had injured.

and I doubted whether I was awake—But to the very laſt I was bewitched; for, if I was not, how could he appear to me to be my maſter Don Iſidor? Why, Pierrot, ſaid Alphonſo, looking earneſtly in his face, are you out of your ſenſes? What ſtrange notion is now running in your precious noddle?</p>
               <p>May I never live, replied Pierrot, if that young cavalier did not appear to me to be the very ſame man that carried away my lady, your mother, from her father's, near Talavera—that married her—that afterwards begat you—and that is now there riding before us! Nay, your honour need not ſtare, for to be ſure it is all bewitchment and ſorcery; for there is nothing about us here but conjurors, magicians, ſpirits, and witches, and I wiſh we were well out of it: nay, for matter of that, I did not like your embracing that young fellow, who, for ought we know, may be ſomething bad, and has taken upon him that handſome ſhape only to hurt and deceive us: indeed, indeed, we ought to turn back, and not go the road he directed us.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as they arrived at the city of Burgos, the Baron, Don Iſidor, Father Thomas, and their attendants, remained at an inn, while Alphonſo went to court. He firſt made it his buſineſs to ſee his patron, Don Juan de Padilla, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to obtain for him a private audience of the king, to whom, he ſaid, he ſhould, in his preſence, unfold a buſineſs no leſs ſurpriſing than horrible. The king, not leſs inclined to oblige his miniſter than to ſerve his favourite, inſtantly granted him the audience, in preſence of Don Juan. Alphonſo began by entreating his majeſty to believe, that nothing leſs than a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the moſt ſerious moment could induce him to call upon his majeſty's attention in ſo very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and urgent a manner.—He plighted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove, to the conviction of the world, one of the moſt execrable conſpiracies that ever was conceived by man in his moſt abandoned wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—a conſpiracy formed againſt the honour, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

—by the intervention of the avenging hand of Heaven. He ſaid, that the affair was ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſo dependent on a variety of proofs, and ſo very difficult of explanation, that it would be neceſſary, as well for his majeſty's eaſe as for the more perfect elucidation of it, to have the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal perſonages of it before his majeſty: and he earneſtly entreated to have the liberty of bringing them on the morrow in attendance before him: one of them was Don Iſidor, his father; another, the Reverend Father Thomas Auguſtino; the third, Baron de Rayo.—How! ſaid Don Juan, Baron de Rayo! Has he not been dead, his eſtates confiſcated, and his titles extinct? That the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's eſtates were confiſcated, and his blood at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by Peter, ſaid Alphonſo, is too true; but it is equally true that he lives, and that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder was taken off by our late king Henry. The conſpiracy and conſequent frauds and murder that led to that—How—murder! exclaimed the king. Even ſo, my liege—moſt foul murder, perhaps worſe, returned Alphonſo: I ſay, and I undertake at the hazard of my life, and, what I value more, your majeſty's favour, to prove that the houſe of Rayo has ſunk beneath the hands of a villain and a murderer!</p>
               <p>This is ſtrong language! ſaid the king.</p>
               <p>It is, my liege, ſaid Don Juan, and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> preſume Alphonſo, ere he uttered it, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to make good.</p>
               <p>Then what is the ſcope of your preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? ſaid the king.</p>
               <p>

That the perſons I have named be permitted, on the morrow, to come before your majeſty, in preſence of Don Juan, and ſuch other perſons as your majeſty may think fit, there to lay before you the whole of this tranſaction.</p>
               <p>I grant it, ſaid the king.</p>
               <p>May your faithful ſervant, ſaid Alphonſo, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſuggeſt the neceſſity of ſecreſy for the preſent; Don Rodrigo is nearly concerned in the event, though not in the guilt.</p>
               <p>Enough, ſaid the king—To-morrow morning at ten o'clock, I will, for greater caution, be at Don Juan's houſe; there we will hear of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary affair.</p>
               <p>On the morning, Alphonſo, attended by Don Iſidor, the Baron, and Father Thomas, repaired to Don Juan's, who received them all with every mark of eſteem, and particularly treated the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron with diſtinguiſhed reſpect: they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon the buſineſs in hand, and Don Juan aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of the king's reſolution to render juſtice to the Baron.</p>
               <p>At the appointed time the king came, and with him the corregidor of Burgos. The king deſired Alphonſo to proceed. Alphonſo entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Baron de Rayo might be permitted to explain the nature of the caſe. The Baron began from the very commencement, and after deprecating the imputation of egotiſm, if he ſpoke of himſelf, which the nature of the caſe demanded, gave a detail of the ſervices of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his family to the ſtate; relating vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:027101_0177_0FD33C51F5570780"/>
victories which had been acknowledged by the reigning kings to have been gained over the enemies of the faith and ſtate, by his valour and wiſdom: for a proof of all which he referred to exiſting records, and living evidence. He then deſcribed the heroiſm and achievements of his ſon; and drew a picture of the ſufferings of him and his daughter, which affected the king ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely: he then adverted to his own miſeries—his impriſonment—wanderings—wants—and finally his reception by Don Iſidor.</p>
               <p>Here Alphonſo took up the affair, with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the incidents at Valleſanto.</p>
               <p>Don Iſidor then began with the ſtory of the ſearch—and laſtly, Father Thomas produced the ring, ſabre, crucifix, and dagger, and the papers found in the portmanteau, ſealed up; all of which they jointly and ſeverally ſwore to.</p>
               <p>Don Juan was aſtoniſhed.—He ſaid, that the leading circumſtances of the tale tallied exactly with facts in his recollection. He was intimate with Gonſalvo—knew his device—believed it was his ring—would certainly know his armour, as they had often fought together—and he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly recollected, that the Marquis de Punalada ſuddenly retired from court ſoon after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance of Gonſalvo.</p>

to induce your majeſty to ſet on foot an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; to call the Father Prior of the convent to account for that croud of ſuſpicious circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and thence to draw more ample proof of the guilt of the accuſed?</p>
               <p>This, ſaid the king, is certainly reaſonable.</p>
               <p>The corregidor agreed with his majeſty.</p>
               <p>Your majeſty then ſees, continued the Baron, that the next conſideration will be, how to do this in ſuch a manner as to prevent the cunning of thoſe concerned from rendering the enquiry abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and as I have turned the whole through my mind, and have conſidered it with ſo much the more attention, as I am moſt concerned in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, I will, with your majeſty's permiſſion, ſuggeſt a plan which I truſt will meet with approbation.</p>
               <p>The corregidor deſired him to explain himſelf.</p>
               <p>My ſcheme, ſaid the Baron, is this:—In the firſt place, let ſome of your lordſhip's moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent officers, duly authoriſed, proceed with us to the vaults, and there take full cognizance, and teſtify to your lordſhip in writing what ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to them: let this, along with the teſtimony of the reverend Father here, of Don Iſidor, and of Don Alphonſo, be made up into a record, and depoſited, together with the ring, armour, ſabre, and letters, in the archieves of your court; on this your majeſty will ground an order for the arreſt of all parties ſuſpected; and in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, care muſt be taken to prevent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

one armed force ſurrounds the caſtle of Punalada on one ſide, and another the priory on the other, we, with a choſen few of your majeſty's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will enter the vault by the private paſſage and be ready to receive any one that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it through the caſtle. I have many reaſons for expecting, from the execution of this plan, much ſucceſs, ſeeing that the ſudden concuſſion of unexpected fear, has often ſhaken from the ſoul of a hardened ſinner, a guilty ſecret, which the deliberate operations of juſtice, nay, torture itſelf, could not wring from him.</p>
               <p>The corregidor then declared, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the miraculous tenor of the whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, every thing which had fallen from the Baron carried ſo much the ſterling weight of truth, as, joined with the evidence, and his and the other witneſſes known integrity, ſerved to bear down all doubt of his ſincerity; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely approved of his plan for facilitating a full diſcovery, and enſuring juſtice: and in concluſion added, that he would appoint a proper perſon to go and hold the inqueſt deſired.</p>
               <p>The king, on his part, aſſured the Baron, that on the proof of what he had advanced being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed (of which by the by he had little doubt), every practicable reparation ſhould be made to him and his family: for, ſaid he, excluſive of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

and kiſſed the king's hand.—Long may John live the pride and glory of Caſtile! exclaimed the Baron: the reſt pronounced a heart-felt amen: and the king and corregidor retired.</p>
               <p>Don Juan kept them all that day at his houſe, and in the evening an officer arrived with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the corregidor to the Baron; he had orders to proceed directly on the inqueſt: they reſolved to ſet out that night; but it was agreed that the ſervants ſhould remain behind, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent unneceſſary ſpeculations.</p>

               <p>IT was juſt twilight when they arrived in the valley: they proceeded to the bower, where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a prior determination, the Baron and Don Iſidor remained with the horſes, while Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thomas, the officer, and Alphonſo, went to the chapel. Arrived at the month of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneous paſſage, they ſtruck a light, and found the place juſt as it had been left by them. The obſtructions being now few, they got down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much loſs of time: Alphonſo ſoon found the little door that opened into the vault.—The of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer entered croſſing himſelf, and was ſmote with horror at the ſpectacle preſented to his view. He examined the ſkull—the armour—every thing—and took down an accurate account of the whole in writing. In order to eſtabliſh the point of the relative ſituation with the convent, Father Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas opened the cemetery, and ſhewed him the bodies of the deceaſed fathers of the convent, which he likewiſe exactly noted, and then again returned into the vault.

               <p>As they went along, Father Thomas, in whoſe mind the expiration of the week appeared with all its horrors, preſſed them to haſten forward, telling them in general terms, that if they were not back in a week, dreadful conſequences might enſue—and as it was full four days journey to Burgos, at the common rate of travelling, it was found expedient to put their horſes to the puſh.</p>
               <p>The Baron could not comprehend what Father Thomas meant, nor would the latter tell him, but amuſed him with a ſtory of his own fiction.

It muſt be, ſaid the Baron at laſt, with difficulty getting forth his words—it muſt be ſhe—it is, it is my daughter! and that youth to whom we ſpoke at the caſtle is her ſon, Fernando is her ſon; then turning to the king, and bending his aged knee—Oh Sire! can thy heart, which never has known ſorrow but by the name, conceive the pangs of an old man, on whoſe grey head it has pleaſed Heaven to ſhower down ſorrows, thick as it ſends the hail upon the earth—canſt thou in this moment of ſuſpenſe, when the cloud of his misfortunes breaking emits one ray of light.—when all his hopes hang on the ſlight tenure of a tyrant and a murderer's will—canſt thou ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with him in his feelings, and with a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſketch of the imagination beguile yourſelf into his condition?

               <p>I will not only do ſo, ſaid the king, but will even take it as a favour if Don Juan will go along with you. Don Juan cheerfully aſſented, and received orders to inſtruct three troops of horſe to hold themſelves inſtantly in readineſs to march.

               <p>Meantime the lady, aſſiſted by Don Juan, came to herſelf—and ſtared wildly round her.—Is he dead? ſaid ſhe—Oh no! Is not this he? Alas!

Nothing could exceed his aſtoniſhment—he ſtarted back—but ſhe ſaw him, and breaking off ſuddenly—Hah! officious pandar, ſaid ſhe, art thou come to help thy lord and maſter and fill up the meaſure of thy iniquities by new butcheries? Father, ſaid Don Juan, ſtepping up to him, I arreſt you in the name of the king. Then turning to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo, and pointing to the Marquis, who ſtill lay proſtrate—Lift up that recreant lord, and let us bring them both from this place towards the caſtle, which it ſhould ſeem lies this way. They then lifted up the Marquis, who opening his eyes, ſtared at Alphonſo, and bellowed out aloud—It is, it is the murdered Gonſalvo!—They hurried him and the prior ſuddenly through the door by which his lordſhip had entered, while the lady, who had all along kept her eyes fixed on her ſon Fernando, at the name of Gonſalvo, caſt up her eyes and caught a ſide glimpſe of Alphonſo, juſt as he puſhed the Marquis through the door.

ſome reſiſtance on her part brought her back to the couch. She ſcreamed and ſtruggled violently. Oh villain! villain! are you too a murderer? and will you keep me from my long loſt lord whom I thought dead?—She then pauſed, and turning to him ſaid, Is he indeed alive, or has my fight been bleſſed with the ſhade of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved? For Heaven's ſake, dear lady, ſaid Don Juan, compoſe yourſelf, and prepare your mind for news that will delight you; for though your huſband be not alive, your deliverance from the tyrant is at hand, and all will yet be well. Juſt at theſe words they heard a great noiſe—I muſt go, ſaid Don Juan, my preſence may be neceſſary.—Good heavens! ſaid the lady, looking earneſtly at him, is not this—Alas! my recollection is gone, and time and grief have effaced names from my memory—Were you not a friend of Gonſalvo's?

               <p>The entrance of Don Juan put an end to the whole cabal—he ordering the Marquis and Prior to be confined in ſeparate places, to prevent any colluſive arrangement with regard to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>

               <p>After conſulting together, it was agreed that he ſhould be allowed the time required, but not in his cloſet.

               <p>When the indeſcribable emotions of paternal affection and filial reverence had a little ſubſided into calmneſs, they led her forth into the upper part of the caſtle, where, the unaccuſtomed air and light overcoming her, ſhe ſwooned, and was put to bed by a female attendant of the caſtle: while the Baron, Don Juan and the reſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their ſearch, and were aſtoniſhed at the number of vaults and ſubterraneous paſſag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The monſter who is now prior was bred by my father's charity about this caſtle, a mendicant child; he was the companion of my youth, the depoſitory of my ſecrets—the confidant and agent of my amours; and when by my father's deſire he took the habit, he became my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
                     <p>On my coming to the eſtate I kept him in my family, intending to give him the priory on the death of the then incumbent.

                     <p>Gonſalvo brought his wife to Toledo—I ſaw her, and was ſmitten with her beauty—yet for a time I had virtue enough to reſiſt the flame. I confeſſed it to Father Pedro. Again I told—again bewailed my miſery, and lamented the flame that conſumed me.—He uſed his endeavours to mitigate it, by letting in at firſt a ray of ſinful hope.—Here I firſt ſtumbled—and never recovered myſelf till I fell into the abyſs of guilt in which you ſee me: wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He laid a plan:—even now, after an interval of twenty years ſpent in buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſſaults of conſcience, my blood runs cold to think of it! He not only deviſed the diabolical plan, but he aided in the execution of it.—The Marchioneſs was in the way—ſhe fell ſick—the reverend father found her a phyſician, and ſhe died.—The prior of this convent fell ſick, and died alſo.</p>

in a nunnery, which I told him was here. The Father was their guide—I haſtened to the caſtle, while he conducted them to the convent, and by a private door let them through the convent into the cemetery, from which, he ſaid, the lady ſhould paſs into the nunnery. She was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly led into a remote room of this caſtle near the paſſage to the cemetery, while I went forward with two aſſaſſins, hired for the purpoſe by the prieſt.—We led Gonſalvo into that vault where his body was found, and as he ſtooped to enter, (his great height making him ſtoop more than us, and he conſequently being more expoſed), one of the aſſaſſins ſmote him with a ſabre, and ſplit his ſkull—With the prieſt's help we took a ſhell and ſome boards from the cemetery, and putting him in buried him on the ſpot. When this was done, the prieſt whiſpered me privately, that our ſafety demanded the death of the aſſaſſins. He did not allow me time to deliberate, but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly round plunged a dagger into the breaſt of him that was neareſt, and then aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other, who reſiſted, I diſpatched him with my ſword on the inſtant.</p>
                     <p>The virtue of the lady ſet her above all my efforts. The officious churchman propoſed force.—I attempted it, but in vain—the feeble efforts of a weak woman were ſufficient to beat me from that object, for the attainment of which I had waded through a ſea of blood.</p>

               <p>Don Juan ordered the domeſtics, who were at hand, to take the body of the Marquis—then ſealed the papers in preſence of all, and gave ſtrict orders to keep the Prior in cuſtody. He then took Fernando, who was ſo bewildered with the wonders of the day that he ſcarcely knew whether what paſſed was reality or a dream, by the hand, and ſaluted him by the name of Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvo, congratulating him at the ſame time on the fortunate diſcovery of his parents, and his certain acceſſion to rank and fortune.

The King was horror ſtruck and aſtoniſhed—he forthwith called a council, of which the Archbiſhop of Toledo made part, in which it was determined that the Prior ſhould be handed over to the grand inquiſitor—that the attainder of Gonſalvo ſhould be entirely eraſed from the records of the court—that the title of Punalada ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and the Marquis's whole fortunes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>They returned to the caſtle of Punalada, with a carriage of the King's to convey the lady to court, the King being deſirous of offering her every mark of diſtinction, and a vehicle for the remains of Conſalvo. When they arrived they found that Don Rodrigo had been there, and, on being refuſed admiſſion to his uncle's cloſet, and poſſeſſion of the caſtle, had ſet off in a rage, threatening them all with the indignation of the King—that the Marquis's body had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the earth with the ignominy attached to ſuicide—and that the lady was recruited, and not only willing, but deſirous to quit the caſtle.</p>
               <p>When Alphonſo was, after proper precaution, introduced to her, her aſtoniſhment was greater than ever it was before—She knew not what to think—what to ſay—or how to conduct herſelf—She looked at every one round her in turn, to read in their faces ſome ſolution of a myſtery that ſhe could not help thinking was involved in it—Her huſband, her beloved Gonſalvo ſtood before her—Aſtoniſhment drank up her tears—ſhe could not cry—yet ſhe would if ſhe could, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This confuſion of reſemblance, ſaid ſhe, Don Iſidor, points out that union which ſhould always ſubſiſt between our children; therefore ſuffer me to treat Alphonſo, and this our ſon, as equally our children. You ſpeak my very ſoul, madam, ſaid Don Iſidor, for my attachment to your ſon is not leſs than yours to mine; and there ſeems already to ſubſiſt between them the affection of brothers. The youths were delighted—all parties were as happy as their different circumſtances may be ſuppoſed to admit of. Preparations were made for their departure—The Baron got the remains of Gonſalvo, even to the duſt in the cheſt, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put into a coffin, and laid in the vehicle. Then after ſeeing the King's officers take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſeal down every thing, the Baron, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thomas and Don Iſidor got with the lady into the carriage and proceeded towards Burges, while Alphonſo and his friend Fernando rode by their ſide.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV.</head>
               <p>IT was pretty far advanced in the night of the fourth day before they came near the city: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo and Fernando, taken up with reflection and mutual congratulations on their happineſs, dropped behind, and had fallen into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the beauty of the night and the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the moon, when, juſt as the carriage turned the corner at the extreme end of an oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary, and got out of hearing, a band of armed ruffians ruſhed from the covert of the trees upon the two youths, who had no perſon to aid them in reſiſtance but Pierrot. Before they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to defend themſelves, one of the ruffians from behind buried a dagger in the ſhoulder of Alphonſo, and felled him to the earth. Fernando on the inſtant ſaw the ſtroke given, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all at once put an end to ourſelves. The lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>—Don Iſidor burſt from the carriage, and, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Baron, ran up the field of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:027101_0209_0FD33C985EFB84C0"/>
and found Fernando weeping over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Alphonſo:—Alas, my brother, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my friend! but one inſtant ſooner and I ſhould have ſaved you—Oh! would to Heaven the dagger had met my heart inſtead of yours: but, unhappy that I am, I ſaw the blow but time enough to revenge, and I ſave my own worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life, while thine is loſt. Where, ſaid Don Iſidor, where is my boy?—where is my Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo?—Let us lift him up, ſaid the Baron; perhaps life may yet be in him. Gallop forward, ſaid Father Thomas to Pierrot, and ſee if there be a houſe at hand, to which we can carry him; and go you and bring a ſurgeon directly—perhaps ſomething may yet be done. Juſt at this inſtant, a patrole of the Ronda<note n="*" place="bottom">A patrole or watch in Spain.</note> came up mounted. The Baron hailed them—Here hath been murder committed, ſaid he; have you got a light?—Yes, ſaid the officer, and diſplaying a dark lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern diſmounted and examined thoſe on the ground. Alphonſo was bleeding profuſely; they lifted him up, tore off his coat, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the wound had entered his ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blade very deep: they did their utmoſt to ſtop the effuſion of blood, and the captain of the troop being informed by one of his people, that the carriage in waiting belonged to the King, drew forth a leathern bottle with wine, and poured ſome of it down Alphonſo's throat—He ſoon exhibited ſome ſlight tokens of life, his
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:027101_0210_0FD33C8312DFCD68"/>
pulſe moved. They brought him to the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, where they found Donna Maria inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable; and by the direction of the officer moved forward to an inn not far diſtant, while he and his men took charge of the wounded ruffians, and brought them after.</p>
               <p>Alphonſo was laid on a bed at the inn with little ſymptom of life—a ſurgeon ſoon attended, and declared that it was impoſſible he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Donna Maria was diſtracted, and, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by an unaccountable feeling which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came form, hung upon him and kiſſed his clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold lips. She was at laſt drawn away to give room to the ſurgeon, who, examining narrowly, began to be of opinion that the wound had not reached any vital part, and obſerved that he muſt have been hurt elſewhere: he therefore exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him carefully, particularly about the head, and found a conſiderable ſwelling juſt above the ear—Here, ſaid he, is the chief injury; can you tell how he received it, or from what ſort of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon? He got but one ſtroke, replied Fernando, and that was in the ſhoulder. Then the hurt in the head has proceeded from his weight in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the loſs of blood from the ſhoulder is in that caſe rather uſeful than injurious. While they were thus ſpeaking, Alphonſo began to breathe hard, then groaned: the ſurgeon order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a glaſs of water, with which he wetted his lips, letting a little down—Still the word was death.</p>
               <p>Meantime the officers of the Rondo had got the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:027101_0211_0FD33C8C1971A818"/>
wounded aſſaſſins to the inn. One appeared, from his equipments, to be a gentleman of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable rank, but he was in as hopeleſs a ſtate as Alphonſo: another was in the livery of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and a third had the appearance of a bravo. The two laſt were coming to themſelves, but the firſt ſeemed quite ſenſeleſs though he breathed; they were all deſperately wounded, particularly the gentleman, whoſe arm was cloven at the joint of the ſhoulder almoſt from his body.</p>
               <p>As the accident happened at the diſtance of leſs than a league from the city of Burgos, Don Iſidor, on his arrival at the inn, wrote off to Don Juan, informing him of the affair, and intreating proper aſſiſtance to be ſent out. Don Juan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf arrived in two hours after the meſſenger was diſpatched, and the king's ſurgeon along with him, who, on examining Alphonſo, enquired whether he had indicated any diſpoſition to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? and on being anſwered in the negative, declared it to be his opinion, that he had only been extremely ſtunned with the fall, and added, that in all probability he would ſoon come to himſelf. He ordered his head to be chafed with warm ſpirits, his extremities to be rubbed, and ſame warm wine poured down his throat: in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>e loved more than any of his favourites, though much had been done to injure him in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:—nay ſuch, he ſaid, was the attachment of the king, that he would not inform him of the preſent accident before he came away, to avoid giving him unneceſſary pain.</p>
               <p>When the two inferior aſſaſſins came to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Don Juan, the Baron, and Don Iſidor, were informed of it, and coming to the room where they were, Don Juan was immediately deſcried by him who wore the livery. Whoſe ſervant are you? ſaid Don Juan ſeverely. I am the ſervant of Don Rodrigo de Calvados, ſaid the fellow. Oho! ſaid Don Juan—and where is your maſter? There, your honour, ſaid the fellow, pointing ſignificantly to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> where the gentleman's body lay.—Then it was he who ſet you on this enterpriſe? ſaid Don Juan. God bleſs your honour, returned the fellow, I knew not what I was going about till I was in the very heart of it: this honeſt man here, who, God bleſs us! looks liker the devil than a man, will tell you more—I was only a ſervant. Don Juan looking at the fellow perceived that he was a bravo, and ordered the two to be immediately carried under a ſtrong guard to jail.</p>
               <p>The next day Alphonſo was much recovered, but complained of a violent pain from the wound in his ſhoulder: he was however declared by the ſurgeon to be able to proceed ſlowly in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:027101_0213_0FD33C881E78B090"/>
to Burgos. The gentleman aſſaſſin, Don Rodrigo too, was able to proceed on a litter; a ſtrong guard was ordered for him, and he was depoſited in the jail, and a ſurgeon ordered to attend him: his mother was almoſt mad with vexation and diſappointment—but all her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, all her tears, all her falſehoods, and all her addreſs were of no avail; ſhe could get no one hardy enough to apply to the king in his favour.</p>
               <p>During Alphonſo's illneſs Donna Maria never quitted him, but when delicacy required.</p>
               <p>But, a conſiderable time having elapſed, and the wound continuing in the ſame ſtate, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon expreſſed his ſurpriſe at the ſlowneſs of the, proceſs, and frequently animadverted on ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a feveriſh kind, for which he could not account. One day making thoſe remarks in the hearing of Peirrot, that honeſt ſoul ſaid, that he fancied he could tell the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Why, what is the cauſe of it, wiſeman? ſaid Don Iſidor.—Love, your honour, replied Pierrot, bluntly. Love!—in the name of God, with whom? I am ſure, your honour, I don't know—and I believe it is more than he knows himſelf: the picture that hangs about his neck, perhaps, may tell—though I doubt that too, for they were ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>Are you mad, fellow? ſaid the Baron haſtily. No, your worſhip, replied Pierrot, I am not, I hope; I do the beſt at leaſt that I can to avoid it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He then told him of the adventure with the two ladies in Portugal—concluding with as aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that ſince his young maſter had ſeen them, he never had had one hour's peace, nor, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved been right in his head.</p>
               <p>Don Iſidor ſeemed extremely uneaſy—retired to a room—wrote letters, and diſpatched a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger with them inſtantly down to the caſtle of Duero. The reſt of the day he ſeemed extremely unhappy, nor could the Baron or any of his friends account for the ſtrange alteration in his manner.</p>
               <p>Next day he put the queſtion of his love with ſome delicacy to Alphonſo; who candidly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that a lady he had met with on his travels in Portugal had gained entire poſſeſſion of his affections—and though he ſcarcely hoped ever to ſee her again, he could not help cheriſhing the love with which, ſhe inſpired him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging ſome ſmall hopes.—He then told his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole ſtory, and concluded with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the picture. At ſight of the picture Don Iſidor turned pale, his lips quivered, his whole frame trembled with the agitation of his mind—He was for ſome minutes ſpeechleſs At length breaking ſilence: It is as I feared, ſaid he!—Oh unhappy youth!—Good God, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! exclaimed Alphonſo, to what ſtrange ſtory is this dreadful agitation a prelude?—Alas! my unhappy child, ſaid Don Iſidor, prepare to hear

that which muſt pierce your ſoul with horror!—Yet you muſt know it; though inſtant death at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the information, you muſt know it—Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die than live one hour in the conception of a deadly ſin!—That young lady—Good God! do I live to tell it to my ſon!—that young lady, with whom you were ſo deeply enamoured, is—your ſiſter!—My ſiſter?—Yes, your ſiſter! and ſhe, that lady whom you reſcued along with her, is mine—the Marchioneſs Deloro.—Then I am undone! exclaimed Alphonſo;—undone here—and loſt to all eternity!</p>
               <p>Say not ſo, my child, ſaid Don Iſidor—we are to believe that the Almighty, who is merciful, will judge by the intention, and not aſſign the puniſhment of a deliberate crime to a paſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary and unintentional.

Don Iſidor: yet it is to me a ſubject of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the bare imagination of which harrows up my ſoul:—I am not fit to ſpeak upon it—I ſhall therefore retire and content myſelf with offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up my prayers to Heaven in your behalf; nor will I again behold you till I have firm aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that you have baniſhed the helliſh paſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Don Iſidor withdrew, leaving the unhappy Alphonſo in a ſtate of diſtraction, horror, and grief. It was the firſt time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in his life that a word engendered in anger had fallen from his father—and his laſt expreſſions ſmote him the more poignantly to the heart.</p>
               <p>On Don Iſidor's meeting the Baron and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Would to God! ſaid Don Iſidor, that the aſſaſſin's poignard had cut him off ere he ſhould have lived to tell the horrid tale—he is in love with his ſiſter! They ſtared aghaſt—Yes, ſaid he, after telling them the ſtory, it is not guilt alone that meets the ſcourge in this life, for I am curſed as Punalada was, and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous love blights my family!—</p>
               <p>Hold, hold, Don Iſidor! interrupted the prieſt judgment belongs to God—reſignation is the duty of man; beware, therefore, that while you denounce vengeance againſt your ſon, and call him ſinner, you are not yourſelf dipping deeper

               <p>Reſerve your arguments, ſaid Father Thomas to a fitter occaſion; at preſent let us look to the lady, who ſeems to ſtand in need of care little leſs than the young gentleman.</p>
               <p>The next morning Pierrot was diſpatched to the village near Talavera, to bring the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been nurſe to Don Iſidor's lady, her whole family, and the nurſe who was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſuckle their child, directly to Burgos, but with ſtrict injunctions not to apprize them of a ſentence that had paſſed. During this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Alphonſo's fever had a fortunate criſis; he recovered the uſe of his ſenſes, and, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely weak, gave ſome hopes of recovery. It was thought adviſeable, however, to keep the diſcovery a ſecret from him, till ſuch proof ſhould be had as would put it paſt a doubt one way or other.</p>
               <p>At length Pierrot returned, and with him the nurſe who had ſuckled Don Iſidor's child, and her huſband; the old woman having been ſome time dead.

Of both theſe, nurſe, you and your huſband ſtand in imminent danger; nor can any thing but a fair confeſſion ſave you from being handed over inſtantly to the cognizance of criminal law. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me, then, as you hope for mercy here, or ſalvation hereafter—Where is the child of Don Iſidor de Haro, which you, for purpoſes beſt known to yourſelves, have changed, impoſing for ſo many years upon him the charge of a child not his own—while on the other hand you may have devoted his to miſery, want, or even death?—Speak, ſpeak the truth, and believe me nothing elſe can ſave you, for of one part of the charge againſt you we have unqueſtionable evidence.</p>
               <p>I will, Father! I will! exclaimed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               <p>One day after I had brought Don Iſidor's child home to nurſe, a woman with a child on her breaſt called in towards the cloſe of the day; ſaid ſhe was a traveller and begged a lodging—

                  </gap> morning—As we never refuſed a chriſtian ſhelter, we deſired her to ſtay, and gave her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of what he had. The weather was extremely hot, and we all lay out on mats in the piazza of our cottage. Juſt at day-break we heard the ſtranger move—ſhe got up, and bid us adieu and went away. We wiſhed her to ſtay for breakfaſt; but ſhe refuſed, alleging that ſhe had a long journey before her, and muſt not delay.</p>
               <p>When we aroſe, the child was aſleep in the cradle; ſo that altogether the woman had been gone three hours before I went to take it up. Gueſs my ſorrow and ſurpriſe, when I ſound that the vile wretch had changed the child. I knew it directly by a bunch of purple grapes on the back, though in other reſpects the children were very like each other.</p>
               <p>Why did you not tell Don Iſidor then? ſaid ſaid the Prieſt.</p>

I ran, continued ſhe, directly to my huſband, who was at work, and told him. He was going to kill me with his ſickle: he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately broke off from work, and went in purſuit of her, charging me to ſay nothing till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as he was pretty ſure of overtaking her. But, God help us, he was all the time going far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from her; for we afterwards ſound that ſhe
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:027101_0224_0FD33CA846DC0AE0"/>
had told us wrong, and was going towards An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daluſia, inſtead of turning from it. At night he returned weary and broken hearted—we knew not what to do—we feared to diſcover the matter—and thought it beſt to leave it to chance. The thing paſt over—the old woman my lady's nurſe was deceived—and finding that we had no reaſon to fear a diſcovery, we thought it beſt, as it could not be remedied, to ſay nothing. This I call God and our Redeemer to witneſs is the whole truth, and I hope you will think that I am not ſo much to be blamed.</p>
