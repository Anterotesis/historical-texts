            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We grieve for the Sufferings of our <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> who have ſuffered much by <hi>Indians</hi> miſled by bad and wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Advice, but we hope an end will be ſoon put to their Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Friends and ours, and beleive the <hi>Indians</hi> will by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they will bring themſelves into by hearkening to this wicked Advice, be made to repent of their bad Actions.</p>
            <p>We hope none of our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> of this Colony are joined with the Wicked <hi>Indians</hi> who have been deſtroying the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And expect you will let us know all you have heard of the Intentions of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and if any of the Enemy <hi>Indians,</hi> or any ſtrange <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould come among you, to put evil and falſe Things into your Heads,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007688_0005_102D9992B106A8C0"/>you will do well not to believe them, and that you will deliver them to us, as dangerous to our Peace and yours.</p>
            <p>As we have heard ſome of the Enemy <hi>Indians</hi> have been in the upper Parts of this Province, and Murdered one Man, and wounded another, this and the Murders on the other ſide of the River, has made our People who live in the upper Parts of this Colony ſo Angry, that it is become dangerous to any <hi>Indians</hi> to go there, as they will not in the hurry know Friends from Enemies. Therefore we would have you ſeriouſly conſider with yourſelves, that it will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for you to contrive ſome Bounds for your own Security, where you may be ſafe, and our People eaſy with it. And as you are our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> we would have your Advice in this Matter, and if you have any requeſt to make for your own eaſe and both our Security's, you will do well to let us know it, and we ſhall give it due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Indians</hi> withdrew.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> Morning, <hi>January</hi> the 9th 1756.</head>
            <p>The Commiſſioners met.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> came into Council, and having appointed <hi>Ohiockecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> to ſpeak for them; he delivered in their Names the following Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Dear <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOME of our old Men can remember when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were weak and few, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtrong and many. We then nurſed them up in our Boſoms and treated them as Friends.</p>
            <p>We are glad our Friendſhip hath continned ſo long, and hope it will always endure.</p>
            <p>Since our Fathers have ſold ſo large a Part of their Lands to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we find it much more difficult to maintain ourſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies by Hunting, which is at leaſt one half our Support.</p>
            <p>But a worſe evil than that has come to us, which is the Uſe of ſtrong Liquor, to which the <hi>Indians</hi> are too much addicted, and by which they are made Weak, Idle, and Quarrelſome, and for ſtrong Drink often ſell thoſe Skins, and other Things, which would provide themſelves and Families with Cloaths and Bread, and for this ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are too much to blame.</p>
            <p>We beg you will take care to put a Stop to this wicked prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007688_0006_102D9994A7B14140"/>which tho' it may offend ſome of our fooliſh People at firſt, yet it will at laſt be beſt liked, and be more for the Health of Soul and Body.</p>
            <p>The bringing in the bleſſed Goſpel, we eſteem the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have received by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming among us, and we truſt it hath been a means in the Hand of God to reform the Minds and Manners of a Number of us, and we prefer the Enjoyment of it and living with our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> even to Life itſelf. It gives us a real concern, that any of our Acquaintance are joined with the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indians.</hi> The Reaſon of their going to them, we beleive was, that they were ſeduced by Lies and Falſity's, becauſe the ſame Methods were uſed with us, but without effect. As Times of great Diſtreſs are come on us, as well as you, we are willing to agree as <hi>Brethren,</hi> upon any Methods for our mutual Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>We propoſe the following, which we hope may be effectual.</p>
            <p>We who live on this ſide <hi>Rariton</hi> River, will not on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, go to the Northward of <hi>Rariton</hi> River at <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and of the great Poſt Road that leads from <hi>Trenton</hi> to <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> except in thoſe Town ſpots, but confine ourſelves between the ſaid Poſt Road and <hi>Delaware</hi> River, to the Sea Shores of this Province, while the War continues, in which Bounds we hope we ſhall always have the free Liberty of Hunting, and beg that good care may be taken, that no Traps ſhall be ſett there, which is of late very frequent and is very dangerous both to you and us.</p>
            <p>If any of our Young Men go to War with you, we hope you will put them upon the ſame footing with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that when our Married Men go to War, you will make ſome Proviſion for their Families.</p>
            <p>As ſeveral of us are obliged to leave our Habitations in this time of general Diſtreſs, we pray that ſome Releif may be provided for ſuch. As it is the Misfortune of ſome of us to be in Debt, and we, for the publick Peace, are willing to deprive ourſelves of ſeveral advantages we formerly enjoy'd, we pray that care may be taken that our Creditors may not be two preſſing, and we promiſe as ſoon as we can, we will honeſtly pay our juſt Debts. We pray that all abuſive Words and Actions, which deſtroy Love, may be puniſhed in both <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We think we have ſtill ſome Peices of Land, for which we have received no Conſideration, if it ſhould prove ſo, and we could get the Money for them, we hope we ſhould be able, with ſome Aſſiſtance from our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007688_0007_102D999942F93718"/>to purchaſe a Peice of Land ſufficient for us all to ſettle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and have the Goſpel among us, which is our great deſire.</p>
            <p>And we <hi>Pompton Indians,</hi> and others, living beyond <hi>Rariton,</hi> will confine ourſelves within a Line to be drawn from that Part of the Sound between <hi>Staten Iſland</hi> and the Main, which is neareſt to <hi>John Jolines,</hi> to go the neareſt Courſe to the ſaid <hi>John Jolines</hi> Houſe, and ſtraight three Miles further into the Woods, and ſo by a Line to be drawn thro' the Woods, at three Miles diſtance, back from the great Road that leads from <hi>John Jolines</hi> to <hi>Elizabeth-Town, Now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ark, Wezel,</hi> and <hi>John Jerolimans</hi> Mill, near the Falls of <hi>Paſſaic,</hi> and from the ſaid Falls near <hi>Jerolimans</hi> Mill to the Fork, and then to <hi>Pompton,</hi> and then on the neareſt ſtraight Line thro' <hi>Bergen</hi> County, to the <hi>Jerſey</hi> Line on the Shore of the North River, or <hi>Hudſons</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ſo by the Waters to were it began on the Sound.</p>
            <p>We have to complain to our <hi>Brethren,</hi> that ill minded Perſons are apt to take Advantage of the <hi>Indians</hi> when they are Drunk, and buy their Lands for a trifle, and often from the <hi>Indians</hi> who does not own it. And we pray our <hi>Brethren,</hi> that for the future no <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Deed or Leaſe may be allowed to be good, but what is made and Signed before the Governor, or two of his Council, who are to have a Certificate from ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> that the <hi>Indian</hi> who ſells the Land, is Owner of it, under the Hand of ſome Magiſtrate, who ſees the fix <hi>Indians</hi> Sign it, and the Deed to have it wrote on the back, and ſigned by the Governor, or two of his Council, that they ſaw the Certificate of the ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> Signed by the Juſtice, and that the <hi>Indian</hi> who ſells the Land, underſtood the Deed, and had a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Price as common for it.</p>
            <p>As ſome bad People have got a long Leaſe from a Drunken <hi>Indian</hi> for the <hi>Indian</hi> Lands at <hi>Wepink,</hi> and for which they pay moſtly, or all in ſtrong Drink, we beg that they may be removed from that Land, and we hope care will be taken that no looſe People ſettle on our Lands, without buying them.</p>
            <p>We heartily promiſe our <hi>Brethren,</hi> that if any ſtrange <hi>Indians</hi> ſhall come among us, we will immediately give Notice thereof to the next Juſtice or Captain, that they may be ſatisfied for what end they come: And if any <hi>Indian</hi> ſhould attempt to come among us, to draw us back from our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we will immediately ſecure them, and deliver them to our <hi>Brethren.</hi> And as this is our fixed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which we deſire may be made publick, we hope our <hi>Brethren</hi> will not give Credit to reports of ſtrange <hi>Indians</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, when ſuch Stories are told by ill minded People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007688_0008_102D999B36C3D620"/>
And if any of our own People ſhould be unruly or abuſive, we will deliver them up to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners then ſpoke to them as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have here three Men and ſome Women and Children, in all Seventeen, which were taken in the upper Parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, where they have lived ſome Years, and ſent down to <hi>Trenton</hi> Gaol, for both theirs and our own Security, from whence they have been eſcorted here, and are now in the Guard Houſe, we ſhall Order them to be delivered to you, to be examined, and if after due Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Matter, you think you can ſafely take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and Anſwer for their Good Behaviour, we will ſhew the Confidence we have in you our <hi>Brethren,</hi> by releaſing them to you; but if you ſuſpect them, you muſt deliver them back to the Guard. There ſtill remains in Gaol at <hi>Trenton,</hi> one <hi>Phillip</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> whoſe conduct has given us great reaſon to ſuſpect him, and whoſe Family is at <hi>Wiomen,</hi> and we ſhall detain him there till ſomething more appears in his favour. We ſhall wait your Anſwer till the Afternoon.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> Afternoon.</head>
            <p>The Commiſſioners and <hi>Indians</hi> being met.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners ſpoke to them as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE acknowledge the Kindneſs your Forefathers have ſhewn to ours, and we ſhall always Act kindly to you, as we hope you will always deſerve it, as long as the Waters run down <hi>Delaware.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are glad to find you acknowledge that your Fathers have ſold the Land we now poſſeſs to our Anceſtors, and we hope you have received Advantages by the riſing of the Price of your Skins, and Furs, and buying what you wanted at a reaſonable Rate, equal to the Loſs you have ſuffered by the ſcarcity of Deer and other Game.</p>
            <p>We are pleaſed to hear that you are ſenſible of the Evils that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe by the too great habit of drinking ſpirituous Liquors among the <hi>Indians,</hi> and we ſhall lay that Matter before the Legiſlature of this Provinee, and ſhall endeavour to get a Proviſion made againſt that Evil.</p>
            <p>It is agreeable to us, to hear that you ſo much Value the Bleſſed Goſpel, and that it has amended the Lives of ſo many of you, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007688_0009_102D999D57FF0160"/>the more you practice the Precepts of it, the better it will be for you.</p>
            <p>We are glad that the Lies and Falſities of your and our Enemies, have not been able to draw you off from us, your <hi>Brethren,</hi> for your true Intereſt is faſt bound to ours.</p>
            <p>As to the Bounds you have propoſed for yourſelves, we agree with you as to them, and ſhall take care that you ſhall be ſecure in them.</p>
            <p>We hope none of our <hi>Brethren</hi> will diſtreſs you, unreaſonably, on Account of any Debts you owe them. And we recommend it to you to be Frugal and Induſtrious till you can pay them.</p>
            <p>We will lay it before the Legiſlature, to provide againſt your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived or defrauded in any Bargains, Grants or Leaſes of Land, that you may make hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to your Lands at <hi>Wepink,</hi> we ſhall make a Report about it, and you may depend upon ample Juſtice being done to you.</p>
            <p>We receive kindly the hearty Declarations you make to us, that you will give immediate Notice to the Officers of Government, when any ſtrange <hi>Indians</hi> come among you, and that you will ſecure ſuch as are your and our Enemies. Let this lay deep in your Hearts, and your fulfilling it punctually, will give us ſure Proofs that you are our hearty <hi>Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will make theſe your Intentions publick, and make no doubt but this Declaration, which we believe comes from your Hearts, will make your <hi>Brethren</hi> Love and Eſteem you, and make them unwilling to beleive any falſe Reports to your diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>All manner of rude and bad behaviour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> to each other ſhall meet with proper Diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>As ſome of our <hi>Brethren,</hi> have ſuſtained Loſſes by Attachment and Love to their <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> We are willing to aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuch of them as have left their Places of abode in their preſent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and ſhall lay the Affair before the Legiſlature for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>As to ſuch of our <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> as will go out to War with our People, which we hope they will chearfully do, when there is occaſion, they will always be put upon the ſame footing with their <hi>Brethren</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as they have been heretofore.</p>

Then the <hi>Indians</hi> by <hi>Ohiockchoque</hi> return'd the following Anſwer, to what the Commiſſioners delivered to them this Morning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have conſidered what you ſaid to us reſpecting the <hi>Indians</hi> who were bro't from the back Parts of the Province. We have ſtrictly examined them, and according to the beſt Judgment we are able to frame, we verily believe they had no bad deſigns againſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but conſidering the deceitfulneſs of Man's Heart, we dare not engage for any but ourſelves, we would be Willing to take them to our Town at <hi>Cranberry,</hi> and do our utmoſt to Watch over them, but the Fears and Jealouſies of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Neighbours, are ſo great, that (as we are informed) it would not be for their or our ſafety to have them among us, and therefore do not chooſe to have any Connections with them, at leaſt for the preſent.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners afterwards enquired of the <hi>Indians,</hi> if they had the ſame Objections to the taking them to any of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Towns, and informed them, that the Commiſſioners would make allowance of ſome <hi>Indian</hi> Corn towards their ſupport this Winter, as they were removed from their own Habitations. Upon which <hi>Quiſh</hi> and the Chiefs of the <hi>Indian</hi> Town in the Branches of <hi>Croſwicks,</hi> agreed, as nothing appeared againſt theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> but that they were brought from their Habitation for their own Security, and the Peace of the upper Inhabitants, and that they could not return there again as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Bounds the <hi>Indians</hi> had preſcribed to themſelves, that they would take them home, uſe them as <hi>Brethren,</hi> and have a careful Eye over them.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Indian</hi> Priſoners promiſſed to keep with the <hi>Croſwick Indians,</hi> and to be have orderly.</p>
            <p>And they were delivered to them, whoſe Names were <hi>Abraham Lewis, John Price, John Phillip,</hi> and Twelve Women and Children.</p>
            <p>And the Commiſſioners informed them, that they would Order ſome Corn for the relief of thoſe who have ſuffered by their Love to us, and by being drove from their Habitations.</p>
            <p>And the Treaty broke up, and the <hi>Indians</hi> next Day went in an orderly Manner to their Towns.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What follows is added by Order of the Commiſſioners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT appeared to the Commiſſioners in the Courſe of this Treaty, that the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Suſquehannah,</hi> have for three or four Years paſt, uſed many Endeavours to carry of to <hi>Suſquehannah</hi> all the <hi>Indians</hi> from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007688_0011_102D99A2663FAFE0"/>this Province, and have brought Belts of Wampom, in the Name of the <hi>Mohocks,</hi> to Order them to remove, tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived them to have been ſent by the <hi>Mohowks,</hi> and have refuſed to leave us.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners are convinced of the Sincerity of the <hi>Indians</hi> of this Province, and recommend it to the Inhabitants to uſe them kindly, to be careful not to ſupply them with ſtrong Drink, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many diſorders may be prevented.</p>
            <p>They alſo requeſt the Inhabitants not to uſe aggravating Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the <hi>Indians,</hi> whereby rude and threatning Expreſſions may be drawn from them in their Drink, and thoſe improved into Tales to alarm weak, People and raiſe ill Blood between the Inhabitants of the Colony and the <hi>Indians,</hi> which ought to be ſuppreſſed by all Means.</p>
            <p>They recommend it to the Inhabitants to conſider whether any Thing but their Love and Friendſhip to us, could have prevented their being new among our Enemies, and for this token of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for us, they are intitled to our Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>As the ſpreading of reports, without a good Foundation, can only ſerve to give the Inhabitants uneaſineſs, they requeſt them carefully to ſuppreſs all Idle Stories, as they will tend to deſtroy their own Quiet and Repoſe.</p>
