            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ISAIAH V.7.</hi>

                  <p>And He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppre≈ø≈øion; for Righteou≈øne≈øs, but behold a Cry.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is part of the explanation and application of a very pertinent and in≈øtructive parable; wherein, under the ≈øimilitude of a vineyard, the divine tenderne≈øs and care, and <hi>I≈ørael</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulne≈øs and danger, are plainly pointed out. <hi>My welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the ≈øtones thereof, and planted it with the choice≈øt vine, and built a tower in the mid≈øt of it, and al≈øo made a winepre≈øs therein: And he looked that it ≈øhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes And now, O inhabitants of Jeru≈øalem and men of Judah judge I pray you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013278_0004_0F8FB8CC2BAD4640"/>
Wherefore when I looked that it ≈øhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? and now, go to I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof and it ≈øhall be eaten up: And break down the wall thereof and it ≈øhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down. And I will lay it wa≈øte; it ≈øhall not be pruned, nor digged; but there ≈øhall come up briers and thorns: I will al≈øo command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it:</hi> As from the fir≈øt to the fifth ver≈øe.</p>
            <p>From this repre≈øentation it appears, that God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people were mo≈øt highly privileged; that they had all the means of temporal and ≈øpiritual pro≈øperity in their hands; yet that they mi≈øimproved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them; were ungrateful and di≈øobedient, and thereby provoked God to withdraw his ≈øpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from them, and leave them expo≈øed to wa≈øting calamities.‚ÄîThat they need not fail of under≈øtanding the parable, and applying it to them≈øelves, the prophet adds, as in the ver≈øe of which our text is part; <hi>For the vineyard of the Lord of bo≈øts is the hou≈øe of I≈ørael, and the men of Judah his plea≈øant plant: And he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for judgment, but behold oppre≈ø≈øion; for righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, but behold a cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus connected and introduced, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øupply us with the≈øe three topicks of di≈øcour≈øe, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou≈øne≈øs, are what God expects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from a people. Neverthele≈øs,</item>
                  <item>II. They are ≈øometimes ≈øo degenerate as, in≈øtead of judgment, to be guilty of oppre≈ø≈øion; and in≈øtead of righteou≈øne≈øs, to occa≈øion a cry.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013278_0005_0F904A029715CA40"/>III. When this is the ca≈øe with a people, he may ju≈øtly leave them to the fatal con≈øequences of their folly and wickedne≈øs, or ≈øend other di≈øtre≈ø≈øing judgments among them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou≈øne≈øs, are what God expects and demands from a people. <hi>He looked for judgment‚Äîand for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs.</hi> God had done ≈øo much for his people <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> both in an ordinary and extraordinary way, that he had all the rea≈øon in the world (≈øpeaking after the manner of men) to expect that they ≈øhould be a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and holy people. God, indeed, has ju≈øt rea≈øon to expect an ob≈øervance of the laws of righteou≈øne≈øs from every ≈øociety of rational creatures, and from every individual, ≈øo far as tho≈øe laws may be known. And the greater advantages any per≈øon or people have to know and ob≈øerve tho≈øe laws, the greater is their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to ob≈øerve them.‚ÄîBut this point may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øtrated by the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteou≈øne≈øs are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the nature and con≈øtitution of man. God manife≈øts his will by the operations of his hands, as well as by the dictates of his word. Mankind in general ≈øhew the work of the law written in their hearts; particularly the law of ju≈øtice and equity. We are born with a ≈øen≈øe of right and wrong, which grows quicker and ≈øtronger, as we advance in age, unle≈øs weakened, corrupted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne by education and example. There is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within us that approves of the practice of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, and condemns wrong and inju≈øtice. Even ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage nations retain this ≈øen≈øe, and have rules among
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013278_0006_0F904A02B7B6D140"/>
them of equitable dealing. And though there are ≈øome that live by plundering and robbing their neighbours, yet they do not like to be plundered and robbed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, but retain among≈øt one another the practice of ju≈øtice. Now, ≈øuch being the impre≈ø≈øions made on the hearts of men by the hand of their Creator, it is plain that he requires them to pre≈øerve the≈øe impre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to do nothing to obliterate them; to ≈øquare their conduct by them; that being upright and hone≈øt in their dealings, they may an≈øwer God's rea≈øonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from them, by promoting the general order and felicity of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we con≈øider the moral character of the deity, as being a lover of righteou≈øne≈øs, and hater of iniquity, and the precepts and prohibitions he has publi≈øhed, we cannot but conclude, that the execution of judgment and the practice righteou≈øne≈øs, are what God ju≈øtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and demands from a people. Our natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God will not allow us to think of him as any other than an all perfect, and con≈øequently, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely holy and righteous being: As one, who will do no wrong to any of his creatures; but, in all his tran≈øactions with them, will ob≈øerve the ≈øtricte≈øt equity. To be≈øure, this is the idea which revelation every where conveys of the divine nature and conduct. He is there ≈øtiled, <hi>the ju≈øt God, the righteous Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And as to his dealing, we are a≈ø≈øured, that <hi>the judge of all the earth will do right</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xviii.25.</note> that <hi>he is excellent in judgment and in plenty of justice</hi>; <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Job xxvii.23.</note> that <hi>he will not lay upon man more than right</hi>; <note n="¬ß" place="bottom">Job xxiv.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

him.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts x.34, 35.</note> This being the character of God, it is evident that he mu≈øt delight in ≈øuch a character; and that the oppo≈øite to this, in any of his creatures, is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øing to him. Hence we read that <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteou≈øne≈øs, and his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the upright: To do judgment and ju≈øtice is more acceptable to the Lord than ≈øacrifice.</hi>

            <p>Here we may make a few brief ob≈øervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is natural for the injured to complain. All the pa≈ø≈øions and ≈øen≈øations of nature, have particular ways of expre≈ø≈øing them≈øelves: And the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions being natural, are univer≈øally felt and under≈øtood. External injuries, which occa≈øion bodily pains, cau≈øe groans and cries, which are the calls of nature for pity and relief. But keener pain and di≈øtre≈øs may be felt in the mind from the ill treatment we meet with from our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; a pain from grief, anger and other pa≈ø≈øions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt. And it is not more natural for a child to cry when it is hurt, than it is for the≈øe inward ≈øen≈øations to vent them≈øelves in ≈øome way of complaining. When any act of inju≈øtice is practi≈øed upon us, we feel our≈øelves injured, we feel our≈øelves impo≈øed on and di≈øhonored; and we cannot help feeling our re≈øentments kindle, our anger ri≈øe, and our grief excited, to find any of our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013278_0023_0F904A13EF7838C0"/>
fellow-creatures di≈øcovering ≈øuch a ba≈øe temper, and that we are the objects upon whom they practi≈øe it. Sometimes, when the injury is great or long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we feel the workings of revenge: We vent our pa≈ø≈øions in bitter language, in threats, if not in execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; (for the pa≈ø≈øions are apt to be extravagant, and <hi>oppre≈ø≈øion will make a wi≈øe man mad</hi>) <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccle≈ø. vii.7.</note> we utter our complaints <hi>of</hi> the injurious, if not <hi>to</hi> them: We pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh them to men, and ≈øometimes ≈øend them to heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not only <hi>natural,</hi> but the injured have a <hi>right</hi> to complain. They have a right from the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are the laws of God. If it is fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable for any natural cau≈øe to produce its nece≈ø≈øary effect; or for any natural law to have its genuine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then it mu≈øt be lawful and right for the pa≈ø≈øions and affections of human nature to expre≈øs them≈øelves in their natural language: Con≈øequently, the injured have a right to complain. Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have not only a right to <hi>complain,</hi> but to be <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>relieved.</hi> They have a right to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in former circum≈øtances and enjoyments; yea, in equity, a right to damages, or to be repaid for all lo≈ø≈øes and ≈øufferings. Be the <hi>injurer</hi> never ≈øo high in dignity, and the <hi>injured</hi> never ≈øo low in degree, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the ca≈øe. The <hi>greate≈øt</hi> has no <hi>right,</hi> though he may have <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> to do wrong, even to the <hi>meane≈øt</hi>; and if he does, the latter has not only a right to complain, but to ≈øeek redre≈øs, and to obtain it. The injured, indeed, have no right to u≈øe inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent language in their complaints, or improper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures in their endeavors to obtain relief. In a ≈øtate of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013278_0024_0F904A14B1AA6E88"/>
nature, the ≈øufferer may immediately avenge him≈øelf, or make repri≈øals, upon him that did the wrong. But in ≈øociety, where there are laws and civil government, redre≈øs mu≈øt be ≈øought in a legal way. Complaint may be made to the aggre≈ø≈øors; And in ca≈øe they refu≈øe to make amends, to tho≈øe who≈øe bu≈øine≈øs it is to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy abu≈øes, to puni≈øh evil-doers, and to redre≈øs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
            <p>"But what ≈øhall be done where the controver≈øy lies betwixt the ≈øupreme power, and a part of the ≈øubjects; where the former, is ≈øuppo≈øed by the latter, to di≈øtre≈øs and injure them; to encroach upon their rights and liberties?" I ≈øhall not pre≈øume to give a full an≈øwer to this que≈øtion; though I will venture to ≈øay, that an injured people have an undoubted right to complain, petition, and remon≈øtrate. This, to be≈øure, is a maxim in the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> con≈øtitution. "But what if all their complaints, petitions and remon≈øtrances are treated with neglect and contempt? To whom ≈øhall they appeal? or how ≈øhall they get redre≈øs? or mu≈øt they, like <hi>a≈ø≈øes,</hi> crouch down to every burden?" To this it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that as the ≈øupreme power has no more right to deprive any of the ≈øubjects of their privileges, than one ≈øubject has to injure another, they may lawfully ≈øeek redre≈øs, and ought to obtain it, and may take every method to obtain it that prudence and rea≈øon, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and the con≈øtitution will ju≈øtify. When a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and loyal people are oppre≈ø≈øed, they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prefer their petitions to heaven, in humble hope, that, <hi>no weapon formed again≈øt them</hi> ≈øhall be ≈øuffered to <hi>pro≈øper</hi>; but on the contrary, that they ≈øhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ≈øupported in their endeavors to maintain, or recover their ju≈øt rights, and liberties. But with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013278_0025_0F904A1573CCE8F8"/>
regard to the lawfulne≈øs of oppo≈øition, I choo≈øe to make u≈øe of thoughts and expre≈ø≈øions ≈øuperior to my own. "It is exceeding difficult to determine exactly where ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion ends, and re≈øi≈øtance may lawfully take place, ≈øo as to leave no room for men of bad minds unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonably to oppo≈øe government, and de≈øtroy the peace of ≈øociety. Mo≈øt certainly, people ought to bear much before they engage in any attempts again≈øt tho≈øe who are in authority. They ought to con≈øider their rulers as frail and fallible men, who are liable to mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and faults even when their general aim is good and right. They ≈øhould overlook their errors, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their vices, if they are not ≈øuch as tend directly to overturn the ≈øtate, and bring di≈øtre≈øs and ruin on the whole community. Better a particular per≈øon, yea many individuals ≈øhould ≈øuffer, than to encourage civil broils and a public di≈øturbance. But where rulers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their power to tyrannical purpo≈øes; when they evidently encroach on natural and con≈øtitutional rights; when they trample on tho≈øe laws which were made to limit the regal power, and defend the people, ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, if it can be avoided, is ≈øo far from being a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it is a crime. It is an offence again≈øt the ≈øtate of which we are members, and who≈øe happine≈øs we ought to prefer to our chief joy. It is an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt mankind, who≈øe rights we meanly betray. It is an offence again≈øt God, who is good to all, and who has appointed government for the welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and not for the de≈øtruction of his creatures." <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. ELIOT'S Election Sermon.</note> The injured therefore have not only a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but to be redre≈ø≈øed, and to make u≈øe of every con≈øtitutional mea≈øure to obtain redre≈øs. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013278_0026_0F904A163232C0F8"/>4. To deny them this right is a double injury and grievance. When a people have grounds to complain of uncon≈øtitutional mea≈øures in government, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated encroachments upon their privileges; and when they utter their complaints in decent language, though with that noble freedom and firmne≈øs, which a ≈øen≈øe of injury, joined with a love of liberty, will in≈øpire, and in≈øtead of being heard, and encouraged, meet with only contempt and di≈øgrace, how hard and injurious! And it ≈øeems the harder, when we reflect, that all earthly rulers ≈øhould be imitators of Him who≈øe <hi>kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> who≈øe ears are open to the petitions of every humble ≈øuppliant, and who hears even <hi>the ravens when they cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this leads to a more particular con≈øideration of the complicated ≈øin in the text, which is repre≈øented as ≈øo hateful to God, and injurious to men, viz <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion,</hi> which occa≈øions complaints and outcries.</p>
            <p>Men in power are not guilty of oppre≈ø≈øion, when they only u≈øe that authority, which the community has entru≈øted them with, for the general good. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, kings and ≈øubordinate magi≈øtrates may make an oppre≈ø≈øive u≈øe of their prerogatives and powers, if ≈øo di≈øpo≈øed. But ≈øo long as they keep within the bounds of the con≈øtitution, and in view of the general good, in the exerci≈øe of their authority, they are not to be accu≈øed of oppre≈ø≈øion. It is no more than their duty to exert the powers of their office to ≈øuch a degree as is nece≈ø≈øary to awe the licentious and turbulent, and to pre≈øerve the ≈øtate in harmony and quiet. Indeed, there is little need of exerci≈øing authority merely for the ≈øake of commanding reverence, or enforcing obedience,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013278_0027_0F904A16EE73A5B8"/>
where rulers make it appear that their talents and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions are equal to their ≈øtations, and that, not the gratification of their own private views, but the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community, is their end in governing.</p>
            <p>Neither is it oppre≈ø≈øion to put laws in execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt ob≈øtinate offenders. Here again, the be≈øt good of the community mu≈øt be the ≈øtandard. For it execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive officers were to con≈øtrue the law in the mo≈øt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ≈øen≈øe it would bear, and recognize every ≈øuppo≈øed breach of the letter of it, they might, under colour of law, greatly di≈øquiet and di≈øtre≈øs the ≈øubject. But when they only put the laws in execution for the puni≈øhment of evil-doers, and ≈øhew them≈øelves <hi>God's mini≈øters to execute wrath</hi> upon daring tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors, they are to be commended for fidelity in their office.</p>
            <p>Yea, where milder laws and puni≈øhments are found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øufficient, it is no part of oppre≈ø≈øion to in≈øtitute <hi>≈øeverer,</hi> and to put them in execution again≈øt ob≈øtinate offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who render life, liberty and property in≈øecure.</p>
            <p>And where <hi>rigor</hi> is nece≈ø≈øary for the good of the ≈øtate, <hi>rigor</hi> is not oppre≈ø≈øion.‚ÄîIt has often been tho't nece≈ø≈øary, and therefore it has been practi≈øed in ≈øome ca≈øes, to make examples of ≈øome leading tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors, by puni≈øhing them to the utmo≈øt extent of the law, <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to ≈øtrike an awe into others, and deter them from the like offences. Again,</p>
            <p>There may be in≈øtances wherein the innocent may be involved with the guilty, and ≈øuffer with them, or on their account, and yet tho≈øe who ordered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment not be guilty of oppre≈ø≈øion. Thus, when a man has committed trea≈øon, he not only forfeits his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013278_0028_0F904A17B4B360F8"/>
own life, but all his e≈øtate and titles to the king; and thereby his innocent family are degraded and di≈øtre≈ø≈øed. And when the inhabitants of a city, or province ri≈øe up in rebellion again≈øt their lawful prince, or lawful authority, it may occa≈øion the di≈øtre≈øs, and perhaps co≈øt the lives of many innocent per≈øons, to reduce them to obedience.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the rai≈øing of men for the defence of a nation again≈øt a dangerous enemy, is not oppre≈ø≈øion, though many perhaps are forced away from their friends and families, and u≈øeful employments, and return no more. In ≈øuch a ca≈øe, the general pre≈øervation ab≈øorbs all private connexions and concerns.</p>
            <p>Neither is levying taxes, in a con≈øtitutional way, for the defreying nece≈ø≈øary public expences, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as oppre≈ø≈øion, though ≈øuch taxes may be heavy and burden≈øome. Government mu≈øt be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the various officers that are requi≈øite for ≈øteering, managing and ≈øecuring the political ve≈ø≈øel, ought to be rewarded according to the dignity and importance of their re≈øpective ≈øtations, and their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in di≈øcharging the duties of them. Again,</p>
            <p>There may be ca≈øes, wherein one part of the nation may be more burdened, or enjoy fewer privileges than the re≈øt, and yet neither the king nor ≈øubordinate ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers be guilty of oppre≈ø≈øion, Many political di≈øad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages may ari≈øe from extreme di≈øtance from the centre of bu≈øine≈øs and of government; and from other unfavorable circum≈øtances that cannot be avoided in this imperfect ≈øtate. The various inhabitants of the earth, by rea≈øon of their different ≈øituations, do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually enjoy the benign influences of the ≈øun, and yet
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013278_0029_0F904A18DA6EF7C0"/>
there is no fault in this <hi>ruler of the day.</hi> "Every large community," ≈øays the author before quoted, "is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted of a number of little ≈øocieties, in which there will be different branches of bu≈øine≈øs. The≈øe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent connexions, and form ≈øeperate intere≈øts: It is va≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult for tho≈øe that govern, to keep the balance ≈øo exactly prized, as that neither part may be injured; but much more ≈øo, to prevent jealou≈øies and ≈øu≈øpicions that things are carried by favor and affection."</p>
            <p>Many other negative particulars might no doubt be ≈øugge≈øted by a per≈øon ver≈øed in politicks; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ≈øay po≈øitively,</p>
            <p>Oppre≈ø≈øion in rulers may be defined, an undue u≈øe, or ≈øtretch of power, to the injury of the ≈øubject.‚Äî "Whatever form of civil government men may have cho≈øen, there are certain fundamental laws which mark out and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people: And tho≈øe can be no other than what are mutually agreed on, and con≈øented to. Whatever au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therefore, the ≈øupreme power has to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ≈øtate, being an authority derived from the community and granted by them, can be ju≈øtly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement. To ≈øuppo≈øe otherwi≈øe, and that without a delegated power, and con≈øtitutional right, rulers may make laws, and appoint officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own arbitrary will and plea≈øure, is to defeat the great end of civil government." And this would be oppre≈ø≈øion and tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:013278_0030_0F904A1962102378"/>It is e≈ø≈øential to a free ≈øtate, that no member of it ≈øhall have his property taken from him by taxation, or any other way, unle≈øs by his own con≈øent, given per≈øonally, or by his repre≈øentative.

            <p>'Tis a glorious privilege of <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> to be tried by their peers: To deprive them of this, is uncon≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional and oppre≈ø≈øive.

            <p>When puni≈øhments are meditated and inflicted to gratify revenge, or merely to ≈øhew power and ≈øuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority; or when they greatly exceed the demerit of the crime; or involve a whole community in di≈øtre≈øs for the offences of a few. When acts are made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, yea, and enforced by military power, which, in general, are con≈øidered as uncon≈øtitutional and grievous; all the≈øe are in≈øtances of oppre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>It is arbitrary and oppre≈ø≈øive in rulers to infringe, curtail, and annihilate as they plea≈øe, tho≈øe charter rights which were granted to a people in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn and explicit manner. For if they can at plea≈øure take away ≈øuch grants without, nay, contrary to the con≈øent, without a hearing, of the per≈øons in their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013278_0031_0F904A1C4A7BBB28"/>
to whom tho≈øe grants were made, what is there that they may not take away, ≈øince by tho≈øe grants they are ≈øuppo≈øed to hold all their liberties and all their e≈øtates?</p>
            <p>Other in≈øtances of oppre≈ø≈øion in rulers might be reckoned up; but I would now ob≈øerve, as was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that it is not a vice peculiar to men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but may be committed by people one among another. When people oppo≈øe the authority of their rulers, it is generally called in≈øurrection and rebellion. And when a mob a≈ø≈øumes the government into their own hands, they are in danger of committing ≈øuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and outrage as are many degrees beyond the guilt and mi≈øchief of bare oppre≈ø≈øion. Yea, people, where they are not guilty of lawle≈øs riots, may combine and impo≈øe ≈øuch re≈øtrictions, and ≈øevere conditions upon others, with intimidating threats, as ≈øhew that they them≈øelves are as tyrannical, imperious and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øive, as arbitrary rulers. In common dealings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, men may oppre≈øs one another by cheating, over-reaching and taking advantage of their nece≈ø≈øities, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ≈øimplicity. The rich may oppre≈øs the poor by ≈øevere exactions; by taking them at di≈øtre≈øs; by harra≈ø≈øing them at law; and many other ways. Yea, people are guilty of oppre≈ø≈øion, not only by every act of trepa≈øs, fraud, and inju≈øtice; but by every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned and needle≈øs delay of paying their ju≈øt debts, whereby damage or difficulty accrues to the creditor.</p>
            <p>That the word, <hi>oppre≈ø≈øion,</hi> is u≈øed in the≈øe ≈øen≈øes by the ≈øacred writers, is evident from a multitude of texts, which I ≈øhall leave you to recollect and peru≈øe at your lei≈øure; only ob≈øerving, that the command to <hi>I≈ørael</hi>

like a vineyard who≈øe fence is broken down, and which has nothing to ≈øecure it from ravage and de≈øtruction.

            <p>Being thus led to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of the ≈øubject, I would gladly apply it to our≈øelves on this occa≈øion: But I feel a peculiar difficulty in expre≈ø≈øing my≈øelf at this ≈øea≈øon of doubtful, anxious expectation. Though I am full, I ≈øcarce know what to ≈øay; but, in general, to exhort and be≈øeech you to repent, and throughly to amend every thing that is ami≈øs in your temper and conduct; and to cry mightily to God, that he would turn away his anger from us, replace us in the favor of our King, and in the enjoyment of our liberties.</p>
            <p>It is ≈øaid, that 'God helps tho≈øe that help them≈øelves.' But what can we do? Our harbour is blocked up by ≈øhips of war; armed ≈øoldiers, in ho≈øtile appearance, are planted in our metropolis; the trade of that once flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing Town is de≈øtroyed; its inhabitants greatly di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øed and impoveri≈øhed; and multitudes in danger of being ≈øtarved, were it not for the charity of others. And to compleat the concern and di≈øtre≈øs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we find by the la≈øt accounts from <hi>England,</hi> that ≈øeveral other acts have pa≈ø≈øed both hou≈øes of parliament,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013278_0035_0F8FB8CE73171DE8"/>
whereby our mo≈øt important charter-privileges are wre≈øted from us. And all, for what? Becau≈øe we have renounced ≈øubjection to the King of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and have ≈øet up for independency? Becau≈øe we are unwilling to be on the ≈øame footing with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and fellow-≈øubjects in <hi>England,</hi> and refu≈øe to take up with the ≈øame privileges which they enjoy? By no means. It is not on account of all, or of any one of the≈øe rea≈øons. For we rejoice in being the ≈øubjects of King GEORGE: We rejoice in being part of the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> dominions; and we con≈øider a clo≈øe, con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional connexion with the nation as our ≈øafety, our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, and our glory. We want nothing but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> ≈øubjects, and to be con≈øidered and treated as entitled to them. We are unwilling to have our e≈øtates, or our charter-rights at the arbitrary di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal of a di≈øtant legi≈ølature, in which we can have no voice. We mean only to maintain tho≈øe privileges, which were confirmed to our fathers, and have been tran≈ømitted to us, and to which we have an unque≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable right as <hi>men,</hi> and as <hi>Engli≈øhmen.</hi> We have no de≈øign to oppo≈øe any authority that is con≈øtitutionally founded and exerci≈øed; but only to <hi>≈øtand fast in the liberty wherewith God,</hi> and our charter, <hi>hath made us free.</hi> And yet, ≈øuch is the indignity and cruelty with which we are treated, as mentioned above! And amid≈øt all the≈øe oppre≈ø≈øions, we have little, or no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to petition or complain, but only to heaven. If any ≈øtand up for us and interceed in our behalf, they are ≈øcorn'd and di≈øgrac'd: If we con≈øult together for mutual ≈øecurity, we are deemed mobi≈øh and riotous: If we attempt to throw off our burdens, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd as rebels: If we adopt the mo≈øt peaceable method to help our≈øelves, by laying a≈øide all luxuries

and ≈øuperfluities, and ≈øub≈øi≈øting by our own indu≈øtry and frugality (which is no more than our di≈øtre≈ø≈øed ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation renders nece≈ø≈øary) we are rail'd and proclaim'd again≈øt as traitors. What then can be done? What ≈øteps can be taken by us for our relief? There is one cour≈øe which rea≈øon and religion point out as the mo≈øt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and which, if univer≈øally adopted, and per≈øevered in (as God grant it may be) will greatly mitigate, if not wholly remove, the calamities we ≈øuffer; and that is, to <hi>live ≈øoberly, righteou≈øly, and godly in the world. Sobriety</hi> includes frugality and temperance, the retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every unnece≈ø≈øary expence, and reducing every inordinate appetite to the ≈øtandard of rea≈øon. <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs</hi> comprehends all tho≈øe duties we owe to one another, and which, if generally practi≈øed, will obviate innumerable difficulties, and make a ≈øociety comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ea≈øy, united and pro≈øperous. <hi>Godline≈øs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes the duties which more immediately re≈øpect our Creator, which are attended with inward ≈øatisfaction, and, in conjunction with the foregoing virtues, never fail to conciliate the favor of heaven, and to procure freedom and happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>The a≈øpects of providence are indeed gloomy and perplexing: More ≈øo perhaps, than ever they were ≈øince our fathers fled from oppre≈ø≈øion at home, to the woods of <hi>America.</hi> But let us not be overwhelmed with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly and de≈øpair, which unhinge the mind, unbrace our re≈øolutions, and unnerve our endeavors. There have heretofore been <hi>Days, wherein God afflicted</hi> our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øtors, and <hi>Years, wherein they ≈øaw evil</hi>

               <hi>turned again and cau≈øed his face to ≈øhine upon them, and they were ≈øaved.</hi> Let us, for our encouragement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the years of the right hand of the mo≈øt High, and the works he did in the days of our fathers, when they made God their refuge and confidence, in the way of well-doing, and found him <hi>a very pre≈øent help in trouble.</hi> He is the ≈øame God, <hi>merciful and gracious, long-≈øuffering, and abundant in goodne≈øs and truth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covenant and mercy for thou≈øands, forgiving iniquity, tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion and ≈øin.</hi> And if we do not retain our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities as a wall of ≈øeparation between God and us, to hinder good things from us, we ≈øhall yet be a free and a happy people. Indeed, when we con≈øider our abounding immoralities, our fle≈øh may well trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for fear of God, and we may be afraid of his judgments. The calamities we feel, are no doubt the tokens of the divine di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt us for our ≈øins: For God does not pour out the vials of his wrath upon a people, unle≈øs to puni≈øh them for their di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Though we are unwilling to own that we have forfeited our privileges into the hands of men, yet mu≈øt we not confe≈øs, that by our ingratitude and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion again≈øt heaven, we have forfeited them all into the hands of God? Though we have been under peculiar obligations, being a free and enlightened people, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe loving kindne≈øs, judgment and righteou≈øne≈øs in the earth; yet when God <hi>looked for judgment, hath he not beheld oppre≈ø≈øion; and for righteou≈øne≈øs hath he not heard a cry?</hi> Have we not practi≈øed too much of the ≈øame oppre≈ø≈øive, encroaching, tyrannical temper towards one another, which we have complained of in ≈øome of our rulers towards us?

him that freedom to which he had a right? Have we not been too apt to cen≈øure and condemn the views and mea≈øures of men in office? Have we not abu≈øed the ine≈øtimable privileges we have enjoyed as men, as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, and as <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> ≈øubjects, to the purpo≈øes of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou≈øne≈øs and extravagance? And is it not for this that we are puni≈øhed by the diminution of them? But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever particular vices have provoked God to bring us low by oppre≈ø≈øion, it behoves us to be ≈øincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal in our repentance and reformation, and then we ≈øhall be ≈øure of getting rid of our wor≈øt enemies. Let us ≈øearch and try our ways and turn to the Lord with our whole heart and not feignedly, and then he will have mercy upon us, and deliver us out of the hand of the oppre≈ø≈øor, and we ≈øhall no longer <hi>cry out of wrong and not be heard.</hi> Let us, in this day of adver≈øity, humble our≈øelves under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt us in due time.
