            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is part of the explanation and application of a very pertinent and inſtructive parable; wherein, under the ſimilitude of a vineyard, the divine tenderneſs and care, and <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs and danger, are plainly pointed out. <hi>My welbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted it with the choiceſt vine, and built a tower in the midſt of it, and alſo made a winepreſs therein: And he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes And now, O inhabitants of Jeruſalem and men of Judah judge I pray you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013278_0004_0F8FB8CC2BAD4640"/>
Wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? and now, go to I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof and it ſhall be eaten up: And break down the wall thereof and it ſhall be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down. And I will lay it waſte; it ſhall not be pruned, nor digged; but there ſhall come up briers and thorns: I will alſo command the clouds, that they rain no rain upon it:</hi> As from the firſt to the fifth verſe.</p>
            <p>From this repreſentation it appears, that God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people were moſt highly privileged; that they had all the means of temporal and ſpiritual proſperity in their hands; yet that they miſimproved and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them; were ungrateful and diſobedient, and thereby provoked God to withdraw his ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from them, and leave them expoſed to waſting calamities.—That they need not fail of underſtanding the parable, and applying it to themſelves, the prophet adds, as in the verſe of which our text is part; <hi>For the vineyard of the Lord of boſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant: And he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for judgment, but behold oppreſſion; for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but behold a cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus connected and introduced, evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply us with theſe three topicks of diſcourſe, viz.
<list>
                  <item>I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteouſneſs, are what God expects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from a people. Nevertheleſs,</item>
                  <item>II. They are ſometimes ſo degenerate as, inſtead of judgment, to be guilty of oppreſſion; and inſtead of righteouſneſs, to occaſion a cry.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013278_0005_0F904A029715CA40"/>III. When this is the caſe with a people, he may juſtly leave them to the fatal conſequences of their folly and wickedneſs, or ſend other diſtreſſing judgments among them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteouſneſs, are what God expects and demands from a people. <hi>He looked for judgment—and for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> God had done ſo much for his people <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> both in an ordinary and extraordinary way, that he had all the reaſon in the world (ſpeaking after the manner of men) to expect that they ſhould be a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and holy people. God, indeed, has juſt reaſon to expect an obſervance of the laws of righteouſneſs from every ſociety of rational creatures, and from every individual, ſo far as thoſe laws may be known. And the greater advantages any perſon or people have to know and obſerve thoſe laws, the greater is their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to obſerve them.—But this point may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the execution of judgment, and the practice of righteouſneſs are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the nature and conſtitution of man. God manifeſts his will by the operations of his hands, as well as by the dictates of his word. Mankind in general ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts; particularly the law of juſtice and equity. We are born with a ſenſe of right and wrong, which grows quicker and ſtronger, as we advance in age, unleſs weakened, corrupted and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne by education and example. There is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within us that approves of the practice of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and condemns wrong and injuſtice. Even ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage nations retain this ſenſe, and have rules among
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013278_0006_0F904A02B7B6D140"/>
them of equitable dealing. And though there are ſome that live by plundering and robbing their neighbours, yet they do not like to be plundered and robbed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but retain amongſt one another the practice of juſtice. Now, ſuch being the impreſſions made on the hearts of men by the hand of their Creator, it is plain that he requires them to preſerve theſe impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to do nothing to obliterate them; to ſquare their conduct by them; that being upright and honeſt in their dealings, they may anſwer God's reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from them, by promoting the general order and felicity of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider the moral character of the deity, as being a lover of righteouſneſs, and hater of iniquity, and the precepts and prohibitions he has publiſhed, we cannot but conclude, that the execution of judgment and the practice righteouſneſs, are what God juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and demands from a people. Our natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God will not allow us to think of him as any other than an all perfect, and conſequently, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely holy and righteous being: As one, who will do no wrong to any of his creatures; but, in all his tranſactions with them, will obſerve the ſtricteſt equity. To beſure, this is the idea which revelation every where conveys of the divine nature and conduct. He is there ſtiled, <hi>the juſt God, the righteous Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And as to his dealing, we are aſſured, that <hi>the judge of all the earth will do right</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xviii.25.</note> that <hi>he is excellent in judgment and in plenty of justice</hi>; <note n="†" place="bottom">Job xxvii.23.</note> that <hi>he will not lay upon man more than right</hi>; <note n="§" place="bottom">Job xxiv.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts x.34, 35.</note> This being the character of God, it is evident that he muſt delight in ſuch a character; and that the oppoſite to this, in any of his creatures, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him. Hence we read that <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth the upright: To do judgment and juſtice is more acceptable to the Lord than ſacrifice.</hi>

The laws of every commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould be ſo framed, as to ſecure the rights of the whole; and protect the perſon and property of every individual, and to reſtrain and puniſh all acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and injuſtice. For, though by being members of ſociety, ſome part of our natural liberty is given up; yet not ſo much of it is given up, as that any other member, or members of ſociety, how great ſoever, may lawfully enſlave us, or deprive us of our property, we remaining innocent. Our perſons and earnings are our own; and we have a right to the unmoleſted enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; yea, we ought to be protected in the enjoyment of them, ſo long as we remain the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able members of the community. It is incumbent on legiſlators to contrive and enact the moſt equitable laws; ſuch as are moſt conducive to the ſecurity and proſperity of the ſtate. And when ſuch laws are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, juſtice requires that they ſhould be obſerved. No individual, not the King himſelf, is above law, or has liberty to go contrary to, or beſide the conſtitution of the kingdom. The king of heaven <hi>exerciſeth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſs in the earth, and deligheth,</hi> and commandeth the kings of the earth to imitate him <hi>therein.</hi> The higheſt human potentate has not the leaſt power or permiſſion, by the laws of nature or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, to do wrong, to pervert judgment and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or to injure the meaneſt of his ſubjects. The rules of righteouſneſs and equity are the rules of <hi>his</hi> conduct, as well as of others. The ſafety and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

of the people is the ſupreme law by which the prince, and all ſubordinate magiſtrates ſhould govern themſelves; the higheſt point at which they ſhould aim.</p>
            <p>An inſpired king, and the wiſeſt of the ſons of men ſays, <hi>Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxv.5.</note> When the throne is eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs, every edict that proceeds from it will be mild, where mildneſs will anſwer the end: And where ſeverity is neceſſary, ſtill the laws of juſtice and equity will not be violated. <hi>Juſtice and judgment are the habitation of God's throne:</hi> And this is a model for earthly kings. Puniſhment is God's <hi>ſtrange work</hi>; and it ſhould be equally the <hi>ſtrange work</hi> of princes and magiſtrates. Puniſhment ſhould never be inflicted, but when the ſafety and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the community require it; never, to gratify the reſentment and revenge of a prince, or his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; never, to awe and intimidate to unworthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. And if light and gentle corrections will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end, heavier ſhould never be made uſe of.</p>
            <p>As it is the buſineſs of legiſlators to enact the moſt equitable laws, ſo it is the part of executive officers to ſee that ſuch laws are obeyed. And if they are juſt magiſtrates, actuated by a principle of righteouſneſs and equity, or a regard to the people's intereſt, they will avoid every thing that will fruſtrate the attainment of this end. Thoſe that ſit on the tribunal, will hold the balances of juſtice with an equal and impartial hand.

            <p>But God not only <hi>looketh for judgment</hi> from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and magiſtrates, but for <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> alſo from the common people. In all their commerce with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, juſtice and equity ſhould be their invariable ſtandard. They muſt never go beyond, nor defraud one another in their dealings; never injure another in his perſon, property, or good name. In all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with their fellow men, they muſt obſerve the golden rule, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. vii.12.</note> It argues a corrupt and diſhoneſt mind, for any to expect the exerciſe of juſtice in others towards themſelves, and to practiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice themſelves towards others. 'Tis abſurd and wicked for any to conduct as if righteouſneſs and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonged only to rulers and judges, or were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined only to courts of judicature, or became obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory only in conſequence of human laws. To refrain from injuring and wronging another; to pay every one his due; to treat every one with that tenderneſs, reſpect and deference, which his particular ſtation, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and merit demand, are duties which primarily reſult not from the laws of man, but from the laws of nature which are the laws of God. They are duties in all ages and nations, under all forms of government, and even where human eſtabliſhments were never framed. Therefore, to withhold from another his juſt right, or to offer him any injury, becauſe there is no human authority to oblige him to pay the one, or to puniſh him for offering the other, is diſhoneſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. The rules of righteouſneſs oblige people to <hi>ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute is due; cuſtom, to whom cuſtom; fear, to whom fear; honor,

That the execution of judgment, and the pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice of righteouſneſs are what God expects and demands from a people, may be argued from the tendency of thoſe virtues to the happineſs of a people, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary tendency of oppreſſion and injuſtice.</p>
            <p>It is evident from the conſtitution of man; from the furniture of his mind and the diſpoſition of his heart; from the chain of love which runs through the whole, and links man to man, and forms them into ſocieties; from the bountiful proviſion that is made throughout the creation, for their accommodation, defence, and pleaſure; from all theſe things, as well as from reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, it is evident, that the father of the univerſe, the great head of the ſocial ſyſtem, conſults the good and happineſs of human ſociety, and that he would have all the members of it do the ſame. And he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed ſuch a ſyſtem of laws, as, if duly obſerved, <hi>will</hi> promote the intereſt of the whole.

            <p>When a people are all righteous; when the rules of equity and juſtice are heartily loved and practiſed by all ranks of men, things muſt go well in the midſt of them. If kings, governors, and all ſubordinate magiſtrates and rulers, are influenced by principles of integrity, how greatly conducive are they to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of their ſubjects, and their own? They will not, in this caſe, frame any laws but what tend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good. They will endeavor that "the advantages of the conſtitution and of the laws, may extend to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch, and to each individual in ſociety, of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever degree; that every man may enjoy his property, and purſue his honeſt courſe of life with ſecurity. Such rulers will attend to the operation of their own acts, and will repeal whatever laws, upon an impartial review, they find to be inconſiſtent with the laws of God, with the rights of men, and the general benefits of ſaints. Stability in promoting the public good, leads to a change of meaſures, when the intereſt of a community requires it, which muſt often be the caſe in this mutable, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate." It muſt be evident that ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in rulers (an invariable regard to the rules of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and juſtice) muſt have a moſt direct tendency to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013278_0014_0F904A075A133F48"/>
the happineſs of a people, and to their own honor, eaſe and intereſt, in both worlds. As to themſelves, ſuch an upright conduct will afford them the moſt peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and joyous reflections, and a heart-felt pleaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſuperior to any that can be adminiſtred by the ſervile flatterer. Yea, they will be able to appeal to God in the language of governor <hi>Nehemiah, Think upon me my GOD for good, according to all that I have done for this people</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Neh. v.19.</note> or in that of king <hi>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight</hi>

            <p>If rulers are pious towards GOD, and benevolent and juſt towards men, it will have a happy and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to transfuſe a ſpirit of piety, benevolence and juſtice through the body of the people. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is very influential, eſpecially in ſuperiors. The lower claſſes of mankind look up to thoſe above them for patterns of behavior as well as dreſs; and eaſily ſlide into the imitation of thoſe whom they conſider as their betters. Happy would it be for people, if they always found in the higher claſſes, examples of piety and juſtice ſuitable to be followed! Pious rulers,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013278_0015_0F904A0829E19690"/>
like pious miniſters, are the lights of the world, diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a benign influence all around, attracting regard, and inviting imitation.</p>
            <p>And when people in general follow after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, charity and godlineſs; when <hi>judgment runs down as waters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream,</hi> how great muſt be their ſecurity and proſperity! When iniquity ſtoppeth her mouth, and juſtice has a free courſe among all orders of men, the body politic will feel eaſy and free, healthy and joyous. There will be no complaints of injuſtice and violence, of tyranny and oppreſſion, of anarchy and diſobedience. <hi>No man will ſeek his own, but every man another's wealth</hi> and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. As chriſtians, they will <hi>ſtudy the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one may edify</hi> and benefit <hi>another.</hi> Neighborhoods, towns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces will live in the peaceable enjoyment of life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property; <hi>every one ſitting under his own vine and figtree, and none making him afraid.</hi> They will eat the fruit of their own labor, dwell in the land ſecurely, ſee the good of God's choſen, and rejoice in the gladneſs of his nation. All <hi>their officers being peace, and their exactors righteouſneſs, violence and ſpoil ſhall no more be heard in their land, waſting and deſtruction within their borders; but they ſhall call their walls ſalvation, and their gates praiſe.</hi>

            <p>And if it ſhould at any time happen, through the neceſſary imperfection of the greateſt and beſt minds, that ſome grievances took place; a people having ſuch rulers as were actuated by principles of integrity, would not be greatly depreſſed, having confidence, that their

complaints would be patiently heard, their juſt petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted, and every unneceſſary burden removed. The innocent would have no cauſe to fear being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with the guilty; but on the contrary, would be ſupported and protected in their juſt rights. And where controverſies were to be ſettled by the deciſion of magiſtrates and judges, how happy muſt the parties be, from a confidence, that the courts of judicature were conſtitutional and uncorrupt; that they could obtain a fair trial; that judges and jurors were upright and impartial, and under no undue influence to favor one more than another; that they would determine with wiſdom, and <hi>judge righteous judgment?</hi>

"Terrible are the effects of this corrupt paſſion, when rulers are venal, and juſtice itſelf is bought and ſold." If ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be their leading principle, every thing elſe, even liberty itſelf, and the moſt ſacred rights, muſt give way thereto. If their tempers are naturally ſevere, they will "incline to write their laws in blood; which will keep a ſociety unquiet, and be apt to approach the verge of tyranny." And where men of arbitrary principles are at the helm, they will "diſpoſe of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, property and life, in ſpite of the moſt venerable rights deſcended from diſtant ages; in ſpite of the voice of reaſon, the maxims of equity, and the claims of conſcience.—No juſtice reſtrains; no mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents." The cries of the oppreſſed, are unheard and unpitied; the needy and the fatherleſs are cruſhed in the gates. "Does any one diſpute or lift up his hand, fire comes out of the bramble, and deſtroys the cedars of <hi>Lebanon.</hi>" In fine, where the ſelfiſh paſſions are predominant, in thoſe that govern, honor and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will be but ſlender reſtraints from oppreſſion and wrong; and if places of honor and profit can be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to themſelves and families, no matter what is ſacrificed in attaining them; not even the freedom of their country, or the rights of their countrymen ſhall be regarded.</p>
            <p>And if thoſe who are in executive authority are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, partial, and corrupt, what injuſtice and miſery will be likely to happen amongſt the people? If judges are appointed, and rewarded, and kept in place, not during, or according to good behavior, but ſolely at the will of the prince; yea, if jurors, and every other

            <p>Here we may make a few brief obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is natural for the injured to complain. All the paſſions and ſenſations of nature, have particular ways of expreſſing themſelves: And theſe expreſſions being natural, are univerſally felt and underſtood. External injuries, which occaſion bodily pains, cauſe groans and cries, which are the calls of nature for pity and relief. But keener pain and diſtreſs may be felt in the mind from the ill treatment we meet with from our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; a pain from grief, anger and other paſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt. And it is not more natural for a child to cry when it is hurt, than it is for theſe inward ſenſations to vent themſelves in ſome way of complaining. When any act of injuſtice is practiſed upon us, we feel ourſelves injured, we feel ourſelves impoſed on and diſhonored; and we cannot help feeling our reſentments kindle, our anger riſe, and our grief excited, to find any of our
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013278_0023_0F904A13EF7838C0"/>
fellow-creatures diſcovering ſuch a baſe temper, and that we are the objects upon whom they practiſe it. Sometimes, when the injury is great or long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we feel the workings of revenge: We vent our paſſions in bitter language, in threats, if not in execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; (for the paſſions are apt to be extravagant, and <hi>oppreſſion will make a wiſe man mad</hi>) <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſ. vii.7.</note> we utter our complaints <hi>of</hi> the injurious, if not <hi>to</hi> them: We pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them to men, and ſometimes ſend them to heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not only <hi>natural,</hi> but the injured have a <hi>right</hi> to complain. They have a right from the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are the laws of God. If it is fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for any natural cauſe to produce its neceſſary effect; or for any natural law to have its genuine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then it muſt be lawful and right for the paſſions and affections of human nature to expreſs themſelves in their natural language: Conſequently, the injured have a right to complain. Yea,</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have not only a right to <hi>complain,</hi> but to be <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>relieved.</hi> They have a right to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in former circumſtances and enjoyments; yea, in equity, a right to damages, or to be repaid for all loſſes and ſufferings. Be the <hi>injurer</hi> never ſo high in dignity, and the <hi>injured</hi> never ſo low in degree, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the caſe. The <hi>greateſt</hi> has no <hi>right,</hi> though he may have <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> to do wrong, even to the <hi>meaneſt</hi>; and if he does, the latter has not only a right to complain, but to ſeek redreſs, and to obtain it. The injured, indeed, have no right to uſe inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent language in their complaints, or improper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in their endeavors to obtain relief. In a ſtate of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013278_0024_0F904A14B1AA6E88"/>
nature, the ſufferer may immediately avenge himſelf, or make repriſals, upon him that did the wrong. But in ſociety, where there are laws and civil government, redreſs muſt be ſought in a legal way. Complaint may be made to the aggreſſors; And in caſe they refuſe to make amends, to thoſe whoſe buſineſs it is to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy abuſes, to puniſh evil-doers, and to redreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured.</p>
            <p>"But what ſhall be done where the controverſy lies betwixt the ſupreme power, and a part of the ſubjects; where the former, is ſuppoſed by the latter, to diſtreſs and injure them; to encroach upon their rights and liberties?" I ſhall not preſume to give a full anſwer to this queſtion; though I will venture to ſay, that an injured people have an undoubted right to complain, petition, and remonſtrate. This, to beſure, is a maxim in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution. "But what if all their complaints, petitions and remonſtrances are treated with neglect and contempt? To whom ſhall they appeal? or how ſhall they get redreſs? or muſt they, like <hi>aſſes,</hi> crouch down to every burden?" To this it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that as the ſupreme power has no more right to deprive any of the ſubjects of their privileges, than one ſubject has to injure another, they may lawfully ſeek redreſs, and ought to obtain it, and may take every method to obtain it that prudence and reaſon, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and the conſtitution will juſtify. When a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and loyal people are oppreſſed, they may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prefer their petitions to heaven, in humble hope, that, <hi>no weapon formed againſt them</hi> ſhall be ſuffered to <hi>proſper</hi>; but on the contrary, that they ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ſupported in their endeavors to maintain, or recover their juſt rights, and liberties. But with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013278_0025_0F904A1573CCE8F8"/>
regard to the lawfulneſs of oppoſition, I chooſe to make uſe of thoughts and expreſſions ſuperior to my own. "It is exceeding difficult to determine exactly where ſubmiſſion ends, and reſiſtance may lawfully take place, ſo as to leave no room for men of bad minds unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to oppoſe government, and deſtroy the peace of ſociety. Moſt certainly, people ought to bear much before they engage in any attempts againſt thoſe who are in authority. They ought to conſider their rulers as frail and fallible men, who are liable to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes and faults even when their general aim is good and right. They ſhould overlook their errors, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their vices, if they are not ſuch as tend directly to overturn the ſtate, and bring diſtreſs and ruin on the whole community. Better a particular perſon, yea many individuals ſhould ſuffer, than to encourage civil broils and a public diſturbance. But where rulers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their power to tyrannical purpoſes; when they evidently encroach on natural and conſtitutional rights; when they trample on thoſe laws which were made to limit the regal power, and defend the people, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, if it can be avoided, is ſo far from being a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it is a crime. It is an offence againſt the ſtate of which we are members, and whoſe happineſs we ought to prefer to our chief joy. It is an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mankind, whoſe rights we meanly betray. It is an offence againſt God, who is good to all, and who has appointed government for the welfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not for the deſtruction of his creatures." <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. ELIOT'S Election Sermon.</note> The injured therefore have not only a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but to be redreſſed, and to make uſe of every conſtitutional meaſure to obtain redreſs. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:013278_0026_0F904A163232C0F8"/>4. To deny them this right is a double injury and grievance. When a people have grounds to complain of unconſtitutional meaſures in government, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated encroachments upon their privileges; and when they utter their complaints in decent language, though with that noble freedom and firmneſs, which a ſenſe of injury, joined with a love of liberty, will inſpire, and inſtead of being heard, and encouraged, meet with only contempt and diſgrace, how hard and injurious! And it ſeems the harder, when we reflect, that all earthly rulers ſhould be imitators of Him whoſe <hi>kingdom ruleth over all,</hi> whoſe ears are open to the petitions of every humble ſuppliant, and who hears even <hi>the ravens when they cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this leads to a more particular conſideration of the complicated ſin in the text, which is repreſented as ſo hateful to God, and injurious to men, viz <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> which occaſions complaints and outcries.</p>
            <p>Men in power are not guilty of oppreſſion, when they only uſe that authority, which the community has entruſted them with, for the general good. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, kings and ſubordinate magiſtrates may make an oppreſſive uſe of their prerogatives and powers, if ſo diſpoſed. But ſo long as they keep within the bounds of the conſtitution, and in view of the general good, in the exerciſe of their authority, they are not to be accuſed of oppreſſion. It is no more than their duty to exert the powers of their office to ſuch a degree as is neceſſary to awe the licentious and turbulent, and to preſerve the ſtate in harmony and quiet. Indeed, there is little need of exerciſing authority merely for the ſake of commanding reverence, or enforcing obedience,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013278_0027_0F904A16EE73A5B8"/>
where rulers make it appear that their talents and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are equal to their ſtations, and that, not the gratification of their own private views, but the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community, is their end in governing.</p>
            <p>Neither is it oppreſſion to put laws in execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt obſtinate offenders. Here again, the beſt good of the community muſt be the ſtandard. For it execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive officers were to conſtrue the law in the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſenſe it would bear, and recognize every ſuppoſed breach of the letter of it, they might, under colour of law, greatly diſquiet and diſtreſs the ſubject. But when they only put the laws in execution for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and ſhew themſelves <hi>God's miniſters to execute wrath</hi> upon daring tranſgreſſors, they are to be commended for fidelity in their office.</p>
            <p>Yea, where milder laws and puniſhments are found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, it is no part of oppreſſion to inſtitute <hi>ſeverer,</hi> and to put them in execution againſt obſtinate offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who render life, liberty and property inſecure.</p>
            <p>And where <hi>rigor</hi> is neceſſary for the good of the ſtate, <hi>rigor</hi> is not oppreſſion.—It has often been tho't neceſſary, and therefore it has been practiſed in ſome caſes, to make examples of ſome leading tranſgreſſors, by puniſhing them to the utmoſt extent of the law, <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to ſtrike an awe into others, and deter them from the like offences. Again,</p>
            <p>There may be inſtances wherein the innocent may be involved with the guilty, and ſuffer with them, or on their account, and yet thoſe who ordered the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment not be guilty of oppreſſion. Thus, when a man has committed treaſon, he not only forfeits his
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013278_0028_0F904A17B4B360F8"/>
own life, but all his eſtate and titles to the king; and thereby his innocent family are degraded and diſtreſſed. And when the inhabitants of a city, or province riſe up in rebellion againſt their lawful prince, or lawful authority, it may occaſion the diſtreſs, and perhaps coſt the lives of many innocent perſons, to reduce them to obedience.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the raiſing of men for the defence of a nation againſt a dangerous enemy, is not oppreſſion, though many perhaps are forced away from their friends and families, and uſeful employments, and return no more. In ſuch a caſe, the general preſervation abſorbs all private connexions and concerns.</p>
            <p>Neither is levying taxes, in a conſtitutional way, for the defreying neceſſary public expences, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as oppreſſion, though ſuch taxes may be heavy and burdenſome. Government muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and the various officers that are requiſite for ſteering, managing and ſecuring the political veſſel, ought to be rewarded according to the dignity and importance of their reſpective ſtations, and their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in diſcharging the duties of them. Again,</p>
            <p>There may be caſes, wherein one part of the nation may be more burdened, or enjoy fewer privileges than the reſt, and yet neither the king nor ſubordinate ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers be guilty of oppreſſion, Many political diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages may ariſe from extreme diſtance from the centre of buſineſs and of government; and from other unfavorable circumſtances that cannot be avoided in this imperfect ſtate. The various inhabitants of the earth, by reaſon of their different ſituations, do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually enjoy the benign influences of the ſun, and yet
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013278_0029_0F904A18DA6EF7C0"/>
there is no fault in this <hi>ruler of the day.</hi> "Every large community," ſays the author before quoted, "is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of a number of little ſocieties, in which there will be different branches of buſineſs. Theſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent connexions, and form ſeperate intereſts: It is vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult for thoſe that govern, to keep the balance ſo exactly prized, as that neither part may be injured; but much more ſo, to prevent jealouſies and ſuſpicions that things are carried by favor and affection."</p>
            <p>Many other negative particulars might no doubt be ſuggeſted by a perſon verſed in politicks; but I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſay poſitively,</p>
            <p>Oppreſſion in rulers may be defined, an undue uſe, or ſtretch of power, to the injury of the ſubject.— "Whatever form of civil government men may have choſen, there are certain fundamental laws which mark out and fix the chief lines and boundaries between the authority of rulers, and the liberties and privileges of the people: And thoſe can be no other than what are mutually agreed on, and conſented to. Whatever au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority therefore, the ſupreme power has to make laws, to appoint officers, &amp;c. for the regulation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtate, being an authority derived from the community and granted by them, can be juſtly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed only within certain limits, and to a certain extent, according to agreement. To ſuppoſe otherwiſe, and that without a delegated power, and conſtitutional right, rulers may make laws, and appoint officers for their execution, and force them into effect, i. e. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own arbitrary will and pleaſure, is to defeat the great end of civil government." And this would be oppreſſion and tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:013278_0030_0F904A1962102378"/>It is eſſential to a free ſtate, that no member of it ſhall have his property taken from him by taxation, or any other way, unleſs by his own conſent, given perſonally, or by his repreſentative. To infringe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this right is another inſtance of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>'Tis a glorious privilege of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to be tried by their peers: To deprive them of this, is unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional and oppreſſive. To place courts of judicature upon ſuch an eſtabliſhment as to be expoſed to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and corruption; or ſo as that one contending party may have it in his power to diſtreſs, or ruin the other; to turn away the needy from their right, and prevent juſtice from taking place; this would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: This would be to <hi>turn judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteouſneſs into hemlock.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Amos vi.12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When puniſhments are meditated and inflicted to gratify revenge, or merely to ſhew power and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority; or when they greatly exceed the demerit of the crime; or involve a whole community in diſtreſs for the offences of a few. When acts are made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, yea, and enforced by military power, which, in general, are conſidered as unconſtitutional and grievous; all theſe are inſtances of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>It is arbitrary and oppreſſive in rulers to infringe, curtail, and annihilate as they pleaſe, thoſe charter rights which were granted to a people in the moſt ſolemn and explicit manner. For if they can at pleaſure take away ſuch grants without, nay, contrary to the conſent, without a hearing, of the perſons in their own vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013278_0031_0F904A1C4A7BBB28"/>
to whom thoſe grants were made, what is there that they may not take away, ſince by thoſe grants they are ſuppoſed to hold all their liberties and all their eſtates?</p>
            <p>Other inſtances of oppreſſion in rulers might be reckoned up; but I would now obſerve, as was hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that it is not a vice peculiar to men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but may be committed by people one among another. When people oppoſe the authority of their rulers, it is generally called inſurrection and rebellion. And when a mob aſſumes the government into their own hands, they are in danger of committing ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and outrage as are many degrees beyond the guilt and miſchief of bare oppreſſion. Yea, people, where they are not guilty of lawleſs riots, may combine and impoſe ſuch reſtrictions, and ſevere conditions upon others, with intimidating threats, as ſhew that they themſelves are as tyrannical, imperious and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, as arbitrary rulers. In common dealings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, men may oppreſs one another by cheating, over-reaching and taking advantage of their neceſſities, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſimplicity. The rich may oppreſs the poor by ſevere exactions; by taking them at diſtreſs; by harraſſing them at law; and many other ways. Yea, people are guilty of oppreſſion, not only by every act of trepaſs, fraud, and injuſtice; but by every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and needleſs delay of paying their juſt debts, whereby damage or difficulty accrues to the creditor.</p>
            <p>That the word, <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> is uſed in theſe ſenſes by the ſacred writers, is evident from a multitude of texts, which I ſhall leave you to recollect and peruſe at your leiſure; only obſerving, that the command to <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013278_0032_0F904A1D8E4313C8"/>
was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs one another.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. xxv. 14.</note> And the deſcription of a people given up by God to the effects of their own wickedneſs, is thus exhibited. <hi>And the people ſhall be oppreſſed every one by another, and every man by his neighbour.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. iii. 5.</note> But this brings me to the laſt obſervation, viz.</p>
            <p n="3">III. When this is the caſe of a people, that inſtead of <hi>judgment,</hi> they are guilty of <hi>oppreſſion</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> they occaſion a <hi>cry,</hi> God may juſtly give them up to the conſequences of their folly and wickedneſs, or ſend other diſtreſſing judgments among them.</p>
            <p>When God <hi>looked</hi> that his vineyard <hi>ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes</hi>; or in the language of the text, <hi>when he looked for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but behold oppreſſion; and for righteouſneſs, but behold a cry,</hi> He utters this ſevere denunciation, <hi>And now, go to, I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden down: And I will lay it waſte; it ſhall not be pruned nor digged; but there ſhall come up briars and thorns. I will alſo command the clouds, and they ſhall rain no rain upon it:</hi> As in the two verſes immediately preceeding my text. A vineyard cannot be in a more ruinous condition than is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And when the deſcription is applied to a community, it muſt point out a moſt wretched ſituation. When a people, by their ingratitude and ſinfulneſs, their injuſtice and oppreſſion, have forfeited the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of heaven, and incurr'd its diſpleaſure, they are
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013278_0033_0F904A1DB2EE3D10"/>
like a vineyard whoſe fence is broken down, and which has nothing to ſecure it from ravage and deſtruction. When they undervalue and miſimprove their privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whether civil or religious, they juſtly forfeit them to heaven, and are in danger of looſing them. <hi>They ſhall not be pruned nor digged,</hi> the means of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proſperity ſhall ceaſe. <hi>I will command the clouds, and they ſhall rain no rain upon it</hi>; which may be fulfilled in a literal ſenſe, and drought and ſcarcity may diſtreſs and impoveriſh them: Or in a moral and religious ſenſe; the divine influences may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden, and people be left to their own hearts luſts, to fill up the meaſure of their iniquities, and to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves ſwift deſtruction. Injuſtice and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion prevailing among a people, are moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vices (as has been already demonſtrated) and tend directly, not only to the vexation, but to the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of civil ſocieties. But beſides the natural ill conſequences of them, they are provoking to God, who <hi>loveth righteouſneſs and bateth iniquity,</hi> and who will not fail to teſtify his diſpleaſure againſt thoſe who <hi>ſpoil by violence,</hi> or <hi>oppreſs the poor and needy. Shall he not viſit for theſe things; ſhall not his ſoul be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on ſuch a nation as this? For thus hath the Lord of hoſts ſaid, hew ye down trees, and caſt a mount againſt Jeruſalem: This is the city to be viſited; ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her.

            <p>Being thus led to the <hi>Improvement</hi> of the ſubject, I would gladly apply it to ourſelves on this occaſion: But I feel a peculiar difficulty in expreſſing myſelf at this ſeaſon of doubtful, anxious expectation. Though I am full, I ſcarce know what to ſay; but, in general, to exhort and beſeech you to repent, and throughly to amend every thing that is amiſs in your temper and conduct; and to cry mightily to God, that he would turn away his anger from us, replace us in the favor of our King, and in the enjoyment of our liberties.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, that 'God helps thoſe that help themſelves.' But what can we do? Our harbour is blocked up by ſhips of war; armed ſoldiers, in hoſtile appearance, are planted in our metropolis; the trade of that once flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Town is deſtroyed; its inhabitants greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed and impoveriſhed; and multitudes in danger of being ſtarved, were it not for the charity of others. And to compleat the concern and diſtreſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we find by the laſt accounts from <hi>England,</hi> that ſeveral other acts have paſſed both houſes of parliament,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013278_0035_0F8FB8CE73171DE8"/>
whereby our moſt important charter-privileges are wreſted from us. And all, for what? Becauſe we have renounced ſubjection to the King of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> and have ſet up for independency? Becauſe we are unwilling to be on the ſame footing with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and fellow-ſubjects in <hi>England,</hi> and refuſe to take up with the ſame privileges which they enjoy? By no means. It is not on account of all, or of any one of theſe reaſons. For we rejoice in being the ſubjects of King GEORGE: We rejoice in being part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions; and we conſider a cloſe, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional connexion with the nation as our ſafety, our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and our glory. We want nothing but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, and to be conſidered and treated as entitled to them. We are unwilling to have our eſtates, or our charter-rights at the arbitrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of a diſtant legiſlature, in which we can have no voice. We mean only to maintain thoſe privileges, which were confirmed to our fathers, and have been tranſmitted to us, and to which we have an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable right as <hi>men,</hi> and as <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi> We have no deſign to oppoſe any authority that is conſtitutionally founded and exerciſed; but only to <hi>ſtand fast in the liberty wherewith God,</hi> and our charter, <hi>hath made us free.</hi> And yet, ſuch is the indignity and cruelty with which we are treated, as mentioned above! And amidſt all theſe oppreſſions, we have little, or no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to petition or complain, but only to heaven. If any ſtand up for us and interceed in our behalf, they are ſcorn'd and diſgrac'd: If we conſult together for mutual ſecurity, we are deemed mobiſh and riotous: If we attempt to throw off our burdens, we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd as rebels: If we adopt the moſt peaceable method to help ourſelves, by laying aſide all luxuries
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013278_0036_0F904A1F2E6EAC48"/>
and ſuperfluities, and ſubſiſting by our own induſtry and frugality (which is no more than our diſtreſſed ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation renders neceſſary) we are rail'd and proclaim'd againſt as traitors. What then can be done? What ſteps can be taken by us for our relief? There is one courſe which reaſon and religion point out as the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and which, if univerſally adopted, and perſevered in (as God grant it may be) will greatly mitigate, if not wholly remove, the calamities we ſuffer; and that is, to <hi>live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in the world. Sobriety</hi> includes frugality and temperance, the retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every unneceſſary expence, and reducing every inordinate appetite to the ſtandard of reaſon. <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> comprehends all thoſe duties we owe to one another, and which, if generally practiſed, will obviate innumerable difficulties, and make a ſociety comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eaſy, united and proſperous. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes the duties which more immediately reſpect our Creator, which are attended with inward ſatisfaction, and, in conjunction with the foregoing virtues, never fail to conciliate the favor of heaven, and to procure freedom and happineſs.</p>
            <p>The aſpects of providence are indeed gloomy and perplexing: More ſo perhaps, than ever they were ſince our fathers fled from oppreſſion at home, to the woods of <hi>America.</hi> But let us not be overwhelmed with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly and deſpair, which unhinge the mind, unbrace our reſolutions, and unnerve our endeavors. There have heretofore been <hi>Days, wherein God afflicted</hi> our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and <hi>Years, wherein they ſaw evil</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But though <hi>for a ſmall moment he forſook them,</hi> yet <hi>with great mercies did he gather them:</hi> Though <hi>in a little wrath he hid his face from them, for a moment,</hi> yet he ſoon
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013278_0037_0F8FB8CF28FBD628"/>
               <hi>turned again and cauſed his face to ſhine upon them, and they were ſaved.</hi> Let us, for our encouragement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the years of the right hand of the moſt High, and the works he did in the days of our fathers, when they made God their refuge and confidence, in the way of well-doing, and found him <hi>a very preſent help in trouble.</hi> He is the ſame God, <hi>merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covenant and mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin.</hi> And if we do not retain our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities as a wall of ſeparation between God and us, to hinder good things from us, we ſhall yet be a free and a happy people. Indeed, when we conſider our abounding immoralities, our fleſh may well trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for fear of God, and we may be afraid of his judgments. The calamities we feel, are no doubt the tokens of the divine diſpleaſure againſt us for our ſins: For God does not pour out the vials of his wrath upon a people, unleſs to puniſh them for their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Though we are unwilling to own that we have forfeited our privileges into the hands of men, yet muſt we not confeſs, that by our ingratitude and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt heaven, we have forfeited them all into the hands of God? Though we have been under peculiar obligations, being a free and enlightened people, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe loving kindneſs, judgment and righteouſneſs in the earth; yet when God <hi>looked for judgment, hath he not beheld oppreſſion; and for righteouſneſs hath he not heard a cry?</hi> Have we not practiſed too much of the ſame oppreſſive, encroaching, tyrannical temper towards one another, which we have complained of in ſome of our rulers towards us? Have we not committed, or countenanced unkindneſs and injuſtice? Either wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neighbor in his eſtate, or good name, or deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013278_0038_0F904A1FF7077A88"/>
him that freedom to which he had a right? Have we not been too apt to cenſure and condemn the views and meaſures of men in office? Have we not abuſed the ineſtimable privileges we have enjoyed as men, as chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and as <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, to the purpoſes of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and extravagance? And is it not for this that we are puniſhed by the diminution of them? But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever particular vices have provoked God to bring us low by oppreſſion, it behoves us to be ſincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in our repentance and reformation, and then we ſhall be ſure of getting rid of our worſt enemies. Let us ſearch and try our ways and turn to the Lord with our whole heart and not feignedly, and then he will have mercy upon us, and deliver us out of the hand of the oppreſſor, and we ſhall no longer <hi>cry out of wrong and not be heard.</hi> Let us, in this day of adverſity, humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of God, and he will exalt us in due time. Renouncing all impiety, injuſtice and uncharitableneſs, let us become <hi>righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> Let us love one another, for love is the fulfilling of the law. Let us not forget the neceſſity of ſubordination and government, nor the obedience that is due-to the laws, nor the reſpect and ſubmiſſion that we owe to thoſe who are cloathed with authority. Let us <hi>honor all men; love the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; fear GOD, and honor the King.</hi> Then may we hope that he who was the God of our fathers, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be our God, and the God of our poſterity, from generation to generation. <hi>O</hi> then, <hi>that there were ſuch an heart in us, that we would fear him, and keep all his commandments always, that it might be well with us and with our children for ever.</hi> AMEN.</p>
