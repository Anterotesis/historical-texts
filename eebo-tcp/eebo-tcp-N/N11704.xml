            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Subſtance of the following Piece was drawn up by a Friend to American Liberty, to oblige a few of his Friends, ſome of whom were for, and others againſt a Reconciliation with Great- Britain; they on both Sides freely peruſed it in Manuſcript, and as the principal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it is become a general Subject of Converſation, is in itſelf very important, and ought to be deliberately weighed before 'tis determined; it appeared to ſome of the Perſons into whoſe hands the Manuſcript had fallen, that it would be proper to have it laid before the Public; accordingly they ſent it to the Printer. And though this is chiefly on one Side of the Queſtion, yet they would be willing to ſee the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the other Side calmly and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally urged, and the Subject ſet to view in its full Light.</p>
            <p>As a Matter of ſuch Importance ſhould be well weighed before its determined, and cannot be well weighed and conſidered, unleſs the Reaſons on both Sides are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly viewed; 'tis proper the Reaſons on both Sides ſhould be fairly exhibited.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE RECONCILIATION 0F GREAT-BRITAIN AND THE COLONIES.</head>
            <p>A RECONCILIATION between Great Britain and the Colonies, has been much in the thoughts of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. At the beginning of the war it was ardently deſired in general, if not by all; but now it is not deſired, but feared by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and it has become a public inquiry whether it is beſt there ſhould be a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, or a proper ſeparation, and we in America be independent. It certainly muſt be agreeable to all rational people to have the war properly terminated. But how ſhall it be done? It certainly will be very difficult to heal the breach that has been made, and bring the war to a proper end and iſſue. It was begun, and has been carried on in ſuch a manner, that the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014791_0005_0F94A8E393C48C00"/>
of it, muſt be peculiarly difficult. Whenever the ſettlememt of our affairs is attempted, it ſhould be with great delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and calmneſs. Self-intereſt, party ſpirit, heats and animoſities ſhould have no part in a matter of ſo great importance.</p>
            <p>To terminate the preſent war, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the rights and privileges of America, and ſettle its civil government, is a moſt momentous affair. It is to do the work of ages; it ſhould not be done ſuddenly. All poſſible light and aſſiſtance ſhould be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe that manage the buſineſs. It is really too much to truſt to any number of men, as repreſentatives, if it could poſſibly be avoided. If it was poſſible, it would be beſt the whole continent ſhould give their voice in the matter: But a few no doubt muſt be truſted with this intereſting concern; and they will doubtleſs find it a weight that they will be ready to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they are impartial and faithful men, as I truſt they will be. It is ſo great an affair, that it ſhould with caution be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to any men. Their is danger of men. There is danger that they may be miſtaken, or biaſſed, or ſome way influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced to take a wrong meaſure. If Britain condeſcends to treat with America, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral congreſs, or any repreſentatives of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014791_0006_0F94A8E456B779B8"/>
ours, ſhe will no doubt uſe all poſſible art, proffer many favours, nor will her money be hid from thoſe that are entruſted to ſettle the affair. In this view we have more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear the money and favours of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than her arms, and open oppoſition. Thoſe have often done more fatal execution than theſe. But we have reaſon to hope: Our congreſs has done worthily. They have nobly expoſed their lives and eſtates in the cauſe of liberty, and defence of their country; and ſhall they, or any others that may come in their room, give up our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges? God forbid! I truſt it will not be.</p>
            <p>It was juſt now ſaid, that if poſſible the whole continent ſhould ſettle our affairs; but ſince it muſt be done by repreſentatives, they ſhould as much as poſſible know the minds of the people in general. For this reaſon among others, it ſhould not be done haſtily. Whenever an accommodation is propoſed, it would be well for every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if not city and town, to publiſh their views or ſentiments of the thing, as was done reſpecting our liberties at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our preſent troubles. Then, almoſt every county, and many towns met and publiſhed their reſolves, concerning our rights and privileges, which thing greatly tended to unite and ſtrengthen the whole
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014791_0007_0F94A8E51DCF6C88"/>
continent. Something ſimilar might be done now, or when matters are about to be ſettled.</p>
            <p>The ſettlement of American government being as we hope for ages, or even to the end of time, we may well take time for it; uſe all proper means, and get all poſſible light. For this reaſon it might be proper, that a number of pieces ſhould be publiſhed on the occaſion, with calmneſs, temper and ſound reaſoning. There will be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſentiments, and which all may publiſh with candour, and offer their reaſons fairly. The grand inquiry is, concerning the iſſue of the war; in what way and manner it muſt be accompliſhed, or attempted; or how we ſhall ſettle matters with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? And here an intereſting and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant inquiry occurs, viz. Shall we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Great Britain, ſo as to be under her government, or ſhall we be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? To determine this, another queſtion ariſes, viz. Have we a right to be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? We all believe an over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we have appealed and applied to God in our preſent ſtruggle; we believe that the ſovereign of the univerſe, the judge of all the earth, diſpoſes of nations and kingdoms, and that ſooner or later he will viſit for iniquity. We have reaſon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014791_0008_0F94A8E7134958F0"/>
therefore to view the equity of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and inquire whether we have a right to be independent.</p>
            <p>The queſtion then is, Has Britain for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited her right to our dependence, ſo that ſhe cannot in juſtice claim it, nor we be under any obligation to ſubmit to it? It is certain we were once dependent, and under Britiſh government; it is a proper enquiry then, How can we be independent? To know whether Britain has forfeited her right to our dependence, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix at the end.</note> we muſt a little conſider the nature of civil government.— In a ſtate of nature, as in the firſt ages of the world, or before mankind were formed into ſocieties for civil government, every man had a right to enjoy himſelf, and the work of his hands, and what he took in hunting, &amp;c. if he injured not any of his fellow creatures, who had the ſame right. And in that ſtate of nature, each man had a right to defend and vindicate himſelf, if aſſaulted or injured by others. But when men were formed into civil ſocieties, each man gave up this right to defend and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate himſelf, to judge and determine in his own caſe, and left all this to the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and the duty and proper buſineſs of the civil magiſtrate, was, is, and ever will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014791_0009_0F94A8E7549B19C8"/>
be, to defend and protect the people, in the peaceable enjoyment of their properties and privileges.</p>
            <p>The whole deſign of civil government or magiſtracy, is the good of the people. A magiſtrate as ſuch, has no right or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but from the people. It is true a man may in a tyrannical and arbitrary manner, aſſume power over others, and oblige them to ſubmit, as has often been the caſe; and the people may think proper ſo to do; and this their ſubmiſſion may become a ſort of compact, and the ruler and ruled be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bound to each other. But ſtill the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end and deſign of magiſtracy, is the good of the people, and in reaſon and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it cannot be any thing elſe. This is ſo eaſy that I need not enlarge. A magiſtrate then by office, and by oath, if there is an oath in the caſe, is bound to defend his ſubjects in the enjoyment of their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and privileges, and people are bound to him only in conſequence of this, or in connection with it. To ſuppoſe otherwiſe would be to deſtroy all liberty and property, and to promote the moſt abſolute tyranny; but I need not inſiſt, for this is out of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>To come to the caſe in hand then, let us ſuppoſe that Britain, or any other kingdom,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014791_0010_0F94A8E9AAA36BA8"/>
had a part of its dominions, an iſland, or continent, lying at a diſtance, America for inſtance. That this ſhould be attacked by a foreign enemy; upon which America cries to Britain the ſource of national pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for protection and defence. Britain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not, protects not, but leaves them to the rage and fury of their enemy, by whom America is at length overcome and ſubdued, when Britain had it in her power to have afforded help, protected and ſaved them. After ſome time, by ſome means America extricates itſelf out of the hand of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and defends herſelf. Has Britain, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, a right to govern America, and require ſubmiſſion to her authority? Would not Britain's right to American government and dependence be forfeited? The caſe is clear; Britain did not her duty to protect and defend, but left America to be ſubdued by another, and America is thereby entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from Britiſh authority.</p>
            <p>Again, let us ſuppoſe a caſe, that when America had been thus attacked, and left deſtitute of Britiſh protection, America was not ſubdued by the enemy, but after a long ſtruggle, while Britain had opportunity to interpoſe, but would not, the Americans ſhould get the better of their enemies, though at a vaſt expence of blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014791_0011_0F94A8EA93DB9288"/>
would America, after that, be under any obligation to ſubmit to Britiſh authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? By no means. America had not the protection that was her due, but expended her own blood and treaſure, and no thanks to Britain ſhe was not wholly deſtroyed. Again, ſuppoſe that inſtead of leaving Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to the depradation, of a foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Britain herſelf ſhould act the part of an enemy; refuſe us the privileges which are ours by conſtitution, ſeize our proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and deprive us of our mutual rights; in which caſe America expoſtulates, pleads, ſubmits to all equitable impoſitions, which are according to conſtitution, begs ſhe may be relieved, and not driven to extremities; but Britain proves deaf to entreaties, ſeizes our properties, and deprives us of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, by which means America is obliged to defend herſelf, by force, which in t<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> reaſon and nature of things, ſhe has a right to do. That in this caſe we have a right to defend ourſelves, is determined by the declaration and conduct of theſe colonies in the preſent ſtruggle, therefore will not now be diſputed by Americans.<note n="*" place="bottom">I do not pretend to reaſon with profeſſed tories, but with thoſe that allow, that we have righteouſly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up arms in our defence.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed then; ſuppoſe in this ſtruggle America ſhould, after ſpilling much blood,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014791_0012_0F94A8EB1A0D4408"/>
and expending much treaſure, get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Britain and prevail till Britain chooſes to ceaſe hoſtilities: would America then be under obligation to ſubmit to Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Every rational perſon would ſay, that Britain had forfeited her right to American dependence. There can be no more reaſon why we ſhould ſubmit to Britain, after ſhe had acted the part of a cruel enemy herſelf, than if ſhe had left America to the rage of a foreign enemy. Yea much leſs reaſon.</p>
            <p>I have only one caſe more to ſuppoſe; Should Britain proceed againſt America, as in the laſt ſuppoſition, till ſhe had put us to much expence, ſhed much of our beſt blood, burnt our ſea port towns, deprived us of our trade, and means of livelihood, but when ſhe found it would not anſwer to proceed againſt us to bring things to a criſis by the ſword, ſhould propoſe a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by our being under her government; are we obliged in juſtice to comply? Has ſhe a right to require it? This is our caſe. What obliges us to ſubmit to Britiſh goverment! It is not for want of will and diſpoſition, in her that ſhe does not proceed againſt us to the utmoſt. She has endeavoured to cruſh us, and expected that what ſhe has done would have accompliſhed it. Britain
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014791_0013_0F94A8EBD6C70A18"/>
expected by her armed force, the Fiſhery Bill, and others of the ſame cruel kind, by ſtarving and blood ſhed, to have reduced us to an entire ſubmiſſion. She has acted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to all her obligations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend us, moſt unjuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced us rebels, and treated us as ſuch:<note n="*" place="bottom">And is ſtill treating us as rebels. How ſtrange is it that Britain ſhould declare us rebels, ſeize our effects, and try every way to hurt us, at the ſame time that ſhe propoſes an accommodation, and appoints Commiſſioners to treat with us! Is it not evident that the commiſſion for an accomodation is nothing but a ſham, deſigned to blind the people in England and keep them quiet, while they are made to believe, that the Americans have very generous terms of accomodation offered them, and alſo to give the tories among us, a covered opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert themſelves and cauſe diviſions?</note>
She propoſed to bring the body of the people into ſubjection, and ſet the heads of ſome of the chiefs; upon Temple Bar. Let her dreadful and bloody treatment of us, againſt all our cries and petitions for lenity, a long time preſented, appear in its proper light, and ſtand full in view, as it ought; and in that view judge whether ſhe has forfeited her right to our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and government, and whether it is neceſſary in point of equity for us to ſubmit.</p>
            <p>But if Britain has forfeited her right, and we are at liberty in point of equity to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014791_0014_0F94A8ECA9F38468"/>
be independent; yet it is a query whether it is prudent; whether it will be beſt for us to aſſume our right, and whether on the whole we ought not yet to deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be in connection, and under the government of Great-Britain. I come therefore to view the arguments for and againſt our reconciliation with Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Argument.</hi> However, we may view the thing, Britain will not give up her right to govern us, but will ſtrenuouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, ſo that if we declare for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, it will involve us in a long and bloody war, and be our utter ruin in the end; eſpecially as in this caſe our friends in Great Britain will forſake us, ſince moſt, if not all of them, have befriended us on ſuppoſition, that we will ſtill be in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Great-Britain. Our having ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends in Great-Britain, is the reaſon that our enemies find themſelves perplexed, and cannot ſo fully exert themſelves againſt us; if it is once found that we declare for independency, Britain will be united againſt us. Thoſe that have been our friends will no longer embarraſs our enemies, but Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain united, will exert herſelf againſt us, with ſuch vigour, that we ſhall ſoon be overcome, or reduced to unknown difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014791_0015_0F94A8ED54010090"/>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Let Britain be ever ſo much united, ſhe cannot victual out an army and fleet, and maintain them at this diſtance, ſo as to deſtroy, or reduce us to unknown difficulty. Should Britain, without foreign aid, attempt to fit out and victual an army of 25,000 men, and 10,000 ſailors to guard our coaſt, it would cauſe ſuch a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city among themſelves as would be their ruin, now their trade is ſo diminiſhed, and their importation of proviſions from us cut off. But ſuppoſe they could and ſhould do this; an army of 25,000, and 10,000 ſailors, would by no means ſubdue us. We can raiſe five to one againſt this number. And ſhould Britain call in foreign aid, as ſhe muſt if ſhe does any thing to purpoſe; that would induce us to do the ſame. And ſhould we make application, we could ſoon have ſuch aſſiſtance, that Britain could not prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Argument.</hi> If we declare for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, Britain will not for time to come, protect us againſt other nations, and we ſhould in time, and probably very ſoon, become a prey to the French or Spaniards, or ſome other enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If we were once Independent, it would be the intereſt of all the European nations to keep us ſo. They would not let
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014791_0016_0F94A8F0745049C8"/>
any one nation engroſs us and our trade, leſt ſuch an acquiſition ſhould enable that nation to be too powerful for its neighbours. Thus ſome ſmall ſtates in Europe are kept independent. The trade to North America would be ſuch a boon to ſeveral European nations, that neither of them would let it be engroſſed, or us be much hurt by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Argument.</hi> If we unite with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we may have our expences refunded, and recover damages for our loſſes; but if we declare for independency, we ſhall loſe all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1ſt, It is not in the diſpoſition, or even in the power of Britain, to make good our damages. There are no ſuch propoſals by them, or like to be, therefore it cannot be uſed as an argument with any propriety. 2d, If Britain ſhould conſent to this, it would yet be much better for us to repair our own damages as well as we can, in a ſtate of independency, than to have Britain repair them in a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her. In a few years, it would be as cheap to us, our expences would be ſo much leſs, and our revenues ſo much greater in a ſtate of independency.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument Fourth.</hi> Our independency would ruin Britain, and ſurely we cannot
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014791_0017_0F94A8F15AEC9FB8"/>
be ſo cruel towards our Parent, though ſhe has dealt ſomething hardly with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1ſt, Notwithſtanding our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency, we may trade with Britain as much, if not more than with any kingdom in Europe; and if ſhe will retrench her needleſs expences of placemen and penſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the luxuries of the great, ſhe may yet ſurvive. With a proper part of our trade, and a reformation of her manners, Britain may ſubſiſt as well as ſome other kingdoms in Europe. 2d, We may by treaty agree to help, and defend Britain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular occaſions, as need may require. 3d, If Britain is ruined, it is by her own miſconduct, and we cannot help it. If ſhe is ruined, it is becauſe ſhe is ripe for ruin, and God's judgments muſt come upon her; in which caſe we ought to be diſunited, if we can, and not connected with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument Fifth.</hi> If we will not ſubmit to a reconciliation with Britain, ſhe will procure the French and Spaniards to join with her, to bring us into ſubjection, or deſtroy us. Britain would grant part of thoſe provinces to the French and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, as a reward for helping to ſubdue the remainder, rather than we ſhould be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. And ſhould Britain grant this, the French and Spaniards would ſoon help to conquer us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:014791_0018_0F94A8F1DD4CB3B0"/>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1ſt, This is but a mere ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or rather a bug-bear to ſcare peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that know no better. 2d, The French and Spaniards had much rather help Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica againſt Britain, than Britain againſt America. 3d, It would be much better for the French and Spaniards to have Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica independent, and they allowed a free trade with the whole continent, than for them to own a part of it, without a free trade. It would coſt them much to guard and defend their part, which would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a bone of contention; whereas if we were independent, they would have the benefit of our trade without any coſt. 4th, Should France and Spain join with Britain againſt us, we ſhould apply to Holland, the King of Pruſſia, and other powers, which would bring on a general war in Europe, which would relieve us, ſo that we might continue independent. 5th, Againſt all ſuch imaginary evil and danger as this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuppoſes, or any that may poſſibly occur, we have this to ſupport us, that our cauſe is good, and we have the Great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of all things to confide in, and apply to. We have not run preſumptuouſly into danger, nor are we propoſing an independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency that is unjuſt or unreaſonable. What we propoſe is the moſt equitable, rational,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014791_0019_0F94A8F29676DEA8"/>
natural mode of civil government; moſt adapted to anſwer the ends of government, according to the word of God. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt favourable to religion as well as liberty, and the natural rights of mankind. In this way we have abundant reaſon to think that God will ſmile upon and bleſs us; will proſper our equitable proceedings, and prevent the evils that earth or hell may deviſe againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argument Sixth.</hi> The Congreſs has late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied to Britain, and petitioned for a reconciliation, and therefore if Britain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with our propoſal, we cannot with honour and juſtice refuſe to treat with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> 1ſt, We may hold a treaty, and try to come to ſome proper agreement, as to trade; enter into a league offenſive and defenſive, and yet maintain our independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to government. 2d, Our petition and offer of reconciliation, ſhould be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon condition, that Britain would redreſs our grievances, repeal ſeveral acts of parliament, and place us in as good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as we were in 1763, which muſt imply making good our damages; which Britain is by no means likely to do. 3d, But the moſt proper anſwer to this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that things are much altered ſince our petition laſt July, or the beginning of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014791_0020_0F94A8F353E4B278"/>
September, when it was offered to the King. If our petition had been complied with, it ought to have been complied with immediately. It was offered in a critical time, we were then in the utmoſt danger, beſet on all ſides. Since that time much of our precious blood has been ſpilt; one of our beſt generals ſlain, ſeveral large towns burnt, and others cannonaded, beſide im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe coſt. If we were held by that offer of the Congreſs, it ought to have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately complied with, or at leaſt we ſhould have been told that it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſoon as poſſible; that it ſhould be laid before the parliament as ſoon as they met. But inſtead of this, we were told that no anſwer would be given, and there was not a word of it in the King's ſpeech to the parliament, framed by the miniſtry, nor an item of any reconciliation with the colonies; nothing but the ſame proceſs of fire and ſword that we had been treated with. Yea afterward, when Governor Penn had been examined before the Houſe of Lords, and the Duke of Richmond made a motion that the laſt petition from the Continental Congreſs, ſhould be made a baſis for a plan of accommodation; the miniſterial party oppoſed it, and it was thrown out by 86 againſt 33. And if the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014791_0021_0F94A8F4CCA555D0"/>
petition is taken under conſideration after all, it is by conſtraint, not willingly; it is becauſe they find that providence has ſmiled upon us, and frowned upon them, and they know not how to accompliſh their cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns as they propoſed. And is there not all the reaſon in the world, that we ſhould ſay that we cannot make the ſame offer now that we did eight months ago, and that we are not bound by the offer we then made. If A offers B a horſe at a certain price, and B does not accept the offer, A has a right to withdraw it, and is not obliged to let B have the horſe on the ſame terms any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time after, eſpecially if circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are much altered in the mean time, and more eſpecially if the alteration is A's damage, by B's neglect to comply with A's offer at firſt. This is our caſe with Britain. We are therefore no way bound by the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition we ſent laſt July.</p>
            <p>I come now to offer the arguments for independency, and againſt our being under Britiſh government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt Argument.</hi> By independency we ſhall avoid tyranny, and oppreſſion. If we ſubmit to Britiſh government, we ſhall be continually cramped with Governors, and other officers appointed by the crown. All thoſe in authority over us, will be ſuch as ſuit the ambitious deſigns of Great Britain,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014791_0022_0F94A8F6B817AA38"/>
however contrary to our intereſt. If we are under Britiſh government, we can make no laws to our advantage, unleſs Britain views them ſo, and they receive a ſanction there. Not a new county can be formed, or chooſe repreſentatives without leave from home. If we are independent we may yearly chooſe ſuch rulers as ſuit us beſt; but if ſubject to Britain, we muſt be under a King that comes by ſucceſſion, however unfit to rule, which is often the bane of government. If we chooſe our rulers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, or once in three years, they are at the end of that time, again put on a level with their fellow ſubjects, and are liable to be called to an account for mal-adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is a great means of preventing miſmanagement when in power. But if the government is hereditary, we muſt take the chief magiſtrate as he is; ſometimes an infant, ſometimes with ſcarce common fenſe, ſometimes inattentive to any public buſineſs, like Domitian catching flies; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ambitious, fierce, and cruel, uſing all the power of the nation, to promote tyranny; ſometimes a capricious woman; <note n="*" place="bottom">Should one of our charter governments chooſe a girl, or an old woman for their governor, and give her the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſalary, would not their money be nobly expended, and their government finely managed! This among other things may ſerve to ſhew, that hereditary government cannot be founded in reaſon and equity.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:014791_0023_0F94A8F78E76D9B0"/>
and however thus unfit to anſwer the true ends of government, he or ſhe, is not to be ſet aſide. Hereditary government tends to keep a continual oppoſition between the court and the country: So that a courtier and a patriot are oppoſite characters, which is the greateſt abſurdity in nature, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of civil government is properly viewed. Rulers are, or ought to be wholly for the good of the people: But how contrary to this, is the caſe in fact, in many inſtances! The court and the patriots in continual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, has long time been a reproach to a nation that boaſts of liberty, and the beſt form of civil government. What ſay ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon? If a kingdom, or an houſe be divided againſt itſelf, it cannot ſtand. Every man that has lived any time in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, under regal government, knows what frequent, and almoſt continual oppoſition there is between the country intereſt and thoſe in power; what jars and contentions between Governors and Aſſemblies, &amp;c. This may be prevented by keeping clear of Britiſh government; and a kind Providence ſeems now to open a door for it. I have but imperfectly exhibited this argument; but our oppreſſions, and the incroachments upon our natural rights by regal officers, are ſo well known to every man that has
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014791_0024_0F94A8F7D70860A8"/>
any acquaintance with our public affairs, that I need not enlarge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Argument.</hi> By being indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we ſhall be much leſs expoſed to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign wars. Every large kingdom is often at war with neighbouring nations. The avarice, and ambition of a Prince, at the head of a powerful nation, will not ſuffer it to be long at peace. If we belong to a large kingdom in Europe, we muſt be at war whenever that kingdom is at war: And ſome part of America will always be expoſed in time of war. But if we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, it will be the intereſt of all the European nations to keep us ſo, and no one of them will view us as enemies, becauſe they are at war among themſelves. Holland often enjoys peace while the neighbouring kingdoms are at war. If we are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent all the nations of Europe will protect and keep us ſo; for reaſons that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been given. This will be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than to be under the protection of any one, tho' the moſt powerful nation in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Argument.</hi> If we are independent, our taxes will be inconſiderable, compared with what they will and muſt be, if we are under regal government. A view of the public expences in the Province of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014791_0025_0F94A8F89558EF70"/>
New-York, and the Colony of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, a few years paſt, may ſerve to evince this. If we are under regal government, the Provinces will be dealt out to hungry officers, who will always get what they can. There are ſo many hangers-on at the Britiſh court, who want places; ſo many reduced gentlemen to be ſupplied; ſo many placemen and penſioners, that we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be peeled and pillaged, and new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of raiſing revenues invented to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them. A number of ſuch hungry creatures will always be gaping for the places of profit and honor, and their ſalaries muſt be as large as poſſible. But if our principal officers were annually choſen from among ourſelves, the expences would be inconſiderable, and the buſineſs of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment much better done. There are many ways more than I can enumerate, by which our public expences would be encreaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regal government, and diminiſhed by being independent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth Argument.</hi> It will be much eaſier to ſettle the preſent diſputes by declaring for independency, than by attempting an accomodation. Should an accomodation be attempted, the views of Britain and America are ſo very different, if not dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite, that they could not be
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014791_0026_0F94A8F98F47E938"/>
made to harmonize. The demands of Britain and America would claſh to ſuch a degree, as to render a reconciliation imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable. America would inſiſt upon ſo many Acts of Parliament being repealed, ſo many rights and privileges aſcertained, ſuch a reparation of damages, &amp;c. many, or all of which things the court of Great-Britain would abſolutely refuſe, that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation could not take place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth Argument.</hi> If matters are ſettled by our being independent, the Continental Congreſs, or the managers of that affair, will be relieved of much difficulty and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted with honor; otherwiſe it is likely they will be ſuſpected of bribery, and loaded with blame and reproach. If a reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is poſſible, and ſhould take place, there muſt probably be ſuch conceſſions on the part of America, as would be very grating to multitudes. And thoſe that were entruſted with the management of the affair, would probably be ſuſpected of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, whether guilty or not. If matters are not ſettled to the ſatisfaction of people in general, the tranſactors of the affair will be the objects of much public odium. Some part of the Continent has ſuffered ſo much, is ſo irritated by cruel treatment, and there is now ſuch a proſpect of ſettling
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014791_0027_0F94A8FA1422C130"/>
things well by independency, that it will be impoſſible to make people think well of the men that ſhall, without abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, again ſubject us to Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No man need deſire to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Congreſs, that ſhall again bring America into ſubjection to Great-Britain, if it is not the general voice of the country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth Argument.</hi> If we are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, we ſhall be leſs liable to internal tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and rebellions. Our people have now ſuch a ſenſe of liberty; have been ſo uſed to meet, form, and publiſh reſolves, and aſſert their rights and privileges, and have ſo well ſucceeded in our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with Britain, that it will be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to prevent ſomething ſimilar for time to come, if they are put under Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; eſpecially if they think it is without neceſſity, and contrary to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights. Should there now be a patched up reconciliation, and we in ſubjection to Great-Britain, we might expect nothing but inward convulſions, ſtruggles, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for freedom, till we were either ruined or ſet free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh Argument.</hi> If we are indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, this land of liberty will be glorious on many accounts: Population will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly increaſe, agriculture will be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014791_0028_0F94A8FBD8A09C78"/>

reconciliation with Britain is become a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of converſation, and I think ought to be impartially canvaſſed. In canvaſſing this matter, and bringing things forward to a determination, the ſide of reconciliation with Britain has conſiderable advantage; becauſe many men in office, and thoſe that hope to be promoted if a union takes place, will exert themſelves, uſe all the plauſible arguments and perſuaſions they can, to lead people to think a union is beſt; and many of thoſe are men that people have been uſed to view as leaders and head men, to whom they have often applied for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Many men now in power, and others who hope to come into places of profit or honour, will from intereſted views, uſe their utmoſt endeavours to lead people in general, to think that a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with Britain is beſt. And it is eaſy for them to influence and lead many of the populous.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since I wrote the above, I have been told, that there are in almoſt every county if not town, men employed, and even hired by thoſe who call themſelves friends to government, to perſuade and influence people as much as poſſible, to favour and promote a reconciliation with Great Britain. People therefore in general thro' the country, ſhould obſerve what ſort of men are engaged to promote a reconciliation with Britain; whether they be ſuch as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect favour from government, or whether they be ſuch as act with a diſintereſted regard to the good of the country.</note> On the contrary the ſide of

            <head>THE PLAN OF AN AMERICAN COMPACT, WITH GREAT-BRITAIN.</head>
            <head type="sub">Firſt Publiſhed at NEW-YORK.</head>
            <p>THE capital ſubject of converſation throughout America for theſe few weeks paſt, hath been excited by a Pamphlet, entitled, Common Senſe; the author of which endeavours to ſhew the neceſſity of our final ſeparation from Great-Britain, as our rights and privileges cannot be properly ſecured by any mode of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation whatever. None of the anſwers given to this ingenious Pamphlet, have ſketched out any plan of ſettlement, by which it might appear that our rights and freedom would be fully ſecured, though again united and harmonized with Britain. That ſuch a compact or ſettlement is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, I think ought to be made apparent to the people of America, before they can be convinced of the propriety of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:014791_0033_0F94A901119CCA00"/>
and unleſs this can be effected, I never wiſh to ſee the union; preferring, beyond all compariſon, the toils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of erecting a free and independent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick to the deluſive promiſes of freedom, pregnant with the principles of ſervitude and oppreſſion. But, I think, ſuch a compact, or act of ſettlement, may be framed, as will ſecure to Americans the rights of freemen, at the ſame time that it removes from them the horrors of war, and the deſolations with which even victory muſt be attended. I think no conſiderate perſon will deny, that our truly honorable Congreſs were of opinion ſuch a compact could be formed, when they petitioned the King, addreſſed the people of Britain, and prayed to the Father of peace for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with Great-Britain, as the greateſt bleſſing theſe colonies could enjoy. If ſuch a ſettlement, in the opinion of the Congreſs could ſo lately have been framed, I think no good reaſon can be given why it cannot now be effected, ſince the ſame wiſe and ſalutary regulations, which ſix months ago would have ſecured us againſt the inroads of tyranny and the deſigns of a wicked Miniſtry, muſt at this day anſwer the ſame important purpoſes. What were the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of this compact, which our Congreſs
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014791_0034_0F94A9012ED0B208"/>
muſt have thought would be ſufficient to ſecure our liberties, I do not know, it is impoſſible, therefore, for me to relate them; but ſufficient it is, for the purpoſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the foundation of independency, to delineate the outlines of a compact, which would reconcile us to Great-Britain, and at the ſame time ſecure and preſerve our rights and privileges: Such a general plan, or ground-work, is here offered to the public for their conſideration.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>ARTICLES</hi> of the <hi>COMPACT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Britiſh Parliament ſhall have no power to tax the colonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> The Parliament ſhall not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with the internal police of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Let Britain provide for her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal government, and the colonies for theirs. By this clauſe all diſputes about invaſion of charters, rights of trial by jury, manufactures of the colonies, &amp;c. will be rooted up at one ſtroke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> The Crown ſhall appoint the officers of government in the colonies, during good behaviour, and the people of the colonies pay them; by this means the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:014791_0035_0F94A901A0D77498"/>
officers become equally dependent upon crown and people, (as they always ought to be.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth.</hi> The Parliament ſhall have the regulation of our trade; but leaſt they may lay heavy duties upon articles of our trade, under pretence of regulating it, and ſo raiſe a revenue out of the colonies, they ſhould have no right to the duties, but they ſhould go to, and be for the benefit of that colony from which they were raiſed, to contribute in paying that colony's taxes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth.</hi> As it is neceſſary there ſhould be ſome general power to ſuperintend and regulate the intereſt of the colonies as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with and interfering with each other, which no Provincial legiſlature is competent to; and as it would be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to give the Britiſh Parliament that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er leaſt tyranny might enter in at ſo indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite a paſſage, there ſhould be a general Convention, conſiſting of Deputies from the ſeveral colony Aſſemblies, or from the people, whoſe buſineſs ſhould be to regulate the poſts, the general currency, and the proportion of the forces of the colonies, and all other matters in which the ſeparate colony legiſlatures have not ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014791_0036_0F94A9026BF18AD0"/>
and which are not contrary to the right herein allowed to the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. One ſpecial buſineſs of this conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be to keep a vigilant and careful watch over the deſigns and tranſactions of the Britiſh Miniſtry and Parliament, that ſo by an early watch word it may prevent tyranny in its embrio: But as abſolute power might in time be aſſumed by this Congreſs, were it without any check, its acts therefore ſhould go home for the Royal aſſent; the Crown to have no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, or the Provincial acts, unleſs done within three years after paſſing here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth.</hi> For our ſecurity againſt the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Britiſh troops to enſlave us in times of tranquillity, when we had forgot the uſe of arms, a perpetual ſtanding mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia bill ſhould form part of the compact by which means the people of the colonies would keep up their martial ſpirit, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be prepared againſt the attack of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power: But, as it would be uſeful, in caſe of ſudden invaſion, to have a ſmall number of troops at all times ready to repel ſuch invaſion, the King ſhould have a right to ſend a certain limited number, for inſtance, 10 or 12,000 upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, whoſe immediate exertions might be
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014791_0037_0F94A9031DB97770"/>
ſufficient to prevent an enemy, until the militia could be aſſembled and brought up. Whoever aſſerts that 10 or 12,000 ſoldiers would be ſufficient to controul the militia of this continent, conſiſting of 500,000 brave men, pays but a deſpicable compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſpirit and ability of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. More than this ſtipulated number the Crown ſhould not ſend without the conſent of the general Convention or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventh.</hi> In order to prevent bribery and corruption from ſapping the foundation of the goodly fabrick, the compact ſhould contain theſe three clauſes, viz. That the Colonies ſhould chooſe their Repreſentatives and Convention every two years: That they ſhould chooſe them by ballot; and that no officer or penſionary of the Crown ſhould be elected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighth.</hi> As theſe colonies would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by the power of Britain, and would receive all the duties ariſing from the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of trade, the Colonies ſhould ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to allow them 8 per cent. upon all merchandizes imported from foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. This would be the eaſieſt of all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for raiſing this ſum; It would be
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014791_0038_0F94A903D9622758"/>
paid inviſibly, and we ſhould even then be gainers, ſince we ſhould receive a profit of 12 per cent. upon ſuch foreign commodities. If the exigencies of the ſtate ſhould at any time require a further grant, the ſame ſhould be obtained freely by way of requiſition.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the outlines of the compact of reconciliation, by which it is apparent our freedom may be amply ſecured. No doubt many additions may be made to it by the wiſdom of our venerable Congreſs, and the obſervations of my countrymen. And ſince an honorable and ſecure harmony may again be eſtabliſhed between Great-Britain and theſe Colonies, who would prefer the horrors of war, the ruin of commerce, the deſtruction of private peace and happineſs, and the loſs of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of our countrymen in battle, to the bleſſings of peace and tranquillity, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of plenty and abundance, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the lives of our fellow creatures, and all theſe in the full poſſeſſion of liberty? And for what are we to encounter all theſe evils, and untried ways, which like all novel experiments, muſt be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with innumerable difficulties, if they ſhould happen to prove ſucceſsful, and
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014791_0039_0F94A904C8874DC8"/>
with diſmal conſequences ſhould they miſcarry. 'Tis a form of government which Baron Monteſquieu, and the beſt writers on the ſubject, have ſhewn to be attended with many miſchiefs and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, while they paſs high encomiums on the excellency of the Britiſh conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But why ſhould I dwell upon the dangers of this ſcheme; the Continental Congreſs have never liſped the leaſt deſire for independency or republicaniſm: all their publications breathe another ſpirit, and in their juſtice, wiſdom and virtue I can freely confide, for a reſtoration of peace and tranquillity upon juſt and honorable conditions.</p>
