            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the following Poem, written by Mr. BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW, a <hi>republican,</hi> virtue is recommended with <hi>republican</hi> freedom and boldness. The poetic beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and beauties of sentiment here displayed are well worthy the Author; and it must be pleasing to observe the warmth of affection which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to retain for his native country. If this has with justice been esteemed one of the Writer's best performances, we need make no apology for its publication; and if it is calculated to answer the design expressed in the Preface, it ought to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and studied by every family in New-England.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A SIMPLICITY in diet, whether it be considered with reference to the happiness of individuals or the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of a nation, is of more consequence than we are apt to imagine. In recommending so important an object to the rational part of mankind, I wish it were in my power to do it in such a manner as would be likely to gain their attention. I am sensible that it is one of those subjects in which example has infinitely more power than the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments on the highest charms of poetry. Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith's</hi> Deserted Village, <hi>though possessing these two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in a greater degree than any other work of the kind, has not prevented villages in England from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. The apparent interest of the rich individuals, who form the taste as well as the laws in that country, has been against him; and with that interest it has been vain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The vicious habits which in this little piece I endeavor to combat, seem to me not so difficult to cure. No class of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple has any</hi> interest <hi>in supporting them; unless it be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest which certain families may feel in vying with each other in sumptuous entertaiments. There may indeed be some instances of depraved appetites, which no arguments will conquer; but these may be rare. There are very few persons but what would always prefer a plain dish for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and would prefer it likewise for their guests, if there were no risk of reputation in the case. This difficulty can only be removed by example; and the example should proceed from those whose situation enables them to take the lead in forming the manners of a nation. Persons of this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in America, I should hope, are neither above nor below the influence of truth and reason, when conveyed in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage suited to the subject.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:030022_0004_0FE3C78A4CB63DF0"/>
               <hi>Whether the manner I have chosen to address my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them be such as to promise any success is what I cannot decide. But I certainly had hopes of doing some good, or I should not have taken the pains of putting so many rhymes together.—The example of domestic virtues has doubtless a great effect. I only wish to rank</hi> simplicity of diet <hi>among the virtues. In that case I should hope it will be cherished and more esteemed by others than it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>

               <lg>
                  <l>YE Alps audacious, thro' the Heav'ns that rise,</l>
                  <l>To cramp the day and hide me from the skies;</l>
                  <l>Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurl'd,</l>
                  <l>Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world,</l>
                  <l>I sing not you. A softer theme I chuse,</l>
                  <l>A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse,</l>
                  <l>But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire</l>
                  <l>The purest frenzy of poetic fire.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Despise it not, ye Bards to terror steel'd,</l>
                  <l>Who hurl your thunders round the epic field;</l>
                  <l>Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing</l>
                  <l>Joys that the vineyard and the still-house bring;</l>
                  <l>Or on some distant fair your notes employ,</l>
                  <l>And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy.</l>
                  <l>I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel,</l>
                  <l>My morning incense, and my evening meal,</l>
                  <l>The sweets of Hasty-Pudding. Come, dear bowl,</l>
                  <l>Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul.</l>
                  <l>The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine,</l>
                  <l>Its substance mingled, married in with thine,</l>
                  <l>Shall cool and temper thy superior heat,</l>
                  <l>And save the pains of blowing while I eat.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song</l>
                  <l>Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue,</l>
                  <l>Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime,</l>
                  <l>And, as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme,</l>
                  <l>

No more thy aukward unpoetic name</l>
                  <l>Should shun the Muse, or prejudice thy fame;</l>
                  <l>But rising grateful to th' accustom'd ear,</l>
                  <l>All Bards should catch it, and all realms revere!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Assist me first with pious toil to trace</l>

                  <l>(Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore)</l>
                  <l>First gave thee to the world; her works of fame</l>
                  <l>Have liv'd indeed, but liv'd without a name.</l>
                  <l>Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days,</l>
                  <l>First learn'd with stones to crack the well-dry'd maize,</l>
                  <l>Thro' the rough seive to shake the golden show'r,</l>
                  <l>In boiling water stir the yellow flour:</l>
                  <l>The yellow flour, bestrew'd and stir'd with haste,</l>
                  <l>Swells in the flood and thickens to a paste,</l>
                  <l>Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim,</l>
                  <l>Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim;</l>
                  <l>The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks,</l>
                  <l>And the whole mass its true consistence takes.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Could but her sacred name, unknown so long,</l>
                  <l>Rise like her labors, to the son of song,</l>
                  <l>To her, to them, I'd consecrate my lays,</l>
                  <l>And blow her pudding with the breath of praise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <l>If 'twas Oella, whom I sang before,</l>
                  <l>I here ascribe her one great virtue more.</l>
                  <l>Not thro' the rich Peruvian realms alone</l>
                  <l>The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known,</l>
                  <l>But o'er the world's wide climes should live secure,</l>

                  <l>THE days grow short; but tho' the falling fun</l>
                  <l>To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done,</l>
                  <l>Night's pleasing shades his various task prolong,</l>
                  <l>And yield new subjects to my various song.</l>
                  <l>For now, the corn-house fill'd, the harvest home,</l>
                  <l>Th' invited neighbours to the <hi>Husking</hi> come;</l>
                  <l>A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play,</l>
                  <l>Unite their charms, to chace the hours away.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where the huge heap lies center'd in the hall,</l>
                  <l>The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall,</l>
                  <l>Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaux,</l>
                  <l>Alternate rang'd, extend in circling rows,</l>
                  <l>Assume their seats, the solid mass attack;</l>
                  <l>The dry husks rustle, and the corn-cobs crack;</l>
                  <l>The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound,</l>
                  <l>And the sweet cider trips in silence round.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The laws of Husking ev'ry wight can tell;</l>
                  <l>And sure no laws he ever keeps so well:</l>
                  <l>

For each red ear a general kiss he gains,</l>
                  <l>With each smut ear she smuts the luckless swains;</l>
                  <l>But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast,</l>
                  <l>Red as her lips, and taper as her waist,</l>
                  <l>She walks the round, and culls one favor'd beau,</l>
                  <l>Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow.</l>
                  <l>Various the sport, as are the wits and brains</l>
                  <l>Of well pleas'd lasses and contending swains;</l>
                  <l>Till the vast mound of corn is swept away,</l>
                  <l>And he that gets the last ear, wins the day.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Meanwhile the house-wife urges all her care,</l>
                  <l>The well-earn'd feast to hasten and prepare.</l>
                  <l>The sifted meal already waits her hand,</l>
                  <l>The milk is strain'd, the bowls in order stand,</l>
                  <l>The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes</l>
                  <l>The headlong stream that o'er the mill-dam breaks)</l>
                  <l>Foams, roars and rages with incessant toils,</l>
                  <l>So the vext cauldren rages, roars and boils.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>First with clean salt she seasons well the food,</l>
                  <l>Then strews the flour, and thickens all the flood.</l>
                  <l>Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand:</l>
                  <l>To stir it well demands a stronger hand;</l>
                  <l>The husband takes his turn; and round and round</l>
                  <l>The ladle flies; at last the toil is crown'd;</l>
                  <l>When to the board the thronging huskers pour,</l>
                  <l>And take their seats as at the corn before.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I leave them to their feast. There still belong</l>
                  <l>More copious matters to my faithful song.</l>
                  <l>For rules there are, tho' ne'er unfolded yet,</l>
                  <l>Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Some with molasses line the luscious treat,</l>
                  <l>And mix, like Bards, the useful with the sweet.</l>
                  <l>A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise,</l>
                  <l>A great resource in those bleak wintry days,</l>
                  <l>When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in snow,</l>
                  <l>And raging Boreas drives the shivering cow.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Blest cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ,</l>
                  <l>Great source of health, the only source of joy;</l>
                  <l>

How oft thy teats these pious hands have prest!</l>
                  <l>How oft thy bounties prove my only feast!</l>
                  <l>How oft I've fed thee with my fav'rite grain!</l>
                  <l>And roar'd, like thee, to find thy children slain!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Ye swains who know her various worth to prize,</l>
                  <l>Ah! house her well from Winter's angry skies.</l>
                  <l>Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer,</l>
                  <l>Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer;</l>
                  <l>When Spring returns she'll well acquit the loan,</l>
                  <l>And nurse at once your infants and her own.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Milk then with pudding I should always chuse;</l>
                  <l>To this in future I confine my Muse,</l>
                  <l>Till she in haste some farther hints unfold,</l>
                  <l>Well for the young, nor useless to the old.</l>
                  <l>First in your bowl the milk abundant take,</l>
                  <l>Then drop with care along the silver lake</l>
                  <l>Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide</l>
                  <l>Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide;</l>
                  <l>But when their growing mass no more can sink,</l>
                  <l>When the soft island looms above the brink,</l>
                  <l>Then check your hand; you've got the portion's due,</l>
                  <l>So taught our sires, and what they taught is true.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>There is a choice in spoons. Tho' small appear</l>
                  <l>The nice distinction, yet to me 'tis clear.</l>
                  <l>The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon, contriv'd to scoop</l>
                  <l>In ample draughts the thin diluted soup,</l>
                  <l>Performs not well in those substantial things,</l>
                  <l>Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings;</l>
                  <l>Where the strong labial muscles must embrace,</l>
                  <l>The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space.</l>
                  <l>With ease to enter and discharge the freight,</l>
                  <l>A bowl less concave but still more dilate,</l>
                  <l>Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size,</l>
                  <l>A secret rests unknown to vulgar eyes.</l>
                  <l>Experienc'd feeders can alone impart</l>
                  <l>A rule so much above the lore of art.</l>
                  <l>These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried,</l>
                  <l>With just precision could the point decide,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="15" facs="unknown:030022_0015_0FE3C6995930E210"/>
Tho' not in song; the muse but poorly shines</l>
                  <l>In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines.</l>
                  <l>Yet the true form, as near as she can tell,</l>
                  <l>Is that small section of a goose-egg-shell,</l>
                  <l>Which in two equal portions shall divide</l>
                  <l>The distance from the centre to the side.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin.</l>
                  <l>Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin</l>
                  <l>Suspend the ready napkin; or, like me,</l>
                  <l>Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee;</l>
                  <l>Just in the zeneth your wise head project,</l>
                  <l>Your full spoon, rising in a line direct,</l>
                  <l>Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall,</l>
                  <l>The wide mouth'd bowl will surely catch them all.</l>
