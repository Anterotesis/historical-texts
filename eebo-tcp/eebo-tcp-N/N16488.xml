            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is a reproach, too often ju≈øtly, ca≈øt on writers of morality, that their names prefixed in the title-pages of their books, are little el≈øe than a confutation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that follow.</p>
            <p>For as the morals of a divine, add no little weight to the doctrine he would incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the pulpit; ≈øo the life of a writer equally dimini≈øhes, or adds to, the regard the public pay his works.</p>
            <p>It is for this rea≈øon, as I ≈øhould be ≈øorry ≈øentiments, who≈øe truth and importance I am ≈øo fully convinced of, ≈øhould meet with le≈øs regard from a knowledge of their author, that this little piece comes into the world without a name, which on other occa≈øions has been made ≈øo public.</p>
            <p>I am ≈øen≈øible of the curio≈øity naturally ari≈øing in every reader, the de≈øire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who, and what is the author: but for the above mentioned rea≈øon, not to ≈øay there is a rudene≈øs in ≈øtriving to know what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du≈øtriou≈øly concealed, I pre≈øume my denial of gratifying ≈øuch curio≈øity, will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to my having le≈øs ambition to appear, in the theory, a per≈øuader of the fair ≈øex to virtue, than I have been, by example, to afford them di≈ø≈øua≈øives from vice.</p>

I am per≈øuaded, if the world were ≈øen≈øible to whom I now addre≈øs my≈øelf, no other apology would be nece≈ø≈øary for my pre≈øumption in the following work than the knowledge of your private opinion, in my behalf; but as I have no right, at this di≈øtance, to tran≈øgre≈øs ≈øo far on your Lord≈øhip's complacence, I mu≈øt ≈øubmit to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:021184_0004_0FB26DFAFA2CFD78"/>of the few, who may make any di≈øcovery concerning the author.</p>
            <p>But if a perfect knowledge of the ≈øubject, be qualification ≈øufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title a writer to the exerci≈øe of the pen; I pre≈øume, as the knowledge dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought by experience, is univer≈øally e≈øteemed the mo≈øt ju≈øt, I have been greatly, though not ≈øufficiently, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to venture on compiling <hi>the Duty of Woman.</hi>

               <p>GIVE ear, O ye daughters of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, attend to the voice of your ≈øi≈øter, for experience hath taught her wi≈ødom, and length of days virtue and under≈øtanding.</p>
               <p>My father was the brother of <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs;</hi> my mother was the ≈øi≈øter of <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the ro≈øe-bud opening to the morn, as the dew-drop on the lily, ≈øo was the loveline≈øs of my youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021184_0006_0FB26E0047A50030"/>
I awoke at the ri≈øing of the dawn; my ≈øalutation was that of joy and gladne≈øs. <hi>Plea≈øure</hi> beckoned me forth, and I ≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ≈øun-≈øhine of <hi>plenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hours were ≈øwift, and ran ≈ømil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away; but the lightne≈øs of my heart out-lived the going down of the ≈øun.</p>
               <p>The day departed with the milde≈øt breeze, and the night but invited me to the bed of repo≈øe.</p>
               <p>My pillow was the ≈øofte≈øt down, my ≈ølumbers attended with golden dreams.</p>
               <p>Thus one day pa≈ø≈øed away, and the morning of the next found me happy.</p>
               <p>Happy are the hours of artle≈øs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence! happy the days of virgin ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, while the bo≈øom is a ≈øtranger to deceit, and the heart incon≈øcious of the painful ≈øigh!</p>
               <p>O that I could overtake the wings of time! O that I could recal the plea≈øures of my youth! for the days of my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manhood have been days of many ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; the tears of misfortune have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimmed the lu≈øtre of mine eye; the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is fallen, and the ro≈øe-bud is blown and withered on my cheek.</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021184_0007_0FB26E056442DA28"/>
For I li≈øtened to the voice of <hi>adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and her bewitching blandi≈øhments allured me to de≈øtruction.</p>
               <p>The ≈øilver tongue of <hi>flattery</hi> is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and laden with guile; the manna that drops from her lips, is corro≈øive poi≈øon to the heart.</p>
               <p>Hear then, O daughter of Britain. O faire≈øt of the fair among women! let my precepts be trea≈øured in thy bo≈øom, and walk in the ways of my coun≈øel; ≈øo ≈øhalt thou ≈øhun the thorn of reproach, more keen than the bite of the a≈øp, more venemous than the ≈øting of the ≈øcorpion.</p>
               <p>The hand of ≈øcorn ≈øhall point its finger from thee; the tear of mi≈øery ≈øhall never bedew thy cheek; thy life ≈øhall be replete with good things, and peace and honour ≈øhall ≈øatisfy thy ≈øoul.</p>
