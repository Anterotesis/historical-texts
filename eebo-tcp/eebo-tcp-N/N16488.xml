            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT</hi> is a reproach, too often juſtly, caſt on writers of morality, that their names prefixed in the title-pages of their books, are little elſe than a confutation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that follow.</p>
            <p>For as the morals of a divine, add no little weight to the doctrine he would incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the pulpit; ſo the life of a writer equally diminiſhes, or adds to, the regard the public pay his works.</p>
            <p>It is for this reaſon, as I ſhould be ſorry ſentiments, whoſe truth and importance I am ſo fully convinced of, ſhould meet with leſs regard from a knowledge of their author, that this little piece comes into the world without a name, which on other occaſions has been made ſo public.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible of the curioſity naturally ariſing in every reader, the deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who, and what is the author: but for the above mentioned reaſon, not to ſay there is a rudeneſs in ſtriving to know what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly concealed, I preſume my denial of gratifying ſuch curioſity, will not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to my having leſs ambition to appear, in the theory, a perſuader of the fair ſex to virtue, than I have been, by example, to afford them diſſuaſives from vice.</p>

            <p>IF it were poſſible to ſuſpect your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ever ſpeaking without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the compliment you once honored me with, might be reckoned, as moſt compliments are, attended with no meaning: you was pleaſed to ſay, with an air of pleaſantry, you thought me the moſt proper perſon of my whole ſex, to write <hi>the Duty of a Woman;</hi> yet, as the occaſion of your Lordſhip's making this remark was a very particular one, it was impoſſible for me to conſtrue it into mere raillery. I am perſuaded, if the world were ſenſible to whom I now addreſs myſelf, no other apology would be neceſſary for my preſumption in the following work than the knowledge of your private opinion, in my behalf; but as I have no right, at this diſtance, to tranſgreſs ſo far on your Lordſhip's complacence, I muſt ſubmit to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:021184_0004_0FB26DFAFA2CFD78"/>of the few, who may make any diſcovery concerning the author.</p>
            <p>But if a perfect knowledge of the ſubject, be qualification ſufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title a writer to the exerciſe of the pen; I preſume, as the knowledge dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought by experience, is univerſally eſteemed the moſt juſt, I have been greatly, though not ſufficiently, quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to venture on compiling <hi>the Duty of Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very material objection may, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ariſe, in reſpect to my capacity in conveying thoſe ſentiments, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of my life have ſo deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. I have, therefore, followed an inimitable original, in the ſtile of the Sacred Dictates of Wiſdom, whoſe beauties, if I have juſtly, though faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, copied, I am ſatisfied, <hi>the whole Duty of Woman</hi> will need no other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>

               <p>GIVE ear, O ye daughters of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, attend to the voice of your ſiſter, for experience hath taught her wiſdom, and length of days virtue and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>My father was the brother of <hi>tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> my mother was the ſiſter of <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the roſe-bud opening to the morn, as the dew-drop on the lily, ſo was the lovelineſs of my youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021184_0006_0FB26E0047A50030"/>
I awoke at the riſing of the dawn; my ſalutation was that of joy and gladneſs. <hi>Pleaſure</hi> beckoned me forth, and I ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſun-ſhine of <hi>plenty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The hours were ſwift, and ran ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away; but the lightneſs of my heart out-lived the going down of the ſun.</p>
               <p>The day departed with the mildeſt breeze, and the night but invited me to the bed of repoſe.</p>
               <p>My pillow was the ſofteſt down, my ſlumbers attended with golden dreams.</p>
               <p>Thus one day paſſed away, and the morning of the next found me happy.</p>
               <p>Happy are the hours of artleſs inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence! happy the days of virgin ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, while the boſom is a ſtranger to deceit, and the heart inconſcious of the painful ſigh!</p>
               <p>O that I could overtake the wings of time! O that I could recal the pleaſures of my youth! for the days of my wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manhood have been days of many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows; the tears of misfortune have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimmed the luſtre of mine eye; the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is fallen, and the roſe-bud is blown and withered on my cheek.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021184_0007_0FB26E056442DA28"/>
For I liſtened to the voice of <hi>adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and her bewitching blandiſhments allured me to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The ſilver tongue of <hi>flattery</hi> is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and laden with guile; the manna that drops from her lips, is corroſive poiſon to the heart.</p>
               <p>Hear then, O daughter of Britain. O faireſt of the fair among women! let my precepts be treaſured in thy boſom, and walk in the ways of my counſel; ſo ſhalt thou ſhun the thorn of reproach, more keen than the bite of the aſp, more venemous than the ſting of the ſcorpion.</p>
               <p>The hand of ſcorn ſhall point its finger from thee; the tear of miſery ſhall never bedew thy cheek; thy life ſhall be replete with good things, and peace and honour ſhall ſatisfy thy ſoul.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021184_0008_0FB26E10CAA54010"/>pain, avoid, O daughter of Eve, the bewitching charm of curioſity.</p>
               <p>Seek not to know what is improper for thee; thirſt not after prohibited knowledge; for happier is ſhe who but knoweth a little, than ſhe who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with too much.</p>
               <p>Remember thy mother, the daughter of heaven, arrayed in the whiteſt robes of innocence; forget not the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of her diſobedience.</p>

               <p>Be thou contented, therefore, with knowledge fitting for thee; for in the acquaintance of many things, lieth not wiſdom; but in the knowledge of that which is meet.</p>
               <p>Let the threſhold of thy neighbour's door ſecure her family, let her window tempt not thine eye to ſee, nor the open caſement thine ear to hear the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of her houſe.</p>

               <p>Thy ignorance of his cunning may lay thee open to his deceit; but the knowledge thereof muſt be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thy being deceived.</p>

               <p>The eaſt and the weſt pour forth their treaſures to deck thee; the ſea and land give up the pearl and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone; thy array is the fineſt ſilk; the diamond is a ſtar on thy boſom, and the ruby and the emerald are interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the hair on thy temples.</p>
               <p>Therefore vanity hath lifted thee up, thou fluttereſt on the wings of thine own conceit, thou deſpiſeſt even the ground where the vulgar tread, thy chariot is drawn by white horſes, and thy feet are hardly conſcious of their own burden.</p>

               <p>They are decked in the pride of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, they enjoy the ſun-ſhine a while, but ſhortly fade and attract the eye no more.</p>
               <p>Is thy breath perfume, is thy taſte rich? the particoloured carnation and

               <p>Nay, they will condemn thee unheard, yea, cenſure when thou ſpeakeſt not.</p>

               <p>THE coronet of glory decketh the head of the young veſtal, ſhe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in reſpect, her ſteps are attended with reverence, and the words of her mouth are held in high eſtimation.</p>
               <p>She approacheth the excellence of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, her ſtate is that of the moſt perfect innocence of mortality.</p>
               <p>The Heathen conſecrated her to divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, her truſt was eſteemed an inviolable ſecurity, and her interceſſion gave life to thoſe who had forfeited it unto death.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian calleth the mother of ſalvation by her name, ſhe is honored throughout the whole earth.</p>
               <p>Art thou enamoured with the beauty of her condition, wouldſt thou honour thyſelf in her ſituation; attend to the voice of inſtruction, and ſhun the rock, on which the veſſel of thy ſiſter hath been daſhed to pieces.</p>

Preſume not on a vow of chaſtity, nor be tranſported with the zeal of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary virginity; there is no merit in conſtraint, there is no virtue in forced obedience.</p>
               <p>Be cautious leſt thou ſully the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of innocence; the leaſt ſpeck is ſeen on the new-fallen ſnow.</p>
               <p>Let not curioſity miſlead thee; for curioſity is unſeemly in a woman, but in a virgin, dangerous as the breath of evil.</p>
               <p>Let thy converſation be with the ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of elegance; liſten not to the levity of the daughters of indiſcretion.</p>
               <p>Do they ſay there is no harm, we may talk, for the words of our lips are air, and not criminal; theſe are the ſnares of the licentious; the breath of their mouth is malignant, the ſparkling of their eyes is contagious.</p>
               <p>They will infect thee to do ill, thou wilt fall into the ſnare before thou art aware thereof.</p>
               <p>As the ladder deſcendeth by degrees, ſo many are the intermediate ſteps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the modeſty of the virgin, and the boldneſs of a proſtitute.</p>

Let not thine ear liſten to the tale of the wanton, nor be privy to the amour of thy ſiſter, even with her ſworn ſpouſe.</p>
               <p>Delight not in the romantic tales of love; the triumphant beauty and the captive knight, are deluding images to thy paſſions.</p>
               <p>A fictitious tale, may awaken a real curioſity, and that may prove fatal to thy peace.</p>
               <p>Learn not wiſdom of thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor endeavour to over-reach the ſagacity of thy mother.</p>
               <p>Let thy toilette claim thy morning hours, but dreſs not a ſecond time in a day.</p>
               <p>Thy elegance will be an ornament, but thy frequent change of apparel will favour of profuſeneſs and uncertainty of temper.</p>
               <p>Let not thy ſervants fly thick with invitations, neither be thou much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected if the rout be put off till to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

In thy father's houſe, learn the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of a wife from thy mother; ſo ſhalt thou carry it into life, and be the comfort of thy future huſband.</p>
               <p>Is there who delighteth in aſſemblies, who prideth herſelf in the pleaſures of the maſk, who ſtaketh her fortune on a dye; ſhe putteth her honour in the hands of a ſharper, and placeth the jewel of her reputation on the next hazard.</p>
               <p>The days of her virginity ſhall want the honour thereof; and the man who giveth his freedom for her embraces, ſhall repent of his bargain.</p>
               <p>Grey hairs are uncomely to the virgin, the ancient maiden is a by-word with her ſiſters, and is accounted ill conditioned among women.</p>
               <p>Doth ſhe ſtrive to hide her years, doth ſhe aſſume the gaiety of her youth; her celibacy will not appear the effect of choice, but of neceſſity.</p>
               <p>Reject not the ordinance of marriage, nor put the day afar off, when it promiſes thee happineſs.</p>
               <p>Yet truſt not a man, on thine own knowledge; confide not in his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before thee.</p>

Deceit is familiar to his ways, and flattery and hypocriſy the fruits of his tongue.</p>
               <p>Is he obſequious, ceremonious, and full of words; though the honey of the wild bee is on his lips, yet the ſting of the hornet lieth hid in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom.</p>
               <p>Be not taken with the appearance of gaiety: the painted butterfly is an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of the coxcomb.</p>
               <p>Be not deceived by the high opinion of heroiſm, by the empty braggard; he is as the ſound of a drum, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he promiſeth thee but the defence of a coward.</p>
               <p>Neither is the valour of a man, or the ſtrength of his arm, an indication of the integrity of his heart.</p>
               <p>Hath he ſlain his friend in defence of thy beauty, is his ſword looſe in its ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard; join not thy hand with his, leſt thou repent the magnanimity of thine huſband.</p>
               <p>Take not a man abſorbed in ſtudy, the philoſopher is not a man of this world; he will be abſent even in thy company, he will be as a child to be

               <p>Thou wilt have no companion in him; he will be wanting in the duties of his family.</p>
               <p>Liſten not to the ſervile, who cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth low and is a beggar in his ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for when he hath command, he will be imperious; thou wilt perceive he knoweth not himſelf.</p>
               <p>Avoid the libertine as the fiery ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; he is the deſtroyer among the daughters of women.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt be wedded to him, yet have no huſband; thy bed will be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and thy nights comfortleſs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</p>

               <p>It is called the child of love; but as the viper whoſe birth is the death of its parents, ſo is the conception of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy the deſtruction of the mother that bears it.</p>

               <p>BRIGHT as the morning ſtar, dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the radiance of the ſun-beams, cometh the ſeraph of immortality.</p>
               <p>She approacheth in white robes, her eye is fixed on the heavens, her knee is humbled in the duſt, ſhe giveth laws to the daughters of women.</p>
               <p>She teacheth the way of virtue, her precepts are ſimplicity and truth.</p>
               <p>Her profeſſion is pure and undefiled, her temple is not filled with prieſts.</p>
               <p>The duties ſhe enjoineth, are plain and eaſy; ſhe dealeth not in the ſyſtems of ſpeculation and vain philoſophy.</p>
               <p>She perplexeth not the mind with the hypotheſes of ſcepticiſm, neither the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villers nor the ſophiſts are the teachers of her precepts.</p>
               <p>Attend to her counſel, and abide by her inſtructions; ſo ſhall peace be the companion of thy reflections, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs the partner of thy contemplations.</p>

In the practice of piety is ſatisfaction on earth, and its reward is on high, in the regions of bliſs and immortality.</p>
