            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE COUNCIL Iudging it of Absolute necessity for the Security of the English and the Indians that are in Amity with us, that they be Restrained their usual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the English, and hunting in the Woods, during the time of Hostility with those that are our Enemies;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do Order, that all those <hi>Indians</hi> that are desirous to Approve themselves Faithfull to the <hi>English,</hi> be confined to their several <hi>Plantations under written,</hi> untill the <hi>Council</hi> shall take further Order; and that they so order the setting of their <hi>Wigwams</hi> that they may stand Compact in some one part of their <hi>Plantations</hi> respectively, where it may be best for their own <hi>Provision and Defence</hi> and that none of them do presume to <hi>Travaile</hi> above one <hi>mile</hi> from the <hi>Center</hi> of such these dwellings, unless in Company of some English, or in their Service near their dwellings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting for gathering and fetching in their Corn with one English man, on peril of being taken as our enemies, or their Abettours: And in case that any of them shall be taken without the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits abovesaid, except as abovesaid, and do loose their Lives or be otherwise damnified, by Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish or Indians: The <hi>COUNCIL</hi> do hereby Declare that they shall account themselves wholly Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and their Blood or other dammge (by them susteined) will be upon their own heads.</p>
            <p>Also it shall not be lawful for any <hi>Indians</hi> that are in Amity with us, to entertain any <hi>strange Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or receive any of cur Enemies Plunder, but shall from time to time make discovery thereof to some <hi>English</hi> that shall be appointed for that end to sojourn among them, on penalty of being reputed our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of being liable to be proceeded against as such.</p>
            <p>Also whereas it is the manner of the Heathen that are now in Hostility with us, contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Civil Nations, to execute their bloody Insolencies by stealth and sculking in small parties, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining all open decission of their controversie, either by Treaty or by the Sword,</p>
            <p>The Council do therefore Order; That after the Publication of the Provision aforesaid, It shall be lawful for any person whether <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi> that shall finde any <hi>Indian</hi> travelling or skulking in any of our Towns or Woods, contrary to the limits abovenamed, to command them under their Guard, and Examination, or to kill and destroy them as they best may or can. The <hi>Council</hi> hereby declaring, that it will be most acceptable to them that none be killed or wounded that are willing to surrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into custody.</p>
            <p>The places of the <hi>Indians</hi> Residencies are <hi>Natick, Punquapaog, Nashoba, Wamesit</hi> and <hi>Hassanemesit:</hi> And if there be any that belong to any other Plantations, they are to repair to some one of these.</p>
