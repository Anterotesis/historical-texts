            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ADDRESS to the STUDENTS Of DICKINSON COLLEGE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY YOUNG FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AFTER deſpairing even of life, and renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hopes of being uſeful to this ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, it has pleaſed God to reſtore me to my former health and office. I hope it will be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to ſay any thing to convince you of my good will to this country, and to this College in particular. If abandoning an honourable and independent ſtation, and renouncing the ſociety of many valuable and long tried friends; if my croſſing the vaſt Atlantic, and expoſing my life to the perils of a new climate, are not ſufficient to perſuade you of my good wiſhes, it will be needleſs to uſe any words to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The troubles and diſtreſſes of my family, and the pains I have endured, both in body and mind ſince my arrival in this country, I ſhall chearfully forget, if I ſhall be enabled to be ſubſervient to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting of your ſtudies, and forming your taſte and morals, ſo that you may fulfil the hopes of your parents, and prove uſeful citizens to your country.</p>
            <p>You are here aſſembled from various parts, and muſt have different views and expectations in life,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019865_0003_0FAD3D5E82390BC8"/>
but I hope you are all agreed in the deſire of learning, and reſolve to cultivate the powers of your mind, from a conviction that the knowledge you may acquire here, will enable you to fill with dignity and propriety the ſeveral ſtations to which you may be called; and to contribute your parts to promote the happineſs, and to raiſe the reputation of this new and riſing empire.</p>
            <p>It is of the utmoſt conſequence to your progreſs in learning, that you form juſt notions of its digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and importance to the public as well as to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as individuals. It is not to ſpend your years in idleneſs and diſſipation, or to acquire a ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tincture of letters, that you have been ſent hither with ſo much trouble and expence by your parents. They expect ſomething more ſolid and uſeful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for their pains and charge on your account.— They hope that you will aſpire to excellence and diſtinction in your ſtudies, and that the honeſt emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which a public education produces, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you to an uſeful and diligent employment of your time here. You are now in the moſt pleaſant and the moſt important time of life: your powers are freſh, and eaſily ſuſceptible of improvement, and the impreſſions that you receive at this time muſt be of the utmoſt importance in determining your future ſates and characters. Your preſent rank as ſtudents is honourable. As candidates for ſcience, fame and conſequence, you ought to deſpiſe every thing that is mean and diſhonourable, and think your time too precious to be ſpent in trifles or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purſuits.</p>
            <p>A ſuperficial application to learning is ſo far from being uſeful, that it is greatly prejudicial. It
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019865_0004_0FAD3D5F46D2BFF8"/>
fills the mind with confuſed notions, and ſometimes with unſufferable vanity; it tends to bring learning into diſgrace, and leads the world to form falſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its tendency and importance. It creates a contempt and averſion to ſtudy, and is apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate its baleful influence to future generations. It places the ſtudent on a level with the forward ſmatterer, whoſe learning is extracted from maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines and reviews, and whoſe pertneſs ariſes only from his ignorance.</p>
            <p>It is true that all are not endowed with equal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for making progreſs in letters, and that different ſtudies are ſuited to different tempers and characters: yet diligence, application and conſtant deſire of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, will carry every man as far as nature intended he ſhould go; and the various branches of ſtudy in which youth are exerciſed, will point out to every ſtudent what he is beſt qualified for, and develope the natural bent of his genius, ſo as to direct him how to employ himſelf in future. But without applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we can make no diſcovery of our talents, and the indolent ſtudent muſt continue a child for life.</p>
            <p>To encourage you to diligence, you ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that you have our reputation, as well as your own fame and intereſt, in your hands; and that much of the happineſs and ſatisfaction of your parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on your preſent behaviour, and the manner in which you employ your time and talents. After a pretty long life ſpent in the purſuit of learning, and undergoing ſo many dangers and troubles for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting its increaſe in this country, I flatter myſelf that I have a name to loſe; and you would do me a ſenſible and grievous injury, if it ſhould be loſt by your negligence. With regard to my colleagues,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019865_0005_0FAD3D604EFB4038"/>
I need ſay nothing, as you know their capacity and characters by actual experience. We all have an equal intereſt in your progreſs, as the world will not believe us to be good for any thing, unleſs you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be profited by our pains and inſtructions. Your parents expect that you ſhould return inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved in the knowledge of men and things, and that you ſhould be qualified for uſeful and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſtations in life; and you cannot do juſtice to them or to us, except by a diligent application to your ſtudies, and a conſtant attention to moral duties.</p>
            <p>You muſt be ſenſible that the greateſt pains and diligence on our part will be quite abortive without your hearty conſent and concurrence. To talk to the deaf, or, which is the ſame thing, to the thoughtleſs and inattentive, is labouring without pleaſure and without profit, and muſt be extremely afflicting to every ſenſible and benevolent mind.— You have it in your power to render all our labours unſucceſsful, and to baffle all our hopes of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſefulneſs; but we hope you will not be ſo ill-natured as to employ your power for ſo vile a purpoſe, eſpecially as it muſt at the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve yourſelves in ignorance, inſignificance, guilt and miſery.</p>
            <p>We would therefore beg, as the greateſt favour to ourſelves, as well as the beſt ſervice you can do to your own character, to the intereſt of your parents and the public, that your conſent may conſpire with our wiſhes to promote your beſt intereſts: you muſt ſee the neceſſity of ſuch concurrence, and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous conſequences of refuſing it. Let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find in you a readineſs to be inſtructed, and a deſire of excelling in thoſe branches of knowledge
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019865_0006_0FAD3D60C32BF748"/>
in which you are to be exerciſed. The habit of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and a conſtant endeavour to underſtand and retain the inſtructions of your teachers, will make your ſtudies eaſy and pleaſant, as well as profitable to you; and unleſs you make your ſtudies your pleaſure, your ſituation as ſtudents will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly painful and uncomfortable, your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance will be a burden: you will live the life of priſoners, conſtantly diſpleaſed with your preſent ſituation, conſtantly longing for a change, with the diſmal conſciouſneſs that you are loſing your time, and that your ſufferings are entirely without profit to yourſelves or others.</p>
            <p>With regard to your behaviour to us and to one another, we hope your parents have taught you the rudiments of good manners, and that you will not diſgrace their inſtructions and example, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulance, impertinence or rudeneſs of any kind.— The child who behaves rudely and improperly to others, diſhonours his father's houſe, and gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers an occaſion to believe that he has been ill-edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or that his parents have ſet him a bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A haughty and quarrelſome temper, a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to revenge and miſchief, are moſt fatal to the character and happineſs of youth, and afford the moſt unfavourable prognoſtic of their riper years. "Men are but children of a larger growth." Thoſe habits that are formed, &amp; thoſe propenſities that are diſcovered in youth, ordinarily prevail through the whole of life. Such ſtudents as you are here, ſuch citizens you will prove to the republic. If you now acquire a love of order, juſtice, decency and obliging behaviour, you will be the delight of your parents, and the ornaments and ſupports of the ſtate; but if you indulge pride and revenge, if
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019865_0007_0FAD3D61FA1A4480"/>
you are prone to quarrel, deſpiſe and fight with one another, what elſe can be expected from the growth of ſuch habits, but that you ſhould become the grief of your parents, a diſgrace to your maſters, and friends, and the peſts and firebrands of every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety? Make your choice between theſe extremes.</p>
            <p>We do not indeed expect from your early years, the coolneſs, the prudence &amp; the gravity of advanced age. Such errors as ariſe from the natural warmth, the innocent gaiety, and even the levity of youth, may be naturally expected and eaſily pardoned: but we hope you will conſider that you are no longer children, that by your admiſſion into this ſociety, and being engaged in the ſtudies and employments of men, you are conſidered as ſubjects of moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuſceptible of the principles of law and order. You have already in a good meaſure the command of yourſelves, and are capable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being conſcious when you are in the wrong. With theſe capacities you may avoid the follies of childhood, and contract thoſe habits of attention and application that are proper for your age, and favourable to your progreſs in your ſtudies.</p>
            <p>Idleneſs and trifling are the bane of youth, both with reſpect to learning and morals; theſe habits prevent progreſs, excite quarrels, and encourage the groſſeſt corruption of manners. They are the beginning of vices and of ſorrows, and can not be too much checked and diſcouraged. Trifling is a perverted activity which in every event leads to evil, and tends either to meanneſs or malice. Let me warn you eſpecially againſt one vice which is often prevalent among youth, and indicates or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the worſt diſpoſitions: we mean the practice
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019865_0008_0FAD3D625084E1C0"/>
of exciting or tempting one another to evil, and prompting them to deeds of malice or revenge.— To ſow diſcord among brethren, to irritate the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and evil paſſions of men, is the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the devil, and ought to be held in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt abhorrence by all who would be wiſe or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>
            <p>Magnanimity and dignity of behaviour are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that ought to be in high eſteem with youth, as they lay the foundations of a good character, and prevent our age from bluſhing for the meanneſs of our early years. But it is of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to form juſt notions of theſe virtues, and to be well informed wherein real magnanimity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts. It is not in contempt of others, or prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to revenge, or being the plague or terror of ſociety. On the contrary a perſon of true magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity will always be juſt to the merits of others, and will reckon nothing ſo diſgraceful as what is unjuſt, and injurious to the rights of others; and will be aſhamed of every thing that is unworthy of human nature, or hurtful to the order of ſociety: he will be mild and gentle to others, and will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from injuring them, for his own ſake as well as for theirs. He will not leave it in the power of every one to tempt him to indecent and paſſionate behaviour, nor diſgrace himſelf becauſe another is injurious; but deſpiſing the ignoble paſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he will avoid the ſociety of the wicked, and aſſociate with thoſe who are capable of inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pleaſing him by their example, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of tempting him to indecency by injury.</p>
            <p>The moſt effectual antidote againſt quarrelling and mean behaviour, is diligence and application to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019865_0009_0FAD3D635DB8C3C0"/>
your ſtudies: all the vices and miſeries of youth ariſe uniformly from ignorance and trifling. If you are idle, your lives will be at once unprofitable and unpleaſant. As an additional incitement to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, we would ſuggeſt to you the advantages you enjoy as ſtudents of this ſeminary, and the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages you muſt labour under from its yet infant ſtate. Both theſe ought to incite you to diligence, that you may improve the one, and ſurmount or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the other. At preſent you have leiſure, and opportunity of profiting by books and inſtructors. But as theſe can not yet be afforded you in ſuch number and variety as is to be wiſhed, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you ought to uſe more diligence to profit by the opportunities you have; and the fewer theſe are at preſent, the more honour will your diligence and ſucceſs reflect on yourſelves, and on this new ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>If you ever hope to proſper in learning, you will not content yourſelves with reading thoſe parts only of claſſic authors that are prelected to you by your maſters, and of which you are to give an account to them. By confining yourſelves to theſe, you effectually diſappoint their intentions, and render their pains uſeleſs to yourſelves. By making you acquainted with a part, they intended to make you capable of reading the whole. There is no underſtanding the merit, nor profiting by the talents of an author, by conſulting extracts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached parts; you can not have time to read all that is excellent in them at ſchool; and I know from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and obſervation, that a diligent boy will go through the whole of any author in a ſhorter time than the unequal abilities of a claſs will get thro' that part that is taught in public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:019865_0010_0FAD3D63C12624C8"/>Altho' the rules of grammar and conſtruction are neceſſary in order to underſtand foreign languages, you muſt not think you have done when you have made yourſelves maſters of theſe. It remains to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the ſenſe, the hiſtory, the ſentiment, and the beauties of thought and language; to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſcope and ſpirit of the writer, to diſcern his excellencies and to detect his weakneſs, or that of the times in which he lived. The claſſics are uſeful, not from their being writ in dead languages, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it coſts a great deal of pains to read them: but they are valuable as models of juſt thinking, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true taſte, and monuments of the wiſdom and capacity of ancient nations, and have been the delight and wonder of many ſucceſſive generations.</p>
            <p>You ought always to remember that real learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does not conſiſt in acquiring a great many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and indigeſted ideas, nor in performing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic exerciſes with ſuch apparent propriety as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade others that you are learned: far leſs does it conſiſt in the uſe of harſh and uncouth terms, which are not familiar to ordinary underſtandings, but that it conſiſts in the exerciſe and application of the powers of the mind, the improvement of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive as well as our active faculties, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and diſcerning of truth, and ſuch an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with human nature and its excellencies and defects, its acquiſitions and hiſtory, as may fit us for the right conduct of life, and for promoting the happineſs of ourſelves and others.</p>
            <p>In order to profit by reading, meditation and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention muſt be joined with it, we muſt not paſs by any thing that we do not underſtand, or content ourſelves with a ſingle reading of what is uſeful,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019865_0011_0FAD3DE968E4EEE0"/>
excellent or neceſſary; and we ought to labour to retain what we have read, becauſe it is only that which we retain that can be profitable to us in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Inattentive and deſultory reading is only a more active idleneſs, and a more decent mode of trifling. It is better to ſhut the book as ſoon as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention fails, than to accuſtom ourſelves to read without it.</p>
            <p>A fooliſh truſting to public exerciſes has been the ruin of many ſtudents. To confine ourſelves to our preſcribed leſſons, and our ſtudies to the public hours, argues a narrow mind, deſtitute of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inſenſible of the excellence and charms of true learning. Poor and ſcanty muſt be the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the pretended ſtudent, who ſeigns atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in public, and is idle and negligent in private! This is rendering public exerciſes entirely uſelell, and thwarting the intention of your inſtructors. As that can be done in public is to preſcribe general rules, to remove difficulties, to caution againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſuggeſt uſeful hints and directions; but the main buſineſs of learning is to be compaſſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by private ſtudy and meditation; and the ſtudent who does not apply his diligence in private, miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the true nature and deſign of public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. Thoſe parents likewiſe are greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken who inſiſt that their children ſhould be kept to long confinement and attendance, ſo as to leave them neither time, ſpirits or inclination for private ſtudy. It is impoſſible that any ſhould be made ſcholars in this manner. Such injunctions diſcover a deep ignorance of human nature, as if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to teach boys againſt their will, or force them into learning by whipping and impriſonment. Theſe methods may readily produce a rooted averſion for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019865_0012_0FAD3DEA72CD14C8"/>
learning, as it is certain that they render progreſs in it utterly unattainable and impracticable; but they will never make boys in love with ſtudy, or ambitious to excel in knowledge. Even in the loweſt claſſes, the ſtudent muſt prepare his leſſon at home, if he expects to be able to pleaſe his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or keep up with his claſs; but ſuch regulations as leave no time for this, deprive the ſtudent of opportunities of profiting, and oblige the maſter to labour in vain.</p>
            <p>As our public library is as yet but indifferently furniſhed, and could never ſupply the neceſſities of all, and as the procuring a variety of books in a new country is utterly impoſſible, you ought to be more diligent in the uſe of all the books you can command, eſpecially of ſuch as lead to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of others. Without a tolerable acquaintance with literary hiſtory, a ſtudent can not proſecute his ſtudies, whatever opportunities and helps he may enjoy. He muſt be at a loſs where to apply for help, unleſs he knows what authors have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the ſubject in which he deſires information.</p>
            <p>In order to diſcover the genius and capacity of ſtudents, and to ſuggeſt uſeful hints for conducting their ſtudies and regulating their conduct, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that private acquaintance and converſation are of great uſe. It will therefore be agreeable to me to receive viſits from all of the ſtudents, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as their ſtudies and mine will permit, and to ſuggeſt to them what may be uſeful, as well as to reſolve their doubts and difficulties, being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to act as the private preceptor, as well as the public inſtructor of every ſtudent, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reſpect of perſons, who comes to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary in queſt of uſeful knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:019865_0013_0FAD3DEB03C89508"/>As concord and order are the ſoul and ſtrength of every ſociety, and peculiarly neceſſary in a ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſtudy of letters, we hope that every ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will reckon it his honour to ſtudy theſe with the greateſt care; and to attain theſe you ought to reflect how diſgraceful it is to diſturb ſociety, and to appear impatient of order and equal ſociety. It will be our part to render all of you equal juſtice and encouragement, but it will depend on your conduct to render our labours pleaſant and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Beware of pride, from which contention cometh; abhor injuſtice and inſulting manners, and avoid all indecent and provoking expreſſions. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that your character as well as your ſucceſs in learning, depends on your preſent behaviour, and that if you do not ſhew yourſelves regular, well-bred and peaceable ſtudents, there can be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hope of your becoming uſeful or eſtimable citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>As your time is your greateſt treaſure, and may be employed to the beſt account, we would earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend a prudent and thrifty improvement of it. For this purpoſe you ought to riſe early, and beware of ſpending too much of it in unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary exerciſes or childiſh recreations. You have much to do, and unleſs you apply to yout ſtudies betimes, you muſt be great loſers. Beſides, ſaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and idleneſs are inimical to habits of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and by neglecting to ſtudy, you may ſoon become incapable of it. If you would practiſe the leſſon of Pythagoras, and examine every evening what you have been doing all day, you will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the value of time, and the folly of idleneſs, by obſerving how little you have done, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019865_0014_0FAD3DEBA398E658"/>
of what you might have done, which may lead to a better improvement of time for the future.</p>
            <p>You ought never to forget that all true learning is ſubordinate and conducive to morals and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is not in order that you may be admired for your talents that your parents have beſtowed on you benefits of a liberal education. They expect that you ſhould become virtuous, orderly and uſeful members of ſociety, that you ſhould know how to eſteem true excellence, to revere truth and honour, to form yourſelves upon the beſt models, to deſpiſe every thing that is mean and vicious, to delight in promoting the happineſs of others, to be lovers of peace, to form friendſhip with the virtuous and worthy, to avoid the ſociety of the wicked, and to merit and command the eſteem of the wiſer part of your fellow citizens.</p>
            <p>Young people are apt to imagine that they have little to do with religion, and that it is time enough to think of that in mature life; but this is a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miſtake. "Train up a child," ſays Solomon, "in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Even a child is known by his way, whether it be pure and whether it be right. Young as you are, you have a conſcience; you are ſubjects of moral diſcipline, and ſuſceptible of good or bad moral characters. You know not whether you may live to mature age, and what ſhall become of your ſouls if you die in an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, thoughtleſs and irreligious ſtate? We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that your parents have taught you to know and honour the God who made you, to revere his name, and to pray to him daily, for the pardon of your ſins, the purifying of your natures, and final
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019865_0015_0FAD3DEC43BFBF50"/>
happineſs and ſalvation through Jeſus Chriſt. We hope you are inſtructed in the neceſſity of holineſs and virtue as the only means to fit you for eternal life. It ſhall be our endeavour to ſecond the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and intentions, as well as to fulfil the wiſhes of your parents, ſo far as is in our power, by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting to you as occaſion offers, ſuitable advices for your moral and religious conduct in life; and in ſo doing we are ſure of pleaſing them by endeavouring to promote your real happineſs. Even wicked and thoughtleſs parents would be ſorry to ſee their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren growing up in vicious habits; and nothing can exceed the ſorrow of virtuous and chriſtian parents when their children walk not in the ways of God. Give joy to your parents, and to your maſters and friends, by an early application to religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and practice; read the word of God with care, reverence and attention: pray to God for wiſdom and ſpiritual underſtanding, and ye ſhall not aſk in vain. Be aſſured that it is your higheſt honour to honour God, to thank him for his benefits, and keep his commandments; you will be more worthy of the eſteem of your neighbours, if you pray to God morning and evening, if you ſtudy to pleaſe him, and to keep the ſabbath day holy, to abſtain from all mean and vicious conduct. You may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure yourſelves that ſuch a conduct will contribute no leſs to your progreſs in learning than your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in virtue. God is the father of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and ought to be acknowledged and worſhipped in that character. He made our ſouls, with all their wonderful powers; and their improvement and exerciſe muſt depend on his bounty. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the plowman and the mechanic is attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture to the teaching of God, and that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019865_0016_0FAD3DED0B1C40E8"/>
large and comprehenſive knowledge which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed king Solomon, is expreſſly ſaid to have been the gift of God. And who elſe can give it? As in religion, ſo likewiſe in learning, though Paul may plant, and Apollos water, it belongs to God only to give the increaſe. You are groſſly miſtaken if you imagine that a religious life is melancholy or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable; on the contrary it is the only road to true pleaſure and ſatisfaction. To have God for your friend, your father and defender, is true dignity as well as ſolid peace and confidence. Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord. What man is he that deſireth life and loveth many days, that he may ſee good? keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guile, depart from evil and do good: ſeek peace, and purſue it. The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. The face of God is againſt them that do evil, to cut off their memory from the earth. Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</p>
