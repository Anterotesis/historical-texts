            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Oration, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO think well of even the defects of our country, is a pardonable infirmity. To view them with indulgence,—to approach them with filial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and tenderneſs and to cover them with the mantle of a partial, and almoſt blind affection, is a degree of virtue. But to value and boaſt her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and bleſſings, to exult in her honor and be made happy by her happineſs, is inſeparable from every juſt mind, and generous heart. If this nationality of ſentiment and feeling be ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in her fathers, who are approaching the time, in which they will be unaffected by her fortunes, and releaſed from her ſervice; it is truly graceful in her children, who, juſt parting, or parted, from the goal, muſt run with her their whole career of life; and make and ſhare her diſgrace or glory, her miſery or happineſs. If this ſenſibility to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts dignify age, and adorn youth at all times, it
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033963_0003_0FF9C061A3A899E0"/>does it <hi>then</hi> more than ever, when not only her rights are invaded, and her fame reproached, but a deadly potion is held to her mouth, and a murderous dagger aimed at her boſom.</p>
            <p>THOUGH the eulogy of the bleſſings and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of <hi>America</hi> is ſo common, as to want the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of novelty; and ſometimes ſo extravagant, as to incur the imputation of vanity; yet, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency of her circumſtances, which demands all the enthuſiaſm of patriotiſm, and engages all the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of philanthropy; in an aſſembly, compoſed of perſons, poſſeſſing, or anticipating more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon her opinions and conduct; and in a place, conſecrated to the ſublime purpoſe of rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her guides, her models, and her guardians; it can be neither unpleaſant nor uninſtructive, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol her felicity, to unfold her dangers, and to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her duty.</p>
            <p>AN ample field for ſplendid deſcription, and for animating prophecy lies open, in the population, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulence, and proſperity of our country, in the ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and variety of her ſoil, in the advantages of her climate and ſituation, in the abundance of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, in the extenſiveneſs of her commerce, and the immenſity of her reſources. But it may be more uſeful and agreeable, on this occaſion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our attention to thoſe PRINCIPLES, MAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERS.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033963_0004_0FF9DDC269D86318"/>and INSTITUTIONS, which are the price and pledge of all her other bleſſings; and to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate our obligations and motives to cheriſh them, in their pure ſpirit and tendency, as they were poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and tranſmitted to us by our predeceſſors, unadul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated by latter mixtures of error and vice.<note n="*" place="bottom">THE text for this comment, is prepared by that man, whoſe name will be coeval with his country, in his addreſs to the young men of the American metropolis. "Without wiſhing," ſays he, "to damp the ardor of curioſity, or influence the freedom of inquiry. I will hazard a predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that after the moſt induſtrious, and impartial reſearches, the longeſt liver of you all, will find no principles, inſtitutions or ſyſtems of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more fit in general to be tranſmitted to your poſterity, than thoſe, which you have received from your anceſtors." Let not this prediction, ſo ſolemn and affectionate, be diſregarded, leſt we ſee the day of bitter, but ineffectual repentance.</note> Theſe <hi>principles, habits,</hi> and <hi>inſtitutions</hi> are not the ephem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral productions of the day; not the noſtrums of upſtart political quackery; not the novel diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of infidel philoſophy; not the vagaries of brains, diſtempered with revolutionary fervor; but they are fabrics, raiſed by time, covered with the "vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hoar" of years, founded in wiſdom, improved by experience, and evinced the moſt ſufficient bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, that man can erect, againſt the inundations of vice, folly, and miſery. They are, to our country, the <hi>"tree of life in the midſt of the city, which yields her fruit continually, the leaves whereof are for the healing of the nations."</hi> Let our wiſdom and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue guard it, as the cherubim and flaming ſword, which turned every way, guarded the avenue to the tree of <hi>Eden.</hi> Let them defend it from the demons, infidelity, ambition, and faction, which are prowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033963_0005_0FF9C072288FF4F8"/>around it, ready to pluck its fruits, to ſtrip its foliage, with the blaſt of their breath, to kill its veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etating virtue, and with their vengeful axe to hew it down, and caſt it into that fire, which is lighted at the infernal pile to lay waſte the natural and moral world.</p>
            <p>IT would be no unintereſting labor, to attempt a minute delineation of the whole deſign and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, colouring and drapery of the piece, on which our fathers, and we have been working; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent opportunity will afford ſufficient time only for ſketching a few of its characteriſtic outlines.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of the <hi>political</hi> principles, which we have received, a principle often expreſſed in very indefinite language, and whoſe miſconception, or perverſion, has in a manner annihilated ſociety in one country in <hi>Europe,</hi> is this, "THAT ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL." The blaſphemies ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the crimes committed, and the deſolation ſpread within the ſpace of a few years, in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>liberty and equality,</hi> have aſſociated ſuch turpitude and horror with the words, that the blood freezes, the heart ſickens at their ſound. Viewed in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation, inſtead of tutelary divinities demanding the love and veneration of men, for the bleſſings which they ſhed, they appear tremendous ſpectres, born of chaos and ſtalking through the earth with the ſcythe of deſtruction. If we ſee them only in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:033963_0006_0FF9C0C3193B2310"/>of theſe their pretended patrons and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, they are the agents of envenomed envy, of phrenzied ambition, and inſatiate avarice, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned to go forth into the nations, and convert man into a brute, kingdoms into theatres of blood, and ſociety into a dreary waſte, on which "vegetates no plant but the hemlock and the night-ſhade;" they are another name for robbery, devaſtation, and murder; for a lofty and preſumptuous indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all laws, natural, civil, moral, and divine; an impious victory over all the motives and feelings, implanted by the Creator, to check and modify the infinitaly diverging action of the human will and paſſions, and prevent the ſocial ſtate from being worſe than a deſert.</p>
            <p>BUT breaking this unnatural aſſociation, we find that <hi>we</hi> have not ſo learned liberty, and that, well underſtood, it is the firſt of bleſſings. As it is taught in our ſchool, the liberty of a nation, with reſpect to other nations, is the right of governing itſelf in conſiſtency with their rights. Such a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we poſſeſſed, before our ſeparation from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent country, until her ſyſtem of aggreſſion began. We ever denied her claim to bind us in any caſe, without our conſent. Since revolution has come to mean ſubverſion, it means too much to be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that alteration of our political relations made by independence. We contended for preſervation.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033963_0007_0FF9C076B4228308"/>not acquiſition, to keep the rights we had, rather than to gain thoſe we never had; and the ſeparation was reſorted to chiefly as a neceſſary means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ancient ground. We are not therefore very much flattered, that our former ally ſhould think we were complimented, in being told of our emancipation from actual rather than threatened ſlavery, by our revolutionary conteſt. We will not inſult the aſhes of our fathers, by admitting, for a moment, that they were ever "hewers of wood, and drawers of water," to any power on earth; that they, who conveyed to us an abhorrence of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ever ſubmitted to it; and we will correct the miſtake, and repel the taunt of our hypocritical friend in the language of our illuſtrious ſon of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, aſſuring her, that every AMERICAN, was "BORN IN A LAND OF FREEDOM."<note n="*" place="bottom">See Ade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BY <hi>liberty,</hi> as it reſpects our internal relations, we underſtand protection of rights; and by <hi>rights,</hi> the claim of every member of the community to all the advatages which he can obtain and enjoy, without injuring others. Theſe rights are declared to be the right to life and perſonal ſecurity, the right
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033963_0008_0FF9DDF2E25BCAA8"/>to acquire, hold, and tranſmit property, the right to liberty of action, the right to reputation, the right to liberty of opinion, of ſpeech, and of religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and worſhip. But we conſider all theſe rights ſubject to various limitations and exceptions. We deny that they allow any one to be judge in his own cauſe; or to exert them in any way inconſiſtent with law. Society here does not ſecure life to the murderer, freedom of action to the madman, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to the thief, robber, or knave, reputation to the villain, nor liberty of ſpeech and writing to the tongues or pens, which miſlead the ignorant or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the pure, which blaſpheme God and trumpet ſedition. Our commonwealth claims to limit even the rights of conſcience. Whilſt it tolerates every denomination of religious teachers, it requires the maintenance of ſome denomination; and whilſt it extends protection to the Jew, Mahometan, and Gentoo, it inſiſts that a chriſtian people will commit the enaction and adminiſtration of their laws to none but thoſe, who profeſs to be chriſtians.</p>
            <p>IN the extenſion of like privileges to all perſons in like circumſtances, conſiſts AMERICAN EQUALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, an equality which ſecures the rich from rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no leſs than the poor from oppreſſion; the high from envy, no leſs than the low from contempt; an equality, which proclaims peace alike to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the affluent, and the humble dwellings of the poor.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:033963_0009_0FF9C07CA8410DC0"/>
OUR political fathers have taught us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the right to protection, and the right to govern the ſtate; to conſider that the ſhare which each member ſhall have in the management of public affairs, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of convention and expediency, and not an original univerſal right of man. Whilſt our Conſtitutions admit to the privilege of chooſing, and being choſen, to public office, as many claſſes of the ſociety, as conſiſts with the general ſafety, they reject that doctrine of univerſal ſuffrage, which has ſo much contributed in other countries to pull down the fabric of ſocial order. They diſqualify from the exerciſe of political rights all perſons not arrived to a certain age, and all perſons deſtitute of property; preſuming that without diſcretion, election is worſe than a lottery; and that whilſt proprietors will probably perceive a certain intereſt in order and juſtice, the extremely indigent may hope to profit by anarchy and rapine. For very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reaſons they debar the better half of ſociety from the direct exerciſe of the powers of civil government. Had the new theory of the <hi>Rights of Women</hi> enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the world at the period of the formation of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is poſſible the framers, convinced by its ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, might have ſet aſide the old ſyſtem of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, upon which the world has always proceeded till this reforming age, as ſelfiſh, illiberal, and tyrannical; perhaps they might have felt it abſurd and inſolent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033963_0010_0FF9DE0786783060"/>for man to claim the honor of being the protector and guardian of woman; and pernicious alſo, if they had acknowledged with the champion of her ſex's rights, that it is a conſequence of the preſent order to compel woman to reſort to art, inſincerity, and meanneſs, in order to ſupply, by influence the want of prerogative. To diſprove this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, however, we appeal to the ſimplicity and frankneſs of manners, and dignity of ſentiment of American females; and to teſt this ſingular theory, we may ſubmit to them the queſtion, whether they are not as free, as lovely, as reſpectable, and happy, in their preſent ſituation in ſociety, as they would be, if their ſexuality of character, and employments were done away; and law and cuſtom allowed them to exchange the diſtaff for the plough; the needle and the pencil for the axe and the hammer; and their ſtations as miſtreſſes of their families, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of their huſbands, guides and protectors of their children, and equal ſharers of domeſtic purſuits and pleaſures; to be lawyers, legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and town meeting patriots. We ſubmit to them, whether they are not content to make the beſt part of the object of all government, which is <hi>ſociety,</hi> and to leave to us the drudgery and vexation, the conteſt and danger of providing the <hi>means</hi> of ſecuring that object.</p>
            <p>

WE have learned that government, as well as liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is among the rights of the people, and that whilſt they may eſtabliſh, amend or alter their forms, all eſſential changes are to be attempted with a cautious and trembling hand. If we liſten to the inſtruction which we have received, we ſhall not think ourſelves at liberty capriciouſly to diſſolve a partnerſhip, which includes our poſterity; wantonly to break up the foundations of the ſtate, in order to build on the ruins a theoretic edifice deſtitute of the aid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, habit and attachment—nor ſhall we allow ſociety to be "treated as a <hi>carte blanche,</hi> on which every man may ſcribble what he pleaſes."</p>
            <p>THESE are <hi>our</hi> rights of man; this is <hi>our</hi> liberty; this, <hi>our</hi> equality. There is another ſort of liberty and equality, which we conſider to be ſpurious— 'tis fancys child, and folly is its father, made of ſuch ſtuff as dreams are, and baſeleſs as the fantaſtic vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the evening" and which we leave to thoſe who chooſe it—to that <hi>regenerated nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whoſe government conſiders the people as made for the government, and not the government for the people; preſerves the freedom of elections by the bayonet, and coins money by the guillotine, makes it DEATH TO EMIGRATE, AND DEATH TO STAY AT HOME. We leave it to thoſe wonderful philoſophers, who in the plenitude of their wiſdom, have no uſe for the fund accumulated by paſt ages; who have diſcovered,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033963_0012_0FF9C0814C4DE700"/>that the collective good depends on the ſacrifice of the individual good; that the end ſanctifies the means; that property is a prejudice, and preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of no validity, and we leave to them alſo, all the <hi>order, juſtice, ſecurity,</hi> and <hi>liberty,</hi> which they derive from their <hi>precious</hi> diſcoveries.</p>
            <p>PATRIOTISM, rightly defined, has never been repreſented to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a doubtful virtue, ſtill leſs as a vice. But ſince it is found an obſtacle to the ſubjugation of man by certain metaphyſical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers and tyrants, they have ſet up the cant of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal benevolence, in which it is to be loſt, as the drops in the ocean. Whoever heard before, that becauſe we muſt love our neighbour, we muſt hate ourſelves; or becauſe we muſt deſire the happineſs of the world, we muſt be indifferent to that of our country; that we muſt neglect or deſtroy the parts, in our zeal to take care of the whole? We have learned to love our country, becauſe it is our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; becauſe we are near it, and in it, and have an opportunity of being uſeful to it; becauſe we breathe its air and ſhare its bounties; becauſe the ſweat of our fathers' brows has ſubdued its ſoil; their blood watered its fields, and their revered duſt ſleeps in its boſom; becauſe it embraces our fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, our wives and children, our brothers and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; becauſe here are our altars, and here our fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; becauſe patriotiſm is the combined energy of the ſocial affections, and he who can tear it from his heart, commits ſacrilege upon his nature.</p>

REVEALED religion has the venerable ſanction of the wiſeſt and beſt of our predeceſſors, joined to its own auguſt authority. Thoſe, who hold faſt the form of ſound words which they have delivered, can ſee neither dignity nor conſolation in the ſeparation of time from eternity; of man from his creator. From whom but the fountain of wiſdom ſhall we derive the knowledge of our nature, origin and deſtiny? Does blindneſs need no guidance, perverſeneſs no correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, weakneſs, no ſtrength? Muſt no celeſtial light ſhine on the night of affliction? No immortal hope beam on the darkneſs of the grave? We are taught to believe that religion is the only ſupport of moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and revelation of religion. Unaided reaſon, unable to ſolve the difficulties of natural religion, proves the blind leader of the blind; and after al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring her followers by falſe and glimmering lights, leaves them enveloped with the darkneſs of atheiſm. Under the pavilion of religion only, can ſociety find a covert from that tempeſt of the paſſions, which is ever ready to burſt upon its head. Religion lays her hand on the movements of the heart, and directs her eye into the haunts of ſecret iniquity. She awes the inſolence of the high, and repreſſes the envy of the of the low. Deſtroy her influence, and univerſal tyranny enſues. Every man in power, knowing that others have no reſtraint from crimes but want of opportunity, will by every means keep the weak
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033963_0014_0FF9C08BB114B280"/>in a ſtate of depreſſion; and deſtroy his rivals, leſt if they gain the aſcendancy, they give his own neck to the yoke, or his head to the ſcaffold. Thus ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery man's hand is againſt every man, and ſociety is a den of wild beaſts.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the <hi>principles,</hi> which we have received from our anceſtors. They have not been wholly ineffectual to produce pure <hi>morals,</hi> ſoft and ſocial <hi>manners.</hi> Notwithſtanding the relaxation of of our ſentiments and practices from thoſe of our anceſtors, we ſtill keep ſo near to them, that it is hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable in the public opinion, to be rich without luxury and oppreſſion, to be poor without envy and diſhoneſty; to be juſt, faithful, and chaſte. We truſt there is but a ſmall minority in our country, who are ſo venal as to put up their conſciences to ſale; ſo abject, as to be the willing tools of baſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; ſo abandoned, as to become the panders of crime. We are not yet ſo diveſted of the prejudices of education, and the maxims of the nurſery, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulter of woman, the deſpoiler of innocence, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of age; the cruel or unfaithful huſband, the the undutiful or thankleſs child, can eſcape deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. With our preſent character, had we a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary tribunal, it would probably be difficult to find one father the accuſer of his ſon, one wife of her huſband, one brother of his brother. The plague of this new philoſophy, muſt reach farther
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033963_0015_0FF9C094ADF3D310"/>into our vitals, before our balls and aſſemblies ſhall exhibit dreſſes <hi>a la Grecque;</hi> the people of our towns collected into cannibal mobs, point their pikes with the hearts of their victims; or our legiſlative aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies vote marriage a tyranny, private property a prejudice and the patrimony of the nation; and turn a church into a pantheon for the deification of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins and atheiſts.</p>
            <p>To what do our fathers and we, as far as we have retained them, owe theſe principles and manners? We owe them under God to our excellent <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> To our conſtitutions of government, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially our federal conſtitution, checked and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced according to the experience of ages, adapted to the opinions character, and habits of the people, and adminiſtered with conſummate wiſdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; to our <hi>laws,</hi> which erect barriers around our rights; to <hi>public worſhip and inſtruction, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Lord's day,</hi> by which the ignorant are taught and the devious reclaimed; the ſocial ties are ſtrengthened and the worldly paſſions are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated; to family government and inſtruction, which gives a right direction to the habits of youth; to our <hi>ſchools</hi> and <hi>colleges,</hi> the fountains of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and ſubordination; to this Alma Mater, under whoſe bland influence and nurturing hand the germ of genius "expands into flowers and ripens into fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;" who ſeparating her ſons from the tumultuous
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033963_0016_0FF9C0932A8A7508"/>ſcenes of buſineſs and pleaſure, preſcribing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their ſtudies and the rules of their conduct, conducts them up the ſteep aſcent of ſcience and virtue.</p>
            <p>SUCH is a brief repreſentation of the principles, manners, and inſtitutions, which have deſcended to us from our anceſtors, and deſerve to be maintained and tranſmitted pure to our poſterity. But have they been thus maintained? Will they be thus tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? There are ſpots in thy garments, my country. There is ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love. Many of thy children have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from that ſpirit of order and religion, which marked the precepts and the example of their fathers. Let us inquire by what means we have been ſeduced from their path, and by what means we may regain and preſerve it. Our conteſt for indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by keeping our rights ſo much in view, drew our attention from our duties; and in our zeal to decorate liberty with her cap, we for a time forgot to arm law with her ſword. The interruption of the courſe of juſtice, the fluctuation of property, the paper medium and tender laws, and the foreign connexions, which ſprung out of war, were ſo many channels for the introduction of licentiouſneſs; and the proſperity which attended peace and neutrality, has been lulling to ſleep reflection and public virtue in her luxurious lap: whilſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033963_0017_0FF9DE35B6BAF4B0"/>corruption from internal ſources, we have felt the bane of foreign influence, and been "contam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated with the foul abominations of the revolution in France." With credulous fondneſs we preſſed her to our boſoms; and ſhe has bitten like a ſerpent, and ſtung like an adder. The peſtilence, which ſhe ſent forth, to walk in darkneſs, and waſte at noon day, here met conſtitutions prediſpoſed to its reception. The ſeeds of her democracy, her infidelity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, being ſown with thoſe of our own ſoil, they have been growing up together into rank luxuriance and ſpreading from field to field.</p>
            <p>THANKS to the God of our fathers, whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has led us to diſcover the tares, which the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and domeſtic enemy have ſcattered, and rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to unite, in plucking them up by their roots. We would not hear him in the whiſpers of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and he has kindly awakened us by the thunders of his judgments. Thoughtleſs and ungrateful, we neglected our government in her proſperity; but her day of trial has engaged our hearts and hands, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and ſtrength in her ſupport. We could not preſerve our connexion with our Gallic ally in her preſent ſtate, without the loſs of freedom and virtue; and that connexion is mercifully broken. Her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would have proved our infamy; and we are honored with her enmity; and are taught the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and folly of having ſuppoſed there could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033963_0018_0FF9C09C22F0C748"/>between chriſtians and atheiſts, freemen and tyrants. We have returned to ourſelves, and are Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ericans. We ſee the precipice on which we have ſtood and are eagerly ſtepping back. May the enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, in the cauſe of our altars and laws, which the exigency has kindled, become a habit of our ſouls, and live, a veſtal fire, in every American boſom.</p>
            <p>RESISTANCE is begun on the ſea. Events may demand it on our ſhores. In a cauſe like ours, what chriſtian or patriot, will not dare to combat and to periſh? Should the fortune of war allot him the cypreſs for the laurel, it will quicken the laſt beat of his heart, to reflect that he dies to ſave his country. And ſhould ſhe not be ſaved, but the inexplicable ſcheme of Providence ſuffer her to ſink under the overwhelming ruin let looſe upon the world, we may be aſſured that before ſuch an event, all her beſt blood will be ſhed; that exiſtence here to a true American will be worſe than ten thouſand deaths, and to have been an early victim in her cauſe will be a favored lot.</p>
            <p>WHILST we unite in the defence of our country, let us unite in rendering and preſerving her worthy to be defended. To this end let the pure principles, the virtuous manners, and the uſeful inſtitutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited from our anceſtors, be retained and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Be not carried about by every wind of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal doctrine; but inflexibly adhere to the maxims
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033963_0019_0FF9C0ADF7182040"/>and forms of government which you have received; and cling to their adminiſtration with the graſp of death. Maintain order and inſtruction in your families; and provide liberally for the means of education. If you wiſh to keep alive religion in yourſelves or others, ſuffer not your ſundays to be perverted to amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your bibles to be the lumber of your ſhelves, or your churches to be neglected. Let your literary ſons aim as well to be good as great; leſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge multiply the objects of deſire, whilſt it leaves them deſtitute of principle to direct their choice and purſuit of thoſe objects; and ſuperior talents be only qualifications for more extenſive miſchief. Let thoſe, who become members of this ancient ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inary, be juſt to its eminent advantages, draw a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful veil over imperfections more or leſs inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from every human inſtitution; and never permit that ſpirit of miſrule, which ſcourges the world and menaces the ſtate, to diſturb and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor this choſen retreat. Let your ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be ſenſible that virtue, and not wealth, fame pleaſure, beauty, or accompliſhments is their chief good. Our fair countrywomen, eſpecially are invited to recollect the indiſputable truth, that the ſpirit of chriſtianity has contributed more than any thing to give them the reſpectable and deſerved rank, which they now hold in ſociety in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America.</hi>—This ſpirit, by making the marriage contract indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033963_0020_0FF9C0A2009BEA10"/>and repreſenting woman as endowed with the ſame intellectual and moral nature as man, has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced his reſpect; and raiſed her from being the drudge of his indolence, or the inſtrument of his pleaſure, to be his companion, his equal, his counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and his friend. Far from our youth be thoſe abſurd and unnatural manners, which the innovat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit of the times has made faſhionable, which diſregard the gradations and diſtinctions of nature and ſociety; and placing the young on a level with the old, the child with the parent, and the pupil with the inſtructer, annul the claim of age to reſpect, and of authority to ſubmiſſion.</p>
            <p>THE poiſon of the ſkeptical and diſorganizing philoſophy, which is now perverting and corrupting man, has been adminiſtered in writings, many of which want no confidence of aſſertion to overawe, no ſubtilty of argument to perplex, no ſprightlineſs of wit to amuſe, and no charms of eloquence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. But whilſt to indulge curioſity, to taſte the beauties of compoſition, or to gratify the vanity of general reading we peruſe them; it is at the hazard of being entangled in their ſophiſtry, and depraved by their immoral ſentiments. It is proper advice to all, at leaſt to ſuch, whoſe minds are immature, and whoſe habits are unformed; look not into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious pages. Tread not on the bed of flowers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which a ſerpent lurks. "What! forbid free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry?"

               </gap> and plunge him into the ſea of doubt and deſpair. Will the wiſe man, who counts the coſt, leave ſafety in the camp, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack he enemy with unequal force in the field? Will the traveller, who wiſhe, to ſecure an agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble journey, forſake the beaten road at the peril of being entangled in inextricable wilds? Believe not that diſcoveries are to be made in morality; or that any way will be found of exiſting happily in this world, or in the next, but that which the Lord our God hath illuminated with the brightneſs of a ſunbeam, "Do juſtly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God." Theſe men cant about univerſal benevolence, ſenſibility, and morality. Diſintereſted benevolence! which teaches, that the vileſt means are conſecrated by a benevolent end, and that it is noble to deſtroy the parts to ſerve the whole. Sweet ſenſibility! which feels for every thing except that which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches it; for all mankind, except thoſe with whom it is in contact, and to whom it may be uſeful; which weeps over the injuſtice of governments, and ſends its children to the hoſpital. Rigid morality! which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>WHATEVER faſcination there might be to ſome fanatical or corrupt minds, in the principles of the nation, which theſe philoſophers have put into their crucible, one would think there could be none to any in their conduct. For any to approve or juſtify, muſt be to reſemble it. But the moſt virtuous need to guard againſt the effect of familiarity with ſuch enormous vice in blunting the moral ſenſibility. So peſtilential is its nature, that to look at it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, to look at it with the leaſt indulgence is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to embrace it is death.</p>
            <p>AMERICANS, whilſt you ſtudy improvement, ſhrink from innovation. Difficult enough is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of order with all the aid, which it derives from antiquity, authority, opinion, and habit. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that confidence not jealouſy is the firſt of republican virtues; that to ſettle, not change our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſyſtems is the buſineſs of our time, and that the ſpirit of complaint and oppoſition ſhould be reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the medicine of the Conſtitution, when it ſhall grow old and diſeaſed, and not adminiſtered as its daily food, while it is in the bloom of youth and of health. Such empiriciſm, will ſoon make it as
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033963_0023_0FF9DE5128B72438"/>diſordered as its enemies pretend: and drug it into a malady, which has no cure, but death.</p>
            <p>IF, as men, as members of ſociety, and chriſtians, we will be thus inſtructed, we ſhall obtain, for our country all the happineſs, which a nation can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs in this ſtate of mingled good and evil, and for ourſelves the unfailing conſolation of an approving mind, and a truſt in God in this world; and beyond the line of time, a reward, vaſt as our deſires, and laſting as our exiſtence.</p>
