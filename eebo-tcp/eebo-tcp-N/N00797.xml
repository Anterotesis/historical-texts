            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH is the fulneſs of Sufficiency in Chriſt, that no words can enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it: for which reaſon the Holy Scriptures ſet him forth under the ſhadow of many <hi>Metaphors,</hi> which require a Spiritual improvement; all of which put together make up but a dark &amp; deficient deſcription of him: and yet every one of them Commends him to us as an Object worthy of our Love &amp; Truſt, inaſmuch as they repreſent him one every way furniſhed to anſwer all our wants, which can no where elſe be ſupplied; and, but for whom we muſt needs have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in them. The following Sermons ſet him forth as a <hi>Fountain,</hi> and ſuch an one as is <hi>Opened</hi> to miſerable men, together with thoſe Vertues which do more eminently flow from him as ſuch, for the abundant ſupply of all thoſe that partake in him: and withall it gives us the comfortable notice of a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar &amp; glorious <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, to be made in theſe laſt days.

If thou hast known, what it is to be in a dry and thirsty land, where no Water is, this will be good News to thee. If thou hungreſt and thirſtest after Righteouſneſs, this will give thee direction.

               <hi>ZEchariah</hi> was one of thoſe Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prophets whom God raiſed up and ſent to the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their return from <hi>Babylon.</hi> He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Haggai,</hi> and began his Miniſtry about two months later, in the Reign of that <hi>Darius</hi> who encouraged and ſet forward the building of the <hi>Temple;</hi> to the purſuit of which affair, theſe two Prophets did joyntly ſtir up and animate the People of God. Who this <hi>Zechariah</hi> was, and to what Tribe and Family he belonged, we are at a loſs, his Genealogy being only reckoned up to his

Grandfather, of whoſe Stock there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made elſewhere in the Old Teſtament: only this I ſuppoſe is beyond juſt diſpute, that he is the ſame whom theſe Jews did barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murder, for his faithful reproofs given them, and denouncing of Gods Righteous Threatnings againſt them for their ſins; which added to their guilt, and is articled againſt their Poſterity by Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.35. This Book is partly <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> partly <hi>Viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> In the Viſional part of it he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all the Changes or Revolutions which were to paſs over the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> till, for their ſins, and more particularly, for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of Chriſt, and the Salvation by him offered to them, they ſhould be <hi>laid deſolate</hi>; and ſo abide, till ſuch time as God ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain graciouſly call them: and there are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven the Predictions of the Judgments of God on other Nations, ſo far as they concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his dealings with this people. Divers of theſe <hi>Viſions</hi> are exceeding myſterious, and the harder to be underſtood by us, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the depth of the <hi>Allegories</hi> uſed, and the intermixing of things fore ſignified by way of anticipation; but alſo becauſe they are not as yet accompliſhed: And here we are more eſpecially to obſerve thoſe Propheſies which point to the Calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Chriſt, and the Spiritual Glory of that time, which is more than once hinted at in this

Book: as alſo the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the wonderful enlarging of the Grace of God to other Nations. To make the way clear to the words of our <hi>Text,</hi> let us obſerve, that at the beginning of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. Our Prophet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts an happy and glorious Eſtate which God will in due time reſtore <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto, and he indigita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To what day, or article of time this Propheſie particularly points, is matter of debate, as alſo whether the <hi>Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and literal <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> be at all aimed at in it.

In the clearing up of this Doctrine, three things may be inquired into, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The word, <hi>fountain,</hi> may be conſidered in a double ſenſe; either only as a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> alluding to the repoſitory in which waters are contained, and from which they iſſue; or elſe with the addition of a <hi>Metonymie,</hi> with reſpect unto the waters that are contained in it; and both theſe are applicable to the <hi>Text</hi>: The former of theſe belongs to this enquiry, and the latter to the next. As then a fountain is a repoſitory which God hath, in the work of Creation, provided for the treaſuring up of waters in, ſo is Chriſt a Store-houſe of all Grace, in whom it is laid up. And there are ſeveral reſpects in which he is thus compared to a fountain, and hath this Title put upon him; more eſpecially,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A fountain is ſo called from the Plenty of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are in it.</hi> There is a great fulneſs in a Fountain. Ciſterns have but a little in them;

ſmall Springs, that are but little veins in the earth, do vent but a little water, becauſe they have not much in them; but a fountain hath abundance in it, it is a vaſt treaſury; there is no want in a fountain, but there may come as many as will to it, and have a full ſupply of water from it; and ſuch a fountain of Grace is Jeſus Chriſt to his people; for this reaſon is he ſaid to <hi>be full of Grace and Truth, Joh.</hi> 1.14. And all the people of God are ſaid to receive out of <hi>his Fulneſs,</hi> verſe 16. and becauſe of this abounding ſufficiency of his, thoſe that fear him are ſaid <hi>to have no want of any good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. <hi>A fountain is ſo called from the Quality of the waters in it.</hi> The waters of a fountain are very much different from thoſe that are in a pool or ciſtern; and there are two titles that are put upon them in this regard.</p>

Accordingly we have the Spirit of God, in alluſion to this, deſcribing the fountain of Grace which God hath provided for his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. <hi>He ſhewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as cryſtal.</hi> Such is Chriſt, and ſuch are all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; they are holy, and there is no defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in them.</p>

Hence we ſo often read of <hi>running waters</hi> in the Scriptures. Such alſo is Chriſt in reſpect of his Grace.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We obſerved, that a fountain is properly a receptacle of waters, and therefore is Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymically put for the waters themſelves that are in it; and we may here keep to the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Water is one of thoſe things that are neceſſary for the life of man, and afford a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold benefit unto it; it quencheth the thirſt, it revives the ſpirits, it comforts the man, it cools and refreſheth the body, it is of uſe alſo for cleanſing or purifying both the body, and ſuch things as are for its uſe and comfort: and indeed ſuch is the uſefulneſs of this Element, that the want of it makes the man miſerable, and if he be not ſupplied with it, he will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably periſh. It is therefore reckoned for a ſingular advantage and happineſs to dwell near a fountain of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Iſa</hi> 33.16 <hi>His waters ſhall be ſure</hi>; and Chap. 32.20. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that ſow beſide all waters.</hi> Now that which is here alluded to in this compariſon is whatſoever benefit derives from Chriſt to the Souls of men, for the helping them to obtain

Eternal Life. Theſe waters comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, <hi>Grace, and Glory, and every good thing, Pſal.</hi> 84.11. peculiarly the Graces of his Spirit are here pointed to, and therefore we have ſuch an expreſſion in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we have all received, and grace for grace.</hi> The benefit of which is excellent, and manifold: without it we muſt needs periſh; from and by it derives to us all that is neceſſary or deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is pardon of Sin, peace with God, Sonſhip, Sanctification, and Conſolation: the moſt comprehenſive of which will be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly conſidered of under a following Doctrine. But it is certain that all theſe are laid up in Chriſt, and flow from him to his People, as waters do out of a fountain; and are no where elſe to be had.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How he came to be ſuch a fountain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This flows from his Mediator-ſhip, and may be traced in theſe four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mans Apoſtaſy had cut him off from God as the fountain of life to him.</hi> All mans happineſs is fountained in God, and muſt derive from him by way of participation. He was at firſt, in his ſtate of Integrity, planted by this fountain, had free acceſs to it, and could refreſh himſelf at all times with it; the ſtreams of it ran down freely on him: but when he ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, that made a woful ſeparation, ſo God tells them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your ſins have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between you and your God</hi>; and ſince then,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000960_0017_0FADE40D4B4D3FE0"/>
that is a proper title of ſinful men in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, <hi>Pſal</hi> 73 27. <hi>They that are far from thee.</hi> God is no longer his portion; of a friend he is become his enemy; all thoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes which when for him, would have filled him with ſatisfaction, are now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt him, and become a terror to him, being ready to deſtroy him: and if this be not retrieved he cannot eſcape perdition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gods free Grace conſtituted Chriſt in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediator, that he might procure life and happineſs again for man.</hi> Sin had brought man under the Guilt of Death, binding him over to ſuffer eternal vengeance. Gods Juſtice was now engaged to execute an holy revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for the affront which he had offered to his Law. This Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied; man can no more approach to God but by a Mediator, for without one, <hi>God is a conſuming fire.</hi> God graciouſly reſolves to bring ſome of that unhappy race back again to himſelf, and be a fountain of life unto them, and herein to manifeſt his rich Grace; for this end he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his own Son to become man, and in our nature to bring about an Atonement, by reconciling God and man one to another and procuring a Redemption for us; for this he put Chriſt into his Office, and indented with him in the Days of Eternity: <hi>the counſel of peace</hi> is therefore ſaid to be <hi>between them both, Zech.</hi> 6.13.</p>

               <p>OUR Prophet is ſpeaking of, and predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about Goſpel times, and tells us, that <hi>in that day there ſhall be a fountain Opened.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former Doctrine we had Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us as a fountain of ſaving good, whoſe fulneſs of all Grace and Goodneſs may invite the poor and needy Soul to repair to him, to have all its wants ſupplied: In this we have a farther commendation given him by the <hi>Epithet</hi> added, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is a Fountain Opened, which mightily adds to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of indigent ones to come to him. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former <hi>Metaphor</hi> he was exhibited as an <hi>All ſufficient</hi> Saviour, and by this he is ſet forth as a free, ready and <hi>willing</hi> Saviour; that ſhews what he is in himſelf; this tells us what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000960_0026_0FADE4172BD9F7A8"/>
he is willing to be to us, if we would ſo make uſe of him.</p>
               <p>In purſuit of this Doctrine we may enquire,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What is included in the opening of this Fountain?</p>
               <p n="2">2. How it comes to be thus opened?</p>

Who ſhould tell man that God had ſo much good will for him, as to provide Salvation for him by a Redeemer, when he had deſtroyed himſelf by ſin? God only knew his own thoughts, and none could have gues'd at them by any rational arguings, if he had not told them.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000960_0032_0FADE41B79E35DD0"/>
and helpleſsneſs in himſelf, or in the whole Creation, there had been no occaſion for it. Hence we have Chriſt himſelf decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the deſign of his coming in our nature, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9 13. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance</hi>; and our Prophet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us what the Blood of the Covenant was for, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>By the Blood of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the pit, where there is no water</hi>; and that <hi>blood</hi> was no other than what our Text and Doctrine call a <hi>fountain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Sinners may obtain Salvation by it; they muſt partake in it.</hi> There muſt not only be a remedy ſuitable and ſufficient provided, but there muſt be an application made of it, if ever the Creatures miſery be removed by it. Let there be never ſo full a fountain, never ſo much plenty of living waters, yet if the man do not drink of them, his thirſty Soul will not be ſatisfied therewith, but he muſt periſh for all. It is not enough that there is a Chriſt who is able to give eternal life, who is able to ſave to the uttermoſt, but we muſt have him if we live by him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life</hi>: Except the man drink of theſe waters they will never profit him; what elſe is the reaſon why ſo many periſh, tho there be enough in Chriſt to ſave the whole world? Chriſt himſelf hath told us a reaſon

of it in regard of ſuch as live under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>viz. they will not come to him that they may have life, Joh.</hi> 5.40. For it is by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it, that the vertue of Chriſt's Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on becomes ours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It is by being united to Chriſt by faith that they come to partake in him.</hi> Union with Chriſt is the foundation of Communion with him, and faith is the bond of that Union on our part: he muſt dwell in us, in order to his communicating of his ſaving benefits to us, and how that is we are told, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle propounds that ſolemn caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Know you not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you, except ye are reprobates?</hi> It is by faith that we receive Chriſt; unbelief ſhuts him out, and ſo hinders us of all ſaving good by him; if we believe not in him, we ſhall never receive the waters of life from him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That they may thus believe in him, they muſt have him Opened to them.</hi> Faith is the act of a reaſonable creature, and ſo it muſt have a ground for it, <hi>Paul</hi> can ſay. <hi>I know whom I have truſted,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.12 Hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He muſt be opened by</hi> Revelation. There muſt be a diſcovery made of him to and in the Soul, by which it may be certified of his fulneſs and ſuitableneſs; that he is able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Souls wants, and to ſupply its needs, to fill its cravings, and remedy its miſeries:

                  </gap>nts, <hi>of the womans ſeed breaking the head of the Serpent, Gen.</hi> 3.15. And here we may obſerve three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is clear from the Word of God, that this fountain was opened to man, before Christ came in our Fleſh.</hi> There was a way of Salvation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto man, preſently after he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done himſelf by ſin; and there were a great many ſaved by the vertue of this fountain in the times of the Law: there were then holy men, who were the <hi>Friends of God, men after his own heart,</hi> men that <hi>truſted in him, and waited for his Salvation.</hi> There were Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Predictions about Chriſt from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and thoſe that then believed on him as their <hi>Redeemer, they ſaw his day and were glad,</hi> they prayed in his name, they had an eye to him in all the Types and Figures which were of him: for that was a truth from the beginning, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a peculiar opening of it after ſuch time as Chriſt had wrought out the work ef Redemption for us.</hi> The word of God is wont to make mention of things as if they were
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000960_0037_0FADE41FCE30C830"/>
new, when there is a new manner of the Diſpenſation of them, or when there are very eminent degrees of the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them unto men: Now, with reſpect to the opening of this fountain, it was thus after Chriſt had finiſhed the great affair of ſatisfying the Juſtice of God for us, and went to his glory; and that in two regards;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect to the Clearneſs of the diſcovery.</hi> Thoſe manifeſtations which were made of Chriſt under the Law, were very obſcure; almoſt all that was there ſpoken about him, was under <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Every thing then had a vail upon it, and few were able to ſee through it; and ſo they were exceeding ready to tarry at and take up with the ſhadows inſtead of the ſubſtance; and by that Law, which was given to be a <hi>School-maſter</hi> to lead them <hi>to Chriſt,</hi> to fortify themſelves againſt him and his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteouſneſs, and going about to establiſh their own Righteouſneſs, they have not ſubmitted to the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> So that this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was then in a great meaſure covered, but now it is diſcovered gloriouſly, and every thing concerning Chriſt and Salvation by him is ſpoken plainly; 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.18 <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect to the Extent of the offer that is
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000960_0038_0FADE422D02AEE68"/>
made of it.</hi> Before the Goſpel times, Chriſt was in ſome reſpects a <hi>fountain ſhut up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; he was opened only to the Nation of the Jews, and ſuch as were Proſelyted to them; and that alſo obſcurely: the <hi>Law of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> was a <hi>partition wall</hi> between the Jews and other people, ſo that this was their peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and prerogative; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>To them were committed the Oracles of God; Chap.</hi> 9.4.5. <hi>Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, &amp; the Glory, &amp; the Covenants, &amp; the giving of the Law,</hi> &amp;c. And hence we have that of Chriſt himſelf, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> Hence the Goſpel was to be <hi>firſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them,</hi> and on their rejecting it, to be <hi>carried to the Gentiles. Acts</hi> 13.46. But now the partition wall is pulled down, the Law of Ordinances is removed, and there is a way opened for others to come to him, and have peace in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>He is our peace, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he was to aſcend to Heaven, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned his Apoſtles <hi>to go into all the world, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, Mark</hi> 16.15.

The Apoſtaſy had brought us all into a wilderneſs, <hi>a dry and thirſty land wherein there was no water:</hi> and had not this fountain been broken up to us, we muſt needs have periſhed. Had we lived in the days of the Law? if we had then been of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it had been a great priviledge, and a ſingular favour: however, they were dark

times then compared with ours; but if we had been born of and among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we had been ſhut out from that Garden in which this fountain was made to ſpring up. It is propheſied concerning the Gentiles, with what reſentments they ſhall receive the Goſpel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.19. <hi>The Gentiles ſhall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and ſhall ſay, ſurely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit</hi>: How far then is our condition better than theirs was? let us then be thankful to God, that the <hi>Wells of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> are opened to us, and we may <hi>draw waters out of them</hi>; that Chriſt is preached and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, and we are invited to come to him to have our thirſty Souls ſatisfied; that theſe rivers run before our doors: this is not the priviledge of all the world at this day. Think then how highly we are favoured hereby, and let God have the whole glory of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This tells us how juſtly and inexcuſably they will periſh, who come not to this fountain.</hi> It is certain that all men in their natural ſtate, are in a periſhing condition, being cut off from the fountain of living waters; there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of it again, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a remedy, but hath alſo opened it in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, wooed men with all earneſtneſs to come to, and accept of it, uſed all eadeavours with them to perſwade them to embrace it; and yet they refuſe to hearken to his calls, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his offers, put him away from them, when he comes to them, will not leave their <hi>broken ciſterns</hi> for this <hi>fountain of living waters</hi>; there remains no more hope for theſe, becauſe there is never another fountain at which their Souls can find refreſhment: they deſpiſe Chriſt, forſake him, will none of him, and this makes their perdition inevitable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.13. <hi>They that depart from me ſhall be written in the earth, becauſe they have forſaken the Lord, the foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>USE II. Let it be to encourage thirſty Souls to come unto Chriſt for all they want.</hi> God is wont, in order to his revealing of Chriſt to, and in Sinners, to awaken in them a deep ſenſe of their miſery, and to bring them into ſore diſtreſs: they are made to feel themſelves periſhing in themſelves, and thereupon their craving Souls are inquiſitive whether there be no help to be had for them. Are you then brought into ſuch a ſtrait as this is, let the following advice be acceptable to you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let your felt want put you upon asking after him.</hi> Before you were under the impreſſion

of theſe Convictions, you ſaw no need that you had of him, and that made you to be ſo far from ſeeking after him, that when he came and offered himſelf to you, and bad you to accept of him, you put him away from you, and bad him be gone, made it evident that you had no deſire of him; but now let your enquiry be how you may come at him. Your Wells in which you before put your truſt, are now ſenſibly dried up, and afford you no ſupply at all, ask then after this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Let this be your ſupport under your preſent diſtreſs, that you have heard of ſuch an one, and now make it your buſineſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how you may be made to partake in it, how you may get a full draught of theſe <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Let this fulneſs of ſufficiency be your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go to him and no where elſe.</hi> Every one that would partake in this benefit, and not fail of this Grace of God, muſt reſolve to forſake all the ſtreams which before they took up withal, for the ſake of the fountain; and the prime motive to this, is the apprehenſion they have of the emptineſs of every thing elſe, and his infinite fulneſs. Receive then the witneſs that is born of him in his word, and ſee how worthy he is of your truſt, <hi>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, Eph.</hi> 3.20. Say, I have tried other objects, and they have failed me, but I
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000960_0043_0FADE42752518F58"/>
have heard that there is enough for me in him; I will therefore go to him, and him only for ſupply.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Let his being opened be your encouragement to prevail with you to come to him, and believe on him.</hi> And indeed, here is that which next<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly animates poor thirſty Souls to come to him. It is true, if he were not a fountain of Grace, he could not anſwer our neceſſity, and make us happy; our cravings can be filled with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is leſs; but ſtill, if this fountain were ſhut up and ſealed, and there were no way diſcoverable by which we might come at it, the other conſideration would afford a poor ſupport to our hope. Goodneſs indeed is the object of our <hi>deſire,</hi> but it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municableneſs of this goodneſs which nextly excites our <hi>hope,</hi> and that is it which muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us forth vigorouſly in queſt of it: and the more fully this way of participation is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to us, and the more freely it is offered in the exhibition of it, the greater muſt the encouragement needs be. Here therefore is the great demur that ſenſible Souls are wont to make, <hi>viz.</hi> Is there any way for me to be made a partaker in all this good whereof there is ſuch an abundance in the fountain?</p>

none but Chriſt.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is certain that this fountain is not in any ſenſe opened to all the world.</hi> There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold opening of it, which might have been obſerved, <hi>viz</hi> there is that which is <hi>outward,</hi> by the promulgation of the Goſpel, and that which is <hi>inward,</hi> made by the Illumination of the Spirit.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:000960_0050_0FADE42EF6719770"/>
latter. And here it muſt be granted, that Chriſt is not opened unto any, but ſuch to whom there is ſome ſignification made, by which they may be informed concerning him, ſo as to diſcover him to be a fountain of life; and this muſt be either by Immediate Revelation, or by the diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto them: The former is not ordinary, and therefore, whatſoever God will do on prerogative, yet he hath given us no other ground to expect it but in the latter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> But it is notorious that a great part of the World are altogether ignorant of this fountain, and there is none ſent to ſhew it to them, and ſo muſt remain ſtrangers to it. For men to think that the light of nature can diſcover, or that the Sun, Moon and Stars can preach a Chriſt to fallen man, is a vain and groundleſs opinion; the Apoſtle is poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That this fountain is opened in the outward diſcoveries and offers of it, to thoſe that are not of the Seed of Chriſt, or of his mystical Body.</hi> Chriſt hath a viſible, as well as a ſpiritual ſeed: <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as are only ſo in outward appearance; there is a <hi>Jew</hi> that is ſo <hi>outwardly,</hi> and one who is ſo <hi>inwardly.</hi> Now it is the viſible Church of Chriſt which is the ſubject of the outward Diſpenſations of the Goſpel, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions

of Chriſt therein. Chriſt is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as well to Reprobates as to Elect; the Goſpel is afforded, and the Grace of it offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well to thoſe in whom it is a <hi>Savour of death,</hi> as to thoſe to whom it becomes a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of life,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15, 16.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>This notwithſtanding the direct aim, and great deſign of opening this fountain, is for the ſake of thoſe that are given to Chriſt.</hi> This is a great truth, though the carnal minds of natural men are prejudiced at it, and engage in ſo many earneſt cavils againſt it; and it becomes <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence</hi> to them, yet it is fully aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1 <hi>That there is a ſelect number of</hi> Adams <hi>ruined Poſterity, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od hath appointed to bring to eternl life by Chriſt.</hi> We muſt begin here, if we would follow this grace down from the fountain of it. Gods laſt end in this great affair was the exaltation of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his <hi>Grace</hi>; but in the ordering of the <hi>Media</hi> by which this was to be brought about,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000960_0052_0FADE43071B5BD10"/>
there muſt be a ſubject in whom it is to be exalted; and that can be no other than a Creature that needed it. This neceſſity man brought upon himſelf by his undoing Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, out of the ruines whereof God would pick up ſuch as ſhould be made the monuments of it: and theſe were not intended to be all, but only ſome, who are called his <hi>Choſen,</hi> thoſe <hi>whom he hath given to Chriſt,</hi> thoſe <hi>whoſe names are written in the Book of Life,</hi> and other like diſtinguiſhing notes, differencing them from the reſt of mankind: nor could this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be only general and conditional, for then it were improper to ſay, that their <hi>names</hi> were <hi>written,</hi> or that <hi>God knows who they are,</hi> but we are aſſured that he doth, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence it was for their ſakes that Chriſt was prepared and appointed to be a fountain of life to them.</hi> All mankind died in the firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin came into the world, and death by ſin; ſo that death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned:</hi> There muſt therefore a Well of Salvation be opened for the man, if ever he be reſtored to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Son of God, barely conſidered as a Divine perſon, could not be ſo to Fallen man, as the caſe ſtands between God and him. He was capable of being made ſo, but there was a great deal to be done in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair to bring it about; he muſt become a Surety for us; he muſt, as ſuch, take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:000960_0053_0FADE431F39DE5D0"/>
upon him, and in it put himſelf in our room, under the Law, and comport with the Sanctions of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accordingly he muſt do and dy for us, and therein fulfil all righteouſneſs; and in that way he became <hi>able to ſave us to the uttermoſt:</hi> God is therefore ſaid to have made him all this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Who of God is made to us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Redemption.</hi> Now that which was deſigned in this was our Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had a peculiar reſpect to thoſe whom he was to ſave; Chriſt therefore declares the very deſign of this, <hi>Joh</hi> 17.19 <hi>For their ſakes do I Sanctifie my ſelf</hi>; and it is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unqueſtionable, that if it had not been for this, the Son of God had never taken this province upon him, and gone through it, as may be gathered from, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>That the Goſpel, in which this fountain is opened, was appointed to be the way of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the vertue of it unto theſe.</hi> It is not enough that there was a fulneſs of all Grace ſtored in Chriſt, but there muſt be a derivation of the ſaving vertue of it, to all thoſe that live by it. Now, though the ſpirit of God, to whom the Application of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s he who derives it to us from Chriſt, yet he hath a way in which he ſo doth; and we are given to underſtand that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000960_0054_0FADE4328FD38F38"/>
this is by the Goſpel: and therefore the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it is Metonymically aſſigned to the Goſpel, which is called <hi>the power of God to Salvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it is to become ours, ſo God deals with us in bringing us to this faith, according to our nature, as Reaſonable Creatures, by ſhewing us our object, and the fulneſs and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of it; by diſcovering the terms of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on which we may come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in it; by ſetting before us all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to move us to entertain it; all of which are diſcovered to us in and by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; for we are told, 2 <hi>Tim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1.10. <hi>Life and Immortality are brought to light by the Goſpel.</hi> When therefore God intends men Salvation, in the ordinary diſpenſation of himſelf to them, he makes uſe of the Goſpel as a <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> by which he will apply himſelf to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Thoſe to whom it is thus to be diſpenſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> live mixt among other men.</hi> It is Gods good pleaſure, that his Choſen ſhall be ſcattered up and down in the World, and have their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among thoſe that are his Enemies; he therefore calls them <hi>from the Lions dens, and from the mountains of the Leopards, Cant.</hi> 4.8. There are indeed ſome places in the world that are wholly in darkneſs, and we know not of any of thoſe that are given to Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; but in other places they dwell one with another; in ſome places there are

more, in others there are fewer of theſe, but there are no places where Chriſt hath a Seed, but there are wicked men dwelling with the Godly. The Apoſtle therefore tells us, that <hi>we muſt go out of the world,</hi> if we would be <hi>wholly ſeparated</hi> from ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Covenant of Works, and the Sanctions of it.</hi> That there was ſuch a Covenant plighted with man, the Word of God gives us ſufficient intimations of: and as it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that man ſhould be a cauſe by Counſel of his own actions, or elſe he could not have,

Now in this Covenant there are conſiderable the <hi>Sanctions</hi> of it, but for which man could not have been happy or miſerable according to it, and his carriage of himſelf towards it. God therefore, beſides a Rule which he gave to man directing him how he might ſerve him aright, annexed a promiſe of life in caſe of Obedience full and perfect, and threatned him with death if he ſhould tranſgreſs the precept; which is intimated in that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhall ſurely dy</hi>; and thus man, under the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſtood a probationer for life or death according as he ſhould behave himſelf.</p>

unto eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And that God had a reſpect unto this in appointing Chriſt to be a Redeemer and Saviour, is not to be doubted, inaſmuch as this was the very thing from which he was to redeem and ſave us: this therefore is ſaid to commend that Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us.</hi> God therefore muſt needs have a foreſight of this Apoſtaſy, becauſe the aſſignation of Chriſt to his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial Offices had a reſpect to it; and that man had not fallen but by Divine Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is certain: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>What is the Uſefulneſs of this Fountain for ſuch an end?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> There are two things to be conſidered in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as a Fountain, or a Treaſury in whom they are laid up, which do ſuitably and ſufficiently Anſwer theſe two oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Sinful men, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Merit,</hi> and his <hi>Grace:</hi> I ſhall give ſome general glances at each of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There is an Infinite</hi> Merit <hi>fountained in Chriſt, for the taking away the Guilt of Sin, &amp; the Juſtification of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Sinner.</hi> We obſerved that this Guilt is an obligation lying upon the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by reaſon of the threatning, to ſuffer the penalty menaced by the Law. The Removal of this Guilt, with reſpect to the Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, can be only by a free pardon; for he hath nothing of his own to make compenſation to the Law withal: But the removal of it with reference to the Covenant of works, and the Eſtabliſhed Rule of Relative Juſtice in it, muſt be by Juſtification. God, as a Judge, muſt either Juſtify or Condemn him, upon his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000960_0085_0FADE6126E1ECB10"/>
Trial: and yet, in Juſtifying him, he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pardon him. Theſe two are inconſiſtent in the procedure of humane Judges, but they are inſeparable in Gods proceſs upon believers. It is called <hi>Juſtifying the Ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. But the ungodlineſs muſt be forgiven to the perſon freely, and ſo Juſtification is an act of Grace, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.24. <hi>Being Juſtified freely by his Grace.</hi> And yet it muſt be upon a Satisfaction and Merit, elſe the Law cannot be anſwered in it, nor the Juſtice of God conſiſt with his Grace, and it muſt ſo do; <hi>Verſe</hi> 26. <hi>That God may be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> In this Juſtification there are two things, <hi>viz. the pardon of ſin, and the declaring the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon righteous</hi>; for which there muſt be found the Law anſwered in both parties; the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be ſatisfied for, which is to be done by a bearing of the whole penalty denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the Sinner for ſin; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the promiſe of life muſt be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, which is by perfect Obedience to the whole Law. That this may be done for the Sinner by a Surety, the Goſpel aſſureth us; and that Chriſt was a Surety on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we are there informed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was made a Surety of a better Covenant.</hi> And this is alſo implied in that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin; that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him.</hi> And thoſe ſeveral expreſſions
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000960_0086_0FADE613975EC5D8"/>
amount to as much, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5, 6. <hi>He hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows; he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, &amp;c.</hi> Now Chriſt, by the Redemption that he wrought out, laid in an infinite treaſure of Righteouſneſs for this end, and on this account it is called, <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God,</hi> Phil. 3 9. Rom. 3.21. And <hi>Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, Dan.</hi> 9 24. the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and merit of it is ſufficient to expiate the guilt of all ſins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi> There is a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean of vertue in him, ſo that <hi>he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come to him,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There is an incomprehenſible fulneſs of Grace in Chriſt, which he is able to communicate to us for our Sanctification.</hi> Not only had he in him an unmeaſurable fulneſs of Grace; and hence he is ſaid to be <hi>full of Grace, Joh</hi> 1.14. to have an univerſal fulneſs in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fullneſs dwell.</hi> Not only to have <hi>Grace poured forth on his lips, Pſal.</hi> 45.2. but to be <hi>anointed with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows,</hi> ver. 7. Yea we are told, that <hi>God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure to him, Joh.</hi> 3.34 But he received it as a Fountain or Store houſe, that he might communicate it; hence that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we all receive, and grace for Grace.</hi> For this reaſon he is ſaid to be <hi>made Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to us,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. There is no Grace
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:000960_0087_0FADE61420AB1920"/>
that we can want, but there is enough of it with him to beſtow upon us, and furniſh us therewith for New-Obedience, that we may be ſo enabled to glorifie God in our lives: Nor is there any duty that he calls us to, ſo hard but that he can ſupply us with abundant ability to diſcharge it, and carry us through it to his glory. <hi>Paul</hi> could be confident of this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt ſtrengthening of me.</hi> It is the work of his Spirit to convey this Grace from him to us, <hi>Joh</hi> 16.14. <hi>He ſhall receive of mine, and ſhew it unto you.</hi> And he who is priviledged with this indwelling Spirit, needs not be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at any thing which God lays in his way as duty, but may confide in this, that Chriſt can and will be with him, and carry him through victoriouſly, over all that would obſtruct him in it: and this is the ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he bids his people, though weak in themſelves, not to be afraid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Fear not thou worm Jacob, and the men of Iſrael, I will help thee ſaith the Lord, and thy Redeemer.</hi> His Grace hath a cleanſing vertue in it; and though we are at preſent Sanctified but in part, yet this is not through any defect in his vertue, but becauſe he will carry the work on in his, gradually, for holy ends, and that he may learn them the experience of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will give us the experience of the fulneſs of it, when he ſhall have purged away all our iniquities, and made us entire and ſpotleſs, which we are aſſured is the deſign to which his Redemption leads, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 25, 26, 27. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That where this fountain is ſavingly applied, it ſhall take away the ſin and uncleanneſs of the people of God.</hi> This ſhall be the certain and unfailing operation of it. If ever the vertue of Chriſt's Redemption be communicated to any of the Children of men, it ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have this operation upon them; it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable quality of the fountain. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be laid open in the following Concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the great errand on which Chriſt was ſent into the world, was to take away the ſins of his people.</hi> We have before obſerved that it was our ſin that gave the occaſion for the opening of this fountain, and why did Chriſt take an occaſion from thence to appear in the ſtate of a Redeemer, but that he might remove it? <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſin of the world. Mat</hi> 1.21. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> It was not to reconcile God to ſin, but to reconcile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000960_0089_0FADE615A13F71B0"/>
reconciling the world to himſelf</hi>; which reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation could be made in no other way, but by the removal of that which had made the diſtance, which was nothing elſe but ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God.</hi> It was becauſe ſin had made the world an Hoſpital, that Chriſt was ſent into it to come as an healer, a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and ſo he compares himſelf, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the whole buſineſs of his Humiliation was to enable him thus to do.</hi> Chriſt was not only to be the Phyſician, but the Phyſick too; all the ſanative vertue by which Souls whom ſin had deadlily wounded, might be cured, muſt proceed from him: there muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſuch a vertue in him; and there muſt be an infinite <hi>fulneſs</hi> of it, that it might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all ſin, and compleatly heal Sinners of it. He muſt <hi>be able to ſave to the uttermoſt, Heb.</hi> 7.25. And for this he muſt be a Divine perſon, cloathed with an Humane nature, and in that nature he muſt accompliſh all that which was neceſſary for the fitting of him unto this great work. Now this he did in his ſtate of Humiliation; the application of this belongs eſpecially to his Exalted State, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to give Repentance to Iſrael, and remiſſion of ſins</hi>; but he laid in for it in his humbled ſtate, which was therefore introductory to the other, as we are told in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8, 9. In this he made the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000960_0090_0FADE616962A1668"/>
atonement, without which Guilt could never have been removed; hitherto belongs that, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. He was <hi>made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God through him,</hi> in this his blood was made cleanſing blood, for the purifying us from all our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, according to, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth from all ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Reaſon of this was, becauſe there were ſome that needed it, whom God purpoſed to make partakers in the benefits of it.</hi> As, if mans ſin had not brought him to that exigency, that without ſuch a fountain he muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for ever, Chriſt had not come; ſo, if God had not reſolved to impart the efficacy of it to ſome ſuch neceſſitous ones, he would never have been at the charge of providing it. God did not only intend the proviſion and exhibition of this fountain, that ſo if any would come to, and make uſe of it, they might be ſaved from their Sins by it; if that had been all, Chriſt had died in <hi>vain</hi>; for it is certain that none of fallen men would ever of their own accord come to him: that is true of all, till Chriſt draws them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life:</hi> The natural man loveth his Sin, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to wallow in the mire of his uncleanneſs; but God choſe ſome from eternity to be made the monuments of his rich Grace, in taking away all their iniquities; and he provided
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000960_0091_0FADE617B4566830"/>
Chriſt for this end; and therefore all ſuch as he deſigned this for, ſhall come to Chriſt, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the father hath given me, ſhall come unto me</hi>; they ſhall be cleanſed, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and healed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That they may partake in this benefit, there muſt be a ſaving application of the vertue of it to them.</hi> Theſe waters quench the thirſt of the Soul, by being drank of; they waſh off the Guilt and filth which cleaves to the Soul, by being waſhed with them; they heal the mortal diſeaſes which Sin had infected us withal, by the influence of the ſanative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of them on the Soul. It is not enough that they have all theſe good qualities in them: the Goſpel therefore acquaints us with an <hi>Application</hi> conſequent upon the <hi>Redemption</hi> wrought out by Chriſt, whereby he becomes ours, and we are ſaved by him; and hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on life is reſtrained to our having of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It is ſavingly applied to thoſe only who come to him by ſaving faith in him for it.</hi> Faith is the uniting Grace by which we are made one with Chriſt, and receive him to be our own for all the ends of his Mediatorſhip. This therefore is the great Goſpel condition on which Chriſt is offered to be made ours, and we are given to underſtand, that if thus we do not receive him, we ſhall not partake in
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000960_0092_0FADE618118951A0"/>
his ſaving mercies; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ſhall be ſaved, and he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> And as faith comes to Chriſt, ſo it draws the waters out of this fountain, it fetcheth in ſupplies from Chriſt continually, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>God himſelf is the Author of this Faith in order to our participation in theſe benefits. Faith is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God, Eph.</hi> 2.8. God by his Spirit puts this grace into us, and enables us to exert it, and that which he aims at in this, is to bring us to Chriſt by it, and ſo give us a title to theſe living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may be ours, and we may challenge a property in them, and make uſe of them for all our occaſions continually.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Hence all that do thus come to him ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this vertue from him.</hi> Whoſoever is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Chriſt, the fountain of life, ſhall <hi>live by him</hi>: Where God gives faith, he gives all that is connected in the promiſe with it. All ſaving good is firmly promiſed to believing; God therefore on our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pardons our ſin, the Guilt of it paſſeth off, our perſons are freed from Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and he ſanctifies our hearts, by laying a foundation of holineſs in us, which though imperfect at preſent, and mixed with defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſhall in due time aim at entire holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without ſpot or blemiſh: Hence we have that title put upon believing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.

                  <hi>USE. I.</hi> This may ſerve to Commend Chriſt to the Sinful Children of men, as a deſirable object. And ſurely, there is nothing that can more ſet him forth as a ſuitable and neceſſary one, than this conſideration. In nothing could he have been more accommodable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of fallen man, for his relief. Let then the contemplation of this draw your eyes and your hearts after him, and render him in your eſteem moſt precious and deſirable. And to this end Conſider.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>You are all by nature under the Guilt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of Sin.</hi> This is the ſtate of all mankind: and indeed, if we look upon Sin in its relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it will infer this. As it relates to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, and the Sanctions of that, ſo it involves <hi>Guilt; Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> and that Law hath ordained Death to be the wages of every Tranſgreſſion of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23 <hi>The wages of ſin is Death.</hi> And by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Ordination, the Sinner is held a faſt Priſoner of the Law, obnoxious to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if we look upon Sin as it relates to the Sanctity or purity of the Law of God, ſo it <hi>pollutes</hi> the man, ſtains him with uncleanneſs. Now there is none of you but beſides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Guilt of the firſt Tranſgreſſion, have a corrupt fountain of Original Sin in you,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000960_0094_0FADE61AF43FB3B0"/>
and innumerable actual pollutions, which you have made your ſelves odious withall: hence that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made mine heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Your miſery is unconceivably great whiles you are under the Dominion of theſe.</hi> Indeed all mans miſery began upon his Sinning: and there are two ſprings from whence all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity flows, <hi>viz.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>If this Fountain be yours, you have come to it by a living Faith.</hi> It is offered to us in the Promiſe, and we receive it by believing. No unbeliever can lay any claim to it, but every true believer can. If you have received Chriſt, you have believed in him, and if you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him, you are the Children of God, and heirs of the ſprings of Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his name.</hi> Coming to him, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him are equivalent terms in the Goſpel.</p>

It may be you value all ſucceſs according as you experience, comforts and aſſurances com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon your ſeeking to God, and if you want them, you fear that you have come in vain; but this is a miſtake in your ſearch. You came to have your ſin purged, and if there be any thing of that done, you are ſo far an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Are you then more beaten off from your own Righteouſneſs, and made more to depend upon that of Chriſt alone? Is ſin more vile and hateful to you, and do you more loath your ſelves for it? If it be thus, then you have your end ſo far advanced, and be thankfull.</p>

have him be a fountain of ſaving good to them. Herein only will Chriſt really profit us, if we may obtain Salvation by him; &amp; there is a ſo coming to him, if we would have grounded hopes of obtaining this benefit from him. And it is to be feared that many deceive themſelves about this, who pretend to a great reſpect for Chriſt, and talk much of their truſting in him; but were never rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed about him, and that for which he was manifeſted to us.

If you come to Chriſt for Credit, and Eaſe, and Proſperity in this World, you will find your ſelves mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; he hath aſſured you that you ſhall meet with trouble and reproach, and many trials in his Service, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>ult. In this world you ſhall have tribulation; his Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> If you come to him only to have your Sin pardoned, and not purged away, you will miſs of your aim; for tho'

he muſt apply a pardon to you, if ever you obtain it, yet his <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> are inſeparable; and if you ſeek not the <hi>destruction</hi> as well as the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of your ſins, you will find your ſelves diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

                     <hi>That there is a great and general Calling of the JEWS yet to come.</hi> As there was a time when God rejected them, for the horrible contempt which they caſt upon Chriſt and his Goſpel, in which they were made a ſcorn and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the world, and were diſperſed from one end of the earth to another; ſo there will
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:000960_0110_0FADE442585ABDC0"/>
a time come when there ſhall be a National return of them to God, and they ſhall accept of Chriſt for their Lord and Saviour. The truth of this hath been, and ſtill is denyed, and ſtrenuouſly oppugned by ſome; and the ſeemingly long delay of it, hath made many to heſitate about it; and it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, for Chriſt predicted, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.8. <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find faith on the Earth?</hi> Which ſome have interpreted to have a reſpect to the belief of this truth. But there are others who with as great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour defend it, and have ſolidly confuted all the pretended pleadings againſt it; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not a <hi>Fundamental Article</hi> of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yet there is ſo much of Conſolation ariſing from it to the people of God, in theſe dark days of tribulation upon the Church of Chriſt, that it is worth our while a little to refreſh our ſelves with the ſpeculation of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And here let me premiſe, That this truth is purely of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Credit of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely on the <hi>Divine Teſtimony</hi>; we muſt therefore <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> if we would know whether it be ſo. And among many Scripture confirmations of it, give me leave to offer a few Conſiderations; and to make way to this. Obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are many texts of Scripture which are to be underſtood of the Spiritual</hi> Iſrael. The whole myſtical body of Chriſt, made up of
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:000960_0111_0FADE44317486360"/>
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are frequently called the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, and the <hi>Seed of Abraham.</hi> This muſt not be denyed; for, as God firſt Choſe that Nation to be <hi>a peculiar people</hi> to himſelf; ſo he hath ſeen meet to put their Name upon the Church, even in Goſpel times: and there are ſome places that cannot bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother interpretation; See, <hi>Gal</hi> 6.16 <hi>Peace be on them, and on the Iſrael of God.</hi> We are told of a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> and one that is ſo <hi>inwardly, Rom.</hi> 2.28. And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.6. <hi>All are not Iſrael that are of Iſrael.</hi> Accordingly there are Propheſies in which Goſpel Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are repreſented under legal expreſſions, but muſt be ſpiritually interpreted; ſuch is that, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In every place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my Name, and a pure offering.</hi> And ſome think that the laſt <hi>Eight Chapters</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> are ſo to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There are Promiſes made to the Jews which did properly refer to their return from</hi> Babylon. There was ſuch a return afforded them after their Captivity by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and God before hand gave them many ſupports, and encouraging promiſes about it, wherein he prefixed the time when, and the manner how it ſhould be brought about; and there are many diſcourſes in the Prophets which had a proper and direct aim at it: we are therefore told how <hi>Daniel,</hi> by reading of theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp; making a Calculation from them, came
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:000960_0112_0FADE443CF94F7C8"/>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Predictions of glorious Things in the Goſpel day, that had a ſpecial reference to the Power and Efficacy of the word in the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>times.</hi> The bringing in of the Goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the great changes that were wrought thereby, was a matter of Admiration, and was therefore often foretold in the <hi>Old-Teſtament</hi>: and on this account we are acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that theſe and thoſe things were the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of ſuch and ſuch Propheſies: particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the aſtoniſhing <hi>giving of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the <hi>Fiery Tongues</hi> given the Apoſtles ſoon after Chriſts Aſcention, of which <hi>Peter</hi> gives that account, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16. &amp;c. <hi>This is that which was ſpoken by the Prophet Joel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>That when that time comes, there ſhall be a more peculiar Opening of this Fountain.</hi> There is ſomething to be done in that day, which was never before done in this regard; and that muſt be with regard to the manner and degree of the manifeſtation and application of it. We may take a brief account of this affair in the following Concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are happy Times predicted for the Church, after her wilderneſs estate ſhall be over.</hi> As there was a time, when after God had brought his People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they went through the wilderneſs, in order to their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Settlement in <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo we are told of the Goſpel Church, that ſoon after its being called it ſhould go into the wilderneſs, and be there for a prefixed time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.6. <hi>The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fled into the wilderneſs, where ſhe had a place prepared of God, that they ſhould f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto alſo may that have a ſpecial reference, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.3. <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, Oh City of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That theſe glorious things have not as yet befallen it in their compleat Accompliſhment.</hi> I dare not deny, but that there are ſome things ſpoken in the Scriptures concerning the Church of God, that muſt be referred to the <hi>Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant</hi> ſtate of it, and it would be a deluſion to apply them to its <hi>Militancy.</hi> There muſt alſo be an allowance made for our ſuppoſing the Spirit of God, who condeſcends to ſpeak to us in our own Language, to uſe <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> expreſſions, and ſet forth the better condition of the <hi>Militant</hi> Church upon Earth, with words borrowed from the ſtate of Glory to which it ſhall at length arrive: but we muſt not think that he goes about to delude us with flouriſhing Promiſes, and then put us off with low and little performances. There have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been wonderful accompliſhments for the Church in theſe latter days, peculiarly ſince the beginning of the Reformation; but theſe are little in compariſon with the things fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told to be brought to paſs; we are therefore to look for a tranſcendently greater Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and making haſt to appear. Who ſhall read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. <hi>throughout,</hi> and particularly from <hi>Verſe</hi> 18. <hi>to the end.</hi> And <hi>Chap</hi> 11.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with many other Propheſies of a like import? he muſt confeſs that there is more yet to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

In what order theſe ſhall be brought about, I diſpute not; but God will doubtleſs prepare the way to the deſtruction of the Man of Sin who ſtands in the way, by giving an enlarged Commiſſion for the Preaching of the Everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Goſpel, which ſhall <hi>Call</hi> his out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and convince the Great Ones of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious folly in <hi>giving their power to the Beaſt,</hi> and provoking them to reaſſume it; which Preaching ſhall alſo Call in the Nations of the World that at preſent are Unconverted; by which the <hi>JEWS</hi> ſhall likewiſe be affected, and perſwaded to come in with them unto Chriſt. Theſe things to be ſure will be cloſely connected, and one of them follow upon the other. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Blindneſs in part is hapned to Iſrael, till the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles be come in</hi>; and <hi>verſe</hi> 30, 31. <hi>As ye in times paſt have not believed God, yet now have obtained mercy through their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, even ſo have theſe alſo now not believed, that through your mercy, they may alſo obtain mercy.</hi> And now it is that theſe bleſſed days ſhall Commence: and therefore when the <hi>Whore is Judged, great Salvations come in,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> are brought in, together with the Gentiles to Celebrate it with their <hi>Hallelujah's, Rev.</hi> 19.1, 3, 4, 6.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Happineſs of thoſe times will be mainly Spiritual.</hi> Not but that there will be an External Glory then afforded to the Church of God; that is the time when <hi>God will ſay to Zion, ariſe and ſhine, Iſa.</hi> 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt told <hi>Pilate, Joh.</hi> 18 36. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world</hi>: And Holineſs will mainly difference that from all elſe; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid of theſe times, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.20, 21. <hi>In that day there ſhall be upon the bells of the Horſes, Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The Spiritual felicity of thoſe days will flow from the more full opening of Chriſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>: For,</p>

                     <pb n="118" facs="unknown:000960_0121_0FADE5A8D9B3DD50"/>1. <hi>All Spiritual Good derives from Chriſt to us.</hi> We have none in us naturally; as he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for us all that we have, ſo he confers it upon us: it <hi>is of his fulneſs that we receive, Joh.</hi> 1.16. What therefore he gives, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from him, and therefore our encreaſes are proportionable to his Communications to us; if he with holds from us, we <hi>wither,</hi> and go to decay, but if he ſhall influence us libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, we ſhall <hi>flouriſh.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The glory of theſe days, in regard of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the opening of this fountain, will be ſeen</hi> in two things.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Efficacy.</hi> The vertue of this fountain ſhall then appear abundantly; the pardoning and ſanctifying influence of it ſhall be to admiration, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9. <hi>Every thing that liveth, which moveth, whitherſoever the rivers ſhall come, ſhall live.</hi> The Spirit will then mightily accompany the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and Converſions will not be ſo rare and dubious as now they are, nor the lives of Chriſtians ſo barren, but then will thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies have a wonderful accompliſhment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.15, <hi>&amp;c.

of heart?</hi> If we look on the preſent ſtate of Chriſtianity in the world, it appears with a black face; and if we ſtint our ſpeculations here, it will ſink us in deſpondency; but let us look forward, and we may gather abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant refreſhment. Conſider then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>There are better times yet to come.</hi> It is <hi>night</hi> at preſent, and the <hi>terrours</hi> of it are apt to affright us; but the Day will break, and let us refreſh our ſelves with that conſideration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. <hi>Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</hi> God hath ſaid in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous.</hi> And the Pſalmiſt reſolves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy upon</hi> Zion; and 94.14. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off his people, neither will he forſake his inheritance.</hi> The whole <hi>Creation groans</hi> for this day, and we ought to live upon the <hi>hope</hi> of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 23, Nor need we to fear whether it ſhall be accompliſhed, for God hath engaged in it; and we are told, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7. <hi>The zeal of the Lord of Hoſts will perform this.</hi>
                  </p>

predictions, of things that were to intervene and make way to it, have already received their fulfilment? and we may expect that God will make a ſhort work of it, when it draws nigh its accompliſhment. Nor need the preſent face of things, though diſmal, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright us; or make us think it afar off, for how often is the darkeſt part of the night juſt before the day breaks? and therefore the Church acknowledgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1. <hi>When the Lord turned again the captivity of</hi> Zion, <hi>we were like thoſe that dream.</hi>

evil, needeth no Salvation; they are only the diſtreſſed that want it, or will be advantaged by it. And this Salvation muſt be applyed to the removal of that from which the evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives: now that which is mans infelicity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from Sin and Uncleanneſs; it is the <hi>Guilt</hi> and the <hi>Pollution</hi> of ſin that hurts them. As therefore Chriſt is appointed for this, ſo he muſt be diſcovered to them as ſuch a one, how elſe ſhall they accept of and entertain him as ſo? which they muſt do, if ever he profit them; for it is by faith that they receive him, and ſo are advantaged by him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That there is a time when God will Open and Apply Chriſt to theſe.</hi> They are born in their natural eſtate ſtrangers to Chriſt, and far from Salvation, <hi>Eph</hi> 2.3. <hi>We were Children of wrath, even as others.</hi> They may live a great while in their Alienation from him, and refuſe him, though he offers himſelf unto them: they ever do ſo till he comes with power. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath choſen them to obtain Salvation by Chriſt, he will therefore bring them to this Fountain, and make them to partake in a title to it, and effectual influences of it upon them: Our Saviour hath plumply aſſerted that in, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me</hi> If Election hath pitched upon a perſon, Vocation will without fail, ſooner or later find him out, and bring him home.</p>

               <p>Now for our right taking up of this order, Let us obſerve in general, That we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of ſuch as are converted to God, under and by the diſpenſation of the Goſpel and Ordinances, and the effectual application of them. As for Gods proceeding with Elect Infants, who dy before they are capable of being ſo treated, we are not now enquiring after that. Here then more particularly let theſe things be conſidered.</p>

As to the outward diſcoveries of Chriſt which are made in the Goſpel and Ordinances, they are made to all promiſcuouſly to whom the means of Grace are ſent, and the great truths which concern Chriſt and Salvation by him are urged upon them: but where the Spirit of God doth inwardly reveal Chriſt in the Souls of any, and makes them ſharers in his Salvation, he always b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:000960_0136_0FADE5B7D81A78A0"/>3. <hi>That all ſaving qualifications are wrought in them at once, in Paſſive Converſion.</hi> When the Spirit of God comes to produce this great Change in the Sinner, he infuſeth into him all his Sanctifying Graces: there is a <hi>new man created in him, Eph.</hi> 4.24. There is a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts, though not of degrees: <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is throughout,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. There is therefore no order in the production of theſe ſaving qualities in the Soul, but they come in all at once. In Converſion <hi>whole Chriſt is put on,</hi> it is therefore called a <hi>new birth, Joh.</hi> 3.3. And it is the babe of Grace which is born, and it hath all its members entire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That God draws the man to exert theſe Graces in Active Converſion, after the manner of a Rational Agent.</hi> In the exerting of Grace, the man is not only <hi>active,</hi> but <hi>voluntary</hi> too; he acts as a cauſe by Counſel. As therefore there is the Co-operation of God in this, as well as his operation in the former, according to, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you, to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> So he works upon the Rational Faculties or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are put into man; and having ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, he draws them forth to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the new nature into act, upon ſight, deliberation, and with perſwaſion. He is not drawn to it by meer inſtinct, but he knows what he doth, and why he doth it: he hath a foundation on which he acts every Grace; he knows whom
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:000960_0137_0FADE5B893C74350"/>
he believes, in, and why he ſo doth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have believed, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day</hi>; and ſo of the reſt. God is therefore ſaid to <hi>draw us with the cords of a man, Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>In this Converſion the Soul betakes it ſelf to Chriſt by faith, as to a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanneſs.</hi> The great Grace celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Goſpel is <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we cloſe with Chriſt for life, wherein we comply with the main Article of the New-Covenant; and therefore Salvation is aſcertained to it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believes in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> This Grace is not before the others in being, though it leads in the exerciſe, and doth indeed influence all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being that which fetcheth in help from Chriſt for the acting of them. Now Chriſt is the immediate Object on whom Faith fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; it believes in him for all the good that it wants, and ſeeth to be ſtored in him; and that which draws it ſo to rely on him, is the diſcovery it hath made of his ſufficiency and readineſs to anſwer its great neceſſity; which is, to be delivered from the guilt and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin; and that becauſe it apprehends all this to be fountained in him, that it may be communicated by him to all thoſe that ſtand in need of it; and this it doth upon the invitation given in the Goſpel, to all that are
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:000960_0138_0FADE5B954853C20"/>
oppreſſed with the burden of ſin, to come to him for ſuccour againſt it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>This</hi> Faith <hi>is always accompanied with true</hi> Repentance. In active Converſion theſe two Graces are in conjunction. I ſhall not here meddle with the diſputes, which of theſe two Graces is the firſt: if we ſpeak of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, they are together, and ſo there is no priority of any Grace, they being created in the ſame inſtant: if we ſpeak of the order of nature in their activity, Faith muſt have the precedency, becauſe it influenceth all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for though there is a <hi>Legal Repentance</hi> before Converſion, yet that which is <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> follows upon it, and is no further pleaſing to God, than as it is exerciſed by faith: but in reſpect to order of time, the man repents and believes at once, and ſo they are together. It is a penitent Faith, and a believing Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that is exerted; they are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. <hi>Teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>For the right exerting of theſe Graces, there is the exerciſe of a Spirit of Mourning, and of Supplication.</hi> There is a principle of this, or there is ſuch a Spirit habitually put into the man when he is new made, but the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is in the practiſing of Faith and Repentance. Here then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the exerting of true Repentance, he draws
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:000960_0139_0FADE5BA381617E0"/>
out a Spirit of mourning.</hi> In Repentance we turn from ſin to God, in which turning, there is not only an abſtinence from the outward acts, but a cordial renouncing and forſaking of thoſe ſins which we rightly repent of; and for that end we muſt be made to ſee them to be evil and miſchievous, and that we have foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly turned from God to them; the genuine effect whereof upon the heart, is to bemoan our ſelves by reaſon of them: and hence the Scripture annexeth mourning unto Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as an inſeparable concomitant of it, hence that in, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And for the producing of this mourning, God offers the conviction of the evil and bitterneſs there is in our ſins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Know and ſee that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> Now there are two paſſages to be obſerved in this mourning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He bewails all his Sins.</hi> Godly Sorrow is for Sin: that is the procuring cauſe of all the ſorrows that poor man is expoſed unto, and is therefore that which peculiarly calls for our mourning; and this belongs to that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which the Apoſtle tells us is ſo ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to true Repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10, <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance not to be repented of.</hi> It is by this that we embitter ſin to our ſelves, and ſtir up in us an hatred of it: for, though ſorrow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a mixt Affection, yet it mainly
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:000960_0140_0FADE5BB6B2B6828"/>
partakes of hatred, which is a ſeparating af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and makes us to reject the Object of it. Now if this ſorrow be genuine, it is univerſal; it bears a reſpect to all ſin; becauſe if it be right, it is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the apprehenſion of the great evil there is in ſin, in the nature, as well as in the effects of it; which evil being in all ſin, it muſt needs extend to all: hence that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.104. <hi>I hate every falſe way</hi>; and where this hatred is, there will be Sorrow for our having hurt our ſelves by it, and therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He more peculiarly laments the affronts that he hath offered to Chriſt, who hath been ſet before him in the tenders of Grace.</hi> This therefore is peculiarly remarked in, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only Son, and be in bitterneſs for him, as one is in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs for his first born.</hi> Where the Goſpel comes, and Chriſt is exhibited, together with the need that men have of him by reaſon of Sin; the convictions whereof are laid before men to perſwade them of the neceſſity they ſtand in of having him to be their Saviour; and men have made light of there invitations which have been given them; they have not been perſwaded of their miſery by Sin, and brought to accept of Chriſt to reſcue them from it, and have accordingly deſpiſed

him, neglected him, choſen lying vanities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and remained in their unbelief; This is the great provocation under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>This is the Condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men chuſe dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light.</hi> This Sin therefore they ſhall peculiarly mourn for and reſent with the greateſt ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For the exerciſing of Faith, this Spirit of mourning is ever accompanied with a Spirit of Supplication.</hi> The firſt breathings and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN this Chapter, with the two following an account is given of the ſubſtance or heads of a Sermon which Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Diſciples, in the audience of a multitude ſoon after he had called them, The matters contained in this fifth Chapter, may
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000960_0171_0FADE5DC47CFF448"/>
be reduced to three heads. [1.] He points the way to true Bleſſedneſs, by deſcribing the ſubjects of it in ſeveral diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of them, and declaring wherein they appear to be really happy, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. <hi>to</hi> 13. [2.] He lays open the Office and Duty of ſuch as would approve themſelves to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and edifying Miniſters of the Goſpel, to <hi>Verſe</hi> 17. [3.] He aſſerts the great uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> under the Goſpel, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us that his deſign was not to <hi>Aboliſh,</hi> but <hi>Eſtabliſh</hi> it; and thereupon proceeds to Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the true ſenſe of it from the corrupt and falſe gloſſes of the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors to the end of the Chapter.</hi> In which he inſiſts upon ſeveral <hi>Articles,</hi> which had been more eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by them: and the words of our <hi>Text</hi> are an Exhortation which he draws from the whole foregoing diſcourſe; though I know there are ſome who needleſly reſtrain it to the next foregoing duty of expreſſing our cordial love to our enemies, in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the <hi>Scribes,</hi> who taught <hi>that we ſhould love our neighbour, and hate our enemy.</hi> I know the words are expreſſed in the Future tenſe; <hi>Ye ſhall be perfect</hi>; but yet they are not to be underſtood <hi>Promiſſorily,</hi> as ſome do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them; but <hi>Preceptively,</hi> as an injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on laid upon us. And we have ſeveral like inſtances in this <hi>Chapter</hi>; yea &amp; it is frequent in all languages to uſe the <hi>Future</hi> for the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative:</hi>

You ſhall do thus or ſo; intending, I require or command you ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In the words, beſides the <hi>Illation, therefore,</hi> which refers to the foregoing diſcourſe, there are two parts;</p>
            <p n="1">1. A duty enjoyned; <hi>Be ye perfect.</hi> The ſubject of this command are Chriſts <hi>Diſciples, verſe</hi> 1. The thing required is perfection; which, what it is, will be afterward conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Pattern which is ſet before us to follow, in our eſſayes after this perfection; <hi>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> So that here the Divine perfection is propoſed to us for our imitation; and an argument is uſed to urge it from the conſideration of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he bears to us, he is our Father in heaven; and Children are apt to take after their Parents. Hence that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation; becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, be ye Holy, for I am Holy.</hi> Here is not an equality intended, but a ſimilitude, together with ſuch a meaſure as the Creature is capable of attaining unto: for the greateſt perfections of the moſt excellent Creatures, are imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, compared with God. Nor are all the Divine Perfections here intended: there are thoſe that are by Divines called <hi>Incommunicable,</hi> which we are to admire, but not to aſpire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and there are thoſe which are ſaid to be
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:000960_0173_0FADE5DD57142848"/>
               <hi>Communicable:</hi> Namely, ſuch whereof there may be an Image, or dark repreſentation in us; and theſe are here aimed at. Theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections conſiſt in that <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which are required in the Moral Law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which we are enabled by the Sanctification of the Spirit, the Graces whereof in us are called, the <hi>Image of God</hi>; by which we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in his Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs. That the Duty here required is <hi>Evangelical</hi>; therein appears, becauſe Chriſt enjoyneth it on his Diſciples, and ſuch as can call God their Father, by vertue of the <hi>Adoption,</hi> which we are told cometh in upon believing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>For we are the Children of God, through faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only matter of difficulty before us, is to know what is the perfection intended by Chriſt in this precept, and which he requireth and expecteth that all thoſe who approve themſelves to be his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> ſhould be always aſpiring after. And that which makes it the more difficult, is becauſe the word is variouſly uſed in the Scriptures, and differently applied by Expoſitors to this <hi>Text.</hi> The word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth, that which hath attained its end; and, becauſe when a thing hath ſo done, it hath reached its perfection according to its capacity, it is <hi>Metonymically</hi> uſed for it: and ſo, one that is adult, or grown up to his full <hi>Stature,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a perfect man, Eph.</hi> 4.13.

               </gap>rue diſtinction if ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſound ſenſe, but is warily to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. They tell us alſo, that there is a perfection of <hi>parts,</hi> which is called <hi>Integrality</hi>; and ſo an infant is a perfect man, becauſe he hath all the parts which belong to that <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:</hi> and of <hi>Degrees,</hi> when theſe parts are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and come to the juſt meaſure which nature aſpired unto. They ſpeak alſo of a <hi>Relative</hi> or <hi>Comparative</hi> perfection, when, though a thing be in it ſelf defective, yet when it is compared with another of its own kind, it doth very much exceed or go beyond it; and that which is <hi>Abſolute,</hi> which is when it is improved to its utmoſt capacity; &amp; they obſerve that perfection is ſometimes uſed for <hi>Sincerity,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Hypocriſy</hi>; when a man not only profeſſeth Godlineſs, but is the man he pretends to be, ſuch an one is ſound or perfect, whereas the other is unſound, and ſo imperfect. Now all theſe diſtinctions have their foundation in the word of God: nor, without diſtinguiſhing, can we be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> which aſſert the preſent perfection of the people of God, even in this life, with thoſe that do deny any here to be perfect; which would elſe be contradictions, whereas we are aſſured that the ſpirit of God
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:000960_0175_0FADE5DF580D7C68"/>
doth not contradict himſelf in his word. Now, though it be eaſily granted on all hands, that Chriſt requires <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or an <hi>Upright Heart</hi> of us, yea and <hi>Integrity</hi> too, or a cordial <hi>reſpect</hi> to be expreſſed to all his <hi>Commands</hi>; and he will accept of ſuch ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity at the hands of his people in theſe duties which they perform in faith, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their acceptance in Chriſt: in which reſpect, I ſuppoſe, <hi>Evangelical</hi> Obedience doth mainly differ from that which is <hi>Legal,</hi> and God is pleaſed with it, when he rejects the other; yet, how far, <hi>abſolute perfection</hi> is comprized in the precept here given by Chriſt, is a matter of doubt and debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many. There are, and thoſe not a few, who with greateſt confidence do aſſert, that God doth not expect or require of his people, under the Goſpel Covenant, that perfection in their Obedience to him, which he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Covenant of Works</hi>; but hath abated of the ſtrictneſs of the Command; and if we do our beſt, there is no more required of us. Which aſſertion, though I believe that many who uſe it, do mean well, and intend nothing elſe in it than is acknowledged by all the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi>; yet it is a very unſafe aſſertion in the letter of it; and is one foundation on which the <hi>Papists</hi> do build their Doctrines of mens <hi>merits,</hi> and works of ſupererogation; yea and many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do alſo introduce
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:000960_0176_0FADE5DFA309B230"/>
that abſurd and dangerous notion of making our Obedience to be of the matter of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification; becauſe being upon a New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant account, we do fulfil the Obedience that is in it required of us, and ſo, by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it beſpeaks our <hi>Justification</hi>: Looſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors alſo are hurt by this opinion; they think they are ſincere, and becauſe of this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, are too negligent in their duty, and fail in that true Repentance, which they ought every day to be in the renewed exerciſes of; It may then be of preſent uſe to diſcuſs this Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether that Perſonal Perfection which God requires of his people under the Covenant of Grace, be the ſame for kind and degree with that which was required in the Covenant of Works, or any thing ſhort of it?</hi>

and Salvation is hypothetically promiſed unto them, and invitations are urged upon them to entertain it on the terms propoſed; yet before ſuch time as they have actually embraced the offered Grace, they are truly under the Law as a Covenant of Works: and becauſe they are ſo, it demands of them perſonal perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both habitual and actual, and that on pain of death; for we are told in, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the Curſe: for it is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ihe Book of the Law, to do them.</hi> Hence, as of old, God gave the <hi>Moral Law</hi> a new Sanction, on <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> with thundrings and lightnings, and great terrors, as we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. So to make way for the <hi>veiled Goſpel,</hi> which was afterwards given to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by him to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial Inſtitutions</hi> which were delivered to him; ſo, under the Goſpel; to thoſe that are partakers of the outward bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of it, when he comes to Convert any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners among them to Chriſt, and make them to accept of him, as a Saviour, he lays them under the terrors of the <hi>Law Moral,</hi> by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them what is therein required of them, and what they are to expect at the hands of a Righteous God, if thoſe demands be not fully anſwered; and by this he convinceth them of their miſery, and ſelf impotency to
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:000960_0178_0FADE5E112FAEAD0"/>
deliver themſelves from it, thereby making way for their hearkning after, and giving the greateſt welcome to a Redeemer. On this account is the Law called our <hi>School-maſter unto Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 3.24. Becauſe by it we are acquainted with our need of him, and excited to ſeek after him. There is then no doubt to be made, but that the ſame perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is required of them, notwithſtanding their being in the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt. Whereas true Converts or ſuch as have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, are delivered from this Severity, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are no longer under the Law as a Covenant pronouncing of them dead men if they fail of their Obedience in the leaſt <hi>punctilio</hi>: and the reaſon is, becauſe they are brought under the Covenant of Grace, by which they are freed from the former, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Sin ſhall not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The queſtion is not with reſpect to our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God.</hi> The Juſtification of fallen man hath not the leaſt regard to any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obedience of theirs, as having an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Cauſall into it; and conſequently it can have no reſpect to any kind of perfection of it. Goſpel Juſtification cometh altogether by the <hi>Imputation</hi> of the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of another to us; <hi>viz.</hi> that of Chriſt, which was for that end provided by God for us, and is called his

It is called the Juſtification of a Sinner, or of the <hi>Ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. And therefore muſt needs have a reſpect to that Law in relation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the man is a Sinner; which is the Moral Law, under obligation whereto all men do ſtand as they derive from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>

They wholly miſtake the very nature of Goſpel Juſtification, who allow any Righteouſneſs ſhort of that, to have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in it; and ſince by the fall man is become <hi>Guilty,</hi> and ſo ſubjected to the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law, if he had a perſonal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oad as that which the Law required of man in integrity, yet that would not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for the removal of his Guilt, without which he cannot be Juſtified. So that whether it be perfect or imperfect, it ſignifies nothing here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Nor is the queſtion about what Obedience of ours will find acceptance with God through Chriſt.</hi> It is certain, that no Obedience of ours will be at all accepted of us out of him; and it is alſo beyond doubt that the imperfection which attends the ſincere Services of Gods Children,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:000960_0180_0FADE5E46C5F6FA0"/>
will not procure that theſe Services of theirs ſhould be rejected by him, for if ſo, it were <hi>impoſſible</hi> that any of us, in this imperfect ſtate that abides us, ſhould ever <hi>pleaſe God</hi> in any thing that we do, which muſt needs be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible diſcouragement to us in doing any duties that are required of us: but then it is through Chriſt that they find acceptance with him. In this reſpect it is that the ſincerity which Gods Children do expreſs in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is ſo often called <hi>perfection,</hi> in the Scriptures, (<hi>Job</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a perfect man, and upright, Job</hi>

So that the true Believer who ſerves God in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, is not to be diſcouraged, becauſe he finds his beſt to come ſo far behind of that perfection which the Law preſcribes to men, but is to look to the gracious encouragement which is given to them who <hi>love God in ſincerity.</hi>

of God, and that the <hi>Law Moral</hi> no longer binds them under duty of conformity unto it, but that upon their believing in Chriſt, they are freed from any ſuch engagement; this is purely <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and beſpeaks all the precept given to the Children of God under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to be wholly in vain; or only to concern ſuch as are as yet unregenerate, for the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening them to betake themſelves to Chriſt, and ſeek an intereſt in him by faith, and not at all to belong to thoſe that are already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers in the grace of God; but why then have the Children of God that title of <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> put upon them, and are called upon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it by this conformity? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>As obedient children, not faſhioning your ſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former luſts, &amp;c.</hi> Suppoſing then ſuch an Obedience as this to be our duty, which prerequires a principle to be put into us, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring us to a compliance with it, in order to our actual performance of it, our enquiry is about the extenſiveneſs of it, or how far it is our duty to endeavour after perfection in it? and for the clearing of this Caſe we may take the following Concluſions into Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the deſign of the New Covenant, in which the Grace of it is to appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to bring fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man back to a ſtate of bleſſedneſs.</hi> It was becauſe mankind were become wofully miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the Apoſtaſy of <hi>Adam,</hi> in which they all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell, and there was no room left for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:000960_0182_0FADE5E64D5200F0"/>
to be afforded to them by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, inaſmuch as the <hi>Law could no longer give life, Gal.</hi> 3.21. And God had a pity for ſome of that unhappy race &amp; would ſave them, that he opened a New Covenant, in which he makes the diſplays of his rich Grace to them. Now, as it was the glory of his <hi>Grace</hi> that God had a regard to ultimately in this Contrivance; ſo the way in which he would exalt this Attribute, and make it illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and for ever admirable, was in their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that the Salvation of loſt Sinners is inſeparably connected with, and nextly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinated to this laſt end of God; becauſe in and by it he will accompliſh it. In which Salvation they are delivered from that miſery under which they were fallen by reaſon of ſin, unto all that felicity which they had ſo loſt; hence we are told that it is <hi>by Grace that we are ſaved, Eph.</hi> 2 8. on which account it is called <hi>the Grace of God which brings Salvati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, Tit.</hi> 2 11. When therefore the undone Sinner is brought to the enjoyment of perfect felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, then hath the Grace of God accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its deſign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That in order to the bringing about of this purpoſe of God, there are two things requiſite to be done for the man,</hi> viz The <hi>Juſtificatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of his perſon,</hi> and the <hi>Sanctification of his nature</hi> The ground of this, is becauſe there is a double mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſery befallen the man by the Apoſtaſy, <hi>viz.
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:000960_0183_0FADE5E654F2DE88"/>
Guilt,</hi> which hath rendred him obnoxious to the wrath of God, yea brought him under a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation, binding him over to ſuffer the whole Curſe that is contained in the threatning of Death, unto the execution whereof the Juſtice of God ſtands engaged in the Covenant of works: And <hi>Pollution,</hi> by which his nature is depraved, and fallen under the Dominion of Sin which reigns as a King in him, and ſo he is rendred utterly impotent to the doing of that which is good, and in which his formal happineſs did conſiſt, and all his powers are violently bent to that which is evil: and ſo long as theſe two abide upon him he cannot be happy, but muſt needs be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. As long as the man lies under the Curſes of the Law, a Priſoner of Revenging Juſtice, doomed to ſuffer all the wrath that is contained in the threatnings that are out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinners, in which the quinteſſence of all evil is contained; and is held <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ettered in <hi>Cords of Iniquity,</hi> ſo as that he can do nothing of that buſineſs which he was made for, but is, by the force of his carnal luſts, hurried and precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ted provocations of God, he muſt needs be a miſerable Creature: Nor can he be recovered to a ſtate of bleſſedneſs, but by the removal of both theſe evils from him; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> either of them remain upon him, he is incapable of being a bleſſed man in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The former of theſe is done by <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:000960_0184_0FADE5E71D1D4AF8"/>
and the latter by <hi>Sanctification.</hi> In the one his Condemnation is removed, his Guilt is taken away, he is acquitted from the Law, and delivered from all danger of ſuffering the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful penalties of it; yea and is adjudged to life, to partake in the good that is laid up in the promiſe; in the latter his nature is reſtored, and renewed again, and he is rendred able to Serve God in newneſs of life; he who before was unprofitable, is now made profitable; and can glorify God, which was his laſt end. And for this reaſon both theſe benefits of the new Covenant, are ſo much celebrated in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: both of theſe are included in that reaſon of the Name which was put upon Chriſt at his birth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> And in Gods <hi>taking away all iniquity from them,</hi> Hoſ. 14.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the end of this Sanctification, is to make him a fit ſubject to enjoy true bleſſedneſs.</hi> It is true, without Juſtification of the mans perſon, and in it a pardon of his Sins applied to him, he cannot be happy; for how is it poſſible that he ſhould be ſo, as long as <hi>the wrath of God abides on him,</hi> and he is every moment li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the fearful ſtroke of Divine Vengeance, which is ready to fall on him, and cut him off! Whereas if once this ſtate of his be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he is a Juſtified and Pardoned man, he is forthwith bleſſed, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000960_0185_0FADE5E7D3250BF8"/>
               <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Yet this alone is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for his actual enjoyment of the felicity promiſed in the New-Covenant; for true bleſſedneſs can only conſiſt in the cloſure of the faculty with its Object, and reſting ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed in it; for without ſatisfaction the man is not happy; and that it may thus do, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that there be a ſuitableneſs between the faculty and the object, how elſe ſhould it either cloſe with, or take real content in it? Now the bleſſedneſs which God hath laid in to entertain his people withall, is ſuited only to Holineſs in the ſubject of it; ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, it is impoſſible that the man ſhould ever participate in it, or be delighted with it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Without Holineſs no man ſhall ſee God.</hi> So that the ſinful pollution which is upon the very nature of fallen man, by reaſon of the ſin that dwells in him, renders him, in the preſent condition, and ſo long as he abides under the prevailing efficacy of it, altogether unmeet for bleſſedneſs, yea indeed incapable of it. He cannot have Communion with God, in which his felicity muſt conſiſt, for God alone is an happifying object; nor, if he could can he take any content to himſelf in it, becauſe <hi>God is Holy,</hi> and ſuch is the fellowſhip which he holds with the Creature, than which nothing can be more contrary to the corruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his nature is defiled. We read of <hi>A meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:000960_0186_0FADE5E8CB0AFEF0"/>
for the Inheritance of the Saints, Col.</hi> 1.12· Which meetneſs implies a ſuitable diſpoſition in us thereto, in which it is abſolutely requiſite that there be in us ſuch gracious qualifications as render us conformable to the Inheritance it ſelf; theſe we have not in us by nature, as we derive it from the unclean fountain from which we are originated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean</hi>? It muſt then be done by Sanctification, in and by which we are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated to our Inheritance; becauſe hereby we are made holy, and ſo are fitted for the enjoyment of the holy place, and of all thoſe holy things which are there prepared to make us happy in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That the man can only be truly bleſſed in the glorifying of God, and enjoying of him.</hi> The bleſſedneſs of the Reaſonable Creature requires the concurrence of two things to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, <hi>viz. Well doing,</hi> and <hi>Well being:</hi> nor can either of theſe be alone. A man is then happy when he fully reacheth the end that he was made for; now man was made for God, not only <hi>Ultimately,</hi> but <hi>Immediately</hi> too; and to loſe this end muſt needs be his miſery. Now, Gods Glory being his own laſt end in all his works of Efficiency, hence it follows that the laſt end of all theſe works of his muſt be to Serve to that glory, how elſe ſhould he obtain his end by it in the event? And every one of his Creatures is to Serve to this end agreeably
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:000960_0187_0FADE5EAAB6511E0"/>
to that nature which God put into it when he made it; in which he beſtowed on it a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of ſo ſerving his deſign by it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, man was made capable of doingly this <hi>act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively,</hi> inaſmuch as he was endowed with ſuch powers as enabled him to act as a cauſe by counſel, and make choiſe of his way; and therefore it is only by his ſo doing that he can reach the great end of his being: in his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this he becomes <hi>Vain,</hi> for what elſe is vanity, but the miſſing, or falling ſhort of ones end? That the man may attain this end, it is requiſite that he have a power in him to Serve to it; and what elſe is that power but <hi>Holineſs</hi>? Created Holineſs in man, is nothing elſe but that rectitude in his whole nature, and all the powers of it, whereby he is enabled &amp; enclined to live &amp; be to the Glory of God in all things. And from the exerting of this principle do proceed all his holy actions. Man in his lapſed eſtateis without this principle, having loſt it by his unhappy fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt therefore be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to him in <hi>Sanctification,</hi> elſe he cannot Serve God. Now mans <hi>Well being</hi> is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the former; God only is an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate object for him, or a ſufficient portion for him, to make him bleſſed; he muſt then enjoy him, if ever it be well with him, for in this fruition his actual felicity muſt conſiſt: for could he obtain and have the full freedom of uſing all that is in heaven and earth, ſeparate from God, he were ſtill miſerable; the Pſalmiſt
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:000960_0188_0FADE5EAE23581E0"/>
could ſay, <hi>Pſal</hi> 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is nothing on earth that I deſire with thee:</hi> and the only way for our enjoying of God, is by glorifying of him. It is ſin that hath made the woful ſeparation, which hath procured our infelicity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God.</hi> And what is ſin, but a <hi>coming ſhort of the glory of God? Rom.</hi> 3.23. God therefore hath fully declared that he will beſtow this favour upon none but thoſe that honour him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That for this</hi> Active <hi>perſonal glorifying of God, man muſt have a</hi> Rule. It is not enough that he have an inward principle of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation put into him, whereby he is diſpoſed unto this Service, and empowred for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of it, though without it he muſt needs fall ſhort of his great end; but he muſt alſo have a directory to ſhew him his way, in which this work is to be done. As there muſt be an <hi>heart</hi> in us enclining of us to Glorify God, elſe we cannot move one ſtep towards it, ſo there muſt be a <hi>way</hi> according to which we are to encline our ſelves hereunto. It is certain that there are thoſe things whereby God is diſhonoured in the lives of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, as well as thoſe whereby they do honour him; and how ſhould the man be able either to avoid the one, or rightly to

proſecute the other, except he have ſomething to guide his ſteps, and order his Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by? for this therefore there muſt be a Rule laid before him, hence God tells them, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8 <hi>He hath ſhewn thee Oh man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> the promiſe therefore is made to ſuch as live conformably to this Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6 16. <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, peace be on them, and mercy</hi>; and it is the alone prerogative of God, not only to require Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Creature, which it ows to him as he is its ſupream Lord and Owner, but alſo to preſcribe to it how and wherein he will be Served by it. He who is our <hi>Lord and King,</hi> is our <hi>Law giver</hi> too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. And he muſt ſome way or other reveal this to them that are concerned in it, how elſe ſhould they know how to <hi>order their converſation aright,</hi> ſo as to ſee <hi>his Salvation</hi>? It is by this Rule that they are to ſquare all their actions; they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look upon it, and apply it to every ſtep- <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Thy word is a light to my feet, and a lamp to my path</hi>; but this it cannot be except they be acquainted with it; ſo that they muſt receive it from him in order to their practiſing of it, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>We exhort you by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that as ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us how you ought to walk, and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more.</hi>

               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:000960_0190_0FADE5EE01B35D20"/>6. <hi>The</hi> Moral Law <hi>was at firſt given to man to be this</hi> Rule. As there is a <hi>Common Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which God exerciſeth over the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo there is a <hi>Special Government</hi> by which he leads Intelligent &amp; Rational Agents to the end they are appointed to: Now this Law was the Rule of Gods ſpecial Government with reſpect to mankind. This Law is by ſome made the ſame with, and by others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from the law of nature; but if we reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the law of nature, to be that which was engraven on the heart of man at the firſt, it may be well reckoned for the ſame. This was every way ſuited to the nature of man; it was fitted for the guiding of ſuch a creature to its laſt end, in all the things in which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: The <hi>ſanctified underſtanding</hi> in man, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſtate of integrity, not only could read the inſcriptions of it on his heart, but ſaw and approved the reaſonableneſs and equity of it; yea, the convictions of a <hi>natural Conſcience</hi> in fallen man, do prove that he cannot withſtand the righteouſneſs of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.

               </gap>in. This was the ſame Law which had a new edition of it at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> where God pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it, and regiſtred it on <hi>Tables of Stone,</hi> &amp; ſummed it up in <hi>ten Precepts,</hi> which comprized in them the ſumme and ſubſtance of mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and wherein he was bound to Serve and Glorifie God in his whole courſe, reaching both his heart and his life, the matter, manner &amp; end of all he did.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Though the Sanctions of that Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be removed, in reſpect to believers; yet as a Rule, it abides for ever.</hi> Under the Covenant of Grace, neither is the promiſe of beſtowing a reward of life upon mens performing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect perſonal Obedience, nor the threatning of puniſhing the leaſt defect in that Obedience with death, any longer of force in regard of the Children of God: and the reaſon is, becauſe the Law of Works hath ceaſed to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to them, upon their accepting the terms of, and being admitted into the Covenant of Grace. We do now ſtand upon other terms with God, through Chriſt in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, whereof we are partakers by faith in him. But ſtill the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Moral Law</hi> abide on us as our Duty, there never was any repeal of the Command; nor indeed can they ever ceaſe to be a Rule to man, for the guiding of him in the <hi>right ordering of his Converſation,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:000960_0192_0FADE5F030986A18"/>
as they are every way ſuited to the nature of man, conſidered as being made on purpoſe for the actual glorifying of God; ſo that if we would actually glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him as men, we muſt do it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with theſe precepts. All that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this rule is reduced to thoſe two heads, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 39. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind; and thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And this can never ceaſe to be our duty, ſo long as we are men; nothing can diſcharge us from the obligation of loving God and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, inaſmuch as the <hi>Relation</hi> we bear to both cannot ceaſe, and the duty is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from ſuch a <hi>Relation.</hi> It is alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all of theſe Duties are reinforced in the Goſpel; or under the diſpenſation of the Kingdom of Grace; and may be all of them found on record in the preceptive part of the New-Teſtament, required of Chriſtians, <hi>as they would walk worthy of the vocation with which they are called</hi>; and are therefore called <hi>New Commands,</hi> becauſe they are there reinforced with arguments fetcht from the conſideration of the Grace of God appearing to us; we have this ſummarily commended to us in, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God which brings Salvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men; teaching us, that denying
