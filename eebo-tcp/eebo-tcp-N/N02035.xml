            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE Words are a very grave and ſolemn Charge, whereof we may conſider, 1. The <hi>matter</hi> of it; that they ſhou'd <hi>keep &amp; ſeek for all the Commandments of the Lord their God.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and obſervance of God's Commandments is the ſumm of God's Charge and Will left with his People.

            <p n="2">2. This Charge is deliver'd with much <hi>Solemnity. In the ſight of all Iſrael, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the audience of our God.</hi> What could be ſaid more ſolemn?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sayes the King, I charge you <hi>in the ſight of all Iſrael.</hi> As if they were all here preſent, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

            <p>How much more was it for them to conſider, 3. That it was <hi>in the audience of God Himſelf</hi> that they were now ſpoken to.

            <p n="1">1. Here is a great <hi>Argument, Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> referr'd unto. <hi>Now therefore</hi>; ſo begins my text. It refers to the preceeding diſcourſe of <hi>David</hi>'s: <hi>q. d.</hi> Since I have by the direction and favour of God, made ſuch proviſion for the building a Houſe to his Name and Worſhip, and ſince God has cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Solomon</hi> to build it, and promiſed to be with

The Houſe of God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Kingdom in the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> depended on it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Motive</hi> added in the cloſe of the Text: <hi>That ye may poſſeſs this good land, and leave it for an Inheritance for your Children after you, for ever.</hi> Before they were mov'd from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour &amp; Glory to the Name of GOD; here they are mov'd from their own and their Children's tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare. They were poſſeſs'd of a good land; they held it by the promiſe of GOD upon their Obedience to Him; they would deſire to keep the poſſeſſion they had of it, and that their Children ſhould inherit it after them; But then they muſt needs ſeek for and keep the Commandments of the Lord their God, if they would have a peaceable &amp; quiet poſſeſſion of their pleaſant land ſecured to them, or to their Children after them.</p>
            <p>THESE are the Arguments and Motives with which the duty required in the text is inforced.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now name ſome <hi>Doctrinal Obſervations.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> THAT the People of God in general, the Rulers of a people in particular, and every ſingle

            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> THAT as every Superior in the ſtate or in the Church, is under this Charge himſelf, ſo it is his duty to lay it upon all that are under him, and to leave it as his dying Charge with them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> THAT we ſhould every one of us ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, that it is in the ſight of all the Lord's people, the Congregation of the Lord, and in the Audience of our GOD, that we are under this Charge.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> THAT the Church, Kingdom and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of CHRIST among us, the Houſe of our GOD, depends on our religious ſeeking &amp; keeping of GOD's Commandments.</p>
            <p n="5">

            </p>
            <p>SO they are charged, and this is the Charge in our text. And here I ſhall ſay, 1 This is the Charge of the Lord our God. 2 We are all under it. 3. The Rulers of a People are ſo in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner.</p>

We have his Commandments in his <hi>Word.</hi> They are the Laws, Statutes, Teſtimonies, and Judgments of the Lord our God; and in ſhort <hi>His Covenant</hi> with his people. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets have han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed them down to us; and CHRIST (the Eternal Son of GOD, and Lord of all the Holy Prophets) has confirm'd &amp; ratify'd them. Moſes beſpeaks the Church for ever in the 4. <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Deut. Behold, I have taught you ſtatutes &amp; judgments, as the Lord my God commanded me: ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it: And what Nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes &amp; judgments ſo righteous, as all this Law which I ſet before you?</hi> Now, ſays the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE muſt religiouſly <hi>keep</hi> the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord our God. Laws are made, and Gods laws are written to us, to be obſerved &amp; kept. A Commandment implies Obedience. We muſt needs be <hi>ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The law is to rule &amp; govern us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To <hi>keep</hi> the Commandment is to do it; to obſerve &amp; obey it with our hearts and in our lives. We muſt keep it in our minds and hide it in our hearts, that we may not ſin againſt it, tranſgreſs and break it, in tho't word or deed. We muſt therefore keep our Souls diligently that we may keep God's word. The keeping it implies care, diligence, conſtancy &amp; pleaſure. Faith, fear, love, reverence, eſteem of the word, and deſire to ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE muſt keep <hi>all</hi> the Commandments. So the text requires. Our Obedience muſt be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. What body of Laws is there but Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is equally required to them all. What ſingle Law was ever given, but to be obeyed? The ſame Authority enacts one &amp; another of them. <hi>Every word of God is pure</hi>; all his Commands are holy, juſt &amp; good. He that breaks one law is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor, and liable to the Judgment. <hi>He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends in one point is guilty of all,</hi> Jam. 2.18. He might as well offend in another point: He offers indignity to the Power that made the whole law. Obedience in ſome things will not excuſe diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in others. Exod. 24.7. <hi>All that the Lord our God ſhall ſay to us, we will do and be obedient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IN order to this we muſt <hi>ſeek for them all.</hi> Keep and <hi>ſeek</hi> for all the Commandments of the Lord your God. We muſt be careful &amp; inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive to <hi>know</hi> the Commands, if ever we would keep them. We muſt ſeek the knowledge of them with deſire and care and pains. We need not ſeek <hi>jar</hi> for the Commands; which we have in our hands and before our eyes: Deut. 30.11, 12. <hi>This Commandment which I command thee this day is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off: but the word is very nigh to thee, in thy Mouth and in thy heart; that thou mayſt do it.</hi> Yet neither muſt we grudge

any <hi>pains</hi> or labour that is neceſſary unto our get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the knowledge of God's will. It is highly worth the moſt diligent &amp; laborious ſeeking. Prov. 2. beg. <hi>My ſon, incline thine ear to wiſdom, and apply thy heart to underſtanding; cry after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; lift up thy voice for underſtanding; ſeek her as ſilver &amp; ſearch for her as for hid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſo ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. We muſt therefore <hi>ſearch the Scriptures</hi> which are written for our learning. We muſt read therein daily; read it in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> read it in our <hi>Families.</hi> We muſt ſeek the law at the mouth of Gods <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whoſe lips muſt preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. It was the honour and bleſſing of <hi>Levi,</hi> and a Bleſſing to <hi>Iſrael</hi>; Deut. 33.10. <hi>He ſhall teach Jacob God's judgments, &amp; Iſrael his laws.</hi> We muſt be <hi>waiting daily at God's Gates,</hi> and at his <hi>doors.</hi> We muſt ſeek unto God by <hi>Prayer</hi> for his light &amp; his truth; that he would teach us his ſtatutes &amp; lead us into all truth; Pſal 119.34. <hi>Give me underſtanding and I ſhall keep thy law; yea, I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart.</hi> Thus we muſt <hi>ſeek for,</hi> if we would <hi>keep</hi> the Commandments of God.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>ALL the people</hi> of God together, and every <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> by himſelf, are under this charge of God. So is the text directed, and ſo are all the Commandments of the Holy Word.</p>

and <hi>Miniſters</hi> are yet under, according to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, made known unto all Nations for their Obedience.</p>
            <p>LET our <hi>Rulers</hi> therefore ſuffer the Word of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> and the Admonition from God to them, that <hi>They</hi> eminently among the People of God are under his Commandment and his Charge to <hi>ſeek for and keep his holy Commandments.</hi> And it is fit that they ſhould be ſo charged by God for his <hi>Glory,</hi> whoſe Miniſters and Servants they are, and for the <hi>Good</hi> of Mankind, whereunto they muſt Miniſter according to his Will. It is the peculiar Honour of God to command them, and to be obeyed by them, as alſo to judge and puniſh them; and it is a peculiar Honour to them to be Examples of Obedience to God. Pſalm. 97.7. <hi>Worſhip him all ye Gods.</hi> The <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> above do ſo, and how much more ſhould thoſe on Earth?

            </p>
            <p>BUT as a <hi>perſonal</hi> Subjection and Obedience to all the Commandments of God is the duty of <hi>Rulers,</hi> ſo are they obliged alſo, both in their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative,</hi> and alſo in their <hi>Executive</hi> capacity and truſt <hi>to ſeek for</hi> all the Commandments of the Lord; That they be all of them made <hi>known</hi> to the people under their care, and <hi>enjoyned</hi> on them, and that none be ſuffer'd in the Violation of any of them This is the Duty of their place, and they ſhould voluntarily but with Solemnity come under <hi>this Bond</hi> upon their Souls; as the Rulers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, Neh. 9. <hi>ult.

            <p>II. <hi>THAT as every Superior in the State or in the Church is under this Charge of God himſelf, ſo it is their duty to charge it upon all that are under them, yea &amp; to leave it with them as their dying charge.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>SO <hi>Parents</hi> and Governours of Familys ſhould charge their Children and houſhold after them to ſeek and keep the Commandments of God. So did <hi>Abraham</hi>; of whom God ſaid, <hi>I know him that he will command his Children &amp; his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> So did <hi>Joſhua</hi>; who declared before all <hi>Iſrael, As for me &amp; my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And the 101ſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſtands an everlaſting record of <hi>David</hi>'s Rule &amp; Government of his own houſe: <hi>I will walk in my houſe with a perfect heart; my eyes ſhall be upon the faithful of the Land that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a perfect way he ſhall ſerve me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſaid before, and have exhibited ſeveral illuſtrious Examples, how <hi>Rulers</hi> ſhould require and conſtrain their <hi>Subjects</hi> to keep the word of God.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>IN the ſight of all the Lord's people</hi> we are ſo bound, are ſo charged and have ſo promiſed.

            <p>O how <hi>awful</hi> ſhould this conſideration be to us? according to what we read, Pſal. 139. beg <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſearched me &amp; known me. Thou knoweſt my down ſitting, and my up-riſing; Thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt my thoughts afar off. Thou compaſſeſt my path &amp; my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a Word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether. Thou haſt beſet me behind &amp; before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is High &amp; I cannot attain unto it. Whither ſhall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither ſhall I flee from thy preſence? If I aſcend up into Heaven thou art there! if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there!</hi>—</p>
            <p>HOW awful ſhould it be to <hi>Magistrates,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that they are ſworn <hi>before</hi> &amp; <hi>by</hi> the great GOD! and that <hi>He ſtandeth in the Congregation of the mighty; be judgeth among the Gods</hi>; and that he <hi>will ariſe to judge the Earth, for he ſhall inherit all Nations,</hi> Pſal. 82.</p>

If we receive the witneſs of men, <hi>the witneſs of GOD is greater</hi>: So if the preſence of many witneſſes on earth is great, how much greater is the <hi>ſingle</hi> eye and notice of God? Joſh. 22.22. <hi>The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods He knoweth; and Iſrael he ſhall know.</hi> But how ſmall a thing is <hi>Iſraels</hi> knowledge, in compariſon of <hi>His</hi> who is Iſraels GOD?</p>
            <p>IF it were only a <hi>Stone</hi> that ſtood by, that has neither eye nor ear nor tongue, yet it were eno' in the preſence of GOD. As <hi>Joſhua</hi> took a <hi>great Stone</hi> and ſet it up by the Sanctuary of the Lord, and ſaid unto all the people, <hi>This ſtone ſhall be a witneſs to us; for it has heard all the words of the Lord which he hath ſpoken to us; it ſhall be for a witneſs unto you lest you deny your God.</hi> There needs no witneſs before <hi>Him</hi>; the very <hi>Stones</hi> ſhall be witneſſes and bear witneſs for him; if he pleaſe <hi>theſe ſhall cry out</hi>; and ſo ſhall theſe <hi>Walls</hi> and theſe <hi>Seats</hi>; and ſo ſhall the <hi>Council Board,</hi> the Seats of <hi>Legiſlation</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature,</hi> for they have heard all <hi>our</hi> Words to God, and <hi>his</hi> to us.</p>

            <p>I go on to the Fourth Obſervation:</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Now therefore,</hi> ſays my text; <hi>i. e.</hi> that the <hi>Temple</hi> of God may be built, and his <hi>Worſhip</hi> ſetled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Throne in the Houſe of David</hi> be continued among you; that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may have <hi>peace</hi> and that the <hi>Houſe of God</hi> may be more <hi>glorious</hi> than ever; that <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be bleſſed by its God both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> both in it's <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Intereſts; <hi>keep and ſeek for the Commandments of the Lord your God.</hi> There can be no <hi>Religion</hi> among a People, nor any <hi>Peace</hi> to them, without this. This matter <hi>firſt</hi> belongs to Miniſters and Magiſtrates, and <hi>then</hi> to all the people. As they ſaid to <hi>Ezra, We alſo will be with thee.</hi> Every Order, Rank &amp; Degree among a people muſt <hi>unite</hi> and agree, be <hi>one</hi> in this thing; every one acting in his place; and we all <hi>need</hi> one another in it.

Let not the Religion and Worſhip of God, his Kingdom and Intereſt fall thro us, or in our hands. All lies at ſtake, in our Religion. Wherefore let us riſe and act together, with a united force; as <hi>Joab</hi> ſaid bravely to the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a day of danger; <hi>when the Battle was againſt him before &amp; behind</hi>; 2 Sam. 10.12. <hi>Be of good Courage and let us play the men for our people, and for the Cities of our God.</hi> God calls us to beſtir our ſelves in our reſpective places, according to our different talents, powers, intereſts, to miniſter for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Glory; for the defence, for the reviving, for the propagating and perpetuating of Religion and his Worſhip among this People; and he ſays to us in our places, as <hi>David</hi> did to <hi>Solomon</hi> in his high ſtation, in the 10th and 20th Verſes of our <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>TRULY the Lord our God <hi>is with us if we are with him</hi>; as the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord once ſaid to <hi>Aſa</hi> and to all <hi>Judah.</hi> If he give us a heart and ſpirit to ſtand by his Truths and Wayes, his Cauſe and Intereſts among us, he will ſtand by us in the ſupport and defence of them; but if we

forſake him and theſe he will forſake us. So has he covenanted and threatned. Wherefore let us <hi>beg of Him</hi> above every thing, a united heart to fear his Name, to love his Ways, and to cleave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in them. Let us ſhow a zealous adherence to the <hi>Word</hi> and Worſhip of God. <hi>There</hi> we muſt ſeek for the Laws of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Ordinances of his Houſe. <hi>There</hi> our Fathers <hi>ſought</hi> them, and have left them to us to <hi>keep</hi>; have left us <hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony.</hi>
