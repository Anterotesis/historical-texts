            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The TRIAL of ALICE CLIFTON, FOR THE Murder Of her Baſtard-Child, At the Court of Oyer and Terminer and General Gaol Delivery, held at Philadelphia, on Wedneſday the 18th day of April, 1787.</head>
            <p>ALICE CLIFTON, late of the county of Philadelphia, ſlave of John Bartholomew, was indicted for the murder of her female child, on the 5th inſtant, which was born a baſtard; and that ſhe, with a certain razor, of the value of one ſhilling, did, in, upon, and acroſs the throat of the ſaid child, feloniouſly, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and of malice afore-thought, did penetrate, and cut, with the razor aforeſaid, one mortal wound, of the length of four inches, and of the depth of one inch; of which ſaid mortal wound, the ſaid female child then and there inſtantly did die.</p>
            <p>The Attorney-general managed the trial on behalf of the ſtate, and Meſſrs. Sergeant and Todd were employed for the priſoner. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing witneſſes appeared, and depoſed.</p>

               <head>John Leacock, Coroner, ſworn.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Court.</hi>—Well, Mr. Leacock, what do you know of this affair? I know very little more, than that while the inqueſt were examining the child, I diſcovered that its throat had been cut. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did you ſay any thing to her, or aſk her any queſtions? She was aſked, how ſhe come to kill her child? and anſwered, that it was in order to keep it from crying. I was informed by Mr. Bartholomew, that the body was diſcovered, under ſome cloaths, in a cheſt. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay, that ſhe was the mother? I did not aſk her. <hi>Court.</hi>—You ſay, that ſhe ſaid ſhe cut the child's throat to prevent its crying, when you diſcovered that it had been cut? It was not me who found it out; it was one of the jury, while they were examining it. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay ſhe cut its throat to prevent its crying, or for fear it ſhould cry? I am not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, but believe it was to keep it from crying: ſhe ſaid too, that ſhe had done it by the order or expreſs command of the father of the child. She was then aſked, who the father was? and ſhe mentioned his name. <hi>Court</hi>—Who did ſhe ſay was the father? She mentioned his
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020275_0002_0FAE9C6074E38530"/>
name. <hi>Court.</hi>—What name did ſhe mention? She ſaid it was John Shaffer. <hi>Court.</hi>—What elſe happened? That is all I know. What child was it, male or female? It was a female child. Did it appear to be a likely child? Yes. Was the hair and nails grown, and did it look as if it had come to its full time? The hair and nails were grown, but I did not examine it particularly, as I made no queſtion but it had gone the full time. Is the priſoner at the bar the ſame woman that you then ſaw? Yes. Did you aſk her if it was born-alive? Yes: ſhe was aſked ſeveral times, but always ſaid it was born dead. And was ſhe not then aſked, if it was born dead, what was her reaſon for cutting its throat, and ſhe anſwered it was to prevent its crying? I believe that queſtion was aſked, and ſhe might have anſwered ſo; but I could not hear, as there were a great number of people in the room, ſo that I was crouded up in a corner, as the room was but ſmall. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—If the room was ſo ſmall you could hear the better, I ſhould think. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay whether the child cried or not? No: ſhe ſaid it was born dead. Was the child cold or warm, when you was there? I did not feel it. Did ſhe ſay ſhe cut its throat for fear it would cry? Yes, I think ſhe did. Did ſhe mention any arguments which the father had uſed to induce her to commit ſuch a crime? I know nothing further: Captain Bullfinch was there, and he heard what ſhe ſaid on that ſubject. Did you take any examination in writing, at the time? No. Well but you ſhould on ſuch important occaſion. I did not know it was neceſſary.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Court.</hi>—Are you the miſtreſs of that woman? Yes, Sir. <hi>Court.</hi>—Look, and ſee if it is the ſame. She is, Sir. When did you diſcover her to be with child? About five or ſix months ago. Did you charge her with it? Yes, Sir. Did ſhe own it? No: ſhe ſaid ſhe was not. Did you charge her more than once? Yes; but ſhe conſtantly denied it. What happened the morning that ſhe was delivered? I don't know, for I did not ſee her till twelve o'clock, when I went up to her, and ſhe complained of being unwell. Had ſhe not been up that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Yes: ſhe got up and made the fire in the parlour, and afterward ſhe went and laid down. What did you ſay to her, when you went up? I aſked her what was the matter? and ſhe ſaid ſhe was poorly. I told her that I ſuſpected ſhe was with child, but ſhe denied it. Well, what further? I then left her, Sir: I thought ſhe was in that ſituation, and ſeemed to ſuſpect ſhe was in labour. Was ſhe laying in the bed, or on the bed? She was lying under the clothes; in about an hour I went up again. What did you diſcover then? She ſeemed much the ſame: I aſked her the ſame queſtion, and ſhe told me again, that ſhe was not with child: I went down directly, and in about a quarter of an hour I went up again, and ſhe aſked me for ſome old cloaths to put on: ſhe told me that ſhe felt better. Where was ſhe when you came up? She was walking about the room: I told her I ſuſpected ſhe had a child, but ſhe denied it ſtill; but I ſearched about in the cloſet, and in the

chimney. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did ſhe appear diſturbed while you was ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? No: ſhe ſaid nothing. Where was the child found? My ſiſter-in-law found it in a trunk in another room. Did ſhe bring the child to the mother? Yes; ſhe brought it herſelf. Well, what more? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from the room. Did you ſee the child? I juſt caſt my eye on it. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did you ſee any wound upon it? No: I ſaw none. Well, what further? [Mr. Bartholomew ſaid they were all ſo affected, that they could not bear to remain in the room. Mrs. Bartholomew was alſo much indiſpoſed.] Did you diſcover any blood about the cloaths? No. <hi>Council.</hi>—When you ſaid ſhe aſked you for cloaths, did you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand cloaths for herſelf, or for the child? For herſelf. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> being council for the priſoner.—When ſhe aſked you for old cloaths, did ſhe not let you know that ſhe had a child? No, Sir. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Had ſhe ſufficient cloaths always before? Yes, Sir. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Pray, did you know of her having received any hurt, previous to her delivery? Yes; about a month. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—You'll pleaſe, Madam, to relate the circumſtances to the Court and Jury. About a month or ſo before, ſhe fell down the cellar-ſtairs, with a log of wood in her arms. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</hi>—Was ſhe much bruiſed by the accident? Yes, Sir, a good deal on her hip. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Do you know of any other hurt ſhe received? She was hurt a few days before. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did ſhe complain much of the bruiſe? Yes, Sir, ſhe complained for a week or two after. Did ſhe keep her bed? No, Sir. <hi>Todd,</hi> being alſo council for the priſoner.—Pray, Madam, where was the girl, when you went up to ſee her, about twelve o'clock?—Was ſhe in the garret or ſecond ſtory? She was lying on a bed, in a room on the ſecond ſtory. Is that the uſual room where ſhe ſleeps? No, Sir. Who ſleeps in that room? My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the boys of the ſhop. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Where was you about the time ſhe was delivered? We were eating dinner in the parlour. How far is that room from where the girl lay? The room was exactly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; we were in the room under her. <hi>Todd.</hi>—Is the ceiling of the room high or low? It is middling. Is it not one of thoſe old-faſhioned houſes, where the ceilings are built much lower than is common now? Yes, Sir. Were the doors open? Yes; the room-door was open. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did you hear the child cry? No: I heard no noiſe at all. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Don't you think you could have heard the child, had it cried? I believe I could. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Was ſhe ever in bed in that room before? No. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Where was the room in which the child was found? It was oppoſite to this, and on the ſame floor. Did you hear her when ſhe carried it there, and put it into the cheſt? No. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe appear very ill, when you firſt ſaw her? Yes; ſhe was very poorly. <hi>Todd.</hi>—This is the room, you ſay, where the boys uſually lodged? Yes. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did you know whether their razors were lying about? Yes; they were in the window: there were two razors laying there. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—How came ſhe to go into that room? After ſhe had made a fire in the morning, I ſuppoſe ſhe found herſelf unwell, and went in there to lay down: I know no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                  <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—You ſay it is about five or ſix months ago that you firſt ſuſpected her to be with child: pray, from what ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms was it that you ſuſpected? From her appearance. Was there no particular ſymptom, or ſomething in her conduct, which led you to ſuſpect? Nothing but her being a little ſick, and from appearance. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—What, ſick at her ſtomach? Yes. <hi>Attorney-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>—Did you employ a Doctor for her, when ſhe fell down ſtairs? No: ſhe was not confined. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—She went about as uſual, and did middling well? She kept up and went about all the time, but ſtill complained. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—And how has ſhe been ſince ſhe was delivered, pretty hearty? I don't know; ſhe went from our houſe ſhortly after. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—At the time you firſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected her being with child, you ſaid you founded your opinion upon her appearance; do you mean by that, that you diſcovered it by her bulk? Yes. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Her bulk, Madam, was not the firſt cauſe of your ſuſpicion, but her ſickneſs, and afterward her bulk? Yes, Sir. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Can you ſet the time, when you firſt obſerved this? Not exactly. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—When you perceived her ſickneſs, did you not alſo obſerve her increaſe of bulk? No; not then.</p>

                  <hi>Court.</hi>—You found the child? Yes, Sir. Where? In a trunk in the room oppoſite to where ſhe was: it was wrapped up in a petticoat belonging to her. How did the child get in the trunk? I ſuppoſe ſhe muſt have carried it there herſelf: when I was ſearching about in the trunk, I aſked her what was in the petticoat? when I laid my hand upon it; but ſhe ſaid nothing. Was the petticoat at the top of the trunk? No; it was under a large roll of linen. Did ſhe ſay any thing, when you aſked her what was in the petticoat? No. Whether did ſhe deſire you to open the petticoat or not? No: ſhe opened it herſelf, and laid it upon the bed aſide of her: I aſked her if ſhe had killed the child? and ſhe ſaid, Yes: I aſked her how? and ſhe ſaid ſhe had laid on it, but could not help it. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did you diſcover any marks of violence upon the body? No. You ſaw the child? Yes: ſhe opened the petticoat, and laid the child with it on the bed, and ſat by its ſide. Did nothing further happen? The Jury was ſent for, and came in, and I retired from the room. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Did it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a fine, plump child? I am not a judge: I can't ſay any thing of it. <hi>Todd.</hi>—Can you recollect the time the child was brought out of the trunk? It was about two o'clock. <hi>Todd.</hi>—After you diſcovered the child, was not ſhe left alone with it? Yes: I went down to ſpeak to my ſiſter. What length of time was you abſent? I believe about ten minutes. <hi>Court.</hi>—When you put your hand upon it in the trunk, did it feel warm? <hi>Council.</hi>—If your Honor pleaſes, ſhe ſays it was wrapt up in a petticoat. Well, did you feel it warm through the petticoat? Yes, Sir, I believe it was. She took the child in the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticoat into the other room? I believe ſhe did. How long did you ſtay with her? About ten minutes. <hi>Todd.</hi>—And then went down for ten

minutes? Yes. Did you ſee any blood about the child? (After ſome heſitation) No: none. I mean about the throat? I did not examine. Did you think it was dead, when it lay on the bed? Yes. <hi>Court.</hi>—Had it hair and nails perfect? I can't ſay: I believe it had nails. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</hi>—Pray, Ma'am, do you know any thing of a hurt ſhe received? Yes: ſhe received a hurt in fetching up a log of wood about two months before. <hi>Council.</hi>—Was it one or two? I can't tell exactly. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—She went about tho' as uſual?

               <p>When I went up into the room, I found her ſitting on the floor, with the child leaning over her arm; ſhe kept its head cloſe down on its breaſt. The Inqueſt aſked her, if ſhe had uſed no violence to the child? and ſhe ſaid, No. It was the firſt time ſhe had ever had a child, and ſhe believed ſhe had overlaid it. At this time there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no marks of violence, or they were not diſcovered. Mr. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glee,</hi> or <hi>Norgrove,</hi> (we don't know which he named) was the firſt, who, on examining the child, diſcovered that the throat was cut.

She was aſked, where the razor was? and I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that one Bryan O'Connor, and ſome other, had been there, and taken it away. However, the razor was produced, and ſhe was aſked, if that was the razor? She ſaid, Yes. We aſked her, how ſhe came to cut its throat? and ſhe ſaid, for fear it ſhould cry, and the family would hear it. I obſerved to her, that if the child was born dead, as ſhe ſaid it was, that there was no occaſion to cut its throat. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did the child appear bloody? No; it appeared as if it had been waſhed. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay the child was born dead? Yes: ſhe perſiſted in it, that it was born dead; that is, that ſhe overlaid it. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Had it the appearance of having come to maturity? Why, I thought it appeared plump and hearty. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Do you recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whether ſhe ſaid any thing further? Yes; ſhe ſaid ſhe was told to do it. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay by whom? Yes. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe mention any promiſes that had been made her? She ſaid ſome were made. What were they? She ſaid that he promiſed her, if ſhe made away with the child, ſhe ſhould have her time purchaſed, and he would ſet her at liberty. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay ſhe was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for? Yes: ſhe was to have fine cloaths, and to live like a lady. <hi>Jury.</hi>—Whoſe name did ſhe mention as the father who had promiſed this? John Shaffer, and ſaid it was him who had deſired her to cut the child's throat, or make away with it.</p>

               <p>What I have to declare in the preſent caſe, is merely matter of opinion founded on obſervation, and what my profeſſion teaches me to decide. I ſaw the mother a few minutes after the Inqueſt had been held, and ſhe informed me it was born dead. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—You are not to relate what ſhe ſaid afterward, as that cannot be received as
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020275_0006_0FAE9C65CA37FB68"/>
evidence. Well then, Sir, from the ſize and appearance of the child, I ſaw enough to convince me that it was not born alive: it is true its throat was cut, and it had been taken away from the mother, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in ſpirits by Dr. Foulke. <hi>Attorney-gen.</hi>—Doctor, pray when did you ſee the child firſt? The day after the Inqueſt. <hi>Attorney-gen.</hi>—If that is the caſe, it can have little to do with the ſubject. Why, Sir, an opinion is as well to be formed from the ſize of the child then, as at the firſt minute—And I am convinced it was not a full grown child; for it was too ſmall, and there was little hair on its head, not near ſo much as when an infant has come to its full time of birth. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But is not the mother a very little woman? No: ſhe is not very little; ſhe is about the middling ſize. She is very young tho'? (Her age, Mr. Milne who brought her up, ſaid, was ſeventeen, wanting two months.) <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Is this a ſubject on which you can form an opinion perfectly ſatisfactory to yourſelf? Yes, Sir; and of which I have no doubt. Was the windpipe cut through from ſide to ſide? Yes, it was, and the other large veſſels were ſeparated; and it muſt have killed the child, had it been alive at the time; but I am of opinion it was dead, and born dead from the accident which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to its mother, and from the ſize and appearance of the child. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Can you, from appearances or ſuch circumſtances, determine whether the child was born dead or alive? Yes: I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine for myſelf, and am perfectly ſatisfied of the concluſion. This child had not the appearance of a full grown child; it was of too ſmall a ſize, and had not the uſual quantity of hair on its head, and the inferior limbs were much too ſmall, if compared with the nobler. How long may the infant remain in the womb after it is dead? I have known inſtances of their being retained a long time. Could it be a month? Yes; more than a month or ſix weeks either. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Suppoſe, Doctor, a child to be born dead, would it bleed on cutting its throat? Yes; and many perſons do bleed after they are dead, on opening a ſmall vein only. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But, Doctor, not after having lain ſo long as a month or ſix weeks in the womb? No; I don't ſay that: much depends on the habit of body, and there are various conſtitutions. This child does not appear to be within two months at leaſt of its full time. <hi>Court.</hi>—But did you never ſee a ſeven months child make a good man? I don't ſay ſo: there are certainly ſuch, but they are to be found very ſeldom. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Can you judge better from the comparative ſize of the limbs than from the length of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant? <hi>Court.</hi>—Did the child appear to have fallen away much, when you ſaw it? No. What was the cauſe of its premature birth? The mother told me, that ſhe had received a very ſevere fall in lifting a log. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—You muſt not repeat what ſhe told you. Well but, Sir, it was confirmed to me by the teſtimony of her maſter; and ſoon after ſhe ſaid ſhe was ſeized with the pains of labour. <hi>Attorney-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi>—Did this converſation happen on the ſame day ſhe was delivered? It did? <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But we have nothing of this ſecond hurt in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020275_0007_0FAE9C674A072768"/>
teſtimony. If you have not, I ſuppoſe you will; for I underſtood ſhe had received two falls, and the Jury will be ſatisfied in this point, when they come to hear her maſter; and I underſtood ſhe had a fall, or ſevere ſtrain, the very morning of her delivery.</p>

               <head>Doctor Foulke affirmed.</head>
               <p>I was called upon by the Coroner and the Inqueſt, to examine the dead body of a child ſuppoſed to have been murdered. Before I got there, ſeveral perſons on the inqueſt had examined and found the throat cut. The murder of the child was no longer with me a queſtion, at leaſt ſo far as the efforts of the mother had been able to effect it; and I left the Coroner and Jury to do their duty in an affair which appeared ſo clear and plain. But after they had left the room, I returned to examine the mother, and to explain to her, her dangerous ſituation; but I was induced to doubt the validity of my firſt opinion, when ſhe informed me with reſpect to the time of conception, the time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the circumſtances which prematurely brought on the birth of the child, and from the appearance of the child afterward; from all of which conſiderations I believe myſelf abſolutely juſtifiable in declaring that the child muſt have been born dead: the delicacy neceſſary to be obſerved, will make me ſay as little as is poſſible on this occaſion. With regard to the time of conception, it muſt have been about the latter end of the month of September. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—How do you know that? The girl told me ſo. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But you are not to repeat what ſhe told you. Then, from the appearance of the child, I believe it to be only a ſix or ſeven months conception, which brings it to about that time. I keep the child for the purpoſe of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining it fully, and of ſhewing it to Doctor Jones: the Honorable Court, and the Jury may ſee it alſo if the Court pleaſes; and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to it, they will be able to judge for themſelves in ſome degree from its ſize. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Does it not leſſen by being kept in ſpirits? It does not grow bigger. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But does it not leſſen? Yes, ſomething. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Does it much or little? But little: when Doctor Jones ſaw it, it had not leſſened, for I was obliged to extract it with forceps from the jar in which I put it. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</hi>—From all the circumſtances you have mentioned, do you ſay you are juſtifiable in concluding that it was born dead? I do. Pray, when was you called in? About two hours after the child was born. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—But you then was not of opinion, that it was born dead? Whent I went, and ſaw, and heard that ſhe had cut the child's throat, I formed my opinion on that circumſtance only, and I believe the Inqueſt did the ſame without enquiring whether it was likely to have been born dead or not. <hi>Court.</hi>—You ſay from its ſize, that it was not a full grown child; are not ſome children ſmaller than others? Clearly, Sir, this is not a child that ought to be produced by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after nine months geſtation. <hi>Court.</hi>—Do not children live who are born at ſeven months? Children have lived who were born at ſix months; but ſuch examples are very rare, and ſeldom happen, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020275_0008_0FAE9C67F2EADDC8"/>
cannot affect the preſent queſtion: they are like monſters—I don't mean that they are deformed, but they are not perfect, and are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things, rarely to be met with, not one in a hundred.—I have compared this child with ſeveral others which I have preſerved, (as I have them of almoſt every period of conception) and I find that it is not the child by two or three months, which ought to be releaſed after nine months geſtation. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Do you believe a dead child might bleed on having its throat cut? I do: the blood of children is much finer and more fluid than that of men. Such are the diſpoſitions of nature, in accommodating the cauſe to the effect; the blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants circulate through innumerable ſubtile canals, which a more groſs fluid would obſtruct: but it is not only the throat of a child that would bleed on being cut after it was dead, but alſo of a man, or indeed of any animal. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—Did you diſcover any blood about the child, when you firſt ſaw it? I did a little, not more than is cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary; for it is well known that more or leſs is always diſcharged by the mother on theſe occaſions—This is a ſubject that delicacy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect makes it difficult to ſpeak of—but the Honorable Court will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me. <hi>Court.</hi>—It is neceſſary to be explicit, and relate things as they are, ſo that you ſtand in need of no excuſe. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay the child was born dead? Yes. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—You are not to ſay any thing ſhe ſaid, after the Inqueſt had ſat. I believe the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have related that they heard her ſay ſo. The reaſon why I did not, was, the woman was then in ſuch a ſituation of body and mind, that humanity and every generous feeling for an unhappy creature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to add to her pain and care, and therefore made it expedient to leave the room: but afterward when the poignancy of her diſtreſs might be alleviated, I called and attended to her narration, which I am not, you ſay, to relate. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did ſhe appear very feeble? She was ſetting up, but then it was neceſſary ſhe ſhould, as the room was much crouded, and the people preſſing about her. When I had heard her relate the particulars of her ſituation, I went home, and made notes of it, from which I could explain my ſeveral reaſons for concluding, that the child could not be born alive. [Mr. Bullfinch was called, and aſked if ſhe ſaid it was born dead? He anſwered, Yes; and that ſhe had lifted up the lid of its eye, but it fell down again—This ſhe ſaid before it was diſcovered that the throat was cut.] <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant.</hi>—Did you obſerve, Doctor, that the limbs of the child were not proportioned? Yes: the hands, arms, legs, and other inferior limbs, were too ſmall when compared with the others. There are too, many circumſtances of evidence, which would confirm the juſtneſs of the concluſion drawn by Doctor Jones and myſelf, with reſpect to the child's having been born dead: there are alſo other matters which I could mention, but from the delicacy and tenderneſs with which it is requiſite to ſpeak on this ſubject. <hi>Court.</hi>—Our great object is inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and nothing ſhould prevent our obtaining the fulleſt. Well, then, as this woman was delivered alone of a feeble and imperfect child,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020275_0009_0FAE9C68CB42E770"/>
and as ſhe informs me, ſhe lay upon her back at the time of its birth, then had the child been alive, but come in the common or ordinary way into the world. You know that it is neceſſary that its eyes, its noſe and mouth, in ſhort its face, muſt have been towards the poſterior parts of the mother, and in this ſituation of releaſe—it is more than probable that the child might have been ſmothered in the birth; nay, it is a certainty, that it muſt have been ſmothered from the want of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to extricate it, and from its long continuance in that ſituation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Court.</hi>—Did ſhe ſeem to be affected for the loſs of her child? She ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me to have loſt herſelf much; ſhe ſtroaked it, and looked at it, but I thought not with that maternal tenderneſs, which ſhe ſhould have diſcovered on ſuch an occaſion: ſhe ſhed no tears for her loſs; not that I eſteem the ſhedding tears an eſſential to conſtitute tenderneſs. She began to appear ſorry, when I was about to take the infant from her. <hi>Court.</hi>—Did ſhe ſay why ſhe cut its throat? Yes: ſhe ſaid that John Shaffer, the fat Shaffer, was the father of it, and he had perſuaded her to kill it; if ſhe did, he would purchaſe her freedom, and that he was to marry a fine woman, and that he would make her then as happy and as fine as his wife, and that if ſhe did not do it, ſhe ſhould ſuffer immenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—but if ſhe did, ſhe had nothing to fear, for there was no heaven or hell, no God or devil that he knew better than any body elſe, as he poſſeſſed more learning than any other man, and had travelled in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; and to encourage her, he ſaid that it was no harm, and he had perſuaded a milk-girl to do the like once before. I examined her to know the time of her conception, and ſhe told me that it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after her maſter went to live in Church-alley. She remembered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was ſometime in the latter end of September, when ſhe firſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched by him on their lot, and that ſhe ſoon diſcovered her ſituation; that ſhe went on as women uſually do, until about three weeks before her delivery, when ſhe was helping in with a cord of wood, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a conſiderable injury by the fall of a log upon her hip; that two or three days before ſhe was delivered, ſhe unfortunately met with a fall down ſtairs, when her maſter ſaw her; that ſhe found herſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed in the morning, and ſtrained herſelf in getting up a large back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log, which immediately haſtened on the labour-pains, and an abortion came on about two o'clock; that ſhe was in great agony until then, and ſhe after that laid quiet half an hour, when ſhe took it up in her arms, and lifted its right eye-lid, but which fell down inſtantly: ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſpecting that it might be dead, and recollecting the promiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward offered by Shaffer, and her promiſe to him, and fearing that it might cry and alarm the family, ſhe took up a razor laying by accident in the window by the bed-ſide, and cut its throat through, and cut even the very bone; but the blood that diſcharged, was very ſmall, and there muſt have been ſome miſtake about its being waſhed—for when I ſaw it, it was as is uſual with children after their birth; but perhaps the rags, or things it had been wrapped up in, might have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed ſome, and given the appearance of wiping or waſhing. She
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020275_0010_0FAE9C6B0A5E9E08"/>
ſaid ſhe laid ſtill half an hour after the birth; if ſo, there can be no doubt but it was dead, and ſhe declared that it neither breathed or or cried. <hi>Court.</hi>—You ſay you have the child yet; how is it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved? In a glaſs jar, and I'll ſend it, if you pleaſe, to the Jury. Can't it be brought to Court? Yes, Sir. <hi>Todd.</hi>—If your Honors pleaſe, it can be ſent to the jury-room. <hi>Court.</hi>—If we pleaſe to ſee, why may we not? Well, Sir, I will ſend it.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the child was brought into Court, in a large glaſs jar, and Doctor Foulke had ſent with it a pair of forceps to extract it, if it ſhould be deemed neceſſary.</p>

               <p>I went up ſtairs and found the girl ſetting up, and the Jury were there; I was on the Inqueſt alſo. When I ſaw the child was dead, I aſked her if ſhe knew who was the father? She anſwered, Yes. And aſked her what his name was? She told me John Shaffer. I told her that ſhe ſhould be careful in what ſhe ſaid, and not charge any body unleſs ſhe was certain of them. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did you aſk her how ſhe was delivered? Yes; and ſhe ſaid ſhe was delivered upon her back. I aſked her if ſhe heard the child cry? and ſhe ſaid No. I aſked her if ſhe had told her maſter, that ſhe was with child? and ſhe told me No. I ſaid ſhe ought, and not have concealed it. I left her a little while, when I returned, and examined the child, but could diſcover no marks of violence upon it, until I happened to lift up its head, and then I perceived its throat was cut from here to here, [making a motion with his hand acroſs his throat.] I then told her, that ſhe had murdered the child, and deſerved to be puniſhed. I aſked her how ſhe did it? and ſhe confeſſed ſhe did it with a razor. I aſked her where it was? and was informed that one O'Bryan, or O'Conner, or ſome ſuch name, had taken it away; but the razor was got, and I looked at it, and ſaw it had been wiped, but ſtill there was ſome little blood left on the point. I aſked her how ſhe came to deſtroy the child in that cruel manner? and ſhe ſaid that ſhe was directed by the father, and told to pinch its throat, which would effectually deſtroy it. She told me, that he was concerned with her in Church-alley. I aſked her when ſhe had ſeen him laſt? She ſaid ſhe had not ſeen him lately. I aſked her if ſhe had ſeen him ſince he was concerned with her in the alley? and ſhe ſaid ſhe had ſeveral times, but not lately; ſhe believed he was not in town. I aſked her particularly what Shaffer it was? and ſhe told me the one that married Chavilier's daughter. <hi>Sergeant.</hi>—Did you aſk her if the child was born dead? No: ſhe ſaid it was dead, and I aſked her why ſhe cut its throat when it was dead? It ſeemed as if nature had helped the birth, for it came very plain. What do you mean by its coming very plain, that it was come to its full time? I believe it was very near about that. Did ſhe ſay ſhe was delivered on her back? Yes; but I know it could not be ſo, and I told Doctor Jones, that it could not be born in that way without help. <hi>Attorney-general.</hi>—And what did Doctor Jones ſay? He could not ſay much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

Yes; ſomewhere about a month before ſhe was delivered, it could not be a week under or over, ſhe fell down with a ſtick of wood in my hearing, and when I went to ſee what was the matter, ſhe was ſitting crying, and complained ſhe was hurt much.

               <p>Whereupon Mr. Bartholomew went to fetch it; but before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the Council had gone through much of their pleadings, and he was only examined touching the time; when it appeared he had went into Church-alley the 2d of Auguſt, and left it the beginning of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</p>
               <p>The Council and Attorney-general having finiſhed their pleadings, his Honor the Chief Juſtice gave a charge to the Jury.</p>
               <p>Murder, Gentlemen, is the higheſt and moſt heinous crime againſt the law of nature, and it is greatly aggravated when the parent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys its own offspring; but it is denied that the child was murdered by its mother, becauſe it was already dead: yet you find ſo far as her efforts could effect its deſtruction, ſhe exerted them unpitying, and void of maternal affection.</p>
               <p>This caſe, which has been ably diſcuſſed, was heretofore deſcribed by the laws in this manner—That whenever a ſingle or unmarried woman was delivered of a child, and attempted to conceal it, the bare concealment was made concluſive evidence againſt the mother, that ſhe murdered it, unleſs ſhe could make it appear by one evidence at leaſt, that the child ſo concealed was born dead: ſo that when this probable proof was in evidence, it was incumbent on the priſoner to prove poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that the child was born dead, or did not die through her means or procurement; otherwiſe ſhe was adjudged guilty, and ſuffered the penalty affixed to murder. This act of James—was recognized by the Aſſembly of the State; and had the priſoner been tried under that, there could not be the leaſt doubt but your verdict would determine her guilty. But now, by a late act of Aſſembly, paſſed laſt Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a further kind of proof is required, and the bare concealment is not ſufficient, unleſs there is a probable preſumption offered, that the child was born alive. You have heard this kind of proof already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained—That there are two kinds of evidence. The firſt is poſitive proof, where the witneſs can ſwear to the commiſſion of the fact: this ſometimes is attainable, yet but ſeldom in caſes like the preſent. The ſecond diviſion is circumſtantial proof—This you have heard divided into three kinds. Firſt, Violent preſumption, which is the ſtronger kind, and ſuch as amounts to nearly full conviction, or of which the mind can enntertain no doubt. As in a caſe, where you ſee a man greatly confuſed, endeavouring to make his eſcape out of a houſe, with his naked ſword bloody in his hand, and a body lying on the floor newly ſlain—This I ſay amounts to a violent preſumption that the man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to eſcape, is the ſlayer. Second, There is probable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, which is not ſo concluſive, or ſatisfactory as the former. And thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is ſlight preſumption, but which, in capital caſes, is ſeldom allowed, if by itſelf, any weight in criminating the priſoner, or much regarded by the Court or Jury. Beſide the caſe I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020275_0013_0FAE9C6D3042A8F8"/>
you have heard others adduced by the Council; but among the reſt there is this kind of evidence—the confeſſion of the party upon being apprehended, and this, when other circumſtances are ſtrong in its ſupport, amounts to as full a conviction; I ſay it is ſo ſtrong that no doubt can be had of the criminality, or heſitation left upon the mind, than would had you heard a witneſs come forward, and have ſworn that he ſaw the perpetration. The evidence, I ſay, would be ſtrong and concluſive in the inſtance which was mentioned by the Council, where a man ſhould be robbed of twenty guineas, and that exact ſum be found upon a man with two piſtols, the one loaded the other diſcharged—This, I ſay, would leave no doubt on your minds with reſpect to the criminal. But this is not the circumſtantial proof required in this caſe. The law would not require this kind, becauſe it is not to be had; for people determined upon the commiſſion of the crime of infanticide, always are ſilent and alone for the purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, as they would hardly be ſo callous or fool-hardened, as to commit it in public—Therefore poſitive proof can rarely be come at in ſuch caſes. The concealment of the child, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, was deemed ſufficient evidence of its being murdered, though the Courts and Juries in England and here, for this many years, have always required ſome circumſtantial evidence beſide, or they acquitted the priſoners; and this law has long been deemed to ſavour of ſeverity. Therefore the Legiſlature have altered the law in this reſpect, ſo as to make it correſpond with the already eſtabliſhed practice of their Courts of Juſtice, and have required the ſecond degree of circumſtantial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to convict the priſoner.</p>
               <p>It was obſerved by the Attorney-general, that her perſiſting in the denial of her being with child, even when ſhe was in labour, and her having made not the leaſt proviſion of cloaths for the infant, and as ſhe choſe to be delivered alone, when ſhe might have had the aſſiſtance of her miſtreſs and other women who were by—Theſe, with the further circumſtance of her cutting its throat, (and as you are informed by one of the witneſſes, from ear to ear) with her endeavour to conceal it, by placing it wrapped up under a large roll of linen in a trunk—I ſay, if when you take and weigh all the circumſtances together, you are of opinion, that it amounts to a probable preſumption that the child was born alive, you can be at no loſs to decide that ſhe was guilty in the manner and form in which ſhe ſtands indicted; and as it is incumbent, as I obſerved before, upon her to prove it was born dead, you will examine what teſtimony relates to this particular. There is her own relation of the ſtory; ſhe ſeveral times ſaid it was born dead, but then added alſo that ſhe had overlaid it, and on the Inqueſt's finding the throat cut, ſhe owned having done that, but it was to prevent its crying. Again, there is the depoſition of the Doctors, who, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional men, and as gentlemen eminent in their profeſſion, declare, that they are convinced the child was born dead from the circumſtances of its appearance, and from a conſideration of the hurts which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020275_0014_0FAE9C6DFB0A3E18"/>
had received, the one about a month before, another three days before, and a ſtrain the very morning of the day ſhe was delivered, as well as the circumſtance of her being delivered on her back. I ſay, if you are ſatisfied that the child was killed by any of theſe accidents, then you muſt acquit, as the cutting of the infant's throat, already dead, cannot be accounted murder in the mother. It is for you, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to weigh and conſider the matter of fact; but I would obſerve to you, that when you are ſworn to give a true verdict from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which ſhall be laid before you, you are not bound to give that verdict upon the opinion or judgment of any man however eminent.</p>
               <p>The Jury, after an abſence of about three hours, returned, and brought in their verdict guilty.</p>
               <p>On the morning of Saturday, when ſhe was brought up to receive ſentence of death, a motion was made by Mr. Todd, and ſupported by Mr. Sergeant, that the Court would be pleaſed to grant a new trial, as an affidavit was produced, in which Mr. Edward Pole, one of the Jurors, had ſaid the day preceding the trial, that he did not ſee how any perſon could bring in a verdict otherwiſe than guilty, (or words of like import.) This it was contended, would have been good cauſe of challenge, had it been known at the time; and if cauſe of challenge then, it ſhould be allowed of weight now. Some law-caſes were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, wherein new trials had been granted for ſimilar reaſons. The Attorney-general contended it ought not to be allowed for three reaſons: the firſt was, that no new trial was ever permitted in capital caſes like the preſent: 2d. That a perſon's giving his opinion, was not cauſe of challenge; ſo that if not cauſe of challenge, no pretence could be ſet up for a new trial: and 3d. If it had been cauſe of challenge <hi>then,</hi> it was <hi>now</hi> too late. This was replied to by Mr. Sergeant, and the point conceded, that tho' no new trial had yet been had in capital caſes, yet the Court had <hi>power</hi> to grant one, if it ſaw good cauſe. To the ſecond point he replied, it was cauſe of challenge, and no doubt could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the breaſt of the Court and Jury, but what if it had been known in time, they would have challenged him; if not for cauſe, they would without cauſe, (as every perſon has a right to challenge twenty of the 48 Jurors peremptorily, and as many more as he can ſhow cauſe for.) Of the third point he obſerved, that as the Court had the <hi>power</hi> to allow a new trial, it could not be too late.</p>
               <p>The Court gave it as their opinion, that the expreſſions uſed by Mr. Edward Pole were not ſufficient cauſe for the court to grant a new trial, and the girl then received ſentence of DEATH; but ſince has been reſpired by the Honorable Supreme Executive Council.</p>

               <p>About the middle of November my houſe was broke open, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entered, by opening the padlock of the cellar-door with a falſe key. The goods mentioned in the indictment were taken away; ſome of which were got again, as next morning I got a ſearch-warrant; and on ſearching a cellar in the neighbourhood, we found them. A man was in the cellar at the time, who ſeemed anxious to get away; but whether it was the priſoner or not, I cannot poſitively ſay. After we were ſearching about ſometime, O'Neil came down, and as ſoon as he ſaw we had diſcovered the goods, he ran away: I followed him with a great number of others; and when we returned, I found that this man had alſo gone off, but I cannot ſwear to the perſon.</p>

               <p>I went with Mr. Burns to Coleman's cellar, and there we found this man: I am ſure of the fellow, I know him well enough ſure—they call him Jem Long Splice, <hi>Elias</hi> Long Jem. When we came in, we looked about for the cloaths; up the chimney there was a hole, which came down again, and I went to examine it—But Mr. Burns thought it not worth while; he ſaid it was not his firſt loſs, for he had been robbed twice before; but I did not care, I would do my duty: ſo I hunted about, and I went toward a tub that was turned over, and this Jem—aye I know you well enough—this fellow—your Honor—was ſtanding with his back againſt them. After finding them this ſame jockey wanted to be off—but I would not let him out of the cellar. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did not this <hi>Elias,</hi> or Long Jem, go out of the cellar? Yes, your Honor, Yes—but that was afterwards, when we went to purſue O'Neil. <hi>Council.</hi>—Did not you intend to ſeize this man, before you diſcovered any part of the property? Yes; for I knew he was a great rogue as any from Ireland. This O'Neil, when he came in, ſhook hands with him, and run away as ſoon as he diſcovered we had found the goods. I ſeized this one by the collar, and told him not to ſtir; but he did not heed me, and ſprung up the cellar-ſteps, I believe he touched nothing, for he can run as faſt as any man I ever ſaw. <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</hi>—
