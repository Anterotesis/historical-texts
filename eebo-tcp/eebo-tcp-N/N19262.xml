            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MALIGNANT FEVER, Lately prevalent in Philadelphia.</head>
            <p>AT the period when the Malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made its appearance in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, the City, by a ſeries of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity in commerce, had grown to a ſtate of opulence not often recorded in the hiſtoric page. Her inhabitants indulged themſelves in all the gratifications of luxury and diſſipation, to be procured in this Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern hemiſphere. Her ſtreets were crouded by the gay carriages of pleaſure, going and returning in every direction; new and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant buildings were ſeen riſing in every quarter; and her port was thronged with ſhipping from every trading country in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and both the Indies: like Tyre of old
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025075_0004_0FCE4B36212FDD68"/>
               <q>her merchants were princes, and her traffickers were the honourable of the earth.</q> This uncommon ſlow of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity had its too common effect. The ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens too generally had forgotten the Fountain from whom all their bleſſings flowed; and impiouſly ſaid or ſeemed to ſay <q>by thy great wiſdom and by thy traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic, haſt thou encreaſed thy riches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By the unfortunate diviſions in St. Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, one of the French Iſlands, many of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, to avoid the fire and ſword of their ſtronger antagoniſts, had fled from their homes, and, about the time the contagion took place in Philadelphia, a large number of them ſought refuge among us. Before they had left their own burning and bloody ſhores their hearts had been appalled by ſcenes of the moſt atrocious cruelty, and by the ſight of numerous bodies of the ſlain which had remained unburied for many days: ſo that the air muſt have become too polluted for healthful reſpiration, had they been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtay. Many of theſe unfortunate refugees came in veſſels exceedingly croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as well as poorly provided with the means neceſſary to preſerve health: had they even
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025075_0005_0FCE4B656B266AD0"/>
left their homes in a ſtate of ſoundneſs: ſome of courſe arrived ſickly.</p>
            <p>About this time, likewiſe, the licenſed plunderers of the Ocean, belonging to the ſame nation, brought in their prizes for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and ſale. One of theſe freeboot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, belonging to Marſeilles in France, (the hot bed of peſtilential diſeaſe) after a leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy circuitous cruize, came into our port, and brought with her the Flora, a prize ſhip, both in a ſickly condition. HERE the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have generally agreed to fix the origin of the late dreadful viſitation. And in this opinion they have been confirmed by the report of two accurate obſervers, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who had viſited the ſick in the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, and every ſucceeding ſtage of the diſeaſe. <q>From all the evidence we have been able to collect,</q> ſay they, "the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order made it; firſt appearance in water ſtreet, at Richard Denny's lodging houſe, who kept an ordinary frequented by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Frenchmen who had lately arrived in ſome of the ſuſpected veſſels."</p>
            <p>"Mrs. Parkinſon, who lodged at Mr. Denny's, took the diſeaſe on the third and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſeventh of Auguſt, two French
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025075_0006_0FCE4B38A246E318"/>
lads had taken lodgings at Denny's, a few days before the death of Mrs, Parkinſon, one of whom was ſoon after taken ill and died. Immediately after his death, Mr. Denny's daughter ſays the other one took lodgings higher up the ſtreet, and died ſoon after. Mr. and Mrs. Denny, and two of their next door neighbours, alſo died of the ſame fever, about two weeks after the French lads. Among the next ſucceeding victims were Mrs. Lamaigre and Mr. Miller in the fame neighbourhood, and almoſt every caſe which occurred for the firſt two weeks could be traced to the ſame ſource."</p>
            <p>"From a comparative view of all the preceding circumſtances—from the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of the diſeaſe, and from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of its leading ſymptoms to thoſe of the yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, there can be no doubt that the contagion, which gave riſe to the diſeaſe here, was imported. And from its occurring in that part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtreet, in a few days after the Amelia, Sans Culottes, and Flora arrived, there is the ſtrongeſt preſumption, a preſumption amounting almoſt to a certainty, that it was introduced and cummunicated by ſome of the crew or paſſengers, belonging to one or other of the ſaid veſſels."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:025075_0007_0FCE4B66DC6C90C8"/>
"That the fever originated from the rotten coffee, as has been ſuggeſted, is altogether chimerical."</p>
            <p>"That the dry and warm ſtate of our atmoſphere had no ſhare in the generation of the diſeaſe is reduced to a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from the diſeaſe being at firſt confined to a few particular perſons, and in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of water ſtreet near to the ſuſpected veſſels; from its being communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thoſe to others, and ſo on, in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion."</p>
            <p>Such hath been the report of Doctors Currie and Cathrall, men of extenſive ſkill and obſervation. But this opinion hath been combatted by a phyſician of very conſiderable reputation and practice, who hath offered ſome reaſons to the public for diſſenting on this occaſion, from the above mentioned gentlemen, as well as moſt others of their profeſſion. He ſuppoſes that the contagion was generated from the ſtench of a Cargo of damaged coffee, which had been landed near the ſame place where it made its firſt appearance; on a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that vegetable putrefaction might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a diſeaſe. This gentleman has
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025075_0008_0FCE4B39E28B2B90"/>
deſervedly gained much credit by his noble and humane attention to unhappy patients of the contagion, during its moſt perilous ſtages; but the majority of his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens think that he has carried the ſpirit of diſcovery too far in tracing its origin.</p>
            <p>It is certain that neither the ſame diſeaſe, nor any other ſimilar to it, has ever viſited, this city at any preceding time ſince it was founded, but what has been undeniably traced to a foreign ſource. The city police, perhaps, was never better adminiſtered; nor its cleanlineſs more attended to; and if vegetable putrefaction alone were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to produce ſo dire a contagion; ſurely in the lapſe of one hundred years it might have happened, and been aſcertained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a contradiction. The cleanlineſs of our ſtreets and wharves has been more neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in former times than lately; they have, alſo, been more incommoded by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid vegetable ſubſtances; and we have had every diverſification of ſeaſons, wet and dry, hot and cold, that could aſſiſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch an effect: and as the learned Doctor has not produced ſufficient reaſons to convince a number of his fellow citizens
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025075_0009_0FCE4B6A51D34F08"/>
of the juſtneſs of his opinion in this inſtance, he muſt indulge them in believing that the deleterious miaſmata was introduced from abroad, and from the ſick from on board one of the three veſſels before mentioned.</p>
            <p>There are ſome indeed, who go ſo far as to ſay that if particular men had done their duty; and had not betrayed more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to French cruizers, than genuine friendship for this city, we ſhould never have had occaſion to diſpute on ſo ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a theme.</p>
            <p>From whatever fountain we trace this poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned ſtream it has deſtroyed the lives of many thouſand citizens and ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed worth. Many widows and orphans are left to deplore the loſs of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and parents: at the acme of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominance, the univerſal complexion of the city was like Ezekiels roll, inſcribed from one end to the other with characters of lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and woe.</p>
            <p>A particular account of the various ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the late malignant fever have been deſcribed with great preciſion and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity by the ingenious Dr. William Cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025075_0010_0FCE4B3B5C523A98"/>
in a piece publiſhed in an early ſtage of the diſeaſe. From which the following brief abſtract is taken and inſerted, for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our readers.</p>
            <p>"THE patient firſt complains of wearineſs and weakneſs, which, in a few hours, is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a ſenſe of chillneſs, and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive dull pain and giddineſs in the head, an oppreſſive weight and ſtricture about the breaſt, particularly at the region of the heart, as if the ſpace was too narrow for its pulſations. The breathing is performed with quickneſs and uneaſineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſymptoms in moſt caſes, are ſoon ſucceeded by a frequent propenſity to puke, and this by a quick, full, but ſoft and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular pulſe; great heat about the head, neck, and breaſt; the ſkin generally hot and moiſt about the neck and forehead, but dry, and but little increaſe of heat about the feet and legs.</p>
            <p>IF, to theſe ſymptoms we add an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary proſtration of ſtrength or ſudden debility in the animal functions of the body, we have a perfect deſcription of the fever
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025075_0011_0FCE4B6BB88BA988"/>
under conſideration, from the firſt day of its attack to the third of its progreſs.</p>

               </gap> or 4th day, moſt of the recited ſymptoms become more diſtreſſing and alarming, with the pulſe low and ſunk. Frequent vomiting of matter reſembling coffee grounds in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and conſiſtence, generally occurs before the diſeaſe terminates, when it proves mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, together with a cadaverous appearance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In ſome caſes, a profuſe diſcharge of blood from the noſe, concludes the cataſtrophe. A hiccup is a very frequent but not a conſtant ſymptom, nor does vomiting always occur. The tongue is ſeldom very foul or dry, nor does the patient always crave drink. His intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, though always confuſed, are ſeldom ſo much diſordered as to amount to a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. Subſultus tendinum are very rare</p>
            <p>When the diſeaſe terminates favourably,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025075_0012_0FCE4B3EAAF56FC0"/>
the ſymptoms generally abate on the third or fourth day, accompanied by a profuſe ſweat. When it ends fatally, it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between the fifth and eighth day, though ſome have ſurvived the tenth and died af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>The characteriſtic or leading ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, as has already been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, are ſudden debility in the voluntary powers, oppreſſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As ſoon as the contagion had reached the central ſtreets, it ſpread itſelf with dreadful rapidity on all ſides. In the courſe of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt there were more than three hundred funerals; towards the cloſe of the month there were twenty buried in a day. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the major part of the time the thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtood from 80 to 90 in the afternoons; the ſky was moſtly fair, and the winds ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally weſterly. From the 25th. to the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025075_0013_0FCE4B6CE06B4930"/>
end of the month the weather was cloudy and ſome rain fell; during theſe days the mortallity encreaſed.</p>
            <p>In September its malignance increaſed amazingly: fear impreſſed the ſtouteſt hearts; the dread of infection increaſed with the the infection itſelf. Many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple declined viſiting their neareſt relatives that were ſick. The moſt humane ſeemed to have forgotten their humanity. The utmoſt ſkill in the healing art was employed in vain. Every family ſeemed to hug itſelf in a ſtate of ſecluſion from its neareſt neighbour. Indeed in ſome few ſorrowful inſtances, all the warm "charities of father, ſon and brother," were palſied by the cold hand of death.</p>
            <p>At this criſis, a criſis of inconceivable conſternation, many thouſands flew into the country, as choice or chance directed; and in our own ſtate they generally met with a ſympathetic reception; the farmer opened his hoſpitable doors to receive the affrighted fugitives, and condoled in their ſufferings. A few there were who allowed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025075_0014_0FCE4B3FDF0A51D0"/>
their fears to overpower their fellow-feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and refuſed their aid unleſs paid an extraordinary price. In this month four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred citizens were added to the liſt of mortality. The contagion was ſtill progreſſive; towards the end of it there were from fifty to ninety buried in a day. By the glaſſes the heat of the atmoſphere had abated; the mercury ſeldom roſe above 80. The weather was moſtly fair, with a few intervening days of cloud, which promiſed rain but diſcharged none. The winds ſtill continued to be weſterly. From the 19th to the 23d the air was calm; and during theſe five days and the day following there were near five hundred perſons buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Throughout the month the heat was generally moderate, and the weather pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty equable; ſo that the increaſe of the mortality was owing merely to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the circle of infection.</p>
            <p>Until the middle of October the mighty deſtroyer went on with increaſing havoc. From the 1ſt. to the 17th upwards of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred fell as victims to the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous malady: from the latter day to the 31ſt. the bills of mortality leſſoned pretty
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025075_0015_0FCE4B6E5D4FF3B8"/>
gradually. In the whole of this month the dead amounted to near two thouſand; a dreadful number! if we conſider that at this time upwards of one third of its inhabitants had forſaken the city.</p>
            <p>People by this time had experienced the inefficacy of ſmelling bottles, handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar, camphor bags pieces of tarred rope, &amp;c. as a prevention; and had very generally laid them aſide; truſting rather to the protection of Providence, and a prudent care to avoid the houſes of the ſick. In the earlier period of the diſeaſe theſe precautions were almoſt univerſal; inſomuch that the greater part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be ſeen in the ſtreets, had either one or the other applied to their noſtrils. Many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced an extraordinary confidence in the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of garlic and chewed it conſtantly, even to ſuch a degree as to be ſmelled at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral yards diſtance. Samuel Benge, who had that dangerous office, the ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the removal of the ſick from their houſes to Buſh-hill, uſed to take a few An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon's pills, and a little ſweet-oil every evening: whether this was the cauſe of his
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025075_0016_0FCE4B41701C48C0"/>
eſcaping the diſeaſe, cannot be aſcertained.</p>
            <p>The thermometer was very variable, moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below 80, and above 50 until the 27th, from which day to the end of the month it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways below 50, and one day below 40. The winds generally blew from the N. and N. W. The weather for the greateſt part of the time fair. During the five or ſix laſt days of this month the virulence of the contagion was greatly abated; but few freſh patients pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves—and the funerals were from 12 to 20 per diem.</p>
            <p>From the firſt of November to the ſeventh, the mortality continued gradually to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; on the ninth, the burials in all the grave-yards were reduced to ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as ſix. By this time the fugitive citizens had recovered their ſpirits ſufficiently to venture back to their homes; the ſtreets and the various departments of buſineſs began to reſume life and activity.</p>
            <p>Let us now make a pauſe; a ſolemn pauſe! The viſitation has paſſed over our heads for a time at leaſt. Let us look back on the awful ſcene; and endeavour to draw
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025075_0017_0FCE4B70E8C98B28"/>
ſome inſtruction from it: it is a ſcene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with intereſting inſtruction.</p>
            <p>A contagious fever hath made dreadful, and in this country unparallelled, ravages in every quarter of the city; few houſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have eſcaped. Univerſal conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invaded every mind: the feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity; the ſuggeſtions of duty; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of man, have all been abſorbed by the ſenſe of private danger, and a wiſh to eſcape the infectious calamity: every me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical aid hath been exerted; and in moſt caſes exerted in vain! The potent malady hath laughed to ſcorn our wiſdom, and our ingenuity. We have been beholden to the poor; to the deſpiſed blacks, for nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to attend the ſick; as if Providence were determined to convince us that they are equally the objects of his care, with ourſelves.</p>
            <p>The long extended train of funeral attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, heretofore too common, has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for the ſolitary hearſe; and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relatives have been left to mourn in a ſtate of diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ertion. Let the proud Lord of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025075_0018_0FCE4B44327D8D68"/>
view this picture, and it is not the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fancy, and aſk himſelf whether he has any reaſon to boaſt of his talents, or his virtues. Certainly he has more cauſe to exclaim with humiliating propriety in his addreſs to Almighty God, "Lord! what is man that thou art mindful of him."</p>
            <p>With this humble temper of mind he will be better prepared to receive the benefits of Heaven with gratitude; he can never fail to feel a glow of devotion, when he conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that all human ſkill had been exhauſted in moſt caſes to no good purpoſe; and the gloom which hung over the city ſeemed to threaten to unpeople it, the forgiveneſs and and mercy of the MOST HIGH, burſt out, like the brightneſs of the ſun through a cloud, with healing virtue. Mercy reaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the aſcendant on the judgment ſeat; and the raging mortallity ceaſed. Let us then with one accord lift up our hearts with our hands to God in the Heavens, and pray, that he may animate our minds with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to profit by the late humiliating diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his judgment and his mercy.</p>
            <p>One remarkable circumstance and one
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025075_0019_0FCE4B722C5F8EE0"/>
that reflects much credit on the neghbouring country people is that our markets were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably well ſupplied with every neceſſary of life, uſually to be found in them; and that at no conſiderable advance in the price.</p>
            <p>Although the predominant feature of the city while the mortality raged at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, was terror and diſmay; and altho' moſt people ſought their own ſafety with too little concern about others; there were found men, who, at the imminent riſque of their own lives, ſtept forward, at the moſt trying pinch, to aſſiſt thoſe who wanted the choice or the means of flying. In this band of worthies the poor met with friends in the day of diſtreſs; and the helpleſs orphan with a father.</p>
            <p>The country ſeat of William Hamilton at Buſh-hill being an high and airy ſituation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at ſome diſtance from the city, was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and converted into an hoſpital for the poor, and ſuch as had not conveniencies of being nurſed at their own homes. It ſoon became crouded with patients; and, from a concurrence of cauſes, in a ſhort time it fell into great diſorder. Unprincipled nurſes, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected

the ſick and conſumed in riot the proviſions gathered for their comfort. Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs was neglected to ſuch a degree that the chambers became too offenſive and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for any but an inſenſible, or an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic mind to enter. In this ſtate of diſorder and filthineſs; it will be naturally ſuppoſed, the ſick had little chance of recovering: and indeed ſo few did recover, that the minds of the poor, who to this time had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the infection, inſtead of conſidering the hoſpital as a bleſſing, became terrified with the thoughts of being ſent to it, and many, even of the ſick, reſiſted as long they were able, the importunities of their friends to have them taken to inevitable death as it appeared to them to be.</p>
            <p>A Committee of citizens (a liſt of whoſe names is hereunto annexed) who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to aſſist the ordinary and legal guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the poor, heard repeated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this alarming evil: but the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of attending at the hoſpital to remove it, as well as prevent the repetition of it when removed, ſeemed like an immediate ſacrafice of the lives of the undertakers. To ſearch into the horors of this dismal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptical,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025075_0021_0FCE4B73AAF2FAD8"/>
where every breath was peſtilence and every ſight diſtreſs, required the humanity and fortitude of a Howard. Such men where found!—They voluntarily offered themſelves.—Stephen Gerard a native of France, a wealthy merchant of Philadelphia, one of the committee, and Peter Helm, a native of Philadelphia, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member, generously ſtepped forth and undertook the perilous taſk. If an ancient Roman, who ſaved the life of one citizen, at the riſque of his own, was crowned with a civic wreath, what rewards do theſe men deſerve? who where inſtrumental in ſaving the lives of many! They gave up their own to help the helpleſs—Thanks be to Heaven! They were preſerved; and their generous labours where bleſſed with ſucceſs. The firſt worthleſs nurſes were diſcharged, and new ones introduced; the rooms were well cleanſed, and the ſick were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly attended.</p>
            <p>The effects of the reformation ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; the poor no longer conſidered Buſh-hill Lazaretto as the Antichamber of the grave; but as a humane proviſion for the neceſſitous ſick. In this dangerous poſt theſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025075_0022_0FCE4B46A2BE0B00"/>
two worthy citizens continued their daily attendance until the diſeaſe was extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Joſeph Inſkeep, (a name dear to all his acquaintance) another member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, very early devoted himſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after thoſe that where ſick and to aſſiſt them: often did this good man ſet at their bed ſides adminiſtring comfort. Several he was inſtrumental in reſtoring to their friends and families.</p>
            <p>Daniel Offley, another reſpectable citizen and member of the charitable committee, with ſingular fortitude braved the danger of infection, in diſcharge of his chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; in viſiting the ſick &amp; comfortleſs and affording every aſſiſtance in his power.</p>
            <p>Jonathan D. Sergeant Eſq. Jacob Tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, jun. James Wilſon and Andrew Adgate, all diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and labours of humanity. Theſe ſix valuable men are no more!—They fell victims to the contagion; They are gone from works to rewards but their memories will ever be reſpected by all who knew them</p>

The truly Reverend Henry Helmuth (Paſtor of the Lutheran congregation, in this city) claims particular applauſe. This worthy clergyman, not ſatisfied to wait for the calls of his people, invited them from the pulpet univerſally to make free to ſend for him at all times by day or night. Indeed he conſecrated all his time, whilſt the diſeaſe prevailed to aſſiſt and comfort his flock: and the ſick among them were ſo numerous that he had but little time he could call his own.</p>
            <p>Many more names could be mentioned, who, to their laſting honour, ſtepped forth at this trying ſeaſon, to ſmooth the bed of ſickneſs, and to relieve the neceſſities of the poor. But it would ſwell this ſhort account beyond the compaſs intended, to recount the benevolent actions, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted attentions and the hazardous exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many of our fellow citizens beſides the committee, during this dreadful period.</p>

            <p>So great a mortality among the people conſequently left a large number of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan children in a very deſtitute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing ſituation; ſome of them without a friend to adminiſter to their wants; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them indeed, were found wandering in the ſtreets, not knowing where to apply for relief. Here again was a large field of labour opened for the benevolent. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were to be provided with nurſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025075_0025_0FCE4B7765DF1D38"/>
and other accommodations, which was no ſmall undertaking. The committee however in addition to their former bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, alſo undertook this; and procured the Loganian Library which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ed up, and appropriated to the purpoſe of an Orphan houſe. A ſuitable woman hath been provided as ſuperintendant, with ſufficient aſſiſtants under her. Every neceſſary care appears to have been taken and the children moſtly healthy and chearful. Many of theſe have been delivered to their relatives. About two hundred have been introduced into this houſe of whom about ſixty were infants. At preſent there are nearly fifty in the houſe and between thirty and forty out with wet nurſes. Nineteen only have died.</p>
            <p>The accumulating expence of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as well as that at Buſh-hill, with many others, obliged the committee to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociate a loan of 1500 dollars with the bank of North America, and this being ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diquate to the expence, they borrowed a farther ſum of 5000 dollars of the ſame bank, for which the directors refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve any intereſt. Several liberal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions have enabled the committee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025075_0026_0FCE4B4AB84BB670"/>
their parental care and proviſion for thoſe unfortunate children, as well as to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a great number of poor with fire wood and other neceſſaries. From the citizens of Philadelphia in and near German-Town they recieved two thouſand dollars; from thoſe in the neighbourhood of Darby, fourteen hundred dollars; from the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of New-York, five thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; from Bucks-county ſixteen hundred dollars; from Delaware-county twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars; from Franklin-county five-hundred dollars; ſundry neceſſaries from the inhabitants of Boſton, to the amount of twenty five hundred dollars; and a great many other contributions from different places.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſo generous as were the ſupplies handed us by our friendly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, ſo great was the terror and diſmay with which they were affected at the idea of the fugitive Philadelphians carrying the diſorder with them and ſpreading it in the country, that the great law of ſelf-preſervation ſuperſeded every other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; inſomuch that in many places reſolutions were entered into, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

or goods whatever ſhould be ſuffered to enter their reſpective towns, and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, unleſs it could be proved they had been from the city at leaſt twelve days. The inhabitants of the town of Boſton, New York, Baltimore, Charleſton, and moſt other ſea-ports in the United States, made reſolutions ſimilar to the above and obliged all veſſels coming from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, to ride quarantine for the ſpace of time which they reſpectively apprehended requiſite to aſſertain whether there was any thing of the contagion among them. However, to their credit let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that they generally procured ſuitable hoſpitals, and made ample proviſion for thoſe who ſhould come from the city, and be taken with the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>During this melancholy period, the city in addition to the various other afflictions, loſt ten of her moſt valuable phyſicians, doctors Hutchinſon, Morris, Lynn, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington, Dodds, Johnſon, Glentworth, Phile, Graham and Green. Moſt of the others were ſick at different times, and thoſe who remained alive and able to go out, were not ſufficient in number to anſwer the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025075_0028_0FCE4B4C9F52AD40"/>
many calls for their aſſiſtance, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuffered for want of proper advice and many more for want of ſuitable and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nurſes. Great hath been the charge devolved on them; great have been their exertions, and much gratitude is due by the citizens univerſally, to thoſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty who faithfully braved the danger in performing their duty.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that the French who ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled among us, and particularly thoſe from the Weſt-India iſlands, were in a particular manner preſerved from this ſickneſs: ſome few, however, took it and died.</p>
            <p>The black people, likewiſe, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted in a peculiar manner from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. Very few of them were taken, and ſtill fewer died.</p>
            <p>Had it not been for the exertions and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of ſome of theſe deſpiſed people, the calamity and diſtreſs of the city would have been much aggravated.</p>
            <p>Some parts of their conduct may have the appearance of ingratitude to the citizens of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025075_0029_0FCE4B78DDD3A2A8"/>
Philadelphia who have been their firſt and firmeſt friends, who have always generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and humanely exerted themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and releaſe them from the oppreſſive hand of ſlavery; yet much may be ſaid in extenuation of their fault.</p>
            <p>Though the conduct of ſome of them, in taking three and four dollars a day; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting it with the utmoſt rigor from ſtarving families, and then not doing their duty, is to be reprobated, and for that of others an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe is neceſſary, yet there are ſome among them whoſe conduct merits great applauſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are acquainted with human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will readily allow that the principle of ſelf preſervation, muſt operate upon the blacks as ſtrongly as upon other people. Now tho' experience has ſhewn that the former have almoſt univerſally eſcaped the contagion, yet at that time the fact was not abſolutely eſtabliſhed, and they might rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally be ſuppoſed to be poſſeſſed of the idea that the circulating report of their being incapable of taking the infection, was but a fineſſe or ſtratagem of the whites, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the attainment of their aſſiſtance; and as they were ignorant of the phyſical
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025075_0030_0FCE4B4E1E454868"/>
properties of bodies, and as even we, with all the advantages of education, have not yet been able to develope the cauſe of their wonderful preſervation, the idea, which they may have had of the danger, would very probably prevent many from underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo difficult and hazardous an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Is it not human nature? Would it not have been almoſt a phenomenon, had they, educated as they are, acted otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As the value of labour is generally eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the trouble it coſts, or the danger which attends it, and the plenty or ſcarcity of hands that are willing to undertake an employment, the blacks would naturally follow the general principle and take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the time, to get as much for their labour as they could. I mean not to juſtify the exaction of exorbitant prices at ſuch a time, but merely to offer a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation of a fault which the negroes were unfortunately guilty of. It ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that their education has been ſuch as to keep them in ignorance of the finer feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature, that they have generally been in the habit of being impoſed upon, that they are univerſally poor, and muſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025075_0031_0FCE4B7B940E0498"/>
poſſeſs with others, an ambition of procuring ſomething for future contingencies, that the time afforded tempting opportunities, and that it is too generally the caſe, that mankind ſeize with avidity every occaſion of profiting.</p>
            <p>"IT appears from authentic documents, that the ſame kind of fever as the one which has been deſcribed in the preceding pages, has been prevalent in Philadelphia at two different periods. The firſt, A. D. 1740; ſuppoſed to have been introduced by means of a quantity of wearing apparel brought in a trunk from Barbadoes, belonging to a gentleman who died of it in that Iſland.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond time of its appearance was A. D. 1762, introduced by a mariner, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſick with it from the Havanna, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it to the family where he lodged; from whence it ſpread rapidly from houſe to houſe as families had intercourſe with one another.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the notes of Dr. Redman, the worthy Preſident of the Philadelphia Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025075_0032_0FCE4B5129119C60"/>
of phyſicians, it made its apearance the latter end of Auguſt of the year laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. About the 20th or 25th of September, its progreſs ſeems to have arrived to its height. From the 27th it gradually declined, ſo that by the 10th of October, inſtead of 18 to 20 pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of a day, which Dr. Redman had before attended in it, he had now only two or three.</p>
            <p>THE fever at that period was circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed between Pine-ſtreet northerly, and three or four ſquares from thence ſoutherly, and extended from Water-ſtreet, to Third or Fourth-ſtreet weſterly. Its firſt and greateſt ravages were about the New Market, which lay near the ſource of the contagion. The fever as it appeared at that time, is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Dr. Redman in a communication juſt preſented to, and read in the College of Phyſicians.</p>
            <p>"THE patients were generally ſeized with a ſudden and ſevere pain in the head and eye-balls, which frequently appeared a little inflamed, or had a reddiſh caſt, great pain in the back and limbs, and much dejection of ſpirits. A ſick ſtomach generally attended, but in various degrees of violence, with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025075_0033_0FCE4B7E09190A60"/>
vomiting, more or leſs of green or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low bile, and was diſtinguiſhed from the cholera morbus by not having a purging with it. There was alſo a kind of cardial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, or burning heat about the ſcrobiculus cordis, with great oppreſſion; but if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member right, not much pain like a cholic; nor do I recollect any chill generally prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the above ſymtoms—however, it might be with ſome. The ſkin was dry with a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable burning heat in it, ſenſible to the hand of others. The tongue was not very dry at firſt, but rather moiſt, and covered with whitiſh mucus. The pulſe was not generally either full or tenſe, but very quick in the beginning, by which the degree of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was chiefly deſignated. Yet in ſome perſons previouſly very plethoric from high living and other circumſtances, ſome full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without tenſion was obſerved in the pulſe in the firſt ſtage; after which in many, the pulſe became ſo moderate in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as to be ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable from that of a perſon in health. Though very reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and often toſſing about, or changing poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from oppreſſion at the praecordia, I think they were but ſeldom very delirious; but if the diſeaſe continued to increaſe, and reſiſt
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025075_0034_0FCE4B529FC0FF70"/>
the power of medicines, they rather grew comatoſe, which was a bad ſymptom, and generally continued till death, unleſs the black vomiting came on and occaſionally rouſed them. But even thoſe who were comatoſe, when rouſed appeared quite ſenſible, though not capable of preſerving a regular connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ideas on any one ſubject for any length of time. They ſoon became yellow in their eyes and ſkin univerſally, which became extreme in ſome before, and in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all after death: and in thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. it continued during the whole convaleſcent ſtate, and in ſome, a great part of the cuticle peeled off.</p>
            <p>"WHEN the diſeaſe terminated fatally, it was generally on the 4th, 5th or 6th day; ſome few later; but after the 7th day, or even ſooner if the pulſe became much calmer and ſlower without a Coma, and the patient inclined to a natural eaſy ſleep, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ough ſhort, with a moiſt ſkin and tongue, &amp;c. we were encouraged to hope, and promiſe much and generally ſucceeded in our prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, &amp;c."</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON, 1665.</head>
            <head>(Written at that time.)</head>
            <p>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is pleaſed to viſit the children of men, in order to reduce them to a juſt ſenſe of their own weakneſs and entire dependance upon him, there is ſcarce any that are more productice of true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent humiliation and of a ſight of what is really good and truly evil, than thoſe contagious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which an offended God ſometimes ſuffers to rage amongſt the people. In the year 1665 the city of London was ſorely viſited by the plague. An account of the progreſs and effects of that viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was kept by a citizen who remained there during the whole time of the ſickneſs, and appears to have been candid and judicious in his remarks thereon. I truſt my readers may, in a ſhort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that memorable judgment, meet with ſuch leſſons of beſt wiſdom, which nothing can ſo effectually produce, as a cloſe and ſerious converſe with death and the grave. The introduction of this contagion in London was by ſome goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Holland, which had been brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Levant. It firſt broke out in the houſe where thoſe goods were opened, from whence it ſpread to other houſes. In the firſt houſe that was infected there died four perſons: A neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour who went to viſit them returning home,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:025075_0038_0FCE4B55CE7683C0"/>
gave the diſtemper to her family, and died with all her houſhold. The pariſh officers who were employed about the ſick perſons, being alſo infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the phyſicians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow inſpection, aſſured, that it was indeed the plague, with all its terrifying particulars, and that it threatened a general infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town: the uſual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th of Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the froſt continuing very ſevere till nearly the end of February, the bills decreaſed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increaſed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection ſpread again in a dreadful manner.</p>
            <p>I lived, ſays the author, without Aldgate, and as the diſtemper had not reached to that ſide of the city, our neighbourhood continued eaſy; but at the other end of the town the conſternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unuſual manner; nothing was to be ſeen but waggons, carts, and coaches, with goods and people, and horſe-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, who were apparently returning to fetch more people, beſides innumerable numbers of people on horſe back, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melancholy proſpect; indeed there was nothing elſe of moment to be ſeen; it filled my mind with very ſerious thoughts of the miſery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy condition of thoſe that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had ſpread and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a great degree: Sorrow and ſadneſs
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025075_0039_0FCE4B82E2790AF0"/>
ſat upon every face; and though ſome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. London might well be ſaid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the ſtreets, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body made a formal dreſs of mourning for their neareſt relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the ſtreets; the ſhrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houſes where their deareſt relations were dying, were ſo frequent to be heard as we paſſed the ſtreets, that it was enough to pierce the ſtouteſt heart in the world. Tears and lamentations were ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every houſe, eſpecially in the firſt part of the viſitation; for towards the latter end people did not ſo much concern themſelves for the loſs of their friends, expecting that themſelves ſhould be ſummoned the next hour.</p>
            <p>It was a time of very unhappy breaches amongſt us; in matters of religion, diviſions and ſeparate opinions prevailed; the church of England was lately reſtored, and the Preſbyterians and other profeſſions had ſet up their meetings for worſhip, apart, in which they were frequently diſturbed, the government endeavouring to ſuppreſs their meetings. But this dreadful viſitation reconciled the different parties, and took all manner of prejudice and ſcruple from the people. But after the ſickneſs was over, that ſpirit of charity ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may obſerve, that a nearer view of death would ſoon reconcile men of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our eaſy ſituations in life, and our putting theſe things far from us, that our breaches are fomented, and that there is ſo much prejudice and want of Chriſtian charity and union amongſt us. A cloſe view and converſe with death, or with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes that threaten death, would ſcum off the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025075_0040_0FCE4B5724424D88"/>
gall of our temper, remove our animoſities, and bring us to ſee with different eyes. On the other ſide of the grave we ſhall all be brethren again.</p>
            <p>The inns of court were now all ſhut up, there was few lawyers to be ſeen in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and diviſions about intereſt had ceaſed; every body was at peace.</p>
            <p>It was alſo worthy of obſervation, as well as fruitful of inſtruction, to obſerve with what ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity the people of all perſuaſions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the public worſhip, and other appointed times of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as humiliations, faſtings and public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of ſins, to implore the mercy of GOD, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were ſo thronged, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the largeſt churches. There was alſo daily prayers appointed morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</p>
            <p>All plays and interludes which had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to increaſe amongſt us, were forbidden; the gaming tables, publick dancing-rooms and muſick-houſes, which multiplied and began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch the manners of the people, were ſhut up and ſuppreſſed, finding indeed no trade, for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their grave.</p>
            <p>The infection ſtill gradually increaſed till the middle of Auguſt when there died a thouſand a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thouſands; many of the pariſh officers were taken ſick them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and died when their account was to be given in. The pariſh of Stepney alone had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025075_0041_0FCE4B84EDEC87E0"/>
in the year one hundred and ſixteen ſextons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the work was not of a nature to allow them leiſure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown together in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmoſt peril.</p>
            <p>I had ſays the author, the care of my brother's houſe which obliged me ſometimes to go abroad. In theſe walks I had diſmal ſcenes before my eyes, as particularly of perſons falling dead in the ſtreets, terrible ſhrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a diſmal ſurpriſing manner; it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to deſcribe the variety of poſtures in which the paſſions of the poor people would expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Paſſing through Token Houſe yard, of a ſudden a caſement violently opened juſt over my head and a woman gave three frightful ſhrikes, and then cry'd: <hi>Oh! Death Death Death,</hi> which ſtruck me with horror and chillneſs in my very blood, there was nobody to be ſeen in the whole ſtreet, neither did any window open, for people now had no curioſity in any caſe. I went on to paſs into Bell-Alley, where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run ſkreaming about the rooms like diſtracted, when a garret window opened, and ſomebody on the other ſide aſked <hi>What is the matter?</hi> Upon which it was anſwered, <hi>Oh Lord! my old maſter has hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf.</hi> The other aſked again, <hi>Is he quite dead?</hi> And the firſt anſwered, <hi>Ay ay quite dead and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

oftentimes laid violent hands upon themſelves throwing themſelves out of the windows, or breaking out of the houſes, would dance naked about the ſtreets, not knowing one extacy from another; others if not prevented, would run di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly down the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a paſſion, and ſome of fright and ſurpriſe, without having recieved the infection. It often pierced my very ſoul, to hear the groans and cries of thoſe thus tormented; but this of the ſwellings was accounted the moſt promiſing particular in the whole infection; for if theſe ſwellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally recovered. Whereas thoſe who were ſtruck with death at the beginning of the diſtemper, and had ſpots come upon them, often went about indifferent eaſy, till a little before they died, and ſome till the moment they dropt down; ſome would be taken very ſuddenly ſick, and would run to a convenient place, or their own houſes if poſſible, and there ſit down, grow faint, and die. The method the magiſtrates fell into of locking up the doors of the people's houſes where they had taken the diſtemper, ſetting watchmen there night and day to prevent any going out to ſpread the infection, looked hard and cruel, as perhaps thoſe who were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound in the family, might have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, if they had been removed from the ſick? but the public good ſeem'd to juſtify ſuch a conduct, and there was no obtaining the leaſt mitigation by any application to the magiſtrates. This put the people who thought themſelves well, upon many ſtratigems to get out of their confinements. Going out one morning, I heard a great outcry, which prompting my curioſity, I inquired the cauſe of a perſon who locked out of a window. A watchman had been employed to watch at the door of a houſe, which was infected and ſhut up, both himſelf and the day-watchman attended there
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025075_0043_0FCE4B865E048260"/>
a day and two nights, all this while no noiſe had been heard, nor lights ſeen in the houſe, neither had they called for any thing: it ſeems that two or three days before the dead cart had ſtopt there, and a ſervant maid had been brought down to the door, dead, wrapt only in a green rug, which the buriers had put into the cart, and carried away. The next day the watchman heard great crying and ſcreaming in the houſe, which he ſuppoſed was occaſioned by ſome of the family dying juſt at that time; upon which he knocked at the door a great while, at laſt one looked out, and ſaid with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry quick tone, and a voice of one that was cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>What d'ye want that ye make ſuch a knocking?</hi> He anſwered: <hi>I am the watchman: how do you do? what is the matter?</hi> The perſon anſwered: <hi>What is that to you? Stop the dead cart.</hi> This was about one o'clock; ſoon after the ſtopt the dead cart, and then knock'd again, but nobody anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He continued knocking, and the bellman called ſeveral times: <hi>Bring out your dead;</hi> but nobody anſwered, till the man that drove the cart being called to other houſes, would ſtay no longer, but drove away. In the morning when the day-watchman came in, they knocked at the door a great while, but nobody anſwering, they got a ladder, and one of them went up to the window, and ſaw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a diſmal manner: but tho' he called aloud and knocked hard on the floor with his ſtaff, nobody ſtirred or anſwered.</p>
            <p>This they made known to the magiſtrate, who ordered the houſe to be broken open, when nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was found in the houſe, but that young woman, who having been infected, and paſt recovery, the reſt had left her to die by herſelf, and were every one gone, having found ſome way to delude the watchman, and go out. As to thoſe cries and ſhrieks which he heard, it was ſuppoſed, they were the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025075_0044_0FCE4B5BADB64158"/>
paſſionate cries of the family, at the bitter part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which, to be ſure, it was to them all; this being the ſiſter to the miſtreſs of the family. Many more inſtances might be given, but theſe may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew the deep diſtreſs of that day. Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their houſes and chambers, and even ſtared in their very faces; and though there was ſome ſtupidity and dulneſs of mind, yet there was a great deal of juſt alarm ſounded in the inmoſt ſoul: many conſciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confeſſion was made of crimes long concealed. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be heard even in the ſtreets as we paſſed along calling upon God for mercy, through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a murderer, and the like, and none durſt ſtop to make enquiry into ſuch things, or to adminiſter comfort to the poor creature, who in the anguiſh both of ſoul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of diſtreſs, that ſuch a time of calamity as this, was no time for repentance. I wiſh, ſays the author, I could repeat the very ſound of thoſe groans and exclamations that I heard from ſome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and diſtreſs, and that I could make him that reads this hear, as, I imagine, I now hear them, for the ſound ſeems ſtill to ring in my ears.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of September the number of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials increaſing, the church-wardens of Aldgate pariſh ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and ſixteen broad; ſome blamed the church-wardens for ſuffering ſuch a frightful gulf to be dug: nevertheleſs in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into

My curioſity drove me to go and ſee this pit, when there had been near four hundred people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

There was nobody, as I could perceive, at firſt with the cart but the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, I ſaw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gathered about him, ſuppoſing he was one of thoſe poor delirious or deſperate creatures, that would ſometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blankets, and throw themſelves in, and as they ſaid, bury themſelves. When the buriers came to him, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He calmly deſired the buriers to let him alone, ſaid he would only ſee the bodies thrown in, and go away; ſo they left importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. But no ſooner was the cart turned round, and the bodies ſhot into the pit promiſcuouſly, which was a ſurpriſe to him, for he at leaſt expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, I ſay, no ſooner did he ſee the ſight, but he cryed out aloud, unable to contain himſelf, and fell down in a ſwoon; the buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he came to himſelf, led him to a place where he was taken care of. He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies ſo immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with throwing earth, that nothing could be ſeen. The cart had in it ſixteen or ſeventeen bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Some were wrapt up in linen ſheets, ſome in rugs, ſome little other than naked, or ſo looſe, that what covering they had, fell from them, in the ſhooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the reſt; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one elſe, ſeeing they were to be huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the common grave of mankind; for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, neither was it poſſible there ſhould.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hayward,</hi> under-ſexton, that is, grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digger and bearer of the dead, never had the diſtemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nurſe the infected people; yet ſhe herſelf never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The only preſervative he uſed againſt the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and ſmoaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was waſhing her head in vinegar, and ſprinkling her head-clothes ſo with vinegar, as to keep them always moiſt; and if the ſmell of any of thoſe ſhe waited on was more than ordinary offenſive, ſhe ſnuffed vinegar up into her noſe, ſprinkled her head-clothes and held her handkerchief wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vinegar to her mouth.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt not omit mentioning the diſpoſition of the people of that day, with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025075_0047_0FCE4B8AE6022210"/>
reſpect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate way. Some pious ladies were ſo zealous in this good work, and ſo confident in the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Providence in the diſcharge of this great duty, that they went about themſelves diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alms, and viſiting the poor families that were infected, in their very houſes, appointing nurſes and apothecaries to ſupply them with what they wanted, thus giving their bleſſings to the poor in ſubſtantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake to ſay, that none of theſe charitable people were ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die of the plague, but this I may ſay, that I never knew any of them miſcarried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in caſe of like diſtreſs, and doubtleſs, if they <hi>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</hi> thoſe that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and aſſiſt them in ſuch a miſery as this, may hope to be protected therein.</p>
            <p>From the middle of Auguſt to the middle of September the infection ſtill encreaſed and ſpread itſelf, with an irreſiſtable fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no leſs than ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confuſion and terror was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible: the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilence of the magiſtrates was now put to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt trial. At laſt the violence of the diſtemper came to ſuch a height that the people ſat ſtill, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one another, and ſeemed quite abandoned to deſpair. In a word, people began to give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to a fear, that there was nothing to be expected but univerſal deſolation.</p>
            <p>This deſpair made people bold and venturous, they were no more ſhy of one another, as expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was now no avoiding the diſtemper, but that all muſt go, this brought them to croud into

the churches, they inquired no more what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the people who ſat near them, were in, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themſelves as ſo many dead corps, they came to the churches without the leaſt caution and crouded together, as if their lives were of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, compared to the work which they were come about: Indeed their zeal in coming, and the earneſtneſs and affectionate attention they ſhewed to what they heard, made it manifeſt what value people would ſet upon the worſhip of GOD, if they thought that every day they attended at the church would be their laſt. It was in the height of their deſpair, that it pleaſed GOD to ſtay his hand, and ſlacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as ſurpriſing as that of its beginning, and which demonſtrated it to be his own particular hand above the agency of means; nothing but omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power could have done it; the contagion deſpiſed all medicine; death raged in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabitants. In that very moment when thirty thouſand were dead in three weeks, nay when it was reported three thouſand had died in one night, &amp; an hundred thouſand more were taken ſick, they well might ſay, <hi>I am was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

The phyſicians were ſurpriſed, whereſoever they viſited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Nor was this by any medicine found out or any new method of cure diſcovered, but it was evidently from the ſecret inviſible hand of him that firſt ſent this diſeaſe, as a judgment upon us. Let the philoſophers ſearch for reaſons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to leſſen the debt they owe to their maker; thoſe phyſicians who had the leaſt ſhare of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all ſupernatural.</p>
