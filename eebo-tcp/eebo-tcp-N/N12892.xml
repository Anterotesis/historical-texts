            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this chapter St. Paul declares, that he was divinely called to be an apoſtle of Chriſt, and ſeparated to the work of the goſpel miniſtry; and in the verſe preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the text, that he was ready and deſirous to preach the goſpel at Rome. This being the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of the roman empire, the apoſtle knew that he ſhould there probably meet with men of great learning and ſubtlety, as well as of great power and riches, who would critically examine his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and from their attachment to their old religion and ſuperſtition, which chriſtianity was deſigned to overthrow, do all they could to expoſe him and his preaching to contempt and ridicule.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016306_0004_0F9C1F31132E89A8"/>
But conſcious of the goodneſs of his cauſe, of the reaſonableneſs of the chriſtian inſtitution, and that it would bear the ſtricteſt examination, he declares, as in the text, that he was not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt; not aſhamed to appear a diſciple and an apoſtle of Chriſt crucified, and to publiſh his religion before the greateſt and wiſeſt men of that famous city. The words, "I am not aſhamed" are figurative, and intend more than they expreſs: The apoſtle meant to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert not only that he was not aſhamed of, but that he gloried in the goſpel of Chriſt, and tho't it ſo far from being a diſgrace, that it was a real honor to be a friend and a preacher of this religion. Such was the language of the great apoſtle; and his conduct was along agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it. After he embraced chriſtianity, he was ever a ſteady firm friend to it, openly, and boldly eſpouſing its cauſe, and doing all in his power to maintain and promote it. There were however ſome in his day, who were aſhamed of the goſpel; and ſuch there have been in every age ſince: Some ſuch there probably are among us in this day of thoughtleſs diſſipation and infidelity: Perſons who from their miſtaken notions of the goſpel, and of true honor are aſhamed to profeſs and practiſe chriſtianity. In order therefore to do what I can to promote the cauſe of my Divine maſter, who hath honoured me, putting me into the miniſtry, and prevent ſo fatal a perverſion of the paſſion of ſhame among my beloved hearers, whoſe honor and happineſs, I am ſo highly obliged to ſerve; I propoſe, in diſcourſing upon this ſubject,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:016306_0005_0F9C1F321FC0A980"/>I. To conſider what it is to be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew that the profeſſors of chriſtianity have reaſon to glory in, rather than to be aſhamed of their religion.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to conſider what it is to be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>IT is not neceſſary to give a preciſe definition of the paſſion of ſhame, which none are wholly ſtrangers to. Every man has probably felt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or ſeen in others ſomething of the effects of it. In ſtrictneſs of ſpeech it reſpects only, paſt or preſent actions or things; but in a lax or popular ſenſe it may be conſidered, as looking forward to things future; accordingly in common language we attribute men's doing or omitting certain acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this principle: Thus we ſay a man is aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſuch an action, or to neglect ſuch an one; i. e. he knows that ſuch a conduct would expoſe him to ſhame, and for fear of that uneaſy paſſion he avoids it. Shame ariſes wholy from a defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the opinions of others, and not at all from a regard to propriety and right conduct: And therefore it is eaſy to ſee that it is not ſit to be a governing principle, for it can lead to no ſteady conduct, but only to a conformity to the opinions and practices of thoſe with whom we hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to live, and by whom we wiſh to be eſteemed. And yet it is not an uſeleſs paſſion. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted within us, as all our paſſions were, for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016306_0006_0F9C1F37CBF4F190"/>
wiſe and good ends, and often anſwers valuable purpoſes. Men who have no fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, may be reſtrained from baſe and vicious actions by fear of the reproach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others. And it is no ways improper to maintain a degree of deference to the opinion of other perſons and a regard to their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eſteem. In the prophecy of Jeremiah, it is mentioned as a mark of the great degeneracy of certain profligate perſons, that when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted abomination they were not at all aſhamed, neither could they bluſh: Therefore, ſaith the Lord, they ſhall fall among them that fall, at the time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down. But tho' it is a mark of a baſe and degenerate mind to be incapable of ſhame; yet it is certain that this paſſion ſometimes leads men greatly aſide from their duty, and puts them upon violating the laws of God, to avoid reproach and cenſure from men: From wrong notions of true honor, perſons are ſometimes aſhamed to be ſingular even in a good cauſe, and dare not act differently from thoſe whoſe company they keep, leſt they ſhould incur their ill opinion. And thus for fear of loſing the eſteem and approbation of men, they expoſe themſelves to the reproaches of their own hearts, and the condemnation of God.</p>
            <p>FOR the further illuſtration of this matter, let it be obſerved; That if any man for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in diſgrace with thoſe whoſe company he keeps, or of incurring any cenſure or reproach from men, gives up and renounces chriſtianity,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016306_0007_0F9C1F390E53D0F0"/>
and, to recommend himſelf to his vicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, endeavors to turn it into ridicule and banter; or, not wholly renouncing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neglects to take due care to acquaint himſelf with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and precepts of it, by ſtudying the holy ſcriptures, where only they are to be found in their purity, becauſe it is not eſteemed genteel to read the bible; or from a like motive neglects to perform thoſe public and private acts of piety and devotion which the goſpel requires; or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regards the poſitive inſtitutions of the goſpel, baptiſm and the Lord's ſupper; or is ſhy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be a ſerious conſcientious perſon; or renounces any doctrine plainly contained in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:—If any man, I ſay, acts thus from ſuch motives, he is aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt: He violates his duty to gain the approbation of the world, and ſhews that he loves the praiſes of men more than the praiſes of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other hand, he who has ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his duty, and the approbation of his Maker, as openly to profeſs himſelf a diſciple of Chriſt in a licentious age, when infidelity is faſhionable, and he knows that by this means he ſhall expoſe himſelf to reproach; who practiſes daily the neglected and deſpiſed duties of prayer to God, and pays due regard to the poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of religion, though he is ridiculed as a weak, ſuperſtitious bigot; who appears openly a friend and advocate for chriſtianity, and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily practiſes all the duties therein commanded, however diſreputable they may be thought by others, making it evident that his governing aim
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016306_0008_0F9C1F3ACFD0C078"/>
is to ſhew himſelf approved unto God, whatever the world may think or ſay of him:—He, I ſay, who does thus, proves that he is not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt. I go on,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew that the profeſſors of chriſtianity have reaſon to glory in, rather than to be aſhamed of their religion.</p>
            <p>For the confirmation of this point, ſeveral particulars may be conſidered diſtinctly. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be proper to take a brief ſummary view of the doctrines of the goſpel, and ſee whether there be any thing abſurd or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in them, any thing which a wiſe man need be aſhamed to believe: Now theſe doctrines are; That there is one, and only one God, eternal, ſelf-exiſtent and immortal: That he is a pure Spirit, and conſequently inviſible, without any bodily parts, ſhape, form or paſſions: That he is unchangeably the <q>ſame, yeſterday, to day and forever:</q>—Every where preſent, <q>filling all in all:</q>—Infinite in knowledge and wiſdom, and of almighty power:—So ſupreme and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equaled in goodneſs, that, in the language of Chriſt, <q>there is none good but one, that is God:</q>—Of impartial juſtice and everlaſting truth and faithfulneſs; glorious in holineſs, every way perfect, and incomprehenſibly great.—That this great Being created the world and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſides over it, preſerving, directing and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of all things according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:—That his providence extends to the fowls
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016306_0009_0F9C1F3B96BD0F68"/>
of the air, the lillies and graſs of the field, the height of our ſtature, and even to the number of the hairs of our head:—That there is nothing in the univerſe, great or ſmall, viſible or inviſible, animate or inanimate, which is not under his government and controul. Now is not this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the perfections and providence of God worthy of his majeſty and greatneſs, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether agreeable to right reaſon? Are not theſe the very doctrines which are called the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of natural religion? Though it is certain that <hi>the world by wiſdom knew not God,</hi> i.e. did not diſcover him to be what he is, by mere reaſon; but are chiefly indebted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, for the knowledge which they have of him: But theſe doctrines being diſcovered, they approve themſelves to the unbiaſed reaſon of mankind; nor can any of them be denied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out running into manifeſt abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Theſe which have been mentioned are not what are commonly called doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but are the foundation upon which the chriſtian ſyſtem is built: And theſe being adopted and inculcated by Chriſt affords a preſumptive evidence that the ſuperſtructure which he raiſed upon them is equally reaſonable and worthy of God. It cannot be ſuppoſed that Jeſus would have given ſo juſt and compleat a repreſentation of the divine perfections, if the religion he was inſtituting was in any reſpect inconſiſtent with any of theſe perfections. The doctrines of the goſpel which are peculiar to the chriſtian inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016306_0010_0F9C1F3C4BE9D5D0"/>
are thoſe which relate particularly to the redemption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt. They reſpect mankind not conſidered as innocent, but as apoſtate, guilty creatures, exceedingly prone to tranſgreſs, and for their tranſgreſſions liable to the curſe of God. And that mankind really are in ſuch a ſtate, has been owned and lamented by the wiſeſt and beſt of the heathen moraliſts.</p>
            <p>Mankind, then, being in a degenerate ſtate, ſunk into ignorance, idolatry and vice, the goſpel teaches us, that God from his immenſe goodneſs and mercy ſent his only begotten and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son into the world, that by his example, inſtruction and ſuffering he might lead them to the knowledge of the true God, and the practiſe of righteouſneſs, and make ſuch atonement for their ſins as the wiſdom of God ſaw neceſſary to render their pardon and eternal ſalvation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the honor and dignity of his laws and government:—That this glorious perſon, after finiſhing his work on earth, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the croſs, was rewarded by God with the higheſt glory and honor, having a name given him above every name; angels, principalities and powers being made ſubject unto him:—That as by him God made the worlds, ſo by him he now carries on the adminiſtration of his providence and grace; and that by the ſame illuſtrious perſon he will at the laſt day, raiſe the dead, and judge the world in righteouſneſs, having given us aſſurance that he hath ordained him for that purpoſe. Such in general is the doctrine of the goſpel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016306_0011_0F9C1F3D1570E440"/>
the Mediator; a doctrine which, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, has been often objected againſt; tho' I know of no objection but what has been fully anſwered. It is beyond my deſign at preſent to conſider this controverſy. I will only obſerve, that the mediatorial ſcheme, as repreſented in the goſpel, appears to me to bear a general ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to the common method of the divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. God, we know, is to be conſidered as the giver of every good thing: But it is evident that he generally makes uſe of the inſtrumentality of his creatures for the communication of his favors; He reſtores health to the ſick by means of his phyſician; He feeds the poor by the liberality of the rich; He inſtructs the ignorant by means of the learned; and makes us the daily miniſters of good to one another: His purpoſes reſpecting nations and kingdoms are commonly executed by the agency of men. Why then ſhould it be thought incredible that God ſhould carry on his general government by the mediation of his Son? As to the doctrine of atonement by the death of Chriſt;—I would juſt obſerve, that mankind in all ages ſeem to have thought that ſomething of this ſort was neceſſary in order to the pardon of ſinners, though they ſhould repent; as appears from their uſe of various propitiatory ſacrifices: —That the goodneſs of God is illuſtriouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in his providing a ſacrifice, and receiving offenders to favor upon any terms; and his juſtice in requiring an expiation:—That no in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jury is done to Chriſt, ſince he <hi>voluntarily</hi> gave himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacrifice to God; —and, in a word, that Almighty God having

whole then, there does not appear to be any thing in the ſcripture doctrine of a mediator which a wiſe man need be aſhamed to believe.</p>
            <p>Let us next,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take a brief view of the precepts of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>They direct us to love, fear and honor God as the firſt and the greateſt, the wiſeſt and beſt of Beings: chearfully to ſubmit to all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of his providence, knowing that he is perfect in wiſdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goodneſs and power; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his example as dear children, endeavouring to be perfect as he is perfect; to worſhip him who is a ſpirit, in ſpirit and in truth, with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, humble and contrite minds devoted to his ſervice; acknowledging our continual depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon him for life and breath and all things, confeſſing our ſins before him, praying to him for pardon, for preſervation from every evil, and the beſtowment of every thing truly good for us, glorifying his tranſcendently amiable perfections, and thanking him for his abundant goodneſs: Nor are we to regard ourſelves only in theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to make our prayer, interceſſion and thankſgiving for all men. And theſe addreſſes are to be preſented to God through Jeſus Chriſt, the only mediator between God and man, and through whom alone we have acceſs to the Father. But we are not thus to worſhip God becauſe he needs to be informed of our wants, or loves to be flattered and complimented with the mention of his perfections and our declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016306_0014_0F9C1F3F4C5FD0F0"/>
of gratitude; or as if he could be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to alter the wiſe method of his conduct; but to bring our own minds to ſuch a temper as to render us fit objects of his favor, and diſpoſe us to a ſuitable behavior towards him, and our fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>Now will any man, who has a proper concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glorious perfections of God, and of our relation and obligations to him, deny this to be a reaſonable ſervice, which it is fooliſh and ſhameful to neglect, and wiſe and honorable to perform?</p>
            <p>As to our neighbours;—we are commanded to love them as ourſelves; to do to others as we would have them do to us; to be ſincere, juſt and charitable in all our dealings with men; and do all we can to promote their good; to live peaceably with all men if poſſible; to do no injury; and if a brother be offended, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately endeavour to be reconciled to him; to bear injuries with meekneſs, and forgive offenders, as we hope that God, through Chriſt, will have mercy upon us; not to render evil for evil, but endeavor to overcome evil with good.—This is an epitome of our duty to our neighbour, as laid down in the goſpel.</p>
            <p>As to ſelf-government:—We are directed to keep ourſelves pure; and taught, that the things which defile a man are evil thoughts indulged and breaking out into evil actions; and are therefore commanded not to indulge malice,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016306_0015_0F9C1F400CDEEC00"/>
revenge, envy, luſt, covetouſneſs, diſcontent, or any ſuch evil paſſions; to ſet our affections on things above and ſeek firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, with humble contented minds, truſting in the providence of God for all temporal good things; to be ſober, temperate and chaſte, and regulate both our thoughts and deſigns, and all our external behaviour by the laws of religion and virtue.—Such in general is our duty to ourſelves. And are not theſe precepts all wiſe and excellent? Is any thing here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, which right reaſon condemns; any thing forbidden, which ſhe approves? Will any rational man aſſert that it is ſhameful to practiſe, or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to violate any of theſe laws?</p>
            <p>WHAT have been mentioned are the moral duties of chriſtianity, which are confeſſedly the weightier matters of the law. But beſides theſe, the goſpel enjoins two poſitive inſtitutions—Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's-Supper; the one a rite of initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the church or ſociety of chriſtians; the other a commemoration of the love of Chriſt, the founder of this religion, to mankind. And is there any thing unreaſonable in theſe rites? Is it not proper that perſons ſhould in a public, formal manner be initiated into the ſociety of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and, that after they are members, they ſhould by ſome ſignificant rite diſtinguiſhing them from other perſons, commemorate the love and goodneſs of their <hi>founder?</hi> The conduct of mankind in reference to ſocieties of their own eſtabliſhment, ſhews that they eſteem this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016306_0016_0F9C1F40DC076A40"/>
Theſe ſocieties have their forms of admiſſion, their badges of diſtinction, and ſome of them their feſtivals in honor of their founders or patrons. And if theſe things are thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in ſocieties of human inſtitution, why ſhould they be thought otherwiſe in that inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt? Certainly the man who ſubmits to the rites required of him, in order to his being a member of any of theſe, can with a very ill grace object againſt thoſe appointed by Chriſt, for the obſervation of his diſciples. It will now be proper,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. To take notice of the ſanctions of the goſpel, or the motives which it offers to induce men to comply with its demands. Theſe are; That upon our ſincerely endeavouring to do this, God will ſupport and aſſiſt us by his holy ſpirit in the diſcharge of our duty and forgive our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions: That at the end of the world the dead ſhall be raiſed, and all mankind ſtand before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, and every man be dealt with according to his prevailing character, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it has been good or bad; when the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal.</p>
            <p>I would now appeal to any impartial man whether the religion of the goſpel be not moſt wiſe and excellent? Does it not in all its parts approve itſelf to the unprejudiced reaſon of our minds? Is it not becoming the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God as the father and friend of mankind,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016306_0017_0F9C1F41B319CD68"/>
to inſtitute ſuch a religion to recover his apoſtate, guilty creatures to the knowledge of his will, and the practice of righteouſneſs? Muſt it not highly conduce to the dignity, perfection, and happineſs of mankind? It gives a perfect and ſatisfactory repreſentation of the perfections and providence of God; and aſſures us of his readineſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſinners. It ſets before us the doctrine of a reſurrection and a future ſtate, in the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing manner, by giving us pledges and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of its truth. We are not left to build our faith in this article upon the fables and fictions of poets and the bewildred reaſonings of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. No virtue can be tho't of which it does not recommend; no vice can be named which it does not condemn. No other ſyſtem of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can be found which has not ſome mixture of falſe rules, or falſe principles. In the goſpel alone, we have the doctrines and laws of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs free from falſehood, ſuperſtition and weakneſs. And need any man be aſhamed to profeſs and practiſe ſuch a religion? Can reaſon account it diſhonorable to do ſo? Surely no. The only thing that a profeſſor of chriſtianity can have reaſon to be aſhamed of, is his not living according to his profeſſion. If he would do thus, he would be the very character which wiſe men of all ages have eſteemed the moſt worthy and excellent; the character, which, in the opinion of Plato, muſt charm the beholders with the higheſt degree of love and admiration; which all virtuous beings muſt reſpect, and God himſelf delight to honor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016306_0018_0F9C1F43717C0F70"/>THUS, I conceive, it appears from the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect account that has been given of the chriſtian inſtitution, that it is an honor, inſtead of a ſhame to any man to profeſs and practiſe this religion.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be ſaid, that it may be all a forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and its pretenſions to a divine original falſe; and in that caſe it would be diſhonorable to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it. I reply; (1.) That, allowing that it is a matter of doubt, whether it be a revelation from God, it is an inſtitution ſo well calculated to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and reform mankind, and promote the peace and happineſs of ſociety, that it is certainly worthy of great eſteem and reſpect, and every benevolent man muſt wiſh, that it might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to as a rule of life by all mankind. But, (2.) The ſuperior, the unrivaled excellency of the inſtitution, the ſublimity, the perfection and conſiſtency of its doctrines; the reaſonableneſs, the extent, and unmixed purity of its precepts are, in my apprehenſion, ſufficient to prove its divine original, to an honeſt candid mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any external arguments. And when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, together with the character of ſeveral of the new-teſtament writers; I mean their being quite illiterate, I cannot but think that it would be as abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the goſpel was written without the aſſiſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſpiration, as it would be to ſuppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Newton's <hi>principia,</hi> and Lock's <hi>eſſay concerning human underſtanding,</hi> were the productions of unlettered <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. However, there are not wanting other arguments in favor of chriſtianity, of ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016306_0019_0F9C1F450D4F2E48"/>
weight, that no man need be aſhamed to own himſelf convinced by them. But theſe cannot be conſidered here.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. IT may be proper for confirming the point I am upon, briefly to take a diſtinct view of the character of Jeſus Chriſt, the founder of the chriſtian religion. According to the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation given of him in the goſpel, He was the beſt, the greateſt and moſt honorable character that ever appeared upon earth; the ſon of God in ſo peculiar a ſenſe as to be called his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon; the brightneſs of his glory and the expreſs image of his perſon, in whom dwelt the fullneſs of the Godhead bodily. Before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation he had a glory with the father, far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all the glory of this world: And when he was made fleſh and dwelt among us, the ſpirit of God was given him without meaſure: He was poſſeſſed of ſuch degrees of wiſdom, power and goodneſs, as never appeared in any other perſon. He healed inveterate diſeaſes, calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the raging and tempeſtuous ſea, and raiſed the dead to life by only ſpeaking a word. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the ſecrets of the heart, foretold future events, and evidently proved that he was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the omniſcient ſpirit of God. In his moral conduct he excelled all the men that ever lived in the world, both for the purity of his life and the perfection of his virtues: Actuated by ſo diſintereſted a benevolence, that, thro' his whole life he never performed a ſingle action in which he conſulted his own intereſt only: He continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016306_0020_0F9C1F454E168D58"/>
went about doing good, having no other employment than that of promoting the good of mankind, ever eſteeming it more bleſſed to give, than to receive, to miniſter to others, than to be miniſtred unto. He exerciſed ſuch meekneſs, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and forgiveneſs as no other perſon ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. The prayer which he uttered in behalf of his enemies when he was hanging on the croſs,— Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do—fitly expreſſes the temper which he conſtantly maintained. In all things he was intirely reſigned to the will of his Father; and his piety was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, rational, undiſſembled and fervent. Nor did he upon any occaſion, either in word or deed, manifeſt any emotion of mind inconſiſtent with a perfect love of God and man. He had no fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to obſcure the luſtre of his virtues; no ſpot, no blemiſh to tarniſh the brightneſs of his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled and ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſinners. Such a pitch of perfection proved him to be ſomething more than man; and rendered him a fit perſon to be the meſſenger of God to an apoſtate world to conduct them thro' the paths of righteouſneſs to eternal glory. And ſuch he declared himſelf to be; and both his miracles the excellency of his doctrine, and the holineſs of his life confirmed his declaration. God alſo bore witneſs to him, by the teſtimony of the Judge who condemned him to the croſs, by the miracles which took place at, and ſoon after his death, and by raiſing him from the grave the third day after he had been crucified and ſlain by wicked hands; exalting him to the higheſt ſeat of honor and felicity, and putting all things
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016306_0021_0F9C1F460CE2D7E8"/>
in ſubjection under him. If then Jeſus Chriſt was originally ſo glorious and auguſt a character; if he was a divine meſſenger to mankind; if he was honoured by divine teſtimonials to his truth and innocence in his life, at his death and by his reſurrection and exaltation; if he was perfect in holineſs and virtue thro' this life, and is now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſupreme power and dominion, over angels and men;—need any man be aſhamed to profeſs his religion? Can any name or title be more honorable, than that of a diſciple to ſuch a maſter?—Let us</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Conſider the deſign of the goſpel inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. This was, not to procure for its founder and his friends worldly riches, power and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur; not to exalt him into a temporal ſovereign, and render mankind ſubſervient to his intereſt and pleaſure; as was apparently the deſign of the worldly-minded and politic Mahomet, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of his religion. No action in the life of Chriſt, no ſentiment in the goſpel bears the mark of ſuch an intention. Chriſtianity has a more diſintereſted, benevolent and God-like aim. It's deſign, in general, is to deſtroy the works of the devil; i. e. ſin, which has defaced the moral cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of God, and the natural and penal evils brought upon mankind by it; to reſcue from a ſtate of ſlavery and miſery, not a ſingle nation, but the whole world, and reſtore them to liberty and happineſs; and for this purpoſe to reveal the mercy and loving kindneſs of God, bring life and immortality to light, and teach and perſuade men
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016306_0022_0F9C1F46DC0E9248"/>
to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſt, and live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the world, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hoping for eternal glory and happineſs in Heaven. And is not this an excellent deſign? Can any purpoſe be more worthy of the kind parent of the univerſe, or deſerve a more cordial and thankful acceptance of man? Can any thing be more honorable for a rational creature than to fall in, and co-operate with ſuch a deſign?</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We ſhall be further convinced that chriſtians have no cauſe to be aſhamed of their religion, if we conſider the effects which it has had in the world. Though it is to be wiſhed that theſe had been greater; yet they have not been inconſiderable. Many enormities which anciently prevailed and were approved in the heathen world, are in a great meaſure baniſhed from, or at leaſt rendered diſreputable in every country where chriſtianity is profeſſed in tolerable purity; ſuch as polygamy, inceſt, expoſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, unnatural luſt, ſuicide, revenge, and the moſt vile and ſenſeleſs idolatry, which tended alike to debaſe the mind and corrupt the morals. Let any man read the hiſtories of the ancient monarchies of the world or the moral writings of ancient philoſophers, and he will be convinced that mankind has been greatly reformed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in principles and practice by the chriſtian inſtitution. Its good effects were indeed much more viſible, when it firſt appeared in the world, than they have been in later ages. Then it wrought with ſurpriſing power and energy in reforming many
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016306_0023_0F9C1F4796A6EB70"/>
who embraced it; and oftentimes from ſome of the worſt, made them ſome of the beſt of men. But even in later times, its good influence is not ſmall. It muſt be owned, with grief and concern, that wickedneſs too much abounds in every chriſtian country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But we have reaſon to believe that there are many good men among the bad; and more than there would have been, were it not for the goſpel: And however diſſolute the generality may be in any chriſtian country, they would without doubt be much worſe, if they had never been favored with revelation. In a word, if you compare any country where the goſpel is enjoyed in its purity, with ſome of the ancient heathen countries, or even with ſome of modern times, you will be convinced that it is not an uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs but an highly beneficial inſtitution: And while we have undeniable evidence that many men have been made better by embracing chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, we may challenge all the records of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to produce a ſingle inſtance of any man's being made better by rejecting it. But,</p>
            <p n="7">7. If we conſider the character of ſome of thoſe who have believed and profeſſed the goſpel, we ſhall have further evidence that it is not ſhameful, fooliſh or unreaſonable for us to do ſo too.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe who embraced chriſtianity in its early days, there were ſome men of diſtinguiſhed learning and mental abilities. Not to mention the Apoſtle Paul himſelf, who was undoubtedly a man of ſuperior rational powers, and acquainted
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016306_0024_0F9C1F484C59D998"/>
with all the learning of his day; and who would, therefore, have been as likely as any man to have diſcovered it, if there had been any thing abſurd or unreaſonable in the chriſtian religion; any thing which a wiſe man ought to have been aſhamed to patroniſe:—There were Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Origen, Minucius Felix and others, whoſe writings in favor of chriſtianity ſhew them to have been men of penetrating geniuſes and vaſt erudition. Nor could they be induced to embrace this cauſe by any worldly motives: Theſe were all on the other ſide. The cauſe was then deſpiſed and perſecuted by the powers of the world. They could be influenced only by the evidence of truth. Nor have there been wanting all along ſuch men, who have not been aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But in later days, and in the land of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, there have been, among the friends of chriſtianity, perſons who are acknowledged, thro' all the learned world, to have been eminent for their learning and talent of reaſoning; ſuch as Doctors S. Clarke, Butler, Chandler, Leland, Lardner, Benſon, &amp;c. Theſe men appear from their writings to have been entirely free from enthuſiaſm and ſuperſtition, impartial enquirers after truth, with peculiar abilities for diſcovering it. But it may be ſaid that being miniſters of Chriſt, they were, in a ſenſe, bribed to eſpouſe his cauſe, their <hi>living</hi> depending upon the credit and ſupport of it. If any man, after attending to the marks of penetration and integrity which their writings diſcover, can think this objection
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016306_0025_0F9C1F490E7BAFF8"/>
ſufficient to invalidate their teſtimony, it will be to no purpoſe for me to attempt to convince him of the contrary. There are however other perſons, with equal juſtice, famed for their mental abilities, who have declared for the ſame cauſe, againſt whom this objection does not lie. I have particularly in view Mr. Boyle, Mr. Locke, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Addiſon, the late Lord Littleton, &amp;c. Theſe were all men, whoſe character for erudition and accurate reaſoning has been long eſtabliſhed in the republic of literature; and tho' no clergymen, they were not aſhamed to employ their pens in the cauſe of revelation, and thought it their duty and their honor to become the diſciples of Chriſt. Some of theſe men who have been mentioned were perhaps as great maſters of reaſon as any age or country ever produced; and after examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evidences of the goſpel with great care and diligence, and hearing all the objections of its adverſaries, they were fully convinced of its divine original. How ſurpriſing then, is it, that ſo many perſons of the preſent day, who have ſcarcely abilities to trace one of the eaſieſt of Sir Iſaac's demonſtrations, or underſtand a ſingle page of Locke's eſſay, ſhould pretend to diſcover that the new teſtament is all a forgery, unworthy of credit! But there have not been wanting, in our own country, men eminent for their literary abilities and acquirements, who have ſubſcribed to the truth of chriſtianity. You will, no doubt think of my excellent predeceſſor in the work of the miniſtry as one inſtance of this.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. J. MAYHEW, D. D.</note> Others of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:016306_0026_0F9C1F49D5F1EF68"/>
the ſame <hi>order,</hi> both living and dead, might be mentioned. But I mean to take particular notice only of one, who was no clergyman; one who was lately an honor to his country, a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ornament and bleſſing to our College, and the delight and pride of his friends; but is now, alas! no more;—the learned Profeſſor, Doctor Winthrop.<note n="†" place="bottom">He died May 3d, 1779.</note> You have probably many of you ſeen his teſtimony, delivered the day before he died, in favor of the divine original of the holy ſcriptures; in which, among other things he ſays, <q>The light thrown upon the doctrine of a future ſtate by the glorious goſpel, with me amounts to a demonſtration. The hope that is ſet before us in the New-Teſtament, is the only thing which will ſupport a man in his dying hour. If any man builds upon any other foundation, in my apprehenſion, his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will fail.</q> But it was not only as a dying man that he ſhewed himſelf a believer in chriſtianity. He was a public profeſſor of it, a great part of his life; and his careful conformity to its precepts proved that he was a ſincere one. He frequently took occaſion, among his friends, both to pleaſe and inſtruct them by making obſervations for illuſtrating the ſenſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the authority, of revelation. In a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate converſation with me, not a great while ago, he gave me a freſh and convincing evidence of his firm attachment to chriſtianity: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his grief at-the neglect with which many among us were diſpoſed to treat it at this day. I wiſh, ſays he, the preſent generation would
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016306_0027_0F9C1F4A90AF9370"/>
remember the deſign upon which their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers came into this country, and the regard they ſhewed to religion in all their tranſactions: and conſider, that they meant to hand down their religion as well as their worldly poſſeſſions to their poſterity. He ſpoke particularly of the reaſonableneſs of obſerving the poſitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt; and ſaid that he did not ſee how the neglect of them could be excuſed, or what reaſon any man, who called himſelf a chriſtian, could give for ſuch neglect. Though I am not certain that I have exactly recited his words, I am confident that I have not miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſenſe of what he ſaid, though I may not have given the whole of it.</p>
            <p>Now this teſtimony of Dr. Winthrop muſt be a good evidence to thoſe who knew his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that it argues neither ignorance, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuperſtition or enthuſiaſm, to believe the goſpel. He was naturally poſſeſſed of great ſtrength of mind and clearneſs of conception: By a cloſe application to ſtudies he had intimately acquainted himſelf with moſt of the branches of human learning, and in ſome of them ſhone without a rival in this part of the world: He had accumulated and digeſted a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that ſeldom falls to the ſhare of one man: By his purſuit of mathematical ſtudies he had acquired a habit of juſt reaſoning, and of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending his belief till he ſaw evidence to ſupport it;—the natural conſequence of ſuch ſtudies: The integrity of his heart rendered him a fair and impartial reaſoner: His <hi>Lectures,</hi> and the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016306_0028_0F9C1F4C418C83D0"/>
few publications with which he favoured the world, ſhewed him to have been poſſeſſed of uncommon talents for inveſtigating, as well as for communicating truth: He had ſtudied the holy ſcriptures in their original languages with critical attention: He was thoroughly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the controverſy between chriſtians and deiſts, and had read all the objections of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. Poſſeſſed of ſuch advantages, there is, I think, the higheſt probability that his opinion concerning the authority of revelation was juſt. This, you have heard, was, that the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the word of God: In this faith he lived and died.</p>
            <p>Since then revelation has had ſuch friends, need any man bluſh to own himſelf a chriſtian! Yea, would not a modeſt man be aſhamed to reject chriſtianity without the fulleſt evidence of its falſehood, when it has been pronounced true, by men of ſuch learning and abilities, after the ſtricteſt examination? I do not mean that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or teſtimony of any uninſpired man, or number of men ought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to govern our religious belief, when we have opportunity to examine for ourſelves; which is the right and duty of all. But having ſuch names among the friends of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, muſt at leaſt ſhew that a belief of the goſpel may be the reſult of careful enquiry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with impartiality and great mental abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But enough, I truſt, has been ſaid to ſhew that chriſtians have reaſon to glory in, rather than to be aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt.— A brief application of the ſubject ſhall conclude my diſcourſe.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:016306_0029_0F9C1F4D2FCC7EF8"/>1. What has been ſaid ſhould fill as with love and gratitude to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the chriſtian inſtitution, ſo wiſe and benevolent, ſo excellently calculated to recover us from our degeneracy, and make us perfect in righteouſneſs and felicity. Let us therefore call upon our ſouls and all that is within us to praiſe the name of God, that thro' his tender mercies, the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſtianity being of ſo much importance to mankind, we have reaſon to bleſs God that we have the teſtimony of ſo many men of great abilities and approved integrity to its divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This will often, and ought to have its weight with others, and make them cautious how they reject, without examination, a religion, which has been approved by ſuch men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since it is no ſhame, but an honor to be a chriſtian, let all who profeſs to be ſuch, take care that they are not a ſhame and diſgrace to their religion. Let them cautiouſly avoid every thing contrary to the laws of Chriſt, every thing beneath the dignity of their profeſſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to adorn the doctrine of their God and Savior by all holy converſation and godlineſs: If they do thus, they may juſtly glory in the goſpel of Chriſt, and will find it to be the power of God to ſalvation to thoſe that believe.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:016306_0030_0F9C1F4DABC12C00"/>4. If there be any perſons preſent, who think it diſhonorable to believe chriſtanity, and for that reaſon are diſpoſed to reject it without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, or to neglect any of the duties of it, let me particularly recommend to their conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation what has been offered in the foregoing diſcourſe. Let them treat religion fairly, and give it a candid and careful examination before they ſet themſelves againſt it. The laſt argument that was urged ſhould be ſufficient to induce them to this, without any other conſideration. Will you not acknowledge, that he would act a very fooliſh and abſurd part, who ſhould take upon him to contradict and ridicule the mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical or philoſophical opinions of thoſe great men who were there mentioned, without any evidence of their falſhood? And can it be leſs abſurd and fooliſh to treat their religious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in this way, without examining them? If human authority is to have any influence in this affair, as it is reaſonable that it ſhould, with thoſe who have not examined for themſelves; <hi>that</hi> of theſe men ought to weigh more than that of all thoſe who have ever wrote againſt revelation, from Celſus and Julian, the apoſtate, down to the preſent day. Infidelity has no names to boaſt of among its advocates, to be compared with theſe, for learning, penetration, juſt reaſoning and integrity of heart: And if you will be implicit believers, they are as worthy to be confided in, as any uninſpired men that ever lived in the world;—much more ſo than a Shaftſbury or a Woolſton, a Tindal or a Collins, a Morgan or a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016306_0031_0F9C1F52A794E770"/>
Bolinbroke; or even than the accute and ſubtle Hume, or that univerſal apoſtle of infidelity, the gay and ſprightly Voltaire. And whether moſt of our modern infidels are not the implicit diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of theſe or other revilers of religion, let thoſe judge who know how illiterate and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the controverſy concerning the truth of the goſpel, they generally are. But let me tell you, my brethren, that almoſt all the writers againſt revelation manifeſt ſuch unfairneſs of mind, ſuch want of candor, by their miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations and ſophiſtry, as render them unfit to be truſted without great caution. But perhaps it is in imitation of the free-thinkers and gay-livers of our own time and country, that ſo many among us are diſpoſed to liſt on the ſide of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. But do you know or have you known any man among theſe, ſo likely to form a juſt concluſion reſpecting the truth of the goſpel as <hi>our</hi> late excellent Profeſſor?—Any who had equal advantages for examining this point, and who have conſidered it with equal attention and impartiality? This you will not pretend. And I doubt not but every impartial, reaſonable man, will acknowledge that his ſingle teſtimony, in this caſe, ought to weigh more than that of all the infidels this country has ever produced, however fruitful it may lately have been in theſe degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate plants; and that it would be more honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be an implicit believer in him than in them. However I do not mean, that you ſhould build your religion upon human authority, as has been intimated before: I would rather exhort you to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016306_0032_0F9C1F5444742EB8"/>
ſtudy the ſcriptures and their evidences for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that your faith may not ſtand in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men, but in the power of God. Prove all things; hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FINALLY, Let me recommend it to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and thoſe who have the care of young perſons, to endeavor early to impreſs them with a ſenſe of the excellency of the chriſtian religion, with juſt notions of honor, and a reverence for God; and teach them that there is nothing ſo ſhameful as vice and impiety. Let them caution them againſt the company and books of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of revelation; <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"The danger to be ſure is not great, leſt thoſe profound philoſophers the modern deiſts ſhould gain many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, except among people of their own pitch of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. But youth, who have not had their belief of chriſtianity eſtabliſhed in a convincing manner upon a thorough knowledge of its evidences, are liable to be drawn aſide by the moſt wretched ſophiſtry. They ought therefore to be forewarned and prepared for the cavils (poor and feeble as they are) of that unhappy ſet of men, who reaſon as a perſon might be expected to do, who was born with wrong ſide of his brain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and may be ſafely told, That the following are two or three of their moſt formidable arguments againſt the chriſtian religion. <q>That it can never ſignify much, whether mankind believe or reject the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an faith, if their practiſe be right.</q> Which is much about as good ſenſe as to ſay, It is no great matter, whether the moſt effectual method that can be imagined, for compaſſing a deſign, be taken, ſo the deſign be compaſſed, or That it does not much ſignify, in raiſing a ſtructure, whether a good foundation be laid or not, ſo the ſtructure be raiſed. Again, That the light of reaſon is "ſufficient for mankind, and that revelation is of no manner of uſe, and therefore ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected." Which, ſetting aſide its being found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, That the light of reaſon and revelation both are not too much, is to the ſame purpoſe as to ſay, The naked eye is ſufficient to ſhew us, that there are planets in the ſky, and therefore teleſcopes are of no manner of uſe in aſtronomy, though they may ſhew us many ſurprizing phenomena in each of them, that never were thought of before the invention of that noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. <q>That morality is all, and therefore the rejection of a particular revelation can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing in the ſight of God.</q> As if it was not as much an immorality and as criminal in the ſight of God to oppoſe, or even to neglect what comes with all the characters, internal and external, of a revelation from him, as to injure one's neighbour. <q>That chriſtianity cannot be a revelation from God, elſe it had been communicated with equal advantage to all mankind."</q> Which is as good left-handed arguing, as to ſay, That reaſon cannot be the gift of God, elſe it had been communicated with equal advantages to every idiot as to Sir Iſaac Newton." <bibl>Dr. CHANDLER's thoughts on education.</bibl>
