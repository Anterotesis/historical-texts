            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IF there is (as who can say their is not?) a <hi>Declension</hi> in the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> from what once they were, it is not to be wondred at: For in the Primitive Dayes of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity it was so; and this whilest the Apostles were yet Living. In the Churches in <hi>Galatia,</hi> there was a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious observation of <hi>Holy-daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks.</hi> And in those in <hi>Asia</hi> were greater Errors, and a Scandalous neglect of Discipline in several of them. But in the very next Age to the Apostles, the <hi>Defection</hi> from <hi>Primitive Purity,</hi> was greater and more general, especially in matters relating to <hi>Church-Discipline.</hi> Then began the Contest about the Day when <hi>Easter</hi> should be kept. <hi>Polycarp</hi> (the Bishop of <hi>Smyrna</hi> who was an Holy man,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001077_0004_0FAFDF02B60383C0"/>
&amp; Dyed a Martyr) and the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches with him, pleaded for its Observation on the Fourteenth day of the Month. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicetus</hi> (the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) and with him the <hi>Western</hi> Churches, would keep the Fifteenth day: The former pretending the Authority of the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> for their practice, and the latter the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Peter.</hi> And how strange is it, that <hi>Polycrates</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus</hi> in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that so he might make <hi>Iohn</hi> to be of greater Authority then <hi>Peter,</hi> alledged that he was a Priest, and wore the the High-Priests Golden Crown, when as 'tis known that <hi>Iohn</hi> was of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>; nor would any Christian put on those Sacerdotal Ornaments. It is to be admired, that they who lived so near the dayes of the Apostles, should pretend their Authority for a practice in the Churches which they never taught. <hi>Ireneus</hi> in <hi>Eusebius</hi> sayes that in this, <hi>Their Fore-fathers had delivered to their Posterity a Custome which crept into the Churches through Ignorance.</hi> And <hi>Socrates</hi> in his <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> acknowledgeth tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neither our Saviour nor His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, did Ordain the keeping of that

                     </gap> by the Scripture, were observed in many Churches within a few Ages of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. We find in <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>'s second <hi>Apology,</hi> that they mixed Water with the Wine, at the Lords Supper; and that the Deacons carried the Elements to such as were absent: both which practices were not according to <hi>Divine Institution</hi>: And yet it was thus within Fifty Years after some of the Apostles were living. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise additions to the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, such as, <hi>Oyle, Milk, Honey, signing with the sign of the Cross, and Superstitious Garments</hi>; with other Ceremonies, crept into the Churches in the early Times of Christianity, and made way for <hi>Popery.</hi> So did <hi>the Glory by degrees depart</hi> from the Churches. None of these Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions do as yet obtain in the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi>: But what may in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Time, who can tell?</p>
                  <p>It has been objected to <hi>Non-conformist's,</hi> that Modes and Forms of Worship, and Church Discipline, are <hi>small Matters,</hi> and not Essentials of Religion, and that therefore men should not Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That Pious and Learned Divine (who was Tutor to the late Arch Bishop <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> when in the University) Mr <hi>Clerkson</hi> in his Sermons on <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. has Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Judiciously Answered such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors;
<q>Shewing how the Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ have chosen rather to submit to the extremest Sufferings then to Sin, though it were but in a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Divine Worship: And that things which are but small in their first beginning, may become great in their Progress and tendency: <hi>e. g.</hi> Imposed Forms of Prayer, made way for the <hi>Mass,</hi> and for all the Coruptions of it. If stinted Liturgies had not been at first yielded to, the Popish Mass could never have taken place. Again, the first step to the Popes Throne, was the introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a Superiority amongst ordinary Officers in the Church. This by degrees rose to the Papal Heighth. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of Saints and Martyrs at the place of their Sepulchres, made way for the Idolatry of Prayer to them. If

He further adds, that the smaller the matter is which we suffer for, presuming it to be an Evil, the more Honourable and the more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable will our Sufferings be. It is a great Honour to Christ, that He has any in the world who will suffer much, rather then swerve from Him in the least. And it will be Comfortable to those that Suffer, because this will argue much Love to Christ, and great Fear of Sin, and so will be a great Evidence of Sincerity.

And if they are known to be such, they that bring them in Pollute the Sanctuary, and cause the Glory to Depart out of it. When both the Worship and the Worshippers are such as God approveth, there is a great Glory on such Assemblies, and a singular Presence of the Lord with them, as long as they continue to be such. Then <hi>upon all the Glory shall be a Defence.</hi> Isa. 4.5.

When many of these are removed at once, the

Glory does not use to stay long after them. Especially, this is true of Men in Publick place, who are eminently Faithful. A Magistrate who is not of a worldly, selfish, private Spirit, but whose Heart is set for God, has a great Presence of the Lord with him, Judg, 2.18, 19. <hi>When the Lord raised them up Iudges then the Lord was with the Iudge, and delivered them out of the hand of their Enemies, all the dayes of the Iudge.</hi> As long as that Eminent man Lived, the Glory departed not; but as soon as he was Dead, sad Changes came upon the Land in a little time. Sometimes when one Eminent man is removed, the Glory of a People is Buried with him. It was very much so when <hi>Iosiah</hi> Died. Then did the Lords People say truly, <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Head.</hi> Lam. 5.16. Which is in other words, <hi>The Glory is departed from us.</hi> A Praying Magistrate may do much towards detaining the Glory still. So did <hi>Moses,</hi> when the Glory was going from the Church in the wilderness, by his Prayers he stayed it. So Ministers who have an <hi>Eminency</hi> of Gifts &amp; Grace, have a great
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001077_0043_0FAFDF5E360F4B60"/>
Presence of the Holy Spirit with them. It is said of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he was <hi>full of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Such are instruments in the hand of Christ, by whom the <hi>Glory</hi> is continued. <hi>Elijah,</hi> and after him <hi>Elisha</hi> were as the <hi>Chariots of</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>and the Horsemen thereof.</hi> It was by their means that the <hi>Glory</hi> was kept from being totally removed. In the beginning Times of Christianity, whilest the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Lived, who were richly furnished with Gifts and Graces, there was a <hi>Glory</hi> on the Churches, which after their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease went away. Some Errors in Doctrine crept into the Churches before <hi>Iohn</hi> who outlived the other Apostles was Dead: And in some Churches, the Discipline of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> quite laid aside. And in the very next Age to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, some Ministers who were good men, and suffered Martyrdom at last; nevertheless, did in matters relating to <hi>Church-Government,</hi> degenerate from the simplicity of the Gospel, and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diverse Superstitions, which were never taught nor practised by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, their immediate Predecessors: witness the Contest about <hi>Easter,</hi> and

by a Faithful and Impartial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of that Holy Discipline, which Christ has Commanded, the Lord and His Glory will not long abide in that Church. He cannot endure to dwell where sin is indulged. It is grievous to an Holy man, to be amongst those that allow themselves in Wickedness. Psal. 120.5. <hi>Wo is me that I sojourn in</hi> Mesech, <hi>and dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar. And will the Holy God dwell in such Tents as these are? It is a sign that the Lord is withdrawn from men, when they are left to Scandalous Sins. And when they give way to such sins, they provoke Him to depart from them more dreadfully, and so to deprive them of their Glory. Hos. 4.7. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Look to it, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be not removed from thee. For it begins to go. It is come to the Threshold of the House, if not to the <hi>East-Gate.</hi> And inasmuch as it is on the Departure it may be gone suddenly.

you, and cast you out of my presence.</hi> The Lord stirreth up the Hearts of His Messengers, to give notice that the Glory is going before the removal of it: And this it may be a long time before hand. So did God deal with the Old world. <hi>Noah</hi> continued Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and Warning them an Hundred and Twenty Years before the Flood came, which put an end to all their Glory. Thus also did the Lord deal with the <hi>Iews.</hi> He sent many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to them. There are above Twenty Prophets whose Names are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, by whom the Lord warned that People. The Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> for Three and Twenty Years together (as himself takes notice) told them what was coming. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25.3.

Thus did the Lord threaten His People, Lev. 26.21. <hi>If you will walk contrary to me, &amp; will not hearken to me, I will bring Seven times more Plagues upon you, according to your Sins.</hi> And again, he sayes, 23. <hi>If you will not be reformed by these things, I will punish you yet seven times for your si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Isa. 9.1. <hi>At the first He lightly afflicted the Land of</hi> Zebulon, <hi>and the Land of</hi> Naphtali, <hi>and afterwards did more grievously afflict her.</hi> Thus it was, first one of the Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi> came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ten Tribes, and put them under Contribution, making them to pay a Thousand Talents of Silver, which amounted unto above Three Hundred
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001077_0050_0FAFDF64417104C0"/>
and Forty Thousand Pounds Sterling. After that, there came another King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and depopulated a considerable part of the Countrey, making the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants his Captives. After that, there came a third King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> viz. <hi>Shalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anasser,</hi> and he destroyed the Capital City, and proved a sweeping Judgment to the whole Land. So was the Glory Total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Eternally removed from all the <hi>Ten</hi> Tribes. To the like purpose does the Lord speak by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> saying, <hi>I will be to</hi> Ephraim <hi>as a Moth.</hi> You know a <hi>Moth</hi> does leasurely and by degrees consume and marr mens Clothes. In like manner, from the Death of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reboam,</hi> God had been weakning <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi> viz. the Ten Tribes by various Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, especially by Divisions among themselves. <hi>And to the House of</hi> Judah <hi>as Rottenness</hi>; or as a <hi>Worm,</hi> as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal word imports. A <hi>Worm</hi> does not Rot the wood all at once, but gradually. Thus was it with the Two Tribes, called <hi>The House of</hi> Judah: Lesser Judgments were the forerunners of, and but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to Greater, which issued in a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal removal of the Glory. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

further added in the Fourteenth verse, <hi>I will be to</hi> Ephraim <hi>as a Lion, and as a Young Lion to the House of</hi> Judah, <hi>I even I will Tear and go away.</hi> Thus we see, that lesser make way for <hi>Tearing Iudgments</hi> at last. The Lord comes on His People first as a <hi>Moth,</hi> but after that as a <hi>Lion.</hi> Now as Judgments come, the Glory goes away: and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signs and forerunners thereof. The Death of a Professing people is in the Total Departure of the Glory. Now, as Diseases do by degrees bring Death on the Body, so lesser Judgments do by degrees insensibly weaken a People, and make way for that Judgment which at last proves fatal to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>God useth to favour His People with a day of Grace.</hi> He giveth time for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

Isa. 30.18. <hi>Therefore will the Lord wait that He may be Gracious to you.</hi> In the mean time, He continues calling on them by His Word, and striving with them by His Holy Spirit, and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for many Years together, before there is a Total removal of the Glory. Neh. 9.30. <hi>Many Years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets.</hi> Nor does all the Glory alwayes depart as soon as the Day of Grace is expired.</p>

The day of Grace may be past with a particular person, and with a people also, when nevertheless, the day of Patience may still continue. Was it not so with the Old world?

appointed season of them. In those dayes what manner of persons will there be in Power as to Civil Government, and what kind of Laws shall there be Established?

When once the Glory is quite gone, it seldom returns again: But as tis said of the Living Creatures in <hi>Ezekiels Vision,</hi> Ezek. 1.17. <hi>They returned not when they went.</hi> So the Glory that went away from the Temple returned not when it went.

thee. Such places as have been most Eminent for Religion, and the Light of the Gospel (as <hi>New-England</hi> has) when once they have sinned away that Light become the Darkest and Miserablest places under Heaven.

And my Dearly Beloved, you must needs bear me witness at the Last day, that I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole Counsel of God. Two Considerations have induced me (at this time lest it should be too late) to Preach this Sermon. One, is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I sometimes hope that I have not long to be in this world. Full Forty Years are expired since God brought me to dispense His Word in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. It is then high Time for me to be thinking what my <hi>Last words</hi> shall be.

gone from you. But if I must be so unhappy as to remain longer in this Evil world, I look for Persecution- If won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Revolutions in the world prevent it not, such a Time is hastning, as upon the whole Protestant Interest, so upon these Churches in a special manner. In all probability a Storm is coming: And what reason have I to promise my self an Exemption from suffering in it. I do not mean only Persecution by the wicked Pens &amp; Tongues of men, in which you know that I have often had a singular share: But I expect that the dayes are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when Snares will be laid for my Life. As in one of the late Reigns it was so, when Treasonable things were by Evil men forged against me. It is Related in the Martyr Books concerning <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that when malicious Reports occasioned him some trouble, the King told him he was in greater danger then himself was aware of, not only in that his Zeal in the cause of Religion had caused him many Adversaries, but in that it was an easy matter for his Enemies to procure two or three false witnesses against him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And, <hi>Why not against you</hi> (said the King)

                  <p>THIS with the preceeding Chapter contains the substance of a Sermon Preached by our Lord Jesus Christ, unto his Disciples. The conclusion of the Sermon (which begins with this Verse) contains a description of <hi>the Day of Iudgment</hi>; wherein there is an allusion unto the Jewish <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or <hi>great Court of Iudgment</hi>: in which besides the <hi>Nasi</hi> or <hi>Chief Iudge,</hi> there were Seventy other <hi>Iudges</hi>; and there were <hi>Scribes</hi> appointed, some at the <hi>Right-hand</hi> of the Judge, who did set down the <hi>Votes</hi> for <hi>Absolution</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Others at the <hi>Left-hand</hi> of the Judge, who did set down the <hi>Votes</hi> for <hi>Condemnation.</hi> There is an Allusion thereunto, in that Description of the <hi>Day of Iudgment,</hi> which we have in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of this Chapter. In this Verse there are three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Intimation <hi>who shall be the Iudge</hi> in that Day; <hi>The Son of Man shall come in his Glory.</hi>
