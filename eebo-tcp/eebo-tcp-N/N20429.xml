      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

No muſcles on her lovely hand were ſeen,</l>
                  <l>But only bones envelop'd by a ſkin.</l>
                  <l>Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare,</l>

                  <l>Wiſe nature in her providential care,</l>
                  <l>Did, kindly, bones from vile corruption ſpare,</l>

                  <l>FROM weſtern ſkies, a cloud of glory came,</l>
                  <l>A ſmall, dim ſpot, a torch of lambent flame;</l>
                  <l>Aſcending, widening, ſlow the ſkirts unroll'd,</l>
                  <l>Rainbow'd with fire, and warm'd with glowing gold.</l>
                  <l>There, borne by ſummon'd winds, in pomp ſublime,</l>
                  <l>His look far-piercing down the vaſt of time,</l>
                  <l>Where the long, narrowing vale deſerts the eye,</l>
                  <l>Unboſom'd dimly on the eternal ſky,</l>
                  <l>The Genius fate. He ſaw, when faction ſpent,</l>
                  <l>No more with war his darling kingdom rent;</l>
                  <l>The ſtream of kindred blood forbore to flow,</l>

                  <l>Pois'd in their hands, Columbia's mighty ſway,</l>

                  <l>For dogs of every kindred famed,</l>
                  <l>And from true doggiſh manners named.</l>
                  <l>One morn, a greyhound paſs'd the ſtreet;</l>

Yet the ſchemes of Columbus, however well plann'd,</l>
                  <l>Were ſcarely ſufficient to find the main land;</l>
                  <l>On the iſlands alone with the natives he ſpoke,</l>

                  <l>Sent over a ſquadron, aſſerting his claim.</l>
                  <l>(Had his ſword and title been equally ſlender,</l>
                  <l>In vain had they ſummon'd Mynheer to ſurrender)</l>
                  <l>The ſoil they demanded or threaten'd their worſt,</l>
                  <l>Inſiſting that Cabot had look'd at it firſt.</l>
                  <l>The want of a ſquadron to fall on their rear,</l>
                  <l>Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer—</l>
                  <l>Force ended the conteſt—the right was a ſham,</l>
                  <l>And the Dutch were ſent packing to hot Surinam.</l>
                  <l>'Twas hard to be thus of their labours deprived,</l>
                  <l>But the age of republics had not yet arriv'd—</l>
                  <l>Fate ſaw—tho' no wizzard could tell them as much,</l>
                  <l>—That the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.</l>

                  <l>COLUMBUS looked; and ſtill around them ſpread,</l>
                  <l>From ſouth to north, th' immeaſurable ſhade;</l>
                  <l>At laſt, the central ſhadows burſt away,</l>
                  <l>And riſing regions open'd on the day.</l>
                  <l>He ſaw, once more, bright Del'ware's ſilver ſtream,</l>
                  <l>And Penn's throng'd city caſt a cheerful gleam;</l>
                  <l>The dome of ſtate, that met his eager eye,</l>
                  <l>Now heav'd its arches in a loftier ſky.</l>
                  <l>The burſting gates unfold: and lo, within,</l>
                  <l>A ſolemn train, in conſcious glory, ſhine.</l>
                  <l>The well-known forms his eye had trac'd before,</l>
                  <l>In diff'rent realms along th' extended ſhore;</l>
                  <l>Here, grac'd with nobler fame, and rob'd in ſlate,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>High on the foremoſt ſeat, in living light,</l>
                  <l>Majeſtic Randolph caught the hero's ſight:</l>
                  <l>Fair on his head, the civic crown was plac'd,</l>
                  <l>And the firſt dignity his ſceptre grac'd.</l>
                  <l>He opes the cauſe, and points in proſpect far,</l>
                  <l>Thro' all the toils that wait th' impending war—</l>
                  <l>But, hapleſs ſage, thy reign muſt ſoon be o'er,</l>
                  <l>To lend thy luſtre, and to ſhine no more.</l>
                  <l>So the bright morning ſtar, from ſhades of ev'n,</l>
                  <l>Leads up the dawn, and lights the front of heav'n,</l>
                  <l>Points to the waking world the ſun's broad way,</l>
                  <l>Then veils his own, and ſhines above the day.</l>
                  <l>And ſee great Waſhington behind thee riſe,</l>
                  <l>Thy following ſun, to gild our morning ſkies;</l>

O'er ſhadowy climes to pour the enliv'ning flame,</l>

                  <l>High, on his locks of age, a wreath was brac'd,</l>

                  <l>Is known to many a bard in theſe our days:</l>
                  <l>Apollo's drink, they find, is void of ſpirit—</l>
                  <l>Mere chicken-broth—inſipid as their lays:</l>

                  <l>And yet thou'rt grateful in that ſultry day,</l>

                  <l>Gallons of ink are ſquirted in his face;</l>

                  <l>HAPPY the man who, ſafe on ſhore,</l>
                  <l>Now trims, at home, his evening fire;</l>

                  <l>That on the tufted groves expire;</l>
                  <l>Alas! on us they doubly fall,</l>
                  <l>Our feeble bark muſt bear them all.</l>

                  <l>Wolves in their ſhaded caverns meet,</l>
                  <l>All, all are bleſt but wretched we—</l>
                  <l>For, doom'd a ſtranger to repoſe,</l>
                  <l>No reſt the unſettled ocean knows.</l>

                  <l>We ſaw the ſun's deſcending gloom,</l>
                  <l>No more to ſee the riſing ray;</l>
                  <l>But buried low, by far too deep,</l>
                  <l>On coral beds unpitied ſleep!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But what a ſtrange uncoaſted ſtrand</l>
                  <l>Is that where death permits no day,</l>
                  <l>No charts we have to mark that land,</l>
                  <l>No compaſs to direct the way!</l>
                  <l>What pilot ſhall explore that realm,</l>

                  <l>And tempeſts rage with lawleſs power,</l>
                  <l>Of friendſhip's voice I hear no ſound,</l>
                  <l>No comfort in this dreadful hour—</l>
                  <l>What friendſhip can in tempeſts be,</l>
                  <l>What comforts on this angry ſea!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The barque accuſtom'd to obey,</l>
                  <l>No more the trembling pilots guide,</l>
                  <l>Alone ſhe gropes her trackleſs way.</l>
                  <l>While mountains burſt on every ſide.</l>
                  <l>Thus ſkill and ſcience both muſt fall,</l>
                  <l>And ruin is the lot of all.</l>

The lamps—the knell—the coffin—gloom—</l>
                  <l>With all the horrors of a tomb,</l>

                  <l>HERE lies a fool fiat on his back,</l>
                  <l>The victim of a Cancer Quack;</l>
                  <l>Who loſt his money and his life,</l>
                  <l>By plaſter, cauſtic, and by knife.</l>
                  <l>The caſe was this—a pimple roſe,</l>
                  <l>South-eaſt a little of his noſe;</l>
                  <l>Which daily redden'd and grew bigger,</l>
                  <l>As too much drinking gave it vigour:</l>

                  <l>When fortune led him to peruſe</l>
                  <l>A hand-bill in the weekly news;</l>
                  <l>Sign'd by ſix fools of diff'rent ſorts,</l>

                  <l>Who recommend, with due ſubmiſſion,</l>
                  <l>This cancer-monger as magician;</l>
                  <l>Fear wing'd his flight to find the quack,</l>
                  <l>And prove his cancer-curing knack:</l>
                  <l>But on his way he found another,—</l>
                  <l>A ſecond advertiſing brother:</l>
                  <l>But as much like him as an owl</l>
                  <l>Is unlike every handſome fowl;</l>

                  <l>That ſweat forſooth, and cur'd the faſter.</l>
                  <l>This doctor view'd, with moony eyes</l>
                  <l>And ſcowl'd up face, the pimple's ſize;</l>
                  <l>Then chriſten'd it in ſolemn anſwer,</l>

So Science in the orient climes began,</l>

                  <l>From Egypt's ſchools to Greece was learning brought,</l>
                  <l>What Cadmus old, or Palamedes taught;</l>
                  <l>Her form illuſtrious Athens did illume,</l>

                  <l>Till Science on its fields began to ſmile.</l>

               <head>CHARACTER OF ST. TAMANY.</head>
               <byline>BY WILLIAM PRICHARD.</byline>
               <lg>
                  <l>IMMORTAL Tamany, of Indian race,</l>
                  <l>Great in the field, and foremoſt in the chace!</l>
                  <l>No puny ſaint was he, with faſting pale,</l>
                  <l>He climb'd the mountain, and he ſwept the vale,</l>
                  <l>Ruſh'd thro' the torrent with unequall'd might;</l>
                  <l>Your ancient ſaints would tremble at the ſight;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="224" facs="unknown:026795_0227_0FD1CE59E8BBCBA0"/>
Caught the ſwift boar, and ſwifter deer, with caſe,</l>
                  <l>And work'd a thouſand miracles like theſe.</l>
                  <l>To public views he added private ends,</l>
                  <l>And lov'd his country moſt, and next his friends;</l>
                  <l>With courage long he ſtrove to ward the blow,</l>
                  <l>(Courage we all reſpect ev'n in a foe,)</l>
                  <l>And when each effort he in vain had tried,</l>
                  <l>Kindled the flame in which he bravely died!</l>
                  <l>Let the full horn to Tamany go round,</l>
                  <l>His ſame let every honeſt tongue reſound!</l>
                  <l>With him let ev'ry gen'rous patriot vie,</l>
                  <l>To live in freedom, or with honour die.</l>
