            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lordſhip with this. As your Lordſhip was pleaſed to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <hi>laſt Paſtoral Letter,</hi> I think it my Duty to anſwer it in the beſt Manner I can.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of thoſe, who are committed to your <hi>Lordſhip'</hi>s Charge.—<hi>Luke-warmneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi>

are the two Rocks, againſt which even well-meaning People are in Danger of ſplitting All ought to be thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to ſteer a ſafe and middle Courſe—I would gladly hope, that, <hi>a Zeal for God in the Diſcharge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls</hi> moved your Lordſhip to write.—Theſe are the Principles, I truſt, which now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite me, to direct this Anſwer to your Lordſhip. And, bleſſed be <hi>God,</hi> that I can write with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that Love and Meekneſs which becomes a Diſciple of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and with all that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Reverence, which is due from a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter to a Biſhop of the Church of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lukewarmneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> my Lord, are certainly the Bane of true <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> I thank your Lordſhip again for your kind Cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The only Query is, <q>Whether there was any Occaſion for your Lordſhip's warning the People of your Dioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, againſt running into either of theſe Extremes, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing I have either ſpoken or wrote?</q> Your Lordſhip thinks there was; And you quote Paſſages out of my <hi>Journal</hi> to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of your Lordſhip and Them, with all my Heart.</p>
            <p>As for your Cautions againſt <hi>Lukewarmneſs,</hi> I am not much concerned in them. You do not ſeem to point at me in particular; unleſs it is, where your Lordſhip, (<hi>Page</hi> 10) informs your
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004457_0003_100D84166A8DE008"/>
People, <q>
                  <hi>That a diligent Attendance on the Duties of the Station wherein Providence has placed them, is, in the ſtricteſt Senſe, the ſerving of God.</hi>
               </q> None but thoſe, who condemn Me unheard, can juſtly charge Me with affirming to the contrary.</p>
            <p>However, I beg Leave to obſerve, that your Lordſhip, (<hi>Page</hi> 8.) calls that a very <hi>imperfect State</hi> of Chriſtianity, which is no <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at all. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 13. v. 5. ſays, <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in</hi> the Faith; <hi>Prove your own ſelves.</hi> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were <hi>in the Faith,</hi> truly ſo called, or not; he immediately adds, <hi>Know ye not your ownſelves, how that Chriſt Jeſus is</hi> IN you, <hi>except ye be Reprobates?</hi> So that, according to St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Rule, <q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented himſelf with a bare bodily Attendance upon the Publick Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the more groſs and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has reſted finally upon theſe as the Whole of that Chriſtianity requires of him;</q> is ſo far from being in a very <hi>imperfect State,</hi> as your Lordſhip is pleaſed to affirm, (<hi>Page</hi> 8) that he is in no State of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. No, My Lord, he is a <hi>Reprobate, i. e.</hi> one who at preſent is out of a State of Salvation, nor can he ever have any Aſſurance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <hi>Knows that Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004457_0004_100D8419A64B5070"/>
is IN Him,</hi> by the <hi>indwelling of His Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> If I have miſtaken your Lordſhip's Expreſſion, I will freely beg your Pardon.</p>
            <p>Another Thing, My Lord, to me ſeems dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed in (<hi>Page</hi> 8) (Oh<hi>!</hi> let not your Lordſhip be angry, for indeed I will endeavour to ſpeak with all Gentleneſs and Humility!) Your Lordſhip's Words are theſe. <q>
                  <hi>Nor need they any other Evidence beſides thoſe</hi> Good Diſpoſitions <hi>they find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of</hi> God <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operates with their honeſt Endeavours to ſubdue Sin and grow in Goodneſs.</hi>
               </q> If by <hi>Good Diſpoſitions,</hi> your Lordſhip only means <hi>Good Inclinations or Deſires,</hi> I deny <hi>That</hi> to be a ſufficient Evidence, that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> co-operates with their honeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ſubdue Sin and grow in Goodneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there is a great Difference between <hi>Good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> and <hi>Good Habits.</hi> Many have <hi>One,</hi> who never attain to the <hi>Other.</hi> Many have good Deſires to ſubdue Sin, and yet, reſting in thoſe good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>Sin has</hi> always had <hi>Dominion over them.</hi> A Perſon ſick of a Fever! may deſire to be in Health, but that Deſire is not Health it ſelf. In like Manner many have good Diſpoſitions or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be Good, but That is not Goodneſs it ſelf. And conſequently Men need more Evidence than good Depoſitions, to prove to Themſelves or Others, <q>That the Holy Spirit of <hi>God</hi> co-operates with their honeſt Endeavours to ſubdue Sin.</q> If by good <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> your Lordſhip means Good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004457_0004_100D8419A64B5070"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> ſuch as Peace, Love, Joy, Long-ſuffering, Goodneſs, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I then agree, a Man needs no other Evidence. For theſe are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip immediately adds, <q>Nor that, perſevering in their Courſe, and praying to <hi>God,</hi> for his Aſſiſtance, and relying upon the Merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the Pardon of all <hi>Such</hi> Sins, Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Imperfections, as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State.</q> I beg leave to ask your Lordſhip, whether this does not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour too much of the common Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are to do ſome thing for ourſelves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our own, and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o make UP the Deficiencies of That Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? What elſe can your Lordſhip mean, by ſaying, That we muſt rely on the Merits of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for the Pardon of <q>all <hi>Such</hi> Sins as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State?</q> Did <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> come into the World, My Lord, only to ſave us from the Guilt of <hi>Such Sins,</hi> as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, That Man hath no Righteouſneſs of his own, That <hi>there is none Righteous, no not one:</hi> That <hi>all Our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is as filſhy Rags;</hi> and that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died not only to ſave us from the Guilt of all <hi>ſuch Sins, Failings,</hi> and <hi>Infirmities,</hi> as are more or leſs unavoidable in this mortal State, but from all willful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004457_0005_100D841CCDB91B78"/>
Sins, and alſo from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-ſpring of <hi>Adam,</hi> brings into the World with him. I hope, I have not miſunderſtood or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained your Lordſhip's Expreſſion.</p>
            <p>I come now to your Lordſhip's Caution againſt <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> For that I ſuppoſe your Lordſhip intended more particularly againſt me.</p>
            <p>And here, my Lord, I beg Leave to obſerve, That, in my Opinion, your Lordſhip has by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>According to the fair Rules of Writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was it not firſt Incumbent on your Lordſhip to ſhew, that the Word <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> had a good as well as bad Meaning: That it ſignifies no more than <hi>a Perſon in God,</hi> and conſequently every Chriſtian, in the proper Senſe of the Word, is an <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And our Church ſays. If we receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthily, We are one with <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> with us, We dwell in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in us. For which ſhe has ſufficient Warrant from our <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> John 17. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on Me through their Word.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, As Thou Father art in me, and I</hi> in <hi>Thee, that they alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

that the Love wherewith Thou haſt loved me, may, be</hi> in <hi>them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I</hi> in <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, indeed your Lordſhip's Definition of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all. <q>
                  <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> is a ſtrong Perſwaſion on the Mind that they are guided in an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Manner, by immediate <hi>Impulſes</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>God.</hi>
               </q> Had your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſaid, a ſtrong but <hi>Groundleſs</hi> Perſwaſion, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, it would have been to your Lordſhip's Purpoſe. But to affirm, without any Reſtriction, that a ſtrong Perſwaſion that we are guided man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Manner by immediate Impulſes, is <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> in the worſt Senſe of the Word, when your Lordſhip yourſelf ſays, (<hi>Page</hi> 54) <q>There is, no doubt, but <hi>God,</hi> when He pleaſes can work upon the Minds of Men by <hi>extraordinary</hi> Influences,</q> to me ſeems a little inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p>Your Lordſhip proceeds thus. <q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of diſtinguiſhing aright between the <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> The extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Operations were thoſe, by which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Others, who were entruſted with the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to work Miracles, and ſpeak with Tongues in Teſtimony, that their Miſſion and Doctrine were from <hi>God.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0"/>
your Lordſhip does in your Paſtoral Letter. My conſtant Way of preaching is, firſt, to prove my Propoſitions by Scripture, and then to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate them by the Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>s and Collects of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Thoſe that have heard me, can witneſs, how often I have exhorted them to he conſtnat at the Publick Service of the Church. I attend on it my ſelf, and would read the Publick Liturgy every Day, if your Lordſhip's Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lordſhip require, that I do not ſuggeſt to your Lordſhip's People, <q>as if our Church were regardleſs of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>New Birth,</hi> and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to ſeek elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where for a more <hi>Spiritual</hi> Service.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the following Paragragh, your Lordſhip has the ſame Inſinuation, as though I wanted to introduce Extempore Prayer, and to lay aſide the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lordſhip had been ſpeaking againſt praying by the Spirit, and affirming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the <hi>ſingle Work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> your Lordſhip ſays to your People, <q>You have great Reaſon to be thankful to <hi>God,</hi> for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</q> My Lord, I never ſaid to the Contrary. But does not your Lordſhip ſeem to inſinuate at the ſame Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> to enable us to pray extempore, either in Publick, or private? That Prayer is not the <hi>ſingle
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0"/>
Work</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confeſs. But that the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> does aſſiſt true Chriſtians to pray extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, now, as well as formerly, is undeniable, if the Scriptures be true. For what ſays the Apoſtle? <hi>We know not what to pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit it ſelf helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings, that cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> And this is founded upon a general Promiſe, made to all <hi>God'</hi>s People. <hi>Zacharias</hi> 12. 10, <hi>I will pour upon the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and upon the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of Grace, and of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi> And I believe, my Lord, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Experience of all true Chriſtians, whether or no they did not find the <hi>spirit of Supplication,</hi> or a Power of praying without a Form, encreaſe in Proportion to the Encreaſe of <hi>God'</hi>s Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lordſhip confeſſes in the ſame Page, that the <q>Spirit of <hi>God</hi> does particularly aſſiſt us, in a due Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Religious Offices?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, as your Lordſhip ſeems to deny the immediate Aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addreſſes at the Throne of Grace, ſo your Lordſhip ſeems to deny it alſo in our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions. <q>In like Manner, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſays, we are firmly perſuaded in <hi>general,</hi> that we live under the gracious Influence of <hi>God'</hi>s <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and that he both excites and enables
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004457_0008_100D8423572AAA00"/>
us to do Good. But that this or that <hi>Thought</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> is an Effect of the ſole Motion, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Impulſe of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind;</q> (My Lord, who ever affirmed, that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impulſe of the Spirt of God? Your Lordſhip adds, <q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, do reſpectively contribute to this or that Thought or Action, in ſuch a Meaſure or to ſuch a Degree; theſe are Things we dare not ſay.</q> Indeed my Lord I <hi>dare ſay them.</hi> For if there be any ſuch Thing as a Particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, why may we not expect particular Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>God's</hi> Holy Spirit in a particular Caſes? Does not our Church, my Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> teach us to pray, that <hi>God'</hi>s Holy Spirit may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts? But your Lordſhip ſays, we dare not ſay this, becauſe our Saviour has told us, that we know no more of the working of the Spirit, than we know of the Wind, <hi>from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</hi> Neither need we know any more of them: But you muſt allow, that we know <hi>as much.</hi> Cannot your Lordſhip feel the Wind then? Does not your Lordſhip know when it makes any Impreſſion upon your Body? So eaſy it is for a Spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impreſſion upon his Soul. Without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging this, all the Expreſſions of being <hi>led by the Spirit, walking by the Spirit,</hi> and ſuch like, muſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004457_0008_100D8423572AAA00"/>
be only ſo many Words without any real Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Your Lordſhip acknowledges, that the Holy Spirit does act in <hi>general,</hi> and why not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For, can the <hi>One</hi> be without the <hi>Other?</hi> Does it not frequently happen, my Lord, that the Comfort and Happineſs of our whole Lives, depend on <hi>one particular</hi> Action? And where then, my Lord, is the Abſurdity of ſaying, that the Holy Spirit may even in the minuteſt Circumſtance direct and rule our Hearts? I have been the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, my Lord, on this Part of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Letter, becauſe if this be proved, many of your Lordſhip's Objections againſt my Journals, will fall to the Ground.</p>

               </q> And is not this, my Lord, a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Evidence that I act by a <hi>Divine Commiſſion?</hi> If this be not true, muſt not All thoſe whom your Lordſhip, or the other Biſhops ordain, act only by a <hi>Human Commiſſion?</hi> Nay, (to uſe the Words of Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Paſtoral Letter</hi>) <q>Muſt not they who are ordained, <hi>Lie</hi> not only unto Man but unto <hi>God,</hi> by ſaying, They are <hi>inwardly moved</hi> by the <hi>Holy Spirit?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If your Lordſhip in any wiſe diſputes my act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a <hi>Divine Commiſſion,</hi> you diſclaim your own Divine Right and Authority; nor can you poſſibly avoid the Dilemma, of either allowing <hi>my Divine Commiſſion,</hi> or denying <hi>your own.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Lordſhip has inſinuated a Demand for the Evidences of my <hi>Divine Commiſſion,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately follows theſe Words, <q>When they tell us of extraordinary Communications they have with <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>If by <hi>extraordinary Communications,</hi> your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip means the extraordinary Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> as working Miracles, and ſpeaking with Tongues; your Lordſhip may aſſure yourſelf, <hi>I</hi>

            <p>But pray, my Lord, where has the Scripture made good Works a <hi>Neceſſary Condition</hi> of our being juſtified in the Sight of God?

This, my Lord, is truly a New Goſpel. <hi>I</hi> am ſure it is not what the Apoſtles Preached; and it is as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Tenour of the Goſpel, as Light is contrary to Darkneſs.

as a <hi>neceſſary Fruit</hi> and <hi>Conſequënce,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>neceſſary Condtition</hi> of our being <hi>juſtified,</hi> your Lordſhip would have uſed your Authority aright. For we are commanded to ſhew forth or declare to others, that we have a <hi>True Faith</hi> by our <hi>Works.</hi> And the 12<hi>th</hi> Article of our Church ſays, that '<hi>good Works</hi> follow <hi>after Juſtification;</hi> and how then, my Lord, are they <hi>a neceſſary Condition</hi> of our <hi>Juſtification?</hi> No, my Lord, Salvation (if the Goſpel be true) is the Free Gift of God through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt. Faith</hi> is the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Means</hi> whereby that Salvation is applied to our Hearts, and good Works are the neceſſary <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Proof</hi> of that <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> This is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> And it is, becauſe the Generality of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do not Preach this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that I am reſolved, <hi>God</hi> being my Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to continue inſtant in Seaſon and out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to declare IT unto all Men, let the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as to my own private Perſon, be what they will.</p>
            <p>As for your Lordſhip's blaming me for raſhly cenſuring the Clergy, for their Practice, none are concerned, but my <hi>Indolent, Earthly-minded, Pleaſure-taking</hi> Brethren, (<hi>Page</hi> 39) And ſurely, your Lordſhip will not ſtand up in their Defence.

            <p>Would Time permit, I could now proceed to ſatisfy your Lordſhip more particularly about the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Benjamin Seward:</hi> But as that is done in a Letter ſent to my Lord of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in my laſt <hi>Journal;</hi> and as I am now to embark in a few Hours, <hi>I</hi> hope, your Lordſhip will excuſe me, if I only add my hearty Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for your Lordſhip's temporal and eternal Welfare, and ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>
