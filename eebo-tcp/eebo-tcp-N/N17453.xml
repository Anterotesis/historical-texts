            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>YOUR knowledge of the language in which theſe miſcellanies are written, your protection of the fine arts, and your civilities to the Author, induce him to addreſs this Collection to your Lordſhip. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the frankneſs of a free-born American to ſay, that your noble blood, and immenſe poſſeſſions, would be of little conſideration with the Republicans, whoſe Conſtitutions of Government you have made familiar to your own nation by tranſlating them into French, if unſupported by your perſonal merit and amiable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.</p>
            <p>THE frequency of naval intercourſe, and the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of polite literature, ſeem greatly to approximate the diſtant parts of the globe—the Atlantic is no barrier for limiting fame. Your reputation has been long ſince extenſively and advantageouſly known throughout the United States of America. That republican people cannot but admire ſo excellent a private character, ſo

The voice of undebauched reaſon, which is thus raiſed at this vaſt diſtance from you, to beſtow a tribute of applauſe on your virtues, is infinitely different from the venal voice of flattery. Nor ſhould the conſcious ſatisfaction, which reſults from the review of a life ſpent in beneficent purſuits, prevent a virtuous man from being alſo pleaſed with the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion that is entertained of his conduct, by ſuch of his fellow-men as can have no poſſible ſiniſter object to bias their judgments.</p>
            <p>IN preſenting for your amuſement the trifles which have been occaſionally compoſed at my leiſure hours, I aſſume nothing beyond the negative merit of not having ever written any thing unfavorable to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of freedom, humanity, and virtue.

            <head>From the Journal de Paris, May 7, 1786. Strictures on a Poem addreſſed to the American Armies.</head>
            <p>A GREAT many remarkable circumſtances render this little performance worthy of the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was compoſed in America, in 1782, at the encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of general Waſhington, when the Britiſh ſtill occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing New-York and Charleſton, the great cauſe of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican liberty was not then decided. The author is an American officer, writing in the midſt of the tumult of a camp, and conciliating the occupations and duties of his profeſſion, with that ſilence and meditation which every poetical compoſition demands. The tranſlator is a French general officer (M. le M. de Chattellux) in whom the talents of a great military and literary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter are acknowledged to be blended in a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary degree.</p>
            <p>THE object of the work is to animate the citizens of America to the defence of their country. The marcl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

animated with the ſame ſpirit, and endowed with the ſame talents, has not only transfuſed into our language the beauties of the original, but even added new ones to them.</p>
            <p>THE tranſlator himſelf announces in his letter to Col. Humphreys, that he has not piqued himſelf upon being literal, and that he has taken ſome liberties in his tranſlation. But he is right in ſaying that this liberty does not go ſo far as independence: for that which he adds, is ſo connected with the text itſelf, that it may be conſidered as a development of his author's idea; and what he retrenches (being commonly foreign to our idiom and phraſeology) would not have been preſerved by the American author himſelf, if, more familiariſed with our language, he had been pleaſed to tranſlate his work into French. This liberty may be criticiſed: but we will ſay, in juſtification of the tranſlator, that the author is very far from complaining of it.</p>
            <p>THIS little poem is ſcarcely ſuſceptible of extracts, We will only cite the apoſtrophe to Gen. Waſhington, when he comes to take command of the American army.</p>

THE recital of the death of Brown, who periſhed in an ambuſcade of ſavages, of Scammel who was aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by a piſtol-ſhot in the reins, at the moment after he had ſurrendered himſelf to a detachment of Engliſh, and that of Col. Laurens, ſon to the famous Laurens, preſident of Congreſs, will ever be read with ſympathetic ſorrow. The deſcriptions of the author are full of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, his regrets of ſenſibility; and the tranſlator has not reſted below his model.</p>
            <p>THE reader will, moreover, remark with pleaſure, the contraſt which the author has had the art to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, in a ſkilful manner, between the two very diſtinct parts of his poem. In the firſt, he paints the dangers which America experienced, and the calamities of war which deſolated her for ſo long a period. In the laſt he collects only delightful ideas and pictures of happineſs he unfolds to America the auſpicious effects of that liberty ſhe had obtained, and the felicity ſhe is about to enjoy. He invites his fellow citizens, for whom the taſk of glory is henceforth accompliſhed, to tranſport themſelves upon the borders of the lakes, and upon the fertile banks of the Belle Riviere<note n="†" place="bottom">The name by which the Ohio is known in French,</note>, a river moſt worthy of its name. He repreſents to them all the beauties which nature hath laviſhed upon thoſe happy regions, as a recompence to make them forget, on the boſom of rural felicity, the toils which they have endured for their country.</p>
            <p>IN fine, he predicts the future proſperity of this naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent empire, which riſes upon a plan dictated by wiſdom, and which will for ever remain the aſylum of happineſs and liberty.</p>

You made a myſtery of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me—and your modeſty has expoſed you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an unpardonable fault againſt the alliance that you have ſo nobly celebrated; ſince the European nation, which has had the firſt fruits of your poem, is preciſely the Engliſh: but it is proper to acknowledge, on the preſent, as well as on many other occaſions, this nation has proved that its enmity does not extend to merit and talents. All the public papers which are printed in London, have made your praiſes reſound, and thoſe very papers have firſt diſcloſed your ſecret. It is true, I have ſeen ſome of them, the authors of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be vexed, that a compoſition, in which the Engliſh are not treated with ceremony, ſhould obtain the honors of public readings and public applauſes<note n="*" place="bottom">The Morning Herald, and other Engliſh papers, made mention of the lecture of the poem in queſtion, made in public, apparently in clubs or other places, where people enter by ticket.</note>; and who wiſhed to deſpoil you of your moſt illuſtrious title, that of being an American, by making you to be born in, I known not what diſtrict, of England. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that may be, it is certain that France had reaſon to complain. Of no avail will it be for you to ſay, that your work is written in Engliſh; do you not know how much that language is in vogue among us, and how much we are diſpoſed to tranſlate it? I will not diſguiſe any thing. It has happened that your friend, your companion in arms, came to ſeize poſſeſſion at
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022578_0009_0FB98152F26C3400"/>
your apartments, of a beautiful copy of your poem, printed at London with all the accuracy and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which they always beſtow on every important work. It has, moreover, fallen to his lot to avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of your abſence<note n="†" place="bottom">This letter was addreſſed to Col Humphreys, while he was in England.</note> for making it known to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen. For making it known! that is ſaying too much: but at leaſt to give ſome idea to thoſe who are not ſufficiently acquainted with the Engliſh language, to read it with facility. I have cauſed the text to be printed with the tranſlation. This is a very generous proceeding, with which, I contend, you ought to be mightily ſatisfied. Every reader who may be in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to compare one with the other, will often cry out: "he has not known how to render all the energy, all the beauty of the original:"—and that is exactly what I deſire. There is not a pretty woman who does not pardon her painter for not making her as handſome as ſhe really is, whenever ſhe is placed by the ſide of her portrait; then not a compariſon but what proves to her advantage: and compariſon is of all praiſes the moſt flattering, becauſe it is the moſt perceptible, the moſt preciſe. My object will, therefore, be entirely completed, ſince all the criticiſms which I ſhall merit, will turn to your glory. Being a tranſlator in proſe, and a tranſlator who does not pique himſelf upon being literal, I ſhould have much to fear from my author, if that author was not Colonel Humphreys, whom I wiſh in every point to make my model. He loves liberty too much, to be offended at what I have taken on this occaſion: this liberty ſhall not go quite to indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: this is all I promiſe in aſſuring him that I will always be more faithful to that friendſhip he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded me, than to the text of which I took poſſeſſion."</p>

            <head>ADDRESS TO THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</head>
            <div type="preface">
               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERHAPS the following little poem may be conſidered with the more indulgence by the public, after it ſhall be known, that it was actually written, at a period</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">While the American army was encamped at Peck's-kill, and the enemy occupied the heights of New-York and Charleſton.</note>
                  <hi>when the army was in the field, and the author ſo far engaged in the duties of his profeſſion, as to have but little leiſure for ſubjects of literature or amuſement. And it will not be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to demonſtrate to thoſe who have the leaſt knowledge of a military life, how unfavorable ſuch a ſtate is to poetical contemplation. This, it is preſumed, may pertinently be urged in excuſe for the ſlighter errors and inaccuracies of the performance: and the deſign muſt, in ſome meaſure, alone for any of a different complexion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To inſpire our countrymen, now in arms, or who may, hereafter, be called into the field, with perſeverance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, through every ſpecies of difficulty and danger, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their exertions for the defence of their country, and the preſervation of its liberties, is the object of this addreſs.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:022578_0011_0FB98158D8332120"/>
                  <hi>For this purpoſe, it was imagined, no conſiderations could be more effectual, than the recollection of the paſt, and the anticipation of the future. For, where is the man to be found, who, after all that has been done and ſuffered—after ſuch a profeſſion of blood and treaſure has been expended—and ſuch important advantages have been obtained—would baſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh and leave unfiniſhed the illuſtrious taſk of rearing an empire, which, from its ſituation and circumſtances, muſt ſurpaſs all that have ever exiſted, in magnitude, felicity, and duration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Although the author entertains the moſt ſanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the gratitude and liberality, with which the continent will reward thoſe who have literally borne the heat and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day of war—he has not inſiſted on thoſe pecuniary or ſlighter conſiderations; but has attempted to turn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the future grandeur, happineſs and glory of the country for which we are now contending. The lands alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy granted to the army, firſt ſuggeſted the idea of a military ſettlement on the Ohio, or ſome of thoſe weſtern regions, whoſe beauties can never be ſufficiently diſplayed, much leſs exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated by deſcription. The mild temperature and ſerenity of the air, the ſalubrity of the climate, the fertility of the ſoil, the luxuriance of its products, the extent of territory, and the amazing inland navigation, which thoſe boundleſs lakes and immeaſurable rivers will open—cannot fail, one day, to render that garden of the world equal to the repreſentation given of it, in the concluſion of the poem. The poſſeſſion of ſuch a country, (reſcued from the hand of invaſion) in a perfect ſtate of freedom and ſecurity, will be a glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022578_0012_0FB9815A4FDA3270"/>
for all our toils and ſufferings, and a monument of the moſt unparalleled bravery and patriotiſm, to the remot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſterity. Stimulated with the love of glory, allured by theſe delightful proſpects, and animated with the pleaſing hope of the ſpeedy fruition of thoſe rapturous ſcenes—there are thouſands who have drawn the ſword, with a reſolution never to ſheath it, until a happy period ſhall be put to the conteſt. For himſelf, the writer declares, that having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy devoted whatſoever talents and abilities nature has confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, to the ſervice of his country—no efforts that can be made with his voice, his pen, or his ſword, ſhall ever be wanting to confirm its LIBERTIES and INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENCE.</hi>

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:022578_0030_0FB9818907E729B0"/>
objects calculated to inſpire the moſt elevated concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the imagination. Our mountains, vallies, plains, and rivers, are formed upon a great ſcale; the extent of the country itſelf is great; and the whole is rendered magnificently beautiful, by the creating hand of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Architect! And, if we contemplate the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently dignified part that has been recently acted on the vaſt national ſtage; with the ſcenes of magnanimity, wiſdom, and patriotic virtue, which our gallant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen have exhibited thereon; we muſt allow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can afford more noble themes, for our native bards.</p>
            <p>AMONG the literary productions of American genius, "A Poem on the Happineſs of America, addreſſed to the Citizens of the United States," by Col. Humphreys claims a ſuperior ſtation. The beauties of this piece do great honour to the author, and diſcover that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes a truly patriotic ſoul, as well as a mind animated with genuine poetic fire.</p>
            <p>AS this elegant piece, by ſome unaccountable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, has not yet made its appearance in the ſhops of our bookſellers, we beg leave to preſent the public with a few quotations from it; reminding them, at the ſame time, of the imperfect idea of its merit, that mutilated parts of the piece muſt be ſuppoſed to convey.</p>
            <p>AS it is probable, that a new edition of this poem will ſpeedily be publiſhed, the public will then have the gratification of reading it entire.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION OF THE POEM ON THE HAPPINESS OF AMERICA.</head>
            <p>THIS Poem, having paſſed through eight Editions in little more than four years, without having been accompanied with any introduction or preface, the writer hopes he ſhall eſcape every uncandid imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in offering with this Edition his acknowledgments for the flattering reception it has met with from the Public, together with ſome of the motives which origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally engaged him in this performance.</p>
            <p>THE writer is happy, that he has choſen a ſubject more intereſting than almoſt any other to the feelings of his Countrymen; and that the topics introduced in its diſcuſſion have not proved unſatisfactory to thoſe for whoſe entertainment the work was deſigned. To theſe cauſes, rather than to its intrinſic value as a compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he attributes the diſtinguiſhed regard with which it has been honoured.</p>
            <p>THE United States of America, when firſt aſſuming the form of a nation, preſented a momentuous and aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſpectacle to mankind. For the political welfare of the ſpecies ſeemed, in ſome ſort, involved in the event. The theatre was vaſt, the plot new, the parts important, and the conduct of the action for a long time ſo doubtful, as to produce diſtreſſing apprehenſions reſpecting its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The Americans, whoſe exertions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb facs="unknown:022578_0032_0FB9818DD6C7A270"/>
had been rewarded by the acquiſition of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were, however, at the end of the war, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with threatening proſpects. In theſe circumſtances, the writer endeavoured to ſhew his countrymen the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior advantages for happineſs which they poſſeſſed, to diſſipate their gloomy apprehenſions, by the exhibition of conſolatory anticipations, and to make them think fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of their own ſituation when compared with that of other nations. Many circumſtances conſpired to give facility to the execution of the taſk he had imposed on himſelf. The ideas were principally ſuggeſted by the peculiarity of our condition. We began our political career, in a great meaſure, free from the prejudice, and favoured with the knowledge of former ages and other nations. The amiable innocence and ſimplicity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which reſulted from the preſent ſtate of ſociety in America, offered a curious ſubject for philoſophical contemplation. Our minds, imperceptibly impreſſed with the novelty, beauty or ſublimity of ſurrounding objects, gave energy to the language which expreſſed our ſenſations. While the ſhades of changing nature, which diverſified the ſcenery through all the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſtages of ſettlement and population, from the rude grandeur of a wilderneſs, to the pleaſant landſcapes of cultivation, afforded an extenſive field for variegated deſcription. To an aſſemblage of ſuch magnificent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſo proper for poetry, were added a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents derived from the delights of agricultural life, the bleſſings of enlightened ſociety, and the progreſs of human improvements. The author, by thus availing himſelf of circumſtances, was enabled to gratify an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and decided propenſity for contemplating the beauties
<pb facs="unknown:022578_0033_0FB9818F980C1CD8"/>
of creation; eſpecially under that point of view, in which they are moſt conſpicuouſly beneficial to his fellow men.</p>
            <p>SINCE this Poem was written, by the eſtabliſhment of a general government, and the concurrence of fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate events, ſcenes of happineſs have been realiſed in this country, which were conſidered by ſome altogether chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical. And the proſpects, which are now expanding before our view, ſeem peculiarly calculated to excite us to greater exertions, notonly for promoting the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al proſperity, but even for producing ſuch examples in civil policy as will tend eſſentially to the ameliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human lot.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE extraordinary ſucceſs with which the following Tragedy has been attended in the repreſentation, and the circumſtance of our having been jointly concerned in writing the Prologue and Epilogue, make an apology unneceſſary for my inſcribing it to you. If the public, in judging my writings, has acted the part of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous patron, rather than of a rigid critic, this candid public ought to be informed how much it is owing to you, that my performances are no ſtill leſs worthy of its patronage. It is my boaſt, that we formed our taſte together, and on the ſame models, Although you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded me ſomewhat, in your claſſical ſtudies; yet no ſooner had we ſeen each other at the place of our edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than (as I think I may be allowed to flatter myſelf) a certain ſimilarity of genius, and congeniality of ſoul, connected us by the ties of an undiſſoluble friendſhip.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall not be accuſed of having neglected real bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs for poetical recreations. Had not the tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes, which commenced with the late war, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated our little ſociety, we might perhaps have inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently indulged ourſelves conſiderably more in literary ſpeculations, than the circumſtances have ſince permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is a conſolation that the occaſion or tendency of our performances have conciliated the minds of our Countrymen to receive them with favour. I will not

offend your delicacy by entering into a detail of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of your writings. But I wiſh you would realiſe, that, with ſuch talents, erudition, and critical knowledge as you poſſeſs, the preſent age and poſterity have a kind of claim upon you, for ſuch farther monuments of genius as your avocations may allow you to furniſh.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>UNAVOIDABLE abſence will prevent me from performing the grateful taſk, aſſigned me by the State Society of the Cincinnati, on the fourth day of July next. Though I cannot perſonally addreſs them, I wiſh to demonſtrate by ſome token of affectionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, the ſenſe I entertain of the honor they have more than once conferred upon me by their ſuffrages.</p>
            <p>MEDITATING in what manner to accompliſh this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it occurred to me, that an attempt to preſerve the actions of General Putnam, in the archives of our State Society, would be acceptable to its members, as they had all ſerved with great ſatisfaction under his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate orders. An eſſay on the life of a perſon ſo elevated in military rank, and ſo converſant in extraordinary ſcenes, could not be deſtitute of amuſement and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would poſſeſs the advantage of preſenting for imitation a reſpectable model of public and private vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>GENERAL Putnam is univerſally acknowledged to have been as brave and as honeſt a man as ever America
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:022578_0188_0FB99D3E38B49A00"/>
produced; but the diſtinguiſhing features of his character, and the particular tranſactions of his life are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly known. He ſeems to have been formed on purpoſe for the age in which he lived. His native cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, unſhaken integrity, and eſtabliſhed reputation as a ſoldier, were neceſſary in the early ſtages of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the deſigns of Great Britain, and gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded confidence to our troops in their firſt conflicts in the field of battle.</p>
            <p>THE incloſed manuſcript juſtly claims indulgence, for its venial errors, as it is the firſt effort in Biography, that has been made on this continent. The attempt I am conſcious is laudable, whatever may be the failure in point of execution.</p>
            <p>I AM happy to find the Society of the Cincinnati is now generally regarded in a favorable manner. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, with fewer exceptions, are diſpoſed to do juſtice to the motives on which it was founded. For ourſelves, we can never recal to mind the occaſion, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt tender emotions of friendſhip and ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

the pangs, that tore our boſoms at the melancholy hour of parting. When our hands touched, perhaps, for the laſt time, and our tongues refuſed to perform their office in bidding farewel, Heaven witneſſed and approved the purity of our intentions in the ardor of our affections.

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE LIFE OF GENERAL PUTNAM.</head>
            <p>TO treat of recent tranſactions and perſons ſtill living, is always a delicate and frequently a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs office. Yet, while the partiality of friends, or the malignity of enemies, decides with raſhneſs on every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of character, or recital of circumſtances, a conſolation remains, that diſtant nations and remoter ages, free from the influence of prejudice or paſſion, will judge with impartiality, and appreciate with juſtice. We have fallen upon an aera ſingularly prolific in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſonages, and dignified by ſplendid events. Much is expected from the ſelections of the judicious biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, as well as from the labours of the faithful hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. Whatever prudential reaſons may now occur to poſtpone the portrait of our own times, the difficulties which oppoſe themſelves to the execution, inſtead of being diminiſhed, will encreaſe with the lapſe of years. Every day will extinguiſh ſome life that was dear to ſame, and obliterate the memorial of ſome deed which would have conſtituted the delight and admiration of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:022578_0191_0FB99D4E49DBC9D8"/>
So tranſient and indiſtinguiſhable are the traits of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſo various and inexplicable the ſprings of action, ſo obſcure and periſhable the remembrance of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that, unleſs attempts are made to ſketch the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, while the preſent generation is living, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be for ever loſt, or only preſerved by a vague recollection; diſguiſed, perhaps, by the whimſical co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourings of a creative imagination.</p>
            <p>IT will doubtleſs, hereafter, be an object of regret, that thoſe, who, having themſelves been conſpicuous actors on the theatre of public life, and, who in conjunction with a knowledge of facts, poſſeſs abilities to paint thoſe characters, and deſcribe thoſe events, which (during the progreſs of the American Revolution) intereſted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed mankind, ſhould feel an inſuperable reluctance to aſſume the taſk—a taſk, which (if executed with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) muſt, from the dignity of its ſubject, become grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the patriots of all nations, and profitable in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the remoteſt poſterity. Equally ſevere will be the mortification of contemplating the reveries and fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have been ſubſtituted by hacknied writers in the place of hiſtorical facts. Nor ſhould we ſuppreſs our indignation againſt that claſs of profeſſional authors, who, placed in the vale of penury and obſcurity, at an immenſe diſtance from the ſcenes of action, and all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of acquiring the neceſſary documents, with inſufferable effrontery, obtrude their fallacious and crude performances on a credulous public. Did the reſult of their lucubrations terminate only in relieving their own diſtreſſes, or gratifying their individual vanity, it might be paſſed in ſilent contempt. But the effect is extenſive,

permanent, and pernicious: The lie,<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer had here particularly in his eye, the Rhapſody, palmed upon the public, under the name of a Hiſtory, by a certain Frenchman called D'Auberteiul: Perhaps, ſo much falſhood, folly and calumny was never before accumulated in a ſingle performance.</note> however impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable or monſtrous, which has once aſſumed the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of truth, by being often repeated with minute and plauſible particulars, is at length ſo thoroughly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, as to obtain univerſal credit, defy contradiction, and fruſtrate every effort of refutation. Such is the miſchief, ſuch are the unhappy conſequences on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wildered mind, that the reader has no alternative, but to become the dupe of his credulity, or diſtruſt the veracity of almoſt all human teſtimony. After having long been the ſport of fiction, he will perhaps probably run into the oppoſite extreme, and give up all confidence in the annals of ancient as well as modern times: and thus the eaſy believer of fine fables and marvellous ſtories, will find, at laſt, his hiſtorical faith change to ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and end in infidelity.</p>

Should this eſſay have any influence in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting miſtakes, or reſcuing from oblivion the actions of that diſtinguiſhed Veteran; ſhould it create an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to copy his domeſtic, manly and heroic virtues; or ſhould it prompt ſome more ſkilful hand to pourtray the illuſtrious groupe of Patriots, Sages and Heroes, who have guided our counſels, fought our battles, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned the memorable Epocha of Independence, it will be an ample compenſation for the trouble, and excite a conſolatory reflection through every viciſſitude of life.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL PUTNAM, who, through a regular gradation of promotion became the ſenior Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the army of the United States, and next in rank to General Waſhington, was born at Salem in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, now State, of Maſſachuſetts, on the 7th day of January, 1718. His father, Capt. Joſeph Putnam, was the ſon of Mr. John Putnam, who, with two brothers, came from the ſouth of England, and were among the firſt ſettlers of Salem.</p>
            <p>WHEN we thus behold a perſon, from the humble walks of life, ſtarting unnoticed in the career of fame, and by an undeviating progreſs through a life of honor, arriving at the higheſt dignity in the ſtate; curioſity is ſtrongly excited, and philoſophy loves to trace the path of glory from the cradle of obſcurity to the ſummit of elevation.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH our anceſtors, the firſt ſettlers of this
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:022578_0197_0FB998ABC430C8D0"/>
land, amidſt the extreme preſſure of poverty and danger, early inſtituted ſchools for the education of youth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the learned profeſſions; yet it was thought ſufficient to inſtruct thoſe deſtined to labor on the earth, in reading, writing, and ſuch rudiments of arithmetic as might be requiſite for keeping the accounts of their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tranſactions with each other. Few farmers ſons had more advantages, none leſs. In this ſtate of mediocrity it was the lot of young Putnam to be placed. His early inſtruction was not conſiderable, and the active ſcenes of life, in which he was afterwards, engaged, prevented the opportunity of great literary improvement. His nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous original letters, though deficient in ſcholaſtic accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, always diſplay the goodneſs of his heart, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſtrength of his native genius. He had a certain laconic mode of expreſſion, and an unaffected epigrammatic turn, which characteriſed moſt of his writings.</p>
            <p>To compenſate partially for the deficiency of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though nothing can remove or counterbalance the inconveniencies experienced from it in public life) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his parents the ſource of innumerable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in the ſtamina of a vigorous conſtitution. Nature, liberal in beſtowing on him bodily ſtrength, hardineſs, and activity, was by no means parſimonious in mental endowments. While we leave the qualities of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to be developed in the proceſs of life, it may not be improper, in this place, to deſignate ſome of the circumſtances which were calculated to diſtinguiſh him afterwards as a partizan officer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="unknown:022578_0198_0FB998ADC1835FF8"/>
COURAGE, enterprize, activity and perſeverance were the firſt characteriſtics of his mind. There is a kind of mechanical courage, the offspring of pride, habit or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, that may puſh a coward not only to perform his duty, but even to venture on acts of heroiſm. Putnam's courage was of a different ſpecies. It was ever attended with a ſerenity of ſoul, a clearneſs of conception, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſelf-poſſeſſion and a ſuperiority to all the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of fortune, entirely diſtinct from any thing that can be produced by the ferment of blood, and flutter of ſpirits; which, not unfrequently, precipitate men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when ſtimulated by intoxication or ſome other tranſient exhilaration. The heroic character, thus founded on conſtitution and animal ſpirits, cheriſhed by education and ideas of perſonal freedom, confirmed by temperance and habits of exerciſe, was completed by the dictate of reaſon, the love of his country, and an invincible ſenſe of duty. Such were the qualities and principles, that enabled him to meet unappalled the ſhafts of adverſity, and to paſs in triumph through the furnace of affliction.</p>
            <p>His diſpoſition was as frank and generous, as his mind was fearleſs and independent. He diſguiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; indeed he ſeemed incapable of diſguiſe. Perhaps, in the intercourſe he was ultimately obliged to have with an artful world, his ſincerity, on ſome occaſions, outwent his diſcretion. Although he had too much ſuavity in his nature to commence a quarrel, he had too much ſenſibility not to feel, and too much honor not to reſent an intended inſult. The firſt time he went to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, he was inſulted for his ruſticity by a boy of twice his ſize and age; after bearing the ſarcaſms until his
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:022578_0199_0FB998AF472BC8F0"/>
patience was worn out, he challenged, engaged and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed his unmannerly antagoniſt, to the great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a crowd of ſpectators. While a ſtripling, his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was to perform the labor of a man, and to excel in athletic diverſions. In that rude, but maſculine age, whenever the village-youth aſſembled on their uſual occaſions of feſtivity; pitching the bar, running, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wreſtling were favorite amuſements. At ſuch gymnaſtic exerciſes (in which during the heroic times of ancient Greece and Rome, conqueſt was conſidered as the promiſe of future military ſame) he bore the palm from almoſt every ring.</p>
            <p>BEFORE the refinements of luxury, and the conſequent increaſe of expences had rendered the maintenance of a family inconvenient or burdenſome in America, the ſexes entered into matrimony at an early age. Competence, attainable by all, was the limit of purſuit. After the hardſhips of making a new ſettlement were overcome, and the evils of penury removed, the inhabitants enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the lot of equality, innocence, and ſecurity, ſcenes equally delightful with thoſe pictured by the glowing imagination of the poets in their favorite paſtoral life or fabulous golden age. Indeed the condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind was never more enviable. Neither diſparity of age and fortune, nor ſchemes of ambition and grandeur, nor the pride and avarice of high-minded and mercenary pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, interpoſed thoſe obſtacles to the union of congenial ſouls, which frequently in more poliſhed ſociety prevent, imbitter or deſtroy all the felicity of the connubial ſtate. Mr. Putnam before he attained the twenty-firſt year of his age, married Miſs Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:022578_0200_0FB998B0B39AA9B0"/>
of Salem, by whom he had ten children, ſeven of whom are ſtill living. He loſt the wife of his youth in 1764. Some time after he married Mrs. Gardiner, widow of the late Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's Iſland, by whom he had no iſſue. She died in 1777.</p>
            <p>IN the year 1739 he removed from Salem to Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret, an inland fertile town in Connecticut, forty miles eaſt of Hartford: having here purchaſed a conſiderable tract of land, he applied himſelf ſucceſsfully to agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>THE firſt years, on a new farm, are not, however exempt from diſaſters and diſappointments, which can only be remedied by ſtubborn and patient induſtry. Our farmer, ſufficiently occupied in building an houſe and barn, felling woods, making fences, ſowing grain, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orchards and taking care of his ſtock, had to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in turn, the calamities occaſioned by drought in ſummer, blaſt in harveſt, loſs of cattle in winter, and the deſolation of his ſheep-fold by wolves. In one night he had ſeventy fine ſheep and goats killed, beſides many lambs and kids wounded. This havoc was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a ſhe-wolf, which, with her annual whelps, had for ſeveral years infeſted the vicinity. The young were commonly deſtroyed by the vigilance of the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but the old one was too ſagacious to come within reach of gun-ſhot: upon being cloſely purſued ſhe would generally fly to the weſtern woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps.</p>
            <p>THIS wolf, at length, became ſuch an intolerable
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:022578_0201_0FB998BB68B31CF8"/>
nuiſance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could deſtroy her. Two, by rotation, were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in purſuit. It was known, that, having loſt the toes from one foot, by a ſteel-trap, ſhe made one track ſhorter than the other. By this veſtige, the purſuers recognized, in a light ſnow, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Connecticut river, and found ſhe had turned back in a direct courſe towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood-hounds had driven her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a den, about three miles diſtant from the houſe of Mr. Putnam: The people ſoon collected with dogs, guns, ſtraw, fire, and ſulphur, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus ſeveral unſucceſsful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refuſed to return. The ſmoke of blazing ſtraw had no effect. Nor did the fumes of burnt brimſtone, with which the cavern was filled, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to quit the retirement. Wearied with ſuch fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain. He propoſed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and ſhoot the wolf: the negro de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the hazardous ſervice. Then it was, that their maſter, angry at the diſappointment, and declaring that he was aſhamed to have a coward in his family, reſolved himſelf to deſtroy the ferocious beaſt, left ſhe ſhould eſcape through ſome unknown fiſſure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> rock. His neighbours ſtrongly remonſtrated againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: but he knowing, that wild animal were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated by fire, and having provided ſeveral ſtrips of
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:022578_0202_0FB998BD88A0F048"/>
birch-bark, the only combuſtible material which he could obtain, that would afford light in this deep and darkſome cave, prepared for his deſcent. Having, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, diveſted himſelf of his coat and waiſtcoat, and having a long rope faſtened round his legs, by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted ſignal, he entered head foremoſt, with the blazing torch in his hand.</p>
            <p>THE aperture of the den, on the eaſt ſide of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet ſquare; from thence it deſcends obliquely fifteen feet, then running horizontally about ten more, it aſcends gradually ſixteen feet towards its termination. The ſides of this ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous cavity are compoſed of ſmooth and ſolid rocks, which ſeem to have been divided from each other by ſome former earthquake. The top and bottom are alſo of ſtone, and the entrance, in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly ſlippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to raiſe himſelf upright: nor in any part more than three feet in width.</p>
            <p>HAVING groped his paſſage to the horizontal part of the den, the moſt terrifying darkneſs appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was ſilent as the houſe of death. None but monſters of the deſert had ever before explored this ſolitary manſion of horror. He, cautiouſly proceeding onward, came to the aſcent, which he ſlowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he diſcovered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was ſitting at the extremity of the cavern. Started at the ſight of fire, ſhe gnaſhed her teeth and gave a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len growl. As ſoon as he had made the neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:022578_0203_0FB998BEFAC25FA8"/>
he kicked the rope as a ſignal for pulling him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had liſtened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf and ſuppoſing their friend to be in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, drew him forth with ſuch celerity that his ſhirt was ſtripped over his head and his ſkin ſeverely lacerated. After he had adjuſted his clothes and loaded his gun with nine buck-ſhot, holding a torch in one hand and the muſquet in the other, he deſcended the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. When he drew nearer than before, the wolf, aſſuming a ſtill more fierce and terrible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, howling, rolling her eyes, ſnapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently in the attitude and on the point of ſpringing at him. At the critical inſtant, he levelled and fired at her head. Stunned with the ſhock, and ſuffocated with the ſmoke, he immediately found himſelf drawn out of the cave. But having refreſhed himſelf, and permitted the ſmoke to diſſipate, he went down the third time. Once more he came within ſight of the wolf, who appearing very paſſive, he applied the torch to her noſe; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope (ſtill tied round his legs) the people above, with no ſmall exultation, dragged them both out together.</p>
            <p>I HAVE offered theſe facts in greater detail, becauſe they contain a diſplay of character; and becauſe they have been erroneouſly related in ſeveral European pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, and very much mutilated in the hiſtory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, a work as replete with falſehood as deſtitute of genius, lately printed in London.</p>

               <pb n="204" facs="unknown:022578_0204_0FB998C2CE2F5900"/>
PROSPERITY, at length, began to attend the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affairs of Mr. Putnam. He was acknowledged to be a ſkilful and indefatigable manager. His fields were moſtly encloſed with ſtone walls. His crops commonly ſucceeded, becauſe the land was well tilled and manured. His paſtures and meadows became luxuriant. His cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle were of the beſt breed and in good order. His gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and fruit-trees prolific. With the avails of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of his produce, foreign articles were purchaſed. Within doors he found the compenſation of his labors in the plenty of excellent proviſions, as well as in the happineſs of domeſtic ſociety.</p>
            <p>A MORE particular deſcription of his tranſition from narrow to eaſy circumſtances might be given; but the mind that ſhall have acquired an idea of the habits of labor and ſimplicity, to which the induſtrious coloniſts were accuſtomed, will readily ſupply the omiſſion. The effect of this gradual acquiſition of property, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally favorable to individual virtue and public felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhould not however be paſſed over in ſilence. If there is ſomething faſcinating in the charms of a country life, from the contemplation of beautiful landſcapes; there is likewiſe ſomething elevating to the ſoul, in the conſciouſneſs of being lord of the ſoil, and having the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of creating them. The man can ſcarcely be guilty of a ſordid action, or even deſcend to an ungenerous thought, who, removed from the apprehenſion of want, ſees his farm daily meliorating and aſſuming whatever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he pleaſes to preſcribe. This ſituation converts the farmer into a ſpecies of rural philoſopher, by inſpiring an honeſt pride in his rank as a freeman, flattering the
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:022578_0205_0FB998C579D7E450"/>
natural propenſity for perſonal independence, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing an unlimited hoſpitality and philanthropy in his ſocial character.</p>
            <p>BUT the time had now arrived, which was to turn the inſtruments of huſbandry into weapons of hoſtility, and to exchange the hunting of wolves, who had ravaged the ſheep folds, for the purſuit after Savages who had deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the frontiers. Mr. Putnam was about 37 years old, when the war between England and France, which preceded the laſt, broke out in America. His reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt have been favorably known to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince among the firſt troops that were levied by Connecticut, in 1755, he was appointed to the command of a company in Lyman's regiment of Provincials. I have mentioned his age at this period expreſsly to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a prevalent opinion, that he was far advanced in life when he commenced his military ſervice.</p>
            <p>As he was extremely popular, he ſound no difficulty in enliſting his complement of recruits from the moſt hardy, enterprizing, and reſpectable young men of his neighborhood. The regiment joined the army, at the opening of the campaign, not far diſtant from Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Point. Soon after his arrival at camp, he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the famous partizan Captain, afterwards, Major Rogers; with whom he was frequently aſſociated in traverſing the wilderneſs, reconnoitring the enemy's lines, gaining intelligence, and taking ſtraggling priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; as well as in beating up the quarters and ſurpriſing the advanced pickets of their army. For theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a corps of rangers, was formed from the irregulars.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:022578_0206_0FB998CB8F5CE068"/>
The firſt time Rogers and Putnam were detached with a party of theſe light troops, it was the fortune of the latter to preſerve, with his own hand, the life of the former, and to cement their friendſhip with the blood of one of their enemies.</p>
            <p>THE object of this expedition was to obtain an accurate knowledge of the poſition and ſtate of the works at Crown Point. It was impracticable to approach with their party near enough for this purpoſe, without being diſcovered. Alone, the undertaking was ſufficiently hazardous on account of the ſwarms of hoſtile Indians, who infeſted the woods. Our two partizans, however, left all their men at a convenient diſtance, with ſtrict orders to continue concealed until their return. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus cautiouſly taken their arrangements, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with the profoundeſt ſilence in the evening; and lay, during the night, contiguous to the fortreſs. Early in the morning, they approached ſo cloſe as to be able to give ſatisfactory information to the general who had ſent them, on the ſeveral points to which their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention had been directed: but Capt. Rogers, being at a little diſtance from Capt. Putnam, fortuitouſly met a ſtout Frenchman, who inſtantly ſeized his fuzee with one hand, and with the other attempted to ſtab him, while he called to an adjacent guard for aſſiſtance. The guard anſwered. Putnam, perceiving the imminent danger of his friend, and that no time was to be loſt, or farther alarm given by firing, ran rapidly to them, while they were yet ſtruggling, and with the but-end of his piece laid the Frenchman dead at his feet. The partizans, to elude purſuit, precipitated their flight,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:022578_0207_0FB998D038CE8E88"/>
joined the party, and returned without loſs to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment. Not many occaſions occurred for partizans to diſplay their talents in the courſe of this ſummer.—The war was chequered with various fortune in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quarters—ſuch as the total defeat of General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, and the ſplendid victory of Sir William Johnſon over the French troops commanded by the Baron Dieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kau. The brilliancy of this ſucceſs was neceſſary to conſole the Americans for the diſgrace of that diſaſter. Here I might, indeed, take a pride in contraſting the conduct of the Britiſh Regulars, who had been ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaded on the Monongahela, with that of the Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als (under Johnſon) who, having been attacked in their lines, gallantly repulſed the enemy and took their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral priſoner, did I conſider myſelf at liberty to ſwell this eſſay with reflections on events, in which Putnam was not directly concerned. The time for which the colonial troops engaged to ſerve, terminated with the campaign. Putnam was re-appointed, and again took the field in 1756.</p>
            <p>FEW are ſo ignorant of war as not to know, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary adventures, in the night, are always extremely liable to accidents. Captain Putnam, having been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to reconnoitre the enemy's camp at <hi>the Ovens,</hi> near <hi>Ticonderoga,</hi> took the brave Lieutenant Robert Durkee as his companion. In attempting to execute theſe orders, he narrowly miſſed being taken himſelf in the firſt inſtance, and killing his friend in the ſecond. It was cuſtomary for the Britiſh and Provincial troops to place their fires round their camp, which frequently expoſed them to the enemy's ſcouts and patroles. A
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:022578_0208_0FB998D1B6872EC8"/>
contrary practice, then unknown in the Engliſh army, prevailed among the French and Indians. The plan was much more rational; they kept their fires in the centre, lodged their men circularly at a diſtance, and poſted their centinels in the ſurrounding darkneſs. Our partizans approached the camp—and ſuppoſing the centries were within the circle of fires, crept upon their hands and knees with the greateſt poſſible caution, until, to their utter aſtoniſhment, they found themſelves in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the enemy. The centinels, diſcovering them, fired and ſlightly wounded Durkee in the thigh. He and Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam had no alternative. They fled. The latter, being foremoſt and ſcarcely able to ſee his hand before him, ſoon plunged into a clay-pit. Durkee, almoſt at the identical moment, came tumbling after. Putnam, by no means pleaſed at finding a companion, and believing him to be one of the enemy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lifted his tomahawk to give the deadly blow—when Durkee, (who had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo cloſely as to know him) enquired whether he had eſcaped unhurt. Captain Putnam, inſtantly recognizing the voice, dropped his weapon: and both, ſpringing from the pit, made good their retreat to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ledges, amidſt a ſhower of random ſhot. There they betook themſelves to a large log, by the ſide of which they lodged the remainder of the night. Before they lay down. Captain Putnam ſaid he had a little rum in his canteen, which could never be more acceptable or neceſſary; but on examining the canteen, which hung under his arm, he ſound the enemy had pierced it with their balls, and that there was not a drop of liquor left. The next day he ſound fourteen bullet holes in his blanket.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="unknown:022578_0209_0FB998D3507783E0"/>
IN the ſame ſummer a body of the enemy, conſiſting of 600 men, attacked the baggage and proviſion wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons at a place called the Half-way Brook; it being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidiſtant from Fort Edward, and the ſouth end of lake George. Having killed the oxen and plundered the waggons, they retreated with their booty without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met with ſuch reſiſtance as might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtrength of the eſcort. General Webb, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on receiving intelligence of this diſaſter, ordered the Captains Putnam and Rogers <q>to take 100 volunteers in boats, with two wall-pieces and two blunderbuſſes, and to proceed down lake George to a certain point: there to leave the batteaux under a proper guard, and thence to croſs by land ſo as to harraſs, and if practicable, intercept the retreating enemy at the narrows.</q> Theſe orders were executed with ſo much punctuality, that the party arrived at the deſtined place half an hour before the hoſtile boats came in view. Here they waited, under cover, until the enemy (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe proceedings) entered the narrows with their batteaux loaded with plunder. Then the volunteers pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them volley after volley, killed many of the oarſmen, ſunk a number of the batteaux, and would ſoon have deſtroyed the whole body of the enemy, had not the unuſual precipitancy of their paſſage (favored by the wind) carried them through the narrows into the wide part of South-Bay; where they were out of the reach of muſquet ſhot. The ſhattered remnant of the little fleet ſoon arrived at Ticonderoga and gave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that Putnam and Rogers were at the narrows. A freſh party was inſtantly detached to cut them in pieces, on their return to Fort Edward. Our partizans,
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:022578_0210_0FB998D4E5E343B8"/>
ſenſible of the probability of ſuch an attempt, and being full twenty miles from their boats, ſtrained every nerve to reach them as ſoon as poſſible; which they effected the ſame night. Next day, when they had returned as far as Sabbath-day-Point, they diſcovered, on ſhore, the before-mentioned detachment of 300 men, who had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in the night, and who now, on perceiving our party, took to their boats with the greateſt alacrity, and rowed out to give battle. They advanced in line, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a good mein and felicitating themſelves upon the proſpect of an eaſy conqueſt, from the great ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of their numbers. Fluſhed with theſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they were permitted to come within piſtol-ſhot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a gun was fired. At once, the wall-pieces and blunderbuſſes, which had been brought to take them in the moſt vulnerable point, were diſcharged. As no ſuch reception had been foreſeen, the aſſailants were thrown into the utmoſt diſorder. Their terror and confuſion were greatly encreaſed by a well-directed and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive fire of the ſmall arms. The larger pieces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing re-loaded, without annoyance, continued alternately, with the muſquetry, to make dreadful havoc, until the route was completed and the enemy driven back to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga. In this action, one of the bark canoes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained twenty Indians, of whom fifteen were killed. Great numbers, from other boats, both of French and Indians were ſeen to fall overboard: but the account of their total loſs could never be aſcertained. Rogers and Putnam had but one man killed and two ſlightly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They now landed on the Point, and having refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their men at leiſure, returned in good order to the Britiſh camp.</p>

SOON after theſe rencounters, a ſingular kind of race was run by our nimble-footed Provincial and an active young Frenchman. The liberty of each was by turns at ſtake. General Webb, wanting a priſoner for the ſake of intelligence, ſent Captain Putnam with five men to procure one. The Captain concealed himſelf near the road which leads from Ticonderoga to the Ovens. His men ſeemed fond of ſhewing themſelves, which unſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlike conduct he prohibited with the ſevereſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This rebuke they imputed to unneceſſary fear. The obſervation is as true as vulgar, that perſons, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable for temerity, when there is no apparent danger, are generally poltroons whenever danger ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. They had not lain long, in the high graſs, before a Frenchman and an Indian paſſed—the Indian was conſiderably in advance. As ſoon as the former had gone by, Putnam, relying on the fidelity of his men, ſprang up, ran and ordered them to follow. After run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about thirty rods, he ſeized the Frenchman by the ſhoulders and forced him to ſurrender: But his priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, looking round, perceiving no other enemy, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Indian would be ready in a moment to aſſiſt him, began to make an obſtinate reſiſtance. Putnam, finding himſelf betrayed by his men into a perilous dilemma, let go his hold, ſtepped back and ſnapped his piece, which was levelled at the Frenchman's breaſt. It miſſed fire. Upon this, he thought it moſt prudent to retreat. The Frenchman, in turn, chaced him back to his men, who, at laſt raiſed themſelves from the graſs; which his purſuer, eſpying in good time for himſelf, made his eſcape. Putnam, mortified that theſe men had fruſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſucceſs, diſmiſſed them with diſgrace; and, not
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:022578_0212_0FB998E3B9F98998"/>
long after accompliſhed his object. Such little feats, as the capture of a ſingle priſoner, may be of infinitely more conſequence than ſome, who are unacquainted with military affairs, would be apt to imagine. In a country covered with woods, like that part of America, then the ſeat of war, the difficulty of procuring, and the importance of poſſeſſing good intelligence, can ſcarcely be conceived even by European commanders. They, however, who know its value, will not appreciate lightly the ſervices of an able partizan.</p>
            <p>NOTHING, worthy of remark, happened during this campaign except the loſs of Oſwego. That ſort, which had been built by General Shirley to protect the peltry trade, cover the country on the Mohawk-River, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate an invaſion of Canada by Frontenac and Niagara, fell into the hands of the enemy, with a garriſon of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred men and one hundred pieces of cannon.</p>
            <p>THE active ſervices of Captain Putnam, on every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, attracted the admiration of the public, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Legiſlature of Connecticut to promote him to a majority in 1757.</p>
            <p>LORD Loudon was then Commander in Chief of the Britiſh forces in America. The expedition againſt Crown Point, which, from the commencement of hoſtilities, had been in contemplation, ſeemed to give place to a more important operation that was meditated againſt Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. But the arrival of the Breſt ſquadron at that place prevented the attempt; and the loſs of Fort Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam-Henry ſerved to claſs this with the two former un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:022578_0213_0FB998EE29CF1060"/> campaigns. It was rumored and partially credited at the time, that General Webb, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the northern department, had early intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the movement of the French army, and might have effectually ſuccored garriſon. The ſubſequent facts will place the affair in its proper light.</p>
            <p>A FEW days before the ſiege, Major Putnam, with two hundred men, eſcorted General Webb from Fort Edward to Fort William-Henry. The object was to examine the ſtate of this fortification, which ſtood at the ſouthern extremity of Lake George. Several abortive attempts having been made by Major Rogers and others in the night ſeaſon. Major Putnam propoſed to go down the lake in open day-light, land at Northweſt-Bay and tarry on ſhore, until he could make ſatisfactory diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the enemy's actual ſituation at Ticonderoga and the adjacent poſts. The plan (which he ſuggeſted) of landing with only five men and ſending back the boats, to prevent detection, was deemed too hazardous by the General. At length, however, he was permitted to proceed with eighteen volunteers in three whale-boats: but before he arrived at Northweſt-Bay he diſcovered a body of men on an iſland. Immediately upon this, he left two boats to fiſh at a diſtance, that they might not occaſion an alarm, and returned himſelf with the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The General, ſeeing him rowing back with great velocity, in a ſingle boat, concluded the others were captured, and ſent a ſkiff with orders for him alone to come on ſhore. After adviſing the General of the circumſtances, he urged the expediency of returning to make further diſcoveries, and bring off the boats. Leave
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:022578_0214_0FB998EF8EFEB6F0"/>
was reluctantly given. He found his people, and, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtill onward, diſcovered (by the aid of a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective glaſs) a large army in motion. By this time ſeveral of the advanced canoes had nearly ſurrounded him, but, by the ſwiftneſs of his whale-boats, he eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the midſt of them. On his return, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the General minutely of all he had ſeen, and intimated his conviction that the expedition muſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly be deſtined againſt Fort William-Henry. That Commander, ſtrictly enjoining ſilence on the ſubject, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to put his men under an oath of ſecrecy, and to prepare, without loſs of time, to return to the Head Quarters of the Army. Major Putnam obſerved <q>he hoped his Excellency did not intend to neglect ſo fair an opportunity of giving battle, ſhould the enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to land.</q>—<q>What do you think we ſhould do here,</q> replied the General. Accordingly, the next day he returned, and the day after Colonel Monro was ordered from Fort Edward, with his regiment, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the garriſon. That officer took with him all his rich baggage and camp equipage, notwithſtanding Major Putnam's advice to the contrary. The day following his arrival, the enemy landed and beſieged the place.</p>
            <p>THE Marquis de Montealm, Commander in chief for the French in Canada (intending to take advantage of the abſence of a large proportion of the Britiſh force, which he underſtood to be employed under Lord Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don againſt Louiſbourg) had aſſembled whatever men could be ſpared from Ticonderoga, Crown Point and the other garriſons; with theſe he had combined a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable corps of Canadians and a larger body of Indians
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:022578_0215_0FB998F091AAC420"/>
than had ever before been collected: making in the whole an army of nearly eight thouſand men. Our gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon conſiſted of twenty-five hundred and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel Monro, a very gallant officer; who found the means of ſending expreſs after expreſs to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Webb, with an account of his ſituation and the moſt preſling ſolicitation for ſuccour. In the mean time, the army at Fort Edward, which originally amounted to about four thouſand, had been conſiderably augmented by Johnſon's troops and the militia. On the 8th or 9th day after the landing of the French, General Johnſon (in conſequence of repeated applications) was ſuffered to march for the relief of the garriſon, with all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, Militia and Putnam's Rangers: but before they had proceeded three miles, the order was countermanded, and they returned. M. de Montealm informed Major Putnam, when a priſoner in Canada, that one of his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Indians ſaw and reported this movement; and, upon being queſtioned relatively to the numbers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in their figurative ſtyle, <hi>"If you can count the leaves on the trees, you can count them."</hi> In effect, the operations of the ſiege was ſuſpended, and preparations made for re-embarking, when another of the runners reported that the detachment had gone back. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Montcalm, provided with a good train of artillery, meeting with no annoyance from the Britiſh army, and but inconſiderable interruption from the garriſon, acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated his approaches ſo rapidly, as to obtain poſſeſſion of the Fort, in a ſhort time after completing the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. An intercepted letter from General Webb, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing the ſurrender, was ſent into the Fort to Colonel Monro by the French General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="unknown:022578_0216_0FB998F49864B488"/>
THE garriſon engaged not to ſerve for eighteen months, and were permitted to march out with the honors of war. But the ſavages regarded not the capitulation, nor could they be reſtrained, by the utmoſt exertion of the Commanding Officer, from committing the moſt outrageous acts of cruelty. They ſtripped and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the priſoners, and murdered great numbers in cold blood. Thoſe, who eſcaped by flight, or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the French, arrived in a forlorn condition at Fort Edward: Among theſe was the Commandant of the garriſon.</p>
            <p>THE day ſucceeding this deplorable ſcene of carnage and barbarity, Major Putnam having been diſpatched with his Rangers, to watch the motions of the enemy, came to the ſhore, when their rear was ſcarcely beyond the reach of muſquet ſhot. They had carried off all the cannon, ſtores and water-craft. The Fort was demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The barracks, the out-houſes and ſuttlers booths were heaps of ruins. The fires, not yet extinct, and the ſmoke, offenſive from the mucilaginous nature of the fuel, but illy concealed innumerable fragments of human ſkulls and bones, and, in ſome inſtances carcaſes half conſumed. Dead bodies, weltering in blood, were every where to be ſeen, violated with all the wanton mutilations of ſavage ingenuity. More than one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred women, ſome with their brains ſtill oozing from the battered heads, others with their whole hair wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed collectively with the ſkin from the bloody ſkulls, and many (with their throats cut) moſt inhumanly ſtabbed and butchered, lay ſtripped entirely naked, with their bowels torn out, and afforded a ſpectacle too horrible for deſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:022578_0217_0FB998F881CA2528"/>
NOT long after this misfortune, General Lyman ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the command of Fort Edward. He reſolved to ſtrengthen it. For this purpoſe one hundred and fifty men were employed in cutting timber. To cover them, Captain Little was poſted (with fifty Britiſh Regulars) at the head of a thick ſwamp about one hundred rods eaſtward of the Fort—to which his communication lay over a tongue of land, formed on the one ſide by the ſwamp, and by a creek on the other.</p>
            <p>ONE morning, at day break, a centinel ſaw indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly ſeveral birds, as he conceived, come from the ſwamp and fly over him, with incredible ſwiftneſs. While he was ruminating on theſe wonderful birds, and endeavouring to form ſome idea of their colour, ſhape and ſize, an arrow buried itſelf in the limb of a tree juſt above his head. He now diſcovered the quality, and deſign of theſe winged meſſengers of fate, and gave the alarm. Inſtantly the working party began to retreat along the deſile. A large body of Savages, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed themſelves in the moraſs before the guard was poſted, and were attempting in this way to kill the centinel without noiſe, with deſign to ſurprize the whole party. Finding the alarm given, they ruſhed from the covert, ſhot and tomahawked thoſe who were neareſt at hand, and preſſed hard on the remainder of the unarmed fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. Captain Little flew to their relief, and, by pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Indians a well-timed fire, checked the purſuit, and enabled ſuch of the fatigue-men as did not fall in the firſt onſet, to retire to the fort. Thither he ſent for aſſiſtance, his little party being almoſt over-powered by numbers. But the Commandant, imagining that the
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:022578_0218_0FB99906C12A3F90"/>
main body of the enemy were approaching for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſault, called in his out-poſts and ſhut the gates.</p>
            <p>MAJOR Putnam lay, with his Rangers, on an Iſland adjacent to the fort. Having heard the muſquetry and learned that his friend Captain Little was in the utmoſt peril, he plunged into the river at the head of his corps, and waded through the water towards the place of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. This brought him ſo near to the fort, that General Lyman, apprized of his deſign, and unwilling that the lives of a few more brave men ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to what he deemed inevitable deſtruction, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the parapet and ordered him to proceed no farther. The Major only took time to make the beſt ſhort apology he could, and marched on. This is the only inſtance in the whole courſe of his military ſervice, wherein he did not pay the ſtricteſt obedience to orders; and in this inſtance, his motive was highly commendable. But when ſuch conduct, even if ſanctified by ſucceſs, is paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with impunity, it demonſtrates that all is not right in the military ſyſtem. In a diſciplined army, ſuch as that of the United States became under General Waſhington, an officer, guilty of a ſlighter violation of orders, however elevated in rank or meritorious in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, would have been brought before the bar of a Court Martial. Were it not for the ſeductive tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a brave man's example, I might have been ſpared the mortification of making theſe remarks on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of an officer, whoſe diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics were promptitude for duty and love of ſubordination, as well as cheerfulneſs to encounter every ſpecies of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:022578_0219_0FB99907CEEF9008"/>
THE Rangers of Putnam ſoon opened their way for a junction with the little handful of Regulars, who ſtill obſtinately maintained their ground. By his advice, the whole ruſhed impetuouſly with ſhouts and huzzas into the ſwamp. The Savages fled on every ſide, and were chaced, with no inconſiderable loſs on their part, as long as the day-light laſted. On ours only one man was killed in the purſuit. His death was immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by that of the Indian who ſhot him. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian was one of the runners—a choſen body of active young men, who are made uſe of not only to procure intelligence and convey tidings, but alſo to guard the rear on a retreat.</p>
            <p>HERE it will not be unſeaſonable to mention ſome of the cuſtoms in war, peculiar to the aborigines, which, on the preſent as well as other occaſions, they put in practice. Whenever a retreating, eſpecially, a flying party had gained the ſummit of a riſing ground; they ſecreted one or two runners behind trees, copſes or buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to fire at the enemy upon their aſcending the hill. This commonly occaſioned the enemy to halt and form for battle. In the interim the runners uſed ſuch dexterity as to be rarely diſcovered, or if diſcovered, they vaniſhed behind the height and rejoined their brother-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, who having thus ſtolen a diſtance, were oftentimes ſeen by their purſuers no more. Or if the purſuers were too eager, they ſeldom failed to atone for their raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by falling into an abuſcade. The Mohawks, who were afterwards much employed in ſcouts under the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Major Putnam, and who were perfectly verſed in all the wiles and ſtratagems of their countrymen, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:022578_0220_0FB99909B0E66AD8"/>
him the mode of avoiding the evils of either alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. In ſuſpicious thickets, and at the borders of every conſiderable eminence, a momentary pauſe was made, while they, in different parts, penetrated or aſcended with a cautiouſneſs that cannot be eaſily deſcribed. They ſeemed all eye and ear. When they found no lurking miſchief, they would beckon with the hand and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word, "OWISH," with a long labial hiſſing, the <hi>O</hi> being almoſt quieſcent. This was ever the watch-word for the main body to advance.</p>
            <p>INDIANS, who went to war together, and who, for any reaſon found it neceſſary to ſeparate into different routes, always left two or three runners at the place of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give timely notice to either party in caſe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
            <p>IF a warrior chanced to ſtraggle and loſe himſelf in the woods, or be retarded by accident or wound; the party miſſing him, would frequently, on their march, break down a buſh or a ſhrub and leave the top pointing in the direction they had gone, that the ſtraggler, when he ſhould behold it, might ſhape his courſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>WE come to the campaign when General Abercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie took the command at Fort Edward. That General ordered Major Putnam, with ſixty men, to proceed by land to South-Bay on Lake George, for the purpoſe of making diſcoveries and intercepting the enemy's parties. The latter, in compliance with theſe orders, poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at Wood-Creek, near its entrance into South Bay.
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:022578_0221_0FB9990AB64251E0"/>
On this bank, which forms a jutting precipice ten or twelve feet above the water, he erected a ſtone parapet thirty feet in length; and maſked it with young pine-trees, cut at a diſtance, and ſo artfully planted as to imitate the natural growth. From hence he ſent back fifteen of his men, who had fallen ſick. Diſtreſs for want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, occaſioned by the length of march and time ſpent on this temporary fortification, compelled him to devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate from a rule he had eſtabliſhed, never to permit a gun to be fired but at an enemy, while on a ſcout. He was now obliged himſelf to ſhoot a buck, which had jumped into the Creek, in order to eke out their ſcanty ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance until the fourth day after the completion of the works. About ten o'clock that evening, one of the men on duty at the margin of the Bay informed him, that a fleet of bark canoes, filled with men, was ſteering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mouth of the creek. He immediately called in all his centinels and ordered every man to his poſt. A profound ſtillneſs reigned in the atmoſphere, and the full moon ſhone with uncommon brightneſs. The creek, which the enemy entered, is about ſix rods wide, and the bank oppoſite to the parapet above twenty feet high. It was intended to permit the canoes in front to paſs—they had accordingly juſt paſſed, when a ſoldier acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally ſtruck his firelock againſt a ſtone. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer in the van canoe heard the noiſe and repeated ſeveral times the Savage watch-word OWISH! Inſtantly the canoes huddled together, with their centre preciſely in front of the works, covering the creek, for a conſiderable diſtance, above and below. The officers appeared to be in deep conſultation and the fleet on the point of returning; when Major Putnam,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:022578_0222_0FB9991536028DA8"/>
who had ordered his men in the moſt peremptory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not to fire until he ſhould ſet the example, gave the ſignal by diſcharging his piece. They fired. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could exceed the inextricable confuſion and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſternation occaſioned by this well concerted at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. But, at laſt, the enemy finding, from the unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, (though there was no abſolute intermiſſion) in the firing, that the number of our men muſt be ſmall, reſolved to land below and ſurround them. Putnam, apprehenſive of this from the movement, ſent Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Robert Durkee<note n="*" place="bottom">As the name of the brave Durkee will occur no more in theſe ſheets, I may be indulged in mentioning his melancholy fate. He ſurvived this war, and was appointed a Captain in that war which terminated in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of our Independence. In 1778 he was wounded and taken priſoner by the Savages, at the battle of Wioming on the Suſquehannah. Having been condemned to be burnt, the Indians kept him in the flames with pitchforks, until he expired in the moſt excruciating torments.</note>, with twelve men, about thirty rods down the creek, who arrived in time to repulſe the party which attempted to land. Another ſmall detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under Lieutenant Parſons, was ordered up the creek to prevent any ſimilar attempt. In the mean time, Major Putnam, kept up (through the whole night) an inceſſant and deadly fire on the main body of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, without receiving any thing in return but ſhot void of effect, accompanied with dolorous groans, miſerable ſhrieks and diſmal ſavage yells. After day-break, he was adviſed that one part of the enemy had effected a ſanding conſiderably below, and were rapidly advancing to cut off his retreat. Appriſed of the great ſuperiority ſtill oppoſed to him, as well as of the ſituation of his own ſoldiers, ſome of whom were entirely deſtitute of
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:022578_0223_0FB99915F0CCD7F8"/>
ammunition, and the reſt reduced to one or two rounds per man, he commanded them to ſwing their packs. By haſtening the retreat, in good order, they had juſt time to retire far enough up the creek to prevent being encloſed. During this long continued action, in which the Americans had ſlain at leaſt five times their own number, only one Provincial and one Indian were wounded on their ſide. Theſe unfortunate men had been ſent off for camp in the night, with two men to aſſiſt them, and directions to proceed by Wood-Creek as the ſafeſt, though not the ſhorteſt, route. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken a nearer way, they were purſued and overtaken by the Indians, who, from the blood on the leaves and buſhes, believed that they were on the trail of our whole party. The wounded, deſpairing of mercy, and unable to fly, inſiſted that the well ſoldiers ſhould make their eſcape, which, on a moment's deliberation, they effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Provincial, whoſe thigh was broken by a ball, upon the approach of the Savages fired his piece and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three of them; after which he was quickly hacked in pieces. The Indian, however, was ſaved alive. This man, Major Putnam ſaw, afterwards, in Canada; where he likewiſe learned that his enemy in the rencounter at Wood-Creek, conſiſted of five hundred French and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, under the command of the celebrated partizan Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang, and that no party, ſince the war, had ſuffered ſo ſeverely, as more than one half of thoſe who went out never returned.</p>
            <p>OUR brave little company, reduced to forty in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, had proceeded along the bank of the creek about an hour's march, when, Major Putnam, being in front,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:022578_0224_0FB99922CD5DD830"/>
was fired upon by a party juſt at hand. He, rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating the advantage often obtained by aſſuming a bold countenance on a critical occaſion, in a ſtentoropho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic tone, ordered his men to ruſh on the enemy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhould ſoon give a good account of them. It proved to be a ſcout of Provincials, who conceived they were firing upon the French; but the Commanding Officer, knowing Putnam's voice, cried out, <q>that they were all friends.</q>—Upon this the Major told him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, <q>that friends or enemies, they all deſerved to be hanged for not killing more when they had ſo fair a ſhot.</q> In fact, but one man was mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. While theſe things were tranſacted, a faithful ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, whoſe ammunition had been early exhauſted, made his way to the Fort, and gave ſuch information, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lyman was detached with five hundred men to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the retreat. Major Putnam met them at only twelve miles diſtance from the fort, to which they returned the next day.</p>
            <p>IN the winter of 1757, when Colonel Haviland was Commandant of Fort Edward, the barracks adjoining to the north-weſt baſtion took fire. They extended within twelve feet of the Magazine, which contained three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred barrels of powder. On its firſt diſcovery, the fire raged with great violence. The Commandant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, in vain, by diſcharging ſome pieces of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy artillery againſt the ſupporters of this flight of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks, to level them with the ground. Putnam arrived from the Iſland where he was ſtationed, at the moment when the blaze approached that end which was contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Magazine. Inſtantly a vigorous attempt was
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:022578_0225_0FB999274D036BC0"/>
made to extinguiſh the conflagration. A way was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a poſtern gate to the river, and the ſoldiers were employed in bringing water; which he, having mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a ladder to the eves of the building, received and threw upon the flame. It continued, notwithſtanding their utmoſt efforts, to gain upon them. He ſtood, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in ſmoke, ſo near the ſheet of fire, that a pair of thick blanket mittens were burnt entirely from his hands—he was ſupplied with another pair dipt in water. Colonel Haviland fearing that he would periſh in the flames, called to him to come down. But he entreated that he might be ſuffered to remain, ſince deſtruction muſt inevitably enſue if their exertions ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The gallant Commandant not leſs aſtoniſhed than charmed at the boldneſs of his conduct, forbade any more effects to be carried out of the fort, animated the men to redoubled diligence, and exclaimed <q>if we muſt be blown up, we will go all together.</q> At laſt, when the barracks were ſeen to be tumbling, Putnam deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, placed himſelf at the interval, and continued from an inceſſant rotation of repleniſhed buckets to pour water upon the Magazine. The outſide planks were already conſumed by the proximity of the fire, and as only one thickneſs of timber intervened, the trepidation now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general and extreme. Putnam, ſtill undaunted, covered with a cloud of cinders, and ſcorched with the intenſity of the heat, maintained his poſition until the fire ſubſided, and the danger was wholly over. He had contended for one hour and an half with that terrible element. His legs, his thighs, his arms, and his face were bliſtered; and when he pulled off his ſecond pair of mittens, the ſkin from his hands and fingers followed

them. It was a month before he recovered. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, to whom his merits had before endeared him, could not ſtifle the emotions of gratitude, due to the man who had been ſo inſtrumental in preſerving the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, the Fort, and the Garriſon.</p>
            <p>THE repulſe before Ticonderoga, took place in 1758. General Abercrombie, the Britiſh Commander in Chief in America, conducted the expedition. His army, which amounted to nearly ſixteen thouſand Regulars and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials, was amply ſupplied with artillery and military ſtores. This well-appointed corps paſſed over Lake George, and landed, without oppoſition, at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> point of deſtination. The troops advanced in columns. Lord Howe having Major Putnam with him, was in front of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. A body of about five hundred men (the advance or pickets of the French army) which had fled at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſkirmiſh with our left. "Putnam," ſaid Lord Howe, "what means that firing?" <q>I know not, but with your Lordſhip's leave will ſee,</q> replied the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. "I will accompany you," rejoined the gallant young Nobleman. In vain did Major Putnam attempt to diſſuade him, by ſaying—<q>My Lord, if I am killed, the loſs of my life will be of little conſequence, but the preſervation of yours is of infinite importance to this army.</q> The only anſwer was, Putnam, your <q>life is as dear to you as mine is to me; I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go.</q> One hundred of the van, under Major Putnam, filed off with Lord Howe. They ſoon met the left flank of the enemy's advance, by whoſe firſt fire his Lordſhip ſell—It was a loſs indeed; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt in the operations which occurred three days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

His manners and his virtues, had made him the idol of the army. From his firſt arrival in America, he had accommodated<note n="*" place="bottom">He cut his hair ſhort, and induced the Regiment to follow the example. He faſhioned their cloathing for the activity of ſervice, and diveſted himſelf and them of every article of ſuperfluous baggage.</note> himſelf and his regiment to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar nature of the ſervice. Examplary to the officer, a friend of the ſoldier, the model of diſcipline, he had not failed to encounter every hardſhip and hazard. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more calculated to inſpire men with the raſh animation of rage, or to temper it with the cool perſeverance of revenge, than the fight of ſuch a hero, ſo beloved, fallen in his country's cauſe. It had the effect. Putnam's party, having cut their way obliquely through the enemy's ranks, and having been joined by Captain D'Ell with twenty men, together with ſome other ſmall parties, charged them ſo furiouſly in rear, that nearly three hundred were killed on the ſpot, and one hundred and forty-eight made priſoners. In the mean time, from the unſkilfulneſs of the guides, ſome of our columns were bewildered. The left wing, ſeeing Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam's party in their front, advancing over the dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies towards them, commenced a briſk and heavy fire, which killed a ſerjeant and ſeveral privates. Nor could they, by ſounds or ſighs, be convinced of their miſtake, until Major Putnam, preſerving (if Heaven had thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it) the loſs of his own life to the loſs of the lives of his brave aſſociates, ran through the midſt of the flying balls, and prevented the impending cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>THE tender feelings, which Major Putnam poſſeſſed, taught him to reſpect an unfortunate foe, and to ſtrive,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:022578_0228_0FB9993060175500"/>
by every lenient art in his power to alleviate the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of war. For this purpoſe, he remained on the field, until it began to grow dark, employed in collecting ſuch of the enemy as were left wounded, to one place; he gave them all the liquor and little refreſhments which he could procure; he furniſhed to each of them a blanket; he put three blankets under a French ſerjeant who was badly wounded through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

"Ah," ſaid Major Putnam, <q>depend upon it, my brave ſoldier you ſhall be brought to the camp as ſoon as poſſible, and the ſame care ſhall be taken of you as if you were my brother.</q>—The next morning Major Rogers was ſent to reconnoitre the field, and to bring off the wounded priſoners—but finding the wounded unable to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in order to ſave trouble, he diſpatched every one of them to the world of ſpirits. Putnam's was not the only heart that bled. The Provincial and Britiſh Officers who became acquainted with the fact, were ſtruck with inexpreſſible horror.</p>
            <p>TICONDEROGA is ſurrounded on three ſides by water, on the fourth, for ſome diſtance, extends a dangerous moraſs, the remainder was then fortified with a line eight feet high, and planted with artillery. For one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards in front, the plain was covered with great trees, cut for the purpoſe of defence; whoſe interwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ſharpened branches projected outwards. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe impediments, the engineer, who had been employed to reconnoitre, reported, as his opinion, that the works might be carried with muſquetry. The
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:022578_0229_0FB999386E577EB0"/>
difficulty and delay of dragging the battering cannon, over grounds almoſt impracticable, induced the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this fatal advice—to which, however, a rumour that the garriſon, already conſiſting of four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, was on the point of being augmented with three thouſand more, probably contributed. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack was as ſpirited in execution as ill-judged in deſign. The aſſailants, after having been for more than four hours expoſed to a moſt fatal fire, without making any impreſſion by their reiterated and obſtinate proofs of valor, were ordered to retreat. Major Putnam, who had acted as an aid in bringing the Provincial regiments ſucceſſively to action, aſſiſted in preſerving order. It was ſaid, that a great number of the enemy were ſhot in the head, every other part having been concealed behind their works. The loſs on our ſide was upwards of two thouſand killed and wounded. Twenty-five hundred ſtands of arms were taken by the French. Our army, after ſuſtaining this havoc, retreated with ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary precipitation, that they regained their camp at the ſouthward of Lake George, the evening after the action.</p>
            <p>THE ſucceſſes, in other parts of America, made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this defeat. Louiſbourg, after a vigoros ſiege, was reduced by the Generals Amherſt and Wolfe; Frontenac, a poſt of importance on the communication between Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence, ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Colonel Bradſtreet: and Fort Du Queſne, ſituat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the confluence of Monongahela with the Ohio, (the poſſeſſion of which had kindle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A FEW adventures, in which the public intereſts were little concerned, but which, from their peculiarity, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear worthy of being preſerved, happened before the concluſion of the year. As one day, Major Putnam chanced to lie, with a batteau and five men, on the eaſtern ſhore of the Hudſon, near the Rapids, contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to which Fort-Miller ſtood; his men on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite bank had given him to underſtand, that a large body of Savages were in his rear, and would be upon him in a moment.—To ſtay and be ſacrificed—to attempt croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and be ſhot—or to go down to the falls, with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt abſolute certainty of being drowned, were the ſole alternatives, that preſented themſelves to his choice. So inſtantaneouſly was the latter adopted, that one man who had rambled a little from the party, was, of neceſſity, left, and fell a miſerable victim to ſavage barbarity. The Indians arrived on the ſhore ſoon enough to fire many balls on the batteau before it could be got under way. No ſooner had our batteau-men eſcaped, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the rapidity of the current, beyond the reach of muſquet-ſhot, than death ſeemed only to have been avoided in one form, to be encountered in another, not leſs terrible. Prominent rocks, latent ſhelves, abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eddies, and abrupt deſcents, for a quarter of a mile, afforded ſcarcely the ſmalleſt chance of eſcaping without a miracle. Putnam, truſting himſelf to a good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whoſe kindneſs he had often experienced, rather than to men, whoſe tendereſt mercies are cruelty, was now ſeen to place himſelf ſedately at the helm, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:022578_0231_0FB999409BD70788"/>
an aſtoniſhing ſpectacle of ſerenity: his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with a mixture of terror, admiration and wonder, ſaw him, inceſſantly changing the courſe, to avoid the jaws of ruin, that ſeemed expanded to ſwallow the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing boat. Twice he turned it fairly round to ſhun the rifts of rocks. Amidſt theſe eddies in which there was the greateſt danger of its foundering, at one moment the fides were expoſed to the fury of the waves; then the ſtern, and next the bow glanced obliquely onward, with inconceivable velocity.—With not leſs amazement the Savages beheld him ſometimes mounting the billows, then plunging abruptly down, at other times ſkilfully veering from the rocks, and ſhooting through the only narrow paſſage; until, at laſt, they viewed the boat ſafely gliding on the ſmooth ſurface of the ſtream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. At this ſight, it is aſſerted, that theſe rude ſons of nature were affected with the ſame kind of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious veneration, which the Europeans in the dark ages entertained for ſome of their moſt valorous champions. They deemed the man invulnerable, whom their balls (on his puſhing from ſhore) would not touch; and whom they had ſeen ſteering in ſafety down the rapids that had never before been paſſed. They conceived it would be an affront againſt the <hi>Great Spirit,</hi> to attempt to kill this favoured mortal with powder and ball, if they ſhould ever ſee and know him again.</p>
            <p>IN the month of Auguſt, five hundred men were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, under the orders of Majors Rogers and Putnam, to watch the motions of the enemy near Ticonderoga. At South-Bay they ſeparated the party into two equal
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:022578_0232_0FB99942345EE7F8"/>
diviſions, and Rogers took a poſition on Wood-Creek, twelve miles diſtant from Putnam.</p>
            <p>UPON being, ſome time afterwards, diſcovered, they formed a re-union, and concerted meaſures for returning to Fort-Edward. Their march through the woods, was <hi>in three diviſions by</hi> FILES, the right commanded by Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the left by Putnam, and the centre by Captain D'Ell. The firſt night they encamped on the banks of <hi>Clear River,</hi> about a mile from old Fort-Ann, which had been formerly built by General Nicholſon. Next morning, Major Rogers and a Britiſh officer, named Irwin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſly ſuffered themſelves from a ſpirit of falſe emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to be engaged in firing at a mark. Nothing could have been more repugnant to the military principles of Putnam than ſuch conduct; or reprobated by him in more pointed terms. As ſoon as the heavy dew which had fallen the preceding night would permit, the detachment moved in one body, Putnam being in front, D'Ell in center, and Rogers in the rear. The impervious growth of ſhrubs, and under-bruſh that had ſprung up, where the land had been partially cleared ſome years before, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned this change in the order of march. At the moment of moving, the famous French partizan Molang, who had been ſent with five hundred men to intercept our party, was not more than one mile and an half diſtant from them. Having heard the firing, he haſted to lay an ambuſcade pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in that part of the wood moſt favorable to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Major Putnam was juſt emerging from the thicket, into the common foreſt, when the enemy roſe, and with diſcordant yells and whoops, commenced an attack upon the right of his diviſion. Surpriſed, but undiſmayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="233" facs="unknown:022578_0233_0FB99943CD8AA8D8"/>
Putnam halted, returned the fire, and paſſed the word for the other diviſions to advance for his ſupport. D'Ell came. The action, though widely ſcattered, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally fought between man and man, ſoon grew gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and intenſely warm. It would be as difficult as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to deſcribe this irregular and ferocious mode of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Rogers came not up: but, as he declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, formed a circular file between our party and Wood-Creek, to prevent their being taken in rear or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filaded. Succeſsful as he commonly was, his conduct did not always paſs without unfavorable imputation. Notwithſtanding, it was a current ſaying in the camp, "that Rogers always <hi>ſent,</hi> but Putnam <hi>led</hi> his men to action," yet, in juſtice, it ought to be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, that the latter has never been known, in relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtory of this day's diſaſter, to affix any ſtigma up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the conduct of the former.</p>
            <p>MAJOR Putnam, perceiving it would be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to croſs the creek, determined to maintain his ground. Inſpired by his example, the officers and men behaved with great bravery: ſometimes they fought ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregately in open view, and ſometimes individually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover; taking aim from behind the bodies of trees, and acting in a manner independent of each other. For himſelf, having diſcharged his fuzee ſeveral times, at length it miſſed fire, while the muzzle was preſſed againſt the breaſt of a large and well proportioned Savage. This <hi>warrior,</hi> availing himſelf of the indefenſible atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his adverſary, with a tremendous war-hoop ſprang forward, with his lifted hatchet, and compelled
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:022578_0234_0FB9994586165598"/>
him to ſurrender; and having diſarmed and bound him faſt to a tree, returned to the battle.</p>
            <p>THE intrepid Captains D'Ell and Harman, who now commanded, were forced to give ground for a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: the Savages, conceiving this to be the certain harbinger of victory, ruſhed impetuouſly on, with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and redoubled cries. But our two partizans, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting a handful of brave men, gave the purſuers ſo warm a reception as to oblige them, in turn to retreat a little beyond the ſpot at which the action had commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Here they made a ſtand. This change of ground occaſioned the tree to which Putnam was tied to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly between the fire of the two parties. Human ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can hardly figure to itſelf a more deplorable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation. The balls flew inceſſantly from either ſide, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtruck the tree, while ſome paſſed through the ſleeves and ſkirts of his coat. In this ſtate of jeopardy, unable to move his body, to ſtir his limbs, or even to incline his head, he remained more than an hour. So equally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anced, and ſo obſtinate was the fight! At one moment, while the battle ſwerved in favor of the enemy, a young Savage, choſe an odd way of diſcovering his humor. He found Putnam bound. He might have diſpatched him at a blow. But he loved better to excite the terrors of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, by hurling a tomahawk at his head, or rather it ſhould ſeem his object was to ſee how near he could throw it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching him—the weapon ſtruck in the tree a number of times at a hair's breath diſtance from the mark. When the Indian had finiſhed his amuſement, a French Baſ-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer (a much more inveterate ſavage by nature, though deſcended from ſo humane and poliſhed a nation) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:022578_0235_0FB9994A7B54BC68"/>
Putnam, came up to him, and, levelling a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zee within a foot of his breaſt, attempted to diſcharge it; it miſſed fire—ineffectually did the intended victim, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit the treatment due to his ſituation, by repeating, that he was a priſoner of war. The degenerate Frenchman did not underſtand the language of honor or of nature: deaf to their voice, and dead to ſenſibility, he violently, and repeatedly, puſhed the muzzle of his gun againſt Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam's ribs, and finally, gave him a cruel blow on the jaw with the butt of his piece. After this daſtardly deed he left him.</p>
            <p>AT length the active intrepidity of D'Ell and<note n="*" place="bottom">This worthy officer is ſtill living at Marlborough, in the State of Maſſachuſetts.</note> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſeconded by the perſevering valor of their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, prevailed. They drove from the field the enemy, who left about ninety dead behind them. As they were retiring Putnam was untied by the Indian who had made him priſoner and whom he afterwards called maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Having been conducted for ſome diſtance from the place of action, he was ſtripped of his coat, veſt, ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſhoes; loaded with as many of the packs of the wounded as could be piled upon him; ſtrongly pinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his wriſts tied as cloſely together as they could be pulled with a cord. After he had marched, through no pleaſant paths, in this painful manner, for many a tedious mile, the party (who were exceſſively fatigued) halted to breathe. His hands were now immoderately ſwelled from the tightneſs of the ligature: and the pain had become intolerable. His feet were ſo much ſcratched that the blood dropped faſt from them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with bearing a burden above his ſtrength, and
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:022578_0236_0FB9994DC9798D68"/>
frantic with torments exquiſite beyond endurance; he entreated the Iriſh Interpreter to implore as the laſt and only grace he deſired of the Savages, that they would knock him on the head and take his ſcalp at once, or looſe his hands. A French officer, inſtantly interpoſing, ordered his hands to be unbound, and ſome of the packs to be taken off. By this time the Indian who captured him and had been abſent with the wounded, coming up, gave him a pair of mocaſons, and expreſſed great indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation at the unworthy treatment his priſoner had ſuffered.</p>
            <p>THAT Savage Chief again returned to the care of the wounded, and the Indians, about two hundred in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, went before the reſt of the party to the place where the whole were, that night, to encamp. They took with them Major Putnam, on whom beſides innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble other outrages, they had the barbarity to inflict a deep wound with a tomahawk, in the left cheek. His ſufferings were in this place to be conſummated. A ſcene of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes before, was now preparing. It was determined to roaſt him alive.—For this purpoſe they led him into a dark foreſt, ſtripped him naked, bound him to a tree, and piled dry bruſh with other fuel, at a ſmall diſtance, in a circle round him. They accompanied their labors, as if for his funeral dirge, with ſcreams and ſounds ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable but by ſavage voices. Then they ſet the piles on fire. A ſudden ſhower damped the riſing flame. Still they ſtrove to kindle it, until, at laſt, the blaze ran fiercely round the circle. Major Putnam ſoon began to feel the ſcorching heat. His hands were ſo tied that he could move his body. He often ſhifted ſides as the fire
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:022578_0237_0FB999514B3D8C58"/>
approached. This ſight, at the very idea of which all but Savages muſt ſhudder, afforded the higheſt diverſion to his inhuman tormentors, who demonſtrated the delirium of their joy by correſpondent yells, dances and geſticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. He ſaw clearly that his final hour was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably come. He ſummoned all his reſolution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his mind, as far as the circumſtances could admit, to bid an eternal farewel to all he held moſt dear. To quit the world would ſcarcely have coſt a ſingle pang, but for the idea of home, but for the remembrance of domeſtic endearments, of the affectionate partner of his ſoul, and of their beloved offſpring. His thought was ultimately fixed on a happier ſtate of exiſtence, beyond the tortures he was beginning to endure. The bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death, even of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> death which is accompanied with the keeneſt agonies, was, in a manner, paſt—na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with a feeble ſtruggle, was quitting its laſt hold on ſublunary things—when a French officer ruſhed through the crowd, opened a way by ſcattering the burning brands, and unbound the victim. It was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lang himſelf—to whom a Savage, unwilling to ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther human ſacrifice immolated, had run and communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tidings. That Commandant ſpurned and ſeverely reprimanded the barbarians, whoſe nocturnal Powwas and helliſh Orgies he ſuddenly ended. Putnam did not want for feeling or gratitude. The French Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fearing to truſt him alone with them, remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he could deliver him in ſafety into the hands of his maſter.</p>
            <p>THE Savage approached his priſoner kindly, and ſeemed to treat him with particular affection. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:022578_0238_0FB99952B47FD990"/>
him ſome hard biſcuit, but finding that he could not chew them, on account of the blow he had received from the Frenchman, this more humane Savage ſoaked ſome of the buiſcuit in water and made him ſuck the pulp-like part. Determined, however, not to loſe his captive (the refreſhment being finiſhed) he took the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſons from his feet and tied them to one of his wriſts: then directing him to lie down on his back upon the bare ground, he ſtretched one arm to its full length, and bound it faſt to young tree; the other arm was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and bound in the ſame manner—his legs were ſtretched apart and faſtened to two ſaplings. Then a number of tall, but ſlender poles were cut down; which, with ſome long buſhes, were laid acroſs his body from head to foot: on each ſide lay as many Indians as could convenienly find lodging, in order to prevent the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his eſcape. In this diſagreeable and painful poſture he remained until morning. During this night, the longeſt and moſt dreary conceivable, our hero uſed to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulneſs come caſually acroſs his mind, and could not even refrain from ſmiling, when he reflected on this ludicrous groupe for a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of which he himſelf was the principal figure.</p>
            <p>THE next day he was allowed his blanket and moca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and permitted to march without carrying any pack, or receiving any inſult. To allay his extreme hunger, a little bear's meat was given, which he ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through his teeth. At night, the party arrived at Ticonderoga, and the priſonor was placed under the care of a French guard. The Savages, who had been prevented from glutting their diabolical thirſt for blood,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:022578_0239_0FB9995AC21AC5C8"/>
took other opportunity of manifeſting their malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for the diſappointment, by horrid grimaces and angry geſtures; but they were ſuffered no more to offer violence or perſonal indignity to him.</p>
            <p>AFTER having been examined by the Marquis de Montcalm, Major Putnam was conducted to Montreal, by a French officer, who treated him with the greateſt indulgence and humanity.</p>
            <p>AT this place were ſeveral priſoners. Colonel Peter Schuyler, remarkable for his philanthropy, generoſity, and friendſhip, was of the number. No ſooner had he heard of Major Putnam's arrival, than he went to the Interpreter's quarters, and enquired, whether he had a Provincial Major in his cuſtody? He found Major Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam in a comfortleſs condition—without coat, waiſtcoat, or hoſe—the remnant of his cloathing miſerably dirty and ragged—his beard long and ſqualid—his legs torn by thorns and briars—his face gaſhed with wounds, and ſwollen with bruiſes. Colonel Schuyler, irritated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all ſufferance at ſuch a ſight, could ſcarcely reſtrain his ſpeech within limits, conſiſtent with the prudence of a priſoner and the meekneſs of a Chriſtian. Major Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam was immediately treated according to his rank, cloathed in a decent manner, and ſupplied with money by that liberal and ſympathetic patron of the diſtreſſed.</p>

Apprehenſive, if it ſhould be known that Putnam was a diſtinguiſhed partizan, his liberation might be retarded, and knowing that there were officers, who, from the length of their captivity, had a claim of priority to exchange; he had, by his happy addreſs, induced the Governor to offer, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever officer he might think proper to nominate, ſhould be included in the preſent cartel. With great politeneſs in manner, but ſeeming indifference as to object, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his warmeſt acknowledgements to the Governor, and ſaid: <q>There is an old man here, who is a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Major, and wiſhes to be at home with his wife and children. He can do no good here, or any where elſe: I believe your Excellency had better keep ſome of the young men, who have no wife or children to care for, and let the old fellow go home with me.</q> This juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable fineſſe had the deſired effect.</p>
            <p>AT the houſe of Colonel Schuyler, Major Putnam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came acquainted with Mrs. Howe, a fair captive, whoſe hiſtory would not be read without emotion, if it could be written in the ſame affecting manner, in which I have often heard it told. She was ſtill young and handſome herſelf, though ſhe had two daughters of marriageable age. Diſtreſs, which had taken ſomewhat from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal redundancy of her bloom, and added a ſoftening paleneſs to her cheeks, rendered her appearance the more engaging. Her face, that ſeemed to have been formed for the aſſemblage of dimples and ſmiles, was clouded with care. The natural ſweetneſs was not, however, ſoured by deſpondency and petulance; but chaſtened by
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:022578_0241_0FB9995F762DF308"/>
humility and reſignation. This mild daughter of ſorrow looked as if ſhe had known the day of proſperity, when ſerenity and gladneſs of ſoul were the inmates of her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. That day was paſt, and the once lively features, now aſſumed a tender melancholy, which witneſſed her irreparable loſs. She needed not the cuſtomary weeds of mourning, or the fallacious pageantry of woe to prove her widowed ſtate. She was in that ſtage of affliction, when the exceſs is ſo far abated as to permit the ſubject to be drawn into converſation, without opening the wound afreſh. It is then rather a ſource of pleaſure than pain to dwell upon the circumſtances in narration. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing conſpired to make her ſtory intereſting. Her firſt huſband had been killed and ſcalped by the Indians ſome years before. By an unexpected aſſault in 1756 upon Fort Dummer, where ſhe then happened to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with Mr. Howe, her ſecond huſband, the Savages car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Fort, murdered the greater part of the garriſon, mangled in death her huſband, and led her away with ſeven children into captivity. She was for ſome months kept with them: and during their rambles ſhe was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the point of periſhing with hunger, and as often ſubjected to hardſhips ſeemingly intolerable to one of ſo delicate a frame. Some time after the career of her miſeries began, the Indians ſelected a couple of their young men to marry her daughters. The fright and diſguſt which the intelligence of this intention occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to theſe poor young creatures, added infinitely to the ſorrows and perplexities of their frantic mother. To prevent the hated connection, all the activity of female reſource was called into exertion. She found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of conveying to the Governor a petition, that her
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:022578_0242_0FB9996764B15B38"/>
daughters might be received into a convent for the ſake of ſecuring the ſalvation of their ſouls. Happily the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fraud ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the ſame time the Savages ſeparated, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off her other five children into different tribes. She was ranſomed by an elderly French officer, for four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred livres. Of no avail were the cries of this tender mother—a mother deſolated by the loſs of her children, who were thus torn from her fond embraces, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved many hundred miles from each other, into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes of Canada. With them (could they have been kept together) ſhe would moſt willingly have wandered to the extremities of the world, and accepted as a deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion the cruel lot of ſlavery for life. But ſhe was precluded from the ſweet hope of ever beholding them again. The inſufferable pang of parting, and the idea of eternal ſeparation planted the arrows of deſpair deep in her ſoul. Though all the world was no better than a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and all its inhabitants were then indifferent to her—yet the lovelineſs of her appearance in ſorrow had awakened affections, which, in the aggravation of her troubles, were to become a new ſource of afflictions.</p>
            <p>THE officer, who bought her of the Indians, had a ſon, who alſo held a commiſſion, and reſided with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. During her continuance in the ſame houſe, at St. John's, the double attachment of the father and the ſon, rendered her ſituation extremely diſtreſſing. It is true, the calmneſs of age delighted to gaze reſpectfully on her beauty, but the impetuoſity of youth was fired to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the ſight of her charms. One day, the ſon, whoſe
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:022578_0243_0FB999693A4B7258"/>
attentions had been long laviſhed upon her in vain, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her alone, in a chamber, forcibly ſeized her hand, and ſolemnly declared, that he would now ſatiate the paſſion which ſhe had ſo long refuſed to indulge. She recurred to intreaties, ſtruggles, and tears, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent female weapons, which the diſtraction of danger, not leſs than the promptneſs of genius is wont to ſupply: while he, in the delirium of vexation and deſire, ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a dagger, and ſwore he would put an end to her life, if ſhe perſiſted to ſtruggle. Mrs. Howe, aſſuming the dignity of conſcious virtue, told him, it was what ſhe moſt ardently wiſhed, and begged him to plunge the poignard through her heart, ſince the mutual importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and jealouſies of ſuch rivals, had rendered her life, though innocent, more irkſome and inſupportable, than death itſelf. Struck with a momentary compunction, he ſeemed to relent, and relax his hold—and ſhe, avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf of his irreſolution, or abſence of mind, eſcaped down the ſtairs. In her diſordered ſtate, ſhe told the whole tranſaction to his father, who directed her, in future, to ſleep in a ſmall bed at the foot of that in which his wife lodged. The affair ſoon reached the Governor's ears, and the young officer was, ſhortly afterwards, ſent on a tour of duty to <hi>Detroit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS gave her a ſhort reſpite; but ſhe dreaded his return, and the humiliating inſults for which ſhe might be reſerved. Her children, too, were ever preſent to her melancholy mind. A ſtranger, a widow, a captive, ſhe knew not where to apply for relief. She had heard of the name of Schuyler—ſhe was yet to learn, that it was only another appellation for the friend of ſuffering hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:022578_0244_0FB9996AC22D5F80"/>
As that excellent man was on his way from Quebec to the Jerſeys, under a parole for a limited time, ſhe came with feeble and trembling ſteps to him. The ſame maternal paſſion, which, ſometimes, overcomes the timidity of nature in the birds, when plundered of their callow neſtlings, emboldened her, notwithſtanding her native diffidence, to diſcloſe thoſe griefs which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour her in ſilence. While her delicate aſpect was heightened to a glowing bluſh, for fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an inexcuſable importunity, or of tranſgreſſing the rules of propriety, by repreſenting herſelf as being an object of admiration; ſhe told, with artleſs ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, all the ſtory of her woes. Colonel Schuyler, from that moment became her protector, and endeavored to procure her liberty. The perſon who purchaſed her from the Savages, unwilling to part with ſo fair a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, demanded a thouſand livres as her ranſom. But Colonel Schuyler, on his return to Quebec, obtained from the Governor an order, in conſequence of which, Mrs. Howe was given up to him for four hundred livres—Nor did his active goodneſs reſt, until every one of her five ſons was reſtored to her.</p>
            <p>BUSINESS having made it neceſſary that Colonel Schuyler ſhould precede the priſoners who were exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he recommended the fair captive to the protection of his friend Putnam. She had juſt recovered from the meazles when the party was preparing to ſet off for New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>England. By this time the young French officer had returned, with his paſſion rather increaſed than abated by abſence. He purſued her whereſoever ſhe went, and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he could make no advances in her affection, he
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:022578_0245_0FB9996C666DDC30"/>
ſeemed reſolved by perſeverance to carry his point. Mrs. Howe, terrified by his treatment, was obliged to keep conſtantly near Major Putnam, who informed the young officer, that he ſhould protect that lady at the riſque of his life. However, this amorous and raſh lover, in whoſe boiling veins ſuch an agitation was excited, that while he was ſpeaking of her the<note n="*" place="bottom">This phyſical effect, wonderful as it may appear, is ſo far from being a fictitious embelliſhment, that it can be proved by the moſt ſolemn teſtimony of more than one perſon ſtill living.</note> blood would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently guſh from his noſtrils, followed the priſoners to Lake Champlain; and, when the boat in which the fair captive was embarked, had puſhed from the ſhore, he jumped into the Lake, and ſwam after her until it row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of ſight. Whether he periſhed in this diſtracted ſtate of mind, or returned to the ſhore, is not known.</p>
            <p>IN the long march from captivity, through an inhoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable wilderneſs, encumbered with five ſmall children, ſhe ſuffered incredible hardſhips. Though endowed with maſculine fortitude, ſhe was truly feminine in ſtrength, and muſt have fainted by the way, had it not been for the aſſiſtance of Major Putnam. There were a thouſand good offices which the helpleſſneſs of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition demanded, and which the gentleneſs of his nature delighted to perform. He aſſiſted in leading her little ones, and in carrying them over the ſwampy grounds and runs of water, with which their courſe was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interſected. He mingled his own meſs with that of the widow and the fatherleſs, and aſſiſted them in ſupplying and preparing their proviſions. Upon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:022578_0246_0FB99977EBD223C0"/>
within the ſettlements they experienced a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal regret at ſeparation, and were only conſoled by the expectation of ſoon mingling in the embraces of their former acquaintances and deareſt connections.</p>
            <p>AFTER the conqueſt of Canada in 1760, ſhe made a journey to Quebec, in order to bring back her two daughters whom ſhe had left in a convent. She found one of them married to a French officer. The other, having contracted a great fondneſs for the religious ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terhood, with reluctance, conſented to leave them and return.</p>
            <p>A FEW years previous to the war between Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and America, a queſtion of ſome conſequence aroſe reſpecting the title of the lands in Hinſdale (the town in which Mrs. Howe reſided) inſomuch that it was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expedient, that an Agent ſhould be ſent to England to advocate the claim of the town. It may be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a proof of the acknowledged ſuperiority of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and addreſs of this gentlewoman, that ſhe was univerſally deſignated for the miſſion. But the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute was fortunately accommodated to the ſatiſfaction of the people, without their being obliged to make uſe of her talents.</p>
            <p>WE now arrive at the period, when the proweſs of Britain, victorious, alike by ſea and by land, in the new and in the old world, had elevated that name to the zenith of national glory. The conqueſt of Quebec, opened the way for the total reduction of Canada. On the ſide of the Lakes, Amherſt having captured the poſts
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:022578_0247_0FB99979C6B77798"/>
of Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, applied himſelf to ſtrengthen the latter. Putnam, who had been raiſed to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and preſent at theſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, was employed the remainder of this and ſome part of the ſucceeding ſeaſon in ſuperintending the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were detached to procure timber and other materials for the fortification.</p>
            <p>IN 1760 General Amherſt, a ſagacious, humane, and experienced commander, planned the termination of the war in Canada, by a bloodleſs conqueſt. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, three armies were deſtined to co-operate by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent routes againſt Montreal, the only remaining place of ſtrength the enemy held in that country. The corps formerly commanded by General Wolfe, now by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Murray, was ordered to aſcend the river St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; another (under Col. Haviland) to penetrate by the Iſle Aux Noix; and the third, conſiſting of about ten thouſand men, commanded by the General himſelf, after paſſing up the Mohawk-river, and taking its courſe by the Lake Ontario, was to form a junction by falling down the St. Lawrence. In this progreſs, more than one occaſion preſented itſelf manifeſt the intrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and ſoldierſhip Lieutenant Colonel Putnam. Two armed veſſels obſtructed the paſſage and prevented the attack on Oſwegatchie. Putnam, with 1000 men, in 50 batteaux, undertook to board them. This daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs officer, ever ſparing of the blood of others, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of his own, to accompliſh it with the leſs loſs, put himſelf (with a choſen crew, a beetle and wedges) in the van, with a deſign to wedge the rudders, ſo that the veſſels ſhould not be able to turn their broadſides or
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:022578_0248_0FB9997D18DCDE40"/>
perform any other manoeuvre. All the men in his little fleet were ordered to ſtrip to their waiſtcoats, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance at the ſame time. He promiſed, if he lived, to join and ſhew them the way up the ſides. Animated by ſo daring an example, they moved ſwiftly, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſtillneſs, as to certain victory or death. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on board the ſhips, beholding the good countenance with which they approached, ran one of the veſſels on ſhore, and ſtruck the colors of the other. Had it not been for the daſtardly conduct of the ſhip's company, in the latter, who compelled the Captain to haul down his enſign, he would have given the aſſailants a bloody re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. For the veſſels were well provided with ſpears, nettings, and every cuſtomary inſtrument of annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as well as defence.</p>
            <p>IT now remained to attack the fortreſs, which ſtood on an Iſland, and ſeemed to have been rendered inacceſſible by an high abbattis of black-aſh, that every where projected over the water. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam propoſed a mode of attack, and offered his ſervices to carry it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to effect. The General approved the propoſal. Our partizan, accordingly, cauſed a ſufficient number of boats to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itted for the enterprize. The ſides of each boat were ſurrounded with faſcines (muſquet proof) which covered the men compleatly. A wide plank, twenty feet in length, was then fitted to every boat in ſuch manner, by having an angular piece ſawed from one extremity, that, when faſtened by ropes on both ſides of the bow, it might be raiſed or lowered at pleaſure. The deſign was, that the plank ſhould be held erect, while the oarſmen forced the bow with the utmoſt exertion againſt the abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:022578_0249_0FB9997E32A7B278"/>
and that, afterwards, being dropped on the pointed bruſh, it ſhould ſerve as a kind of bridge to aſſiſt the men in paſſing over them. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam, having made his diſpoſitions to attempt the eſcalade in many places at the ſame moment, advanced with his boats in admirable order. The garriſon, perceiving theſe extraordinary and unexpected machines, waited not the aſſault, but capitulated. Lieutenant Colonel Putnam, was particularly honored by General Amherſt, for his ingenuity in this invention, and promptitude in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. The three armies arrived at Montreal, within two days of each other; and the conqueſt of Canada be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came compleat without the loſs of a ſingle drop of blood.</p>
            <p>AT no great diſtance from Montreal, ſtands the Savage village, called Cochnawaga. Here our partizan found the Indian Chief, who had formerly made him priſoner. That Indian was highly delighted to ſee his old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whom he entertained in his own well-built ſtone houſe, with great friendſhip and hoſpitality; while his gueſt did not diſcover leſs ſatisfaction in an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhaking the brave Savage by the hand, and proffering him protection in this reverſe of his military fortunes.</p>
            <p>WHEN the belligerent powers were conſiderably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, a rupture took place between Great Britain and Spain, in the month of January, 1762, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was formed that campaign, under Lord Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle, againſt the Havannah. A body of Provincials, compoſed of five hundred men from the Jerſeys, eight hundred from New-York, and one thouſand from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:022578_0250_0FB999812EE46CD0"/>
joined his Lordſhip. General Lyman, who raiſed the regiment of one thouſand men in Connecticut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being the ſenior officer, commanded the whole: of courſe, the immediate command of his regiment developed upon Lieutenant Colonel Putnam. The fleet, that carried theſe troops, ſailed from New-York, and arrived ſafely on the coaſt of Cuba. There a terrible ſtorm aroſe, and the tranſport, in which Lieutenant Colonel Putnam had embarked with five hundred men, was wrecked on a rift of craggy rocks. The weather was ſo tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the ſurf, which ran mountain-high, daſhed with ſuch violence againſt the ſhip, that the moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſeamen expected it would ſoon part aſunder. The reſt of the fleet, ſo far from being able to afford aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with difficulty rode out the gale. In this deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſituation, as the only expedient by which they could be ſaved, ſtrict order was maintained, and all thoſe people, who beſt underſtood the uſe of tools, inſtantly employed in conſtructing rafts from ſpars, plank, and whatever other materials could be procured. There happened to be on board, a large quantity of ſtrong cords, (the ſame that are uſed in the whale fiſhery) which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſtened to the rafts, after the firſt had with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable hazard reached the ſhore, were of infinite ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in preventing the others from driving out to ſea, as alſo in dragging them athwart the billows, to the beach: by which means, every man was finally ſaved. With the ſame preſence of mind, to take advantage of circumſtances, and the ſame precaution to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, of ſimilar occaſions, how many valuable lives, prematurely loſt, might have been preſerved as bleſſings to their families, their friends, and their country. As
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:022578_0251_0FB99981F4F89BA0"/>
ſoon as all were landed, Lieutenant Colonel Putnam for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his camp, that he might not be expoſed to inſult, from the inhabitants of the neighboring diſtricts, or from thoſe of Carthagena, who were but twenty-four miles diſtant. Here the party remained unmoleſted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days, until the ſtorm had ſo much abated, as to permit the convoy to take them off. They ſoon joined the troops before the Havannah, who, having been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral weeks in that unhealthy climate, already began to grow extremely<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. Haviland (an accompliſhed officer ſeveral times men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in theſe memoirs) who brought to America a regiment of one thouſand Iriſh veterans, had but ſeventy men remaining alive when he left the Havannah. Col. Haviland, during this ſiege, having once with his regiment engaged and routed five hundred Spaniards, met Col. Putnam on his return and ſaid—"Putnam, give me a pinch of ſnuff," "I never carry any," returned Putnam,—"I have always juſt ſuch luck" cried Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viland, "the raſcally Spaniards have ſhot away my pocket, ſnuff-box and all."</note> ſickly. The opportune arrival of the Provincial reinforcement, in perfect health, contributed not a little to forward the works, and haſten the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that important place, But the Provincials ſuffered ſo miſerably by ſickneſs, afterwards, that very few ever returned to their native land again.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH a general peace among the European powers was ratified in 1763, yet the Savages, on our weſtern frontiers, ſtill continued their hoſtilities. After they had taken ſeveral poſts, General Bradſtreet was ſent in 1764, with an army againſt them. Colonel Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, then, for the firſt time, appointed to the command of a regiment, was on the expidition; as was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:022578_0252_0FB9998ACAB4EFB0"/>
Chief, (whom I have ſeveral times had occaſion to mention as his capturer) at the head of one hundred Cochnawaga-warriors. Before General Bradſtreet reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Detroit, which the Savages inveſted, Captain D'Ell, the faithful friend, and intrepid fellow-ſoldier of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Putnam, had been ſlain in a deſperate ſally. He, having been detached with five hundred men, in 1763, by General Amherſt, to raiſe the ſiege, found means of throwing the ſuccour into the Fort. But the garriſon, (commanded by Major Gladwine, a brave and ſenſible officer) had been ſo much weakened, by the lurking and inſiduous mode of war, practiſed by the Savages, that not a man could be ſpared to co-operate in an attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The Commandant would even have diſſuaded Captain D'Ell from the attempt, on account of the great diſparity in numbers; but the latter, relying on the diſcipline and courage of his men, replied, <q>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that I ſhould ever diſobey the orders of my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</q> and immediately diſpoſed them for action. It was obſtinate and bloody. But the vaſtly ſuperior num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Savages, enabled them to encloſe Captain D'Ell's party on every ſide, and compelled him, finally, to fight his way, in retreat from one ſtone-houſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Having halted to breathe a moment, he ſaw one of his braveſt ſerjeants, lying at a ſmall diſtance, wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the thigh, and wallowing in his blood. Whereupon he deſired ſome of the men, to run, and bring the ſerjeant to the houſe, but they declined it. Then declaring, <q>that he never would leave ſo brave a ſoldier in the field, to be tortured by the Savages,</q> he ran and endeavoured to help him up—at the inſtant, a volley of ſhot dropped them both dead together. The
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:022578_0253_0FB9998D88AA3360"/>
party continued retreating, from houſe to houſe, until they regained the Fort; where it was found, the conflict had been ſo ſharp, and laſted ſo long, that only fifty men remained alive, of the five hundred, who had ſallied.</p>
            <p>UPON the arrival of General Bradſtreet, the Savages ſaw, that all further efforts, in arms, would be vain, and, accordingly, after many fallacious propoſals for a peace, and frequent tergiverſations in the negociation, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a treaty, which ended the war in America.</p>
            <p>COLONEL Putnam, at the expiration of ten years from his firſt receiving a Commiſſion, after having ſeen as much ſervice, endured as many hardſhips, encountered as many dangers, and acquired as many laurels as any officers of his rank, with great ſatisfaction, laid aſide his uniform and returned to his plough. The various and uncommon ſcenes of war in which he had acted a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part, his intercourſe with the world and intimacy with ſome of the firſt characters in the army, joined with occaſional reading, had not only brought into view what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever talents he poſſeſſed from nature, but, at the ſame time, had extended his knowledge and poliſhed his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to a conſiderable degree. Not having become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated with pride or forgetful of his old connections, he had the good fortune to poſſeſs entirely the good will of his fellow citizens. No character ſtood fairer in the public eye for integrity, bravery and patriotiſm. He was employed in ſeveral offices in his own town, and not unfrequently elected to repreſent it in the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. The year after his return to private life, the minds of men were ſtrangely agitated, by an attempt of
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:022578_0254_0FB9998EB422F450"/>
the Britiſh Parliament, to introduce the memorable Stamp Act in America. This germe policy, whoſe growth was repreſſed by the moderate temperature in which it was kept by ſome adminiſtrations, did not fully diſcloſe its fruit until nearly eleven years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. All the world knows how it then ripened into a civil war.</p>
            <p>ON the twenty-ſecond day of March 1765, the Stamp Act received the royal aſſent. It was to take place in America on the firſt day of November following. This innovation ſpread a ſudden and univerſal alarm. The political pulſe in the Provinces, from <hi>Main</hi> to <hi>Georgia</hi> throbbed in ſympathy. The Aſſemblies, in moſt of theſe colonies, that they might oppoſe it legally and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, appointed Delegates to confer together on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This firſt Congreſs met, early in October, at New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York. They agreed upon a Declaration of Rights and Grievances of the Coloniſts; together with ſeparate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the King, Lords, and Commons of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In the mean time, the people had determined, in order to prevent the ſtamped paper from being diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Stamp Maſters ſhould not enter on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their office. That appointment, in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, had been conferred upon Mr. Ingerſol, a very dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, ſenſible and learned native of the colony, who, upon being ſolicited to reſign, did not, in the firſt inſtance, give a ſatiſfactory anſwer. In conſequence of which, a great number of the ſubſtantial yeomanry, on horſeback, furniſhed with proviſions for themſelves, and provender for their horſes, aſſembled in the eaſtern counties, and began their march for New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Haven to receive the reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

But having learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Hartford, that Mr. Ingerſol would be in town the next day to claim protection from the Aſſembly, they took quarters there and kept out patroles during the whole night, to prevent his arrival without their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The ſucceeding morning they reſumed their march and met Mr. Ingerſol in Wethersfield. They told him their buſineſs, and he, after ſome little heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mounted on a round table, read his reſignation<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>SUCH unanimity in the Provincial Aſſemblies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the yeomanry, carried beyond the Atlantic, a conviction of the inexpediency of attempting to enforce the new Revenue Syſtem. The Stamp Act being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and the meaſures in a manner quieted, Colonel Putnam continued to labor with his own hands, at farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without interruption, except (for a little time) by the loſs of the firſt joint of his right thumb from one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and the compound fracture of his right thigh from another—that thigh, being rendered nearly an inch ſhorter than the left, occaſioned him ever to limp in his walk.</p>
            <p>THE Provincial Officers and Soldiers from Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, who ſurvived the conqueſt of the Havannah, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed General Lyman to receive the remainder to their prize-money, in England. A company, compoſed part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of military, and partly of other gentlemen, whoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to obtain from the Crown, a grant of Land on the Miſſiſippi, alſo committed to him the negociation of their affairs. When ſeveral years had elapſed in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, a Grant of Land was obtained. In 1770, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:022578_0258_0FB9999AC3455B48"/>
Lyman, with Colonel Putnam, and two or three others went to explore the ſituation. After a tedious voyage, and a laborious paſſage up the Miſſiſippi, they accompliſhed their buſineſs.</p>
            <p>GENERAL Lyman came back to Connecticut with the Explorers, but ſoon returned to the Natchez: theer form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Eſtabliſhment and laid his bones. Colonel Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam placed ſome laborers with proviſions and farming utenſils upon his location, but the encreaſing troubles ſhortly after ruined the proſpect of deriving any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from that quarter.</p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking of the troubles that enſued, I not only omit to ſay any thing, on the obnoxious claim aſſerted in the Britiſh declaratory act, the continuation of the duty on tea, the attempt to obtrude that article upon the Americans, the abortion of this project, the Boſton Port Bill, the alteration of the charter of Maſſachuſetts, and other to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ics of univerſal notoriety; but even wave all diſcuſſion of irritations on the one part, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations on the other, which preceded the war between Great-Britain and her colonies on this continent. It will ever be acknowledged by thoſe who were beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with facts, and it ſhould be made known to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, that the king of England had not, in his exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive dominions, ſubjects more loyal, more dutiful, or more zealous for his glory than the Americans; and that nothing ſhort of a melancholy perſuaſion, that the <q>meaſures which for many years had been ſyſtematical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſued, by his miniſters, were calculated to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, their conſtitutions,</q> could have diſſolved their
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:022578_0259_0FB9999CA1EF64A8"/>
powerful attachment to that kingdom, which they fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called their <hi>parent country.</hi> Here, without digreſſion to develope the cauſe, or deſcribe the progreſs, it may ſuffice to obſerve, the diſpute now verged precipitately to an awful criſis. Moſt conſiderate men foreſaw it would terminate in blood. But, rather than ſuffer the chains (which they believed in preparation) to be rivetted, they nobly determined to ſacrifice their lives. In vain did they deprecate the infatuation of thoſe tranſatlantic counſels which drove them to deeds of deſperation. Convinced of the rectitude of their cauſe, and doubtful of the iſſue, they felt the moſt painful ſolicitude for the fate of their country, on contemplating the ſuperior ſtrength of the nation with which it was to contend. America, thinly inhabited, under thirteen diſtinct colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial governments, could have little hope of ſucceſs, but from the protection of Providence and the unconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit of freedom which pervaded the maſs of the people: it is true, ſince the peace, ſhe had ſurpriſingly encreaſed in wealth and population—but the reſources of Britain almoſt exceeded credibility or conception. It is not wonderful then, that ſome good citizens, of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nerves, recoiled at the proſpect: while others, who had been officers in the late war, or who had witneſſed by travelling, the force of Britain, ſtood aloof. All eyes were now turned to find the men, who, poſſeſſed of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary experience, would dare, in the approaching hour of ſevereſt trial, to lead their undiſciplined fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to battle. For none were ſo ſtupid as not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that want of ſucceſs would involve the leaders in the puniſhment of rebellion. Putnam was among the firſt and moſt conſpicuous who ſtepped forth. Although
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:022578_0260_0FB9999DC3EBB920"/>
the Americans had been, by many who wiſhed their ſubjugation, indiſcreetly as indiſcriminately ſtigmatized with the imputation of cowardice—he felt—he knew for himſelf, he was no coward; and from what he had ſeen and known, he believed that his countrymen, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the extremity of defending their rights by arms, would find no difficulty in wiping away the ungenerous aſperſion. As he happened to be often at Boſton, he held many converſations on theſe ſubjects with General Gage, the Britiſh Commander in Chief, Lord Piercy, Colonel Sheriff, Colonel Small, and many officers with whom he had formerly ſerved, who were now at the Head Quarters. Being often queſtioned, <q>in caſe the diſpute ſhould proceed to hoſtilities, what part he would really take?</q> He always anſwered, <q>with his country, and that, let whatever might happen, he was prepared to abide the conſequence.</q> Being interrogated <q>whether <hi>he,</hi> who had been a witneſs to the proweſs and victories of the Britiſh fleets and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, did not think them equal to the conqueſt of a country which was not the owner of a ſingle Ship. Regiment or Magazine?</q> He rejoined, that <q>he could only ſay, juſtice would be on our ſide, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with Providence: but that he had calculated if it required ſix years for the combined forces of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and her Colonies to conquer ſuch a feeble coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as Canada; it would at leaſt, take a very long time for England alone to overcome her own widely extended Colonies, which were much ſtronger than Canada: That when men ſought for every thing dear, in what they believed to be the moſt ſacred of all cauſes, and in their own native land; they would have
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:022578_0261_0FB999A347B7A1B8"/>
great advantages over their enemies, who were not in the ſame ſituation; and that, having taken into view all circumſtances, for his own part, he fully believed that America would not be ſo eaſily conquered by England as thoſe gentlemen ſeemed to expect.</q> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once, in particular, aſked, <q>whether he did not ſeriouſly believe that a well appointed Britiſh army of five thouſand veterans could march through the whole continent of America? He replied briſkly,—no doubt, if they behaved civilly and paid well for every thing they wanted</q>—"but"—after a moment's pauſe added—<q>if they ſhould attempt it in a hoſtile manner (though the American men were out of the queſtion) the women, with their laddles and broom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, would knock them all on the head before they had got half way through.</q> This was the tenor, our hero hath often told me of theſe amicable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views. And thus, (as it commonly happens in diſputes about future events, which depend on opinion) they parted without conviction: no more to meet in a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner, until after the appeal ſhould have been made to Heaven, and the iſſue confirmed by the ſword. In the mean time, to provide againſt the worſt contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the militia in the ſeveral Colonies was ſedulouſly trained; and thoſe ſelect companies, the flower of our youth, which were denominated minutemen, agreeably to the indication of their name, held themſelves in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to march at a moment's warning.</p>
            <p>AT length the fatal day arrived, when hoſtilities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. General Gage, in the evening of the 18th of April, 1775, detached from Boſton the Grenadiers and
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:022578_0262_0FB999AA6653CC50"/>
Light Infantry of the Army, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Smith, to deſtroy ſome military and other ſtores depoſited by the Province at Concord. About ſunriſe the next morning, the Detachment, on marching into Lexington, fired upon a company of militia who had juſt re-aſſembled: for having been alarmed late at night, with reports that the Regulars were advancing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the ſtores, they collected on their parade, and were diſmiſſed with orders to re-aſſemble at beat of drum. It is eſtabliſhed by the affidavits of more than thirty perſons who were preſent, that the firſt fire, which killed eight of the militia, then beginning to diſperſe, was given by the Britiſh, without provocation. The ſpark of war, thus kindled, ran with unexampled rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and raged with unwonted violence. To repel the aggreſſion, the people of the bordering towns ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ruſhed to arms, and poured their ſcattering ſhot from every convenient ſtation upon the Regulars; who, after marching to Concord, and deſtroying the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, would have found their retreat intercepted, had they not been reinforced by Lord Piercy with the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion companies of three regiments, and a body of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines. Notwithſtanding the junction, they were hard puſhed, and purſued until they could find protection from their ſhips. Of the Britiſh, two hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three were killed, wounded and taken. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans had thirty-nine killed, nineteen wounded, and two made priſoners.</p>
            <p>NOTHING could exceed the celerity with which the intelligence flew every where, that blood had been ſhed by the Britiſh troops. The country, in motion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited but one ſcene of hurry, preparation, and revenge.

Putnam, who was plowing when he heard the news, left his plough in the middle of the field, unyoked his team, and without waiting to change his clothes, ſet off for the theatre of action. But finding the Britiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to Boſton, and inveſted by a ſufficient force to watch their movements, he came back to Connecticut, levied a regiment (under authority of the Legiſlature) and ſpeedily returned to Cambridge<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>An article, void of foundation, mentioning an interview between General Gage and General Putnam appeared in the Engliſh Gazettes, in theſe words: <q>General Gage, viewing the American army with his teleſcope, ſaw General Putnam in it, which ſurpriſed him; and he contrived to get a meſſage delivered to him, that he wanted to ſpeak to him. Putnam, without any heſitation, waited upon him. General Gage ſhewed him his fortifications, and adviſed him to lay down his arms. General Putnam replied, he could force his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications in half an hour, and adviſed General Gage to go on board the ſhips with his troops.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The apprehenſion of an attack, is adduced with much more veriſimilitude, in M'Fingal, as the reaſon why General Gage would not ſuffer the inhabitants to go from the town of Boſton, after he had promiſed to grant permiſſion:
<q>
                        <l>So Gage of late agreed, you know,</l>

NOT long after this period, the Britiſh Commander in Chief, found the means to convey a propoſal, privately to General Putnam, that, if he would relinquiſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel party, he might rely upon being made a Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on the Britiſh eſtabliſhment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad receiving a great pecuniary compenſation for his ſervices. General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam ſpurned at the offer: which, however, he thought prudent at that time to conceal from public notice.</p>
            <p>IT could ſcarcely have been expected, but by thoſe credulous patriots, who were prone to believe whatever they ardently deſired, that officers aſſembled from Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies diſtinct in their manners, and prejudices, ſelected from laborious occupations, to command a heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crowd of their equals, compelled to be ſoldiers only by the ſpur of occaſion, ſhould long be able to preſerve harmony among themſelves, and ſubordination among their followers. As the fact would be a phaenomenon, the idea was treated with mirth and mockery by the friends to the Britiſh government. Yet this unſhaken embryo of a military corps, compoſed of militia, minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, volunteers, and levies; with a burleſque appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:022578_0265_0FB999AE3A03BAF8"/>
of multiformity in arms, accoutrements, cloathing and conduct, at laſt grew into a regular Army—an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which, having vindicated the rights of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eſtabliſhed the independence of a new Empire, merited and obtained the glorious diſtinction of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot Army—the Patriot Army, whoſe praiſes for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in adverſity, bravery in battle, moderation in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, perſeverance in ſupporting the cruel extremities of hunger and nakedneſs without a murmur or ſigh, as well as for their magnanimity in retiring to civil life, at the moment of victory, with arms in their hands, and without any juſt compenſation for their ſervices, will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ceaſe to be celebrated, when time ſhall exiſt no more.</p>
            <p>ENTHUSIASM for the cauſe of liberty, ſubſtituted in the place of diſcipline, not only kept theſe troops toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but enabled them at once to perform the duties of a diſciplined army. Though the Commanding Officers from the four colonies of New-England, were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner independent, they acted harmoniouſly in concert. The firſt attention had been prudently directed towards forming ſome little redoubts and intrenchments; for it was well known, that lines, however ſlight or untenable, were calculated to inſpire raw ſoldiers with a confidence in themſelves. The next care was to bring the live ſtock from the Iſlands in Boſton bay, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the enemy (already ſurrounded by land) from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of them for freſh proviſions. In the latter end of May, between two and three hundred men were ſent to drive off the ſtock from Hog and Noddle Iſlands, which are ſituated on the north-eaſt ſide of Boſton har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. Advantage having been taken of the ebb-tide,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:022578_0266_0FB999B470770F08"/>
when the water is fordable between the main and Hog-Iſland, as it is between that and Noddle-Iſland the deſign was effected. But a ſkirmiſh enſued, in which ſome of the marines, who had been ſtationed to guard them, were killed: and as the firing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the Britiſh water-craft and our party, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of three hundred men, with two pieces of artillery, was ordered to join the latter. General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam took the command, and having himſelf gone down on the beach, within converſing diſtance, and <hi>ineffectually</hi> ordered the people on board an armed ſchooner to ſtrike, he plied her with ſhot ſo furiouſly that the crew made their eſcape, and the veſſel was burnt. An armed ſloop was likewiſe ſo much diſabled as to be towed off by the boats of the fleet. Thus ended this affair, in which ſeveral hundred ſheep, and ſome cattle were removed from under the muzzles of the enemy's cannon, and our men, accuſtomed to ſtand fire, by being for many hours expoſed to it, without meeting with any loſs.</p>
            <p>THE Provincial Generals, having received advice, that the Britiſh Commander in Chief, deſigned to take poſſeſſion of the heights on the peninſula of Charles Town, detached a thouſand men in the night of the 16th of June, under the orders of General Warren, to entrench themſelves upon one of theſe eminences, named Bunker Hill. Though retarded by accidents, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the work until nearly midnight, yet, by dawn of day, they had conſtructed a redoubt about eight rods ſquare, and commenced a breaſt-work from the left to the low grounds: which an inſufferable fire from the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, floating batteries, and cannon on Cop's Hill, in Boſton, prevented them from compleating.

four battalions of foot, ten companies of Grenadiers, ten companies of Light Infantry, with a proportion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, commanded by Major General Howe, landed under a heavy cannonade from the ſhips, and advanced in three lines to the attack. The Light Infantry, being formed on their right, was directed to turn the left flank of the Americans: and the Grenadiers, ſupported by two battalions, to ſtorm the redoubt in front. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, on application, theſe troops were augmented by the 47th Regiment, the 1ſt Battalion of Marines, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome companies of Light Infantry, and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, which formed an aggregate force of between two and three thouſand men. But ſo difficult was it to reinforce the Americans, by ſending detachments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the Neck, which was raked by the cannon of the ſhipping, that not more than fifteen hundred men were brought into action. Few inſtances can be produced in the annals of mankind, where ſoldiers, who never had before faced an enemy, or heard the whiſtling of a ball, behaved with ſuch deliberate and perſevering valor. It was not until after the Grenadiers had been twice repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their boats, General Warren ſlain, his troops ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted of their ammunition, their lines in a manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filaded by Artillery, and the redoubt half filled with Britiſh Regulars, that the word was given to retire. In that forlorn condition, the ſpectacle was aſtoniſhing as new, to behold theſe undiſciplined men, moſt of them without bayonets, diſputing with the butt end of their muſquets againſt the Britiſh bayonet, and receding in ſullen deſpair. Still the Light Infantry, on their left, would certainly have gained their rear, and exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this gallant corps, had not a body of four hundred

Connecticut men, with the Captains, Knoulton and Cheſter, after forming a temporary breaſt-work, by pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up one poſt and rail fence, and putting it upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, performed prodigies of bravery. They held the enemy at bay, until the main body had relinquiſhed the heights, and then retreated acroſs the Neck, with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, and leſs loſs than could have been expected. The Britiſh, who effected nothing but the deſtruction of Charles Town, by a wanton conflagration, had more than one half of their whole number killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the Americans, only three hundred and fifty-five kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wounded, and miſſing. In this battle, the preſence and example of General Putnam, who arrived with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, were not leſs conſpicuous than uſeful. He did every thing that an intrepid and experienced officer could accompliſh. The enemy purſued to Winter Hill—Putnam made a ſtand, and drove them back under cover of their ſhips.</p>
            <p>THE premature death of Warren, one of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious patriots that ever bled in the cauſe of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the veteran appearance of Putnam, collected, yet ardent in action; together with the aſtoniſhing ſcenery and intereſting groupe around Bunker Hill, rendered this a magnificent ſubject for the hiſtoric pencil. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly Trumbull, formerly an Aid-de-Camp to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington, afterwards Deputy Adjutant General of the northern Army, now an artiſt of great celebrity in Europe, hath finiſhed this picture with that boldneſs of conception, and thoſe touches of art which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the maſter.

In nearly the ſame attitude he is exhibited by Barlow in that excellent Poem, the Viſion of Columbus.</p>

            <p>AFTER this action, the Britiſh ſtrongly fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Peninſulas of Boſton and Charles Town:
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:022578_0270_0FB999BF713970C0"/>
while the Provincials remained poſted in the circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country in ſuch manner as to form a blockade. In the beginning of July, General Waſhington, who had been, conſtituted by Congreſs, Commander in Chief of the American forces, arrived at Cambridge to take the command. Having formed the army into three grand diviſions, conſiſting of about twelve Regiments each, he appointed Major General Ward to command the right Wing, Major General Lee the left Wing and Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Putnam the reſerve. General Putnam's alertneſs, in accelerating the conſtruction of the neceſſary defences, was particularly noticed and highly approved by the Commander in Chief.</p>
            <p>About the 20th of July, the declaration of Congreſs ſetting forth the reaſons of their taking up arms, was proclaimed at the head of the ſeveral diviſions. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with theſe patriotic and noble ſentiments, <q>In our own native land, in defence of the freedom that is our birth-right, and which we ever enjoyed until the late violation of it; for the protection of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, acquired ſolely by the honeſt induſtry of our forefathers and ourſelves; againſt violence actually

offered, we have taken up arms. We ſhall lay them down when hoſtilities ſhall ceaſe on the part of the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and all danger of their being renewed ſhall be removed, and not before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>With an humble confidence in the mercies of the ſupreme and impartial Judge and Ruler of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, we moſt devoutly implore his divine goodneſs to conduct us happily through this great conflict, to diſpoſe our adverſaries to reconciliation on reaſonable terms, and, thereby, to relieve the empire from the calamities of civil war.</q>—As ſoon as theſe memorable words were pronounced to General Putnam's Diviſion, which he had ordered to be paraded on Proſpect Hill, they ſhouted in three huzzas aloud, amen! Whereat (a cannon from the Fort being fired as a ſignal) the new <hi>Standard,</hi> lately ſent from Connecticut, was ſuddenly ſeen to riſe and unrol itſelf to the wind. On one ſide was inſcribed in large letters of gold, "AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN," and on the other, were delineated the armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial bearings of Connecticut, which, without ſupporters or creſt, conſiſt, unoſtentatiouſly, of <hi>Three Vines:</hi> with this motto, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Literally, <hi>"He who tranſplanted them will ſupport them,"</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>"Qui tranſtulit, ſuſtinet;"</hi> alluding to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confidence our forefathers placed in the protection of Heaven, on thoſe three allegorical Scions—KNOW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEDGE—LIBERTY—RELIGION—which they had been inſtrumental in tranſplanting to America.</p>
            <p>THE ſtrength of poſition on the enemy's part, and want of ammunition on ours, prevented operations of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from being attempted. Such diligence was uſed in
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:022578_0272_0FB999C70007B4A8"/>
fortifying our camps, and ſuch precaution adopted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſurprize, as to enſure tranquillity to the troops during the winter. In the ſpring, a poſition was taken ſo menacing to the enemy, as to cauſe them, on the 17th of March 1776, to abandon Boſton: not without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable precipitation and dereliction of royal ſtores.</p>
            <p>As a part of the hoſtile fleet lingered for ſome time in Nantaſket road (about nine miles below Boſton) Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington continued himſelf in Boſton, not only to ſee the coaſt entirely clear, but alſo to make many indiſpenſable arrangements. His Excellency, propoſing to leave Major General Ward with a few regiments, to finiſh the fortifications intended as a ſecurity againſt an attack by water, in the mean time diſpatched the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the army to New-York, where it was moſt probable the enemy would make a deſcent. Upon the ſailing of a fleet with troops in the month of January, Major General Lee had been ſent to the defence of that city; who, after having cauſed ſome works to be laid out, proceeded to follow that fleet to South-Carolina. The Commander in Chief was now exceedingly ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that theſe works ſhould be completed as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and accordingly gave the following</p>

To that end, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Brigadier General Health with the whole body of Rifle-men and five Battalions of the Continental Army, by the way of Norwich in Connecticut, to New-York.

NEARLY at the ſame moment, a detachment of a thou and Continentals was ſent to occupy Governor's-Iſland, a Regiment to fortify Red Hook, and ſome companies of Riflemen to the Jerſey ſhore. Of two boats, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to two armed veſſels) which attempted to take on board freſh water from the watering place on Staten-Iſland, one was driven off (by the Riflemen) with two or three ſeamen killed in it; and the other captured with thirteen. A few days afterwards Captain Vandeput, of the Aſia man of war, the ſenior officer of the ſhips on this ſtation, finding the intercourſe with the ſhore interdicted, their limits contracted, and that no good purpoſes could be anſwered by remaining there, ſailed, with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med veſſels, out of the harbor.

an expectation that the ſame ſpirit of zeal for the ſervice, would continue to animate their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</q>—Putnam, who was then the only Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with the main army, had ſtill a chief agency in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the fortifications; and, with the aſſiſtance of the Brigadiers Spencer and Lord Sterling, in aſſigning to the different Corps their alarm Poſts.</p>
            <p>CONGRESS having intimated a deſire of conſulting with the Commander in Chief, on the critical poſture of affairs, his Excellency repaired to Philadelphia accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and was abſent from the twenty-firſt of May, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the ſixth of June. General Putnam, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that interval, had it in charge, to open all letters directed to General Waſhington, <hi>on public ſervice,</hi> and, if important, after regulating his conduct by their contents, to forward them by expreſs; to expedite the works then erecting; to begin others which were ſpecified; to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh ſignals for communicating an alarm; to guard againſt the poſſibility of ſurprize; to ſecure well the Powder-Magazine; to augment by every means in his power the quantity of Cartridges; and to ſend Brigadier General Lord Sterling to put the Poſts in the <hi>Highlands</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a proper condition of defence. He had alſo <hi>a private and confidential inſtruction,</hi> to afford whatever aid might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Provincial Congreſs of New-York, for apprehending certain of their diſaffected citizens: and as it would be moſt convenient to take the detachment for this ſervice, from the troops on Long-Iſland, under the command of Brigadier General Greene, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended that this officer ſhould be adviſed of the plan, and that the execution ſhould be conducted with
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:022578_0278_0FB999DD0C81CC28"/>
ſecrecy and celerity, as well as with decency and good order. In the records of the army, are preſerved, the daily orders which were iſſued in the abſence of the Commander in Chief, who, on his return, was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, that the works had been proſecuted with all poſſible diſpatch, but alſo that the other duties had been properly diſcharged,</p>
            <p>IT was the latter end of June, when the Britiſh fleet, which had been at Halifax, waiting for reinforcements from Europe, begun to arrive at New-York. To ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct its paſſage, ſome marine preparations had been made. General Putnam, to whom the directions of the whale boats, fire rafts, flat-bottomed boats, and armed veſſels was committed, afforded his patronage to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for deſtroying the enemies ſhipping, by exploſion. A <hi>machine,</hi> altogether different from any thing, hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deviſed by the art of man, had been invented by Mr. David Buſhnell,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>David Buſhnell, A.

He deſtroyed a veſſel in the charge of Commodore Symmonds, whoſe report to the Admiral was publiſhed. One of his kegs alſo demoliſhed a veſſel near the Long-Iſland ſhore. About Chriſtmas, 1777, he committed to the Delaware a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of kegs, deſtined to fall among the Britiſh fleet at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia: but his ſquadron of kegs, having been ſeparated and retarded by the ice, demoliſhed but a ſingle boat. This cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe, however, produced an alarm, unprecedented in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and degree; which has been ſo happily deſcribed in the ſubſequent ſong, by the Hon.

                  <p>Mr. Buſhnell, having been highly recommended for his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents by Preſident Stiles, General Parſons, and ſome other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of ſcience, was appointed a Captain in the corps of ſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and miners: in which capacity he continued to ſerve with that corps, until the concluſion of the war.</p>

<pb n="279" facs="unknown:022578_0279_0FB999DFC3D99C68"/>
found to anſwer the purpoſe perfectly, of rowing hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontally at any given depth under water, and of riſing or ſinking at pleaſure. To <hi>this machine,</hi> (called the American Turtle) was attached, <hi>a magazine of powder,</hi> which it was intended to be faſtened under the bottom
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:022578_0280_0FB999E186D786A0"/>
of a ſhip, with a driving ſcrew; in ſuch ſort, that the ſame ſtroke which diſengaged it from the machine, ſhould put the internal clock-work in motion. This being done, the ordinary operation of a gun-lock (at the diſtance of half an hour, an hour, or any determinate time) would cauſe the powder to explode, and leave the effects to the common laws of nature. The ſimplicity, yet combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:022578_0281_0FB999E6CF48E338"/>
diſcovered in the mechaniſm of this wonderful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, were acknowledged by thoſe ſkilled in phyſics, and particularly Hydraulics, to be not leſs ingenious than novel. The Inventor, whoſe conſtitution was too fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:022578_0282_0FB999E80741E518"/>
to permit him to perform the labor of rowing the Turtle, had taught his brother to manage it with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dexterity; but unfortunately his brother fell ſick of a fever, juſt before the arrival of the fleet. Recourſe was therefore had to a ſerjeant in the Connecticut troops;
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:022578_0283_0FB999EA7A80B328"/>
who, having received whatever inſtructions could be communicated to him in a ſhort time, (went too late in the night) with all the apparatus under the bottom of the Eagle, a ſixty-four gun ſhip, on board of which the Britiſh Admiral, Lord Howe, commanded. In coming up, the ſcrew, that had been calculated to perforate the copper ſheathing, unluckily ſtruck againſt ſome iron plates, where the rudder is connected with the ſtern. This accident, added to the ſtrength of tide, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and the want of adequate ſkill in the ſerjeant, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſuch delay, that the dawn began to appear, whereupon he abandoned the Magazine to chance, and (after gaining a proper diſtance) for the ſake of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rowed on the ſurface towards the town. General Putnam, who had been on the wharf, anxiouſly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſult, from the firſt glimmering of light, beheld the machine near Governor's Iſland, and ſent a whale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:022578_0284_0FB999ECE7F05998"/>
to bring it on ſhore. In about twenty minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the magazine exploded, and blew a vaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of water, to an amazing height, in the air. As the whole buſineſs had been kept an inviolable ſecret, he was not a little diverted with the various conjectures, whether this ſtupendous noiſe was produced by a bomb, a meteor, a water-ſpout, or an earthquake. Other operations of a moſt ſerious nature, rapidly ſucceeded and prevented a repetition of the experiment.</p>
            <p>ON the twenty-ſecond day of Auguſt the van of the Britiſh landed on Long-Iſland, and was ſoon followed by the whole army, except one Brigade of Heſſians, a ſmall body of Britiſh, and ſome convaleſcents, left on Staten-Iſland. Our troops on Long-Iſland had been command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the ſummer by General Greene, who was now ſick; and General Putnam took the command, but two days before the battle of Flatbuſh. The inſtructions to him (pointing in the firſt place to deciſive expedients for ſuppreſſing the ſcattering, unmeaning and waſteful fire of our men) contained regulations for the ſervice of the guards, the Brigadiers and the Field officers of the day; for the appointment and encouragement of proper ſcouts; as well as for keeping the men conſtantly at their poſts; for preventing the burning of buildings (except it ſhould be neceſſary for military purpoſes) and for preſerving private property from pillage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. To theſe regulations were added, in a more diffuſe though not leſs ſpirited and profeſſional ſtyle, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the diſtinction of an army from a mob; with exhortations for the ſoldiers to conduct themſelves man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in ſuch a cauſe, and for their Commander to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:022578_0285_0FB999F1B328D128"/>
the enemy's approach with detatchments of his beſt troops: while he ſhould endeavor to render their advance more difficult by conſtructing abbattis, and to entrap their parties by forming ambuſcades. General Putnam was within the lines, when an engagement took place on the 27th, between the Britiſh army and our advanced Corps, in which we loſt about a thouſand men in killed and miſſing, with the General Sullivan and Lord Sterling made priſoners. But our men (though attacked on all ſides) fought with great bravery; and the enemy's loſs was not light.</p>
            <p>THE unfortunate battle of Long-Iſland, the maſterly retreat from thenoe, and the actual paſſage of part of the hoſtile fleet in the Eaſt River above the town, precluded the evacuation of New-York. A promotion of four Majors General, and ſix Brigadiers, had previouſly been made by Congreſs. After the retreat from Long-Iſland, the main army, conſiſting for the moment, of ſixty Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions (of which twenty were Continental, the reſidue Levies and Militia) was, conformably to the exigencies of the ſervice, rather than to the rules of war, formed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fourteen Brigades. Major General Putnam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the right grand Diviſion of five Brigades, the Majors General Spencer and Greene the center of ſix Brigades, and Major General Heath the left, which was poſted near Kingſbridge, and compoſed of two Brigades. The whole never amounted to twenty thouſand effective men; while the Britiſh and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forces under Sir William Howe, exceeded twenty-two thouſand: indeed the Miniſter had aſſerted in Parliament, that they would conſiſt of more than thirty thouſand. Our two center
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:022578_0286_0FB999F415A7A7C8"/>
diviſions, both commanded by General Spencer in the ſickneſs of General Greene, moved towards Mount Waſhington, Harlem Heights and Horn's Hook, as ſoon as the final reſolution was taken, in a Council of War, on the twelfth of September, to abandon the city. That event, thus circumſtanced, took effect a few days after.</p>
            <p>ON Sunday the fifteenth the Britiſh, after ſending three ſhips of war up the North River to Bloomingdale, and keeping up, for ſome hours, a ſevere cannonade on our lines, from thoſe already in the Eaſt River, landed in force at Turtle Bay—our new Levies commanded by a ſtate Brigadier General, fled without making reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Two Brigades of General Putnam's Diviſion, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to their ſupport, notwithſtanding the exertion of their Brigadiers, and of the Commander in Chief him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who came up at the inſtant, conducted themſelves in the ſame ſhameful manner. His Excellency then ordered the Heights of Harlem, a ſtrong poſition, to be occupied. Thither the forces in the vicinity, as well as the fugitives, repaired. In the mean time Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Putnam, with the remainder of his command and the ordinary out-poſts, was in the city. After having cauſed the Brigades to begin their retreat by the rout of Bloomingdale, in order to avoid the enemy, who were then in the poſſeſſion of the main road leading to Kingſbridge, he galloped to call off the pickets and guards. Having myſelf been a Volunteer in his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and acting Adjutant to the laſt Regiment that left the city, I had frequent opportunities that day of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, for the purpoſe of iſſuing orders and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:022578_0287_0FB999F576776F88"/>
the troops, flying, on his horſe covered with foam, wherever his preſence was moſt neceſſary. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his extraordinary exertions the guards muſt have been inevitably loſt, and it is probable the entire Corps would have been cut in pieces. When we were not far from Bloomingdale, an Aid-de-Camp came from him at full ſpeed, to inform, that a column of Britiſh Infantry was deſcending upon our right. Our rear was ſoon fired upon, and the Colonel of our regiment (whoſe order was juſt communicated for the front to file off to the left) was killed on the ſpot. With no other loſs, we joined the army, after dark, on the Heights of Harlem.</p>
            <p>BEFORE our Brigades came in, we were given up for loſt by all our friends. So critical indeed was our ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſo narrow the gap by which we eſcaped, that the inſtant we had paſſed, the enemy cloſed it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their line from river to river. Our men, who had been fifteen hours under arms, harraſſed by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and countermarching, in conſequence of inceſſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larms, exhauſted as they were by heat, and thirſt (for the day proved inſupportably hot, and few or none had canteens, inſomuch that ſome died at the brooks where they drank) if attacked, could have made but feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>IF we take into conſideration the debilitating ſickneſs which weakened almoſt all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> troops, the hard duty by which they were worn down in conſtructing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs defences, the continual want of reſt they had ſuffered (ſince the enemy landed) in guarding from noc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal ſurprize, the deſpondency infuſed into their
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:022578_0288_0FB999F731D4C660"/>

On the other ſide, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Commander in Chief had wiſely countenanced an opinion, then univerſally credited, that our army was three times more numerous than it was in reality. It is not a ſubject for aſtoniſhment, that the Britiſh, ignorant of the exiſting circumſtances, impoſed upon as to the numbers by reports, and recollecting what a few brave men, ſlightly entrenched, had performed at Bunker Hill, ſhould proceed with great circumſpection. For their reproaches, that the Rebels (as they affected to ſtyle us) loved digging better than fighting, and that they earthed themſelves in holes like foxes, but ill concealed at the bottom of their own hearts the profound impreſſion that action had made. Cheap and contemptible as we had once ſeemed in their eyes, it had taught them to hold us in ſome reſpect. This reſpect, in conjunction with a fixed belief that the enthuſiaſtic ſpirit of our oppoſition muſt ſoon ſubſide, and that the inexhauſtible reſources of Britain would ultimately triumph without leaving any thing to chance (not the avarice or treachery of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh General, as the factious of his own nation wiſhed to inſinuate) retarded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

THE MUSQUET AT ANOTHER, FOR OUR POLITICAL SALVATION. It required great talents to determine when one or the other was moſt profitably to be employed. I am aware how faſhionable it has become to compare the American Commander in Chief, for the prudence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in thoſe dilatory and defenſive operations, ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily proſecuted in the early ſtages of the war, to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Romans, who acquired immortality in reſtoring the Commonwealth, <hi>by delay.</hi> Advantageous and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering as the compariſon at firſt appears, it will be found on examination to ſtint the American Fabius, to the ſmaller moiety of his merited fame. Did HE not in ſcenes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unparalelled activity diſcover ſpecimens of tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent abilities, and might it not be proved to profeſſional men, that boldneſs in council, and rapidity in execution were, at leaſt, equally with prudent procraſtination, and the quality of not being compelled to action, attributes of his military genius? <hi>This,</hi> however, was an occaſion, as apparent as preſſing, for attaining his object <hi>by delay.</hi> From that he had every thing to gain, nothing to loſe. Yet there were not wanting <hi>Politicians,</hi> AT THIS VERY TIME, who querulouſly blamed theſe <hi>Fabian</hi> meaſures, and loudly clamored, that the immenſe labor and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence beſtowed on the fortification of New-York, had been thrown away; that, if we could not face the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <hi>there</hi> after ſo many preparations, we might as well relinquiſh the conteſt at once, for we could no where make a ſtand; and that, if General Waſhington, with an army of ſixty thouſand men, ſtrongly entrenched, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined fighting with Sir William Howe, who had little more than one third of that number, it was not to be expected he would find any other occaſion that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

him to engage.—But General Waſhington, content to ſuffer a temporary ſacrifice of perſonal reputation, for the ſake of ſecuring a permanent advantage to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and regardleſs of thoſe idle clamors for which he had furniſhed materials, by making his countrymen, in order the more effectually to make his enemy believe his force much greater than it actually was; inflexibly purſued his ſyſtem, and gloriouſly demonſtrated how poor and pitiful in the eſtimation of A GREAT MIND, are the cenſorious ſtrictures of thoſe Novices in war and politics, who, with equal raſhneſs and impudence, preſume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide dogmatically on the merit of plans they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther originate or comprehend!—</p>
            <p>THAT night our ſoldiers, exceſſively fatigued by the ſultry march of the day, their cloaths wet by a ſevere ſhower of rain that ſucceeded towards the evening, their blood chilled by the cold wind that produced a ſudden change in the temperature of the air, and their hearts ſunk within them by the loſs of baggage, artillery, and works in which they had been taught to put great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, lay upon their arms, covered only by the clouds of an uncomfortable ſky. To retrieve our diſordered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and prevent the enemy from profiting by them, no exertion was relaxed, no vigilance remitted on the part of our higher officers. The Regiments which had been leaſt expoſed to fatigue that day, furniſhed the neceſſary piquets to ſecure the army from ſurprize. Thoſe, whoſe military lives had been ſhort and unpractiſed, felt enough beſides laſſitude of body to diſquiet the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of their repoſe.

The warmth of enthuſiaſm ſeemed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. The force of diſcipline had not ſufficiently occupied its place to give men a dependence upon each other. We were apparently about to reap the bitter fruits of that jealous policy, which ſome leading men (with the beſt motives) had ſown in our foederal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, when they cauſed the mode to be adopted, for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the war by detachments of militia; from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that an eſtabliſhed Continental army, after defending the country againſt foreign invaſion, might ſubvert its liberties themſelves. Paradoxical as it will appear, it may be profitable to be known to poſterity, that, while our very exiſtence as an independent people was in queſtion, the patriotic jealouſy for the ſafety of our future <hi>freedom</hi> had been carried to ſuch a virtuous, but dangerous exceſs, as well nigh to preclude the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of our Independence. Happily that limited and hazardous ſyſtem ſoon gave room to one more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened and ſalutary. This may be attributed to the reiterated arguments, the open remonſtrances and the confidential communications of the Commander in Chief; who, though not apt to deſpair of the Republic, on this occaſion, expreſſed himſelf in terms of unuſual deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. He declared in his letters, that he found, to his utter aſtoniſhment and mortification, that no reliance could be placed on a great proportion of his preſent troops, and that, unleſs efficient meaſures for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a permanent force ſhould be ſpeedily purſued, we had every reaſon to fear the final ruin of our cauſe.</p>
            <p>NEXT morning ſeveral parties of the enemy appeared upon the plains in our front. On receiving this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:022578_0292_0FB99A079A883C80"/>
General Waſhington rode quickly to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, for the purpoſe of preparing againſt an attack, if the enemy ſhould advance with that deſign. Lieutenant Colonel Knowlton's Rangers (a fine ſelection from the eaſtern Regiments), who had been ſkirmiſhing with an advanced party, came in and informed the General that a body of Britiſh were under cover of a ſmall eminence at no conſiderable diſtance. His Excellency, willing to raiſe our men from their dejection by the ſplendor of ſome little ſucceſs, ordered Lieutenant Colonel Knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with his Rangers, and Major Leitch with three Companies of Weedon's Regiment of Virginians, to gain their rear; while appearance ſhould be made of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack in front. As ſoon as the enemy ſaw the party ſent to decoy them, they ran precipitately down the hill, took poſſeſſion of ſome fences and buſhes, and commenced a briſk firing at long ſhot. Unfortunately Knowlton and Leitch made their onſet rather in flank than in rear. The enemy changed their front, and the ſkirmiſh at once became cloſe and warm. Major<note n="*" place="bottom">Major Leitch, after languiſhing ſome days, died of a locked jaw.</note> Leitch having received three balls through his ſide was ſoon borne from the field, and Colonel Knowlton (who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo gallantly at the battle of Bunker-Hill) was mortally wounded immediately after.

General Waſhington, not willing to draw on a general action, declined preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the purſuit. In this engagement were the ſecond and third Battalions of Light Infantry, the forty-ſecond Britiſh Regiment, and the German Chaſſeurs, of whom eight officers and upwards of ſeventy privates were wounded, and our people buried nearly twenty, who were left dead on the field.

                        <p>Parole, Leitch. — Counterſign, Virginia. The General moſt heartily thanks the troops commanded yeſterday by Major Leitch, who firſt advanced upon the enemy, and the others who ſo reſolutely ſupported them. The beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior yeſterday was ſuch a contraſt to that of ſome of the troops the day before, as muſt ſhew what may be done where Officers and Soldiers will exert themſelves.

Among the troops not engaged, who during the action were throwing earth from the new trenches, with an alacrity that indicated a determination to defend them, every viſage was ſeen to brighten, and to aſſume, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the gloom of deſpair, the glow of animation. This change, no leſs ſudden than happy, left little room to doubt that the men, who ran the day before at the ſight of an enemy, would now (to wipe away the ſtain of that diſgrace, and to recover the confidence of their General) have conducted themſelves in a very different manner. Some alteration was made in the diſtribution of Corps to prevent the Britiſh from gaining either flank in the ſucceeding night. General Putnam, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded on the right, was directed in orders, in caſe the enemy ſhould attempt to force the paſs, to apply for a reinforcement to General Spencer, who commanded on the left.</p>

GENERAL PUTNAM, who was too good a huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man himſelf, not to have a reſpect for the labors and improvements of others, ſtrenuouſly ſeconded the views of the Commander in Chief in preventing the devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Farms, and the violation of private property. For under pretext that the property in this quarter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to friends to the Britiſh government (as indeed it moſtly did) a ſpirit of rapine and licentiouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to prevail, which, unleſs repreſſed in the beginning, foreboded, beſides the ſubverſion of diſcipline, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and defeat of our arms.</p>
            <p>OUR new defences now becoming ſo ſtrong as not to admit inſult with impunity, and Sir William Howe, not chooſing to place too much at riſque in attacking us in front, on the 12th day of October, leaving Lord Piercy with one Heſſian and two Britiſh Brigades in his lines at Harlem to cover New-York, embarked with the main body of his army with an intention of landing at <hi>Frog's Neck,</hi> ſituated near the town of Weſt Cheſter, and little more than a league above the communication call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kingſbridge, which connects New-York Iſland with the main. There was nothing to oppoſe him; and he effected his debarkation by nine o'clock in the morning. The ſame policy of keeping our army as compact as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; the ſame ſyſtem of avoiding being forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the ſame precaution to prevent the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſupplies, reinforcements or retreat, that lately dictated the evacuation of New-York, now induced Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington to move towards the ſtrong grounds in the upper part of Weſt Cheſter County.</p>

ABOUT the ſame time, General Putnam was ſent to the weſtern ſide of the Hudſon, to provide againſt an irruption into the Jerſeys, and ſoon after to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, to put that town into a poſture of defence.

            <p>THE Commander in Chief, having in ſpite of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles made good his retreat over the Delaware, wrote to General Putnam (from his Camp above the Falls of Trenton, on the very day he recroſſed the river to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the Heſſians) expreſſing his ſatiſfaction at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of that General's health, and informing, that, if he had not himſelf been well convinced before of the enemy's intention to poſſeſs themſelves of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, as ſoon as the froſt ſhould form ice ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tranſport them and their artillery acroſs the Delaware, he had now obtained an intercepted letter which placed the matter beyond a doubt. He added, that, if the citizens of Philadelphia had any regard for the town, not a moment's time was to be loſt until it ſhould be put in the beſt poſſible poſture of defence; but leaſt that ſhould not be done, he directed the removal
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:022578_0299_0FB9955B7A3C2460"/>
of all public ſtores, except proviſions neceſſary for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate uſe, to places of greater ſecurity. He queried whether, if a party of Militia could be ſent from Philadelphia to ſupport thoſe in the Jerſeys about Mount Holly, it would not ſerve to ſave them from ſubmiſſion? At the ſame time, he ſignified (as his opinion) the expediency of ſending an active and influential Officer to inſpirit the people, to encourage them to aſſemble in arms, as well as to keep thoſe already in arms from diſbanding; and concluded by manifeſting a wiſh that Colonel For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom he deſired to ſee for this purpoſe, might be employed on the ſervice.</p>
            <p>THE enemy had vainly, as incautiouſly imagined that to over-run was to conquer. They had even carried their preſumption on our extreme weakneſs and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubmiſſion, ſo far as to attempt covering the country, through which they had marched, with an extenſive chain of Cantonments. That link, which the poſt at Trenton ſupplied, conſiſted of a Heſſian brigade of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, a Company of Chaſſeurs, a Squadron of Light Dragoons and fix Field Pieces. At eight o'clock in the morning of the twenty-ſixth of December, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, with twenty-four hundred men, came upon them (after they had paraded) took one thouſand priſoners, and repaſſed the ſame day without loſs to his encampment. As ſoon as the troops were recovered from their exceſſive fatigue, General Waſhington re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſed a ſecond time to Trenton. On the ſecond of January, Lord Cornwallis with the bulk of the Britiſh army advanced upon him, cannonaded his poſt, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him battle: but, the two armies being ſeparated
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:022578_0300_0FB9955E3B09D888"/>
by the interpoſition of Trenton Creek, General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington had it in his option to decline an engagement; which he did for the ſake of ſtriking the maſterly ſtroke that he then meditated. Having kindled fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fires around his camp, poſted faithful men to keep them burning, and advanced centinels whoſe fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might be relied upon, he decamped ſilently after dark, and, by a circuitous route, reached Princeton at nine o'clock the next morning. The noiſe of the firing, by which he killed and captured between five and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Britiſh Brigade in that town, was the firſt notice Lord Cornwallis had of this ſtolen march. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington, the project ſucceſsfully accompliſhed, inſtantly filed off for the mountainous grounds of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Town. Meanwhile his Lordſhip, who arrived by a forced march at Princeton, juſt as he had left it, finding the Americans could not be overtaken, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded without halting to Brunſwick.</p>
            <p>ON the fifth of January 1777, from Pluckemin, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington diſpatched an account of this ſecond ſucceſs to General Putnam, and ordered him to move im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with all his troops to Croſſwicks, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of co-operating in recovering the Jerſeys: an event which the preſent fortunate juncture (while the enemy were yet panic-ſtruck) appeared to promiſe. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cautioned him, however, if the enemy ſhould ſtill continue at Brunſwick, to guard with great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection againſt a ſurpriſe: eſpecially, as they, having recently ſuffered by two attacks, could ſcarely avoid being edged with reſentment to attempt retaliation. His Excellency farther adviſed him to give out his

ſtrength to be twice as great as it was; to forward on all the baggage and ſcattering men belonging to the Diviſion deſtined for Morris Town; to employ as many ſpies as he ſhould think proper; to keep a number of horſemen, in the dreſs of the country, going conſtantly backwards and forwards on the ſame ſecret ſervice; and laſtly, if he ſhould diſcover any intention or motion of the enemy that could be depended upon and might be of conſequence, not to fail in conveying the intelligence as rapidly as poſſible by expreſs to Head Quarters.

He had never with him more than a few hundred troops, though he was only at fifteen miles diſtance from the enemy's ſtrong garriſon of Brunſwick. At one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, from a ſudden diminution, occaſioned by the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of the militia, turning out to replace thoſe whoſe time of ſervice was expired, he had fewer men for duty than he had miles of frontier to guard. Nor was the Commander in Chief in a more eligible ſituation. It is true, that, while he had ſcarcely the ſemblance of an army, under the ſpecious parade of a park of artillery, and the impoſing appearance of his Head Quarters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed at Morris Town, he kept up in the eyes of his countrymen, as well as in the opinion of his enemy, the appearance of no contemptible force. Future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations will find difficulty in conceiving how a handful of new-levied Men and Militia, who were neceſſitated to be inoculated for the Small-Pox in the courſe of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, could be ſubdivided and poſted ſo advantageouſly, as, effectually to protect the inhabitants, confine the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

            <p>IN the battle of Princeton, Capt. M'Pherſon, of the 17th Britiſh Regiment, a very worthy Scotchman, was deſperately wounded in the lungs and left with the dead. Upon General Putnam's arrival there, he found him languiſhing in extreme diſtreſs, without a ſurgeon, without a ſingle accommodation, and without a friend to ſolace the ſinking ſpirit in the gloomy hour of death. He viſited and immediately cauſed every poſſible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be adminiſtered to him. Captain M'Pherſon, who contrary to all appearances recovered, after having demonſtrated to General Putnam the dignified ſenſe of obligations which a generous mind wiſhes not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, one day in familiar converſation demanded—<q>pray, Sir, what countryman are you?—An American, anſwered the latter.—Not a Yankee?—ſaid the other. A full-blooded one, replied the General. By G—d, I am ſorry for that, rejoined M'Pherſon, I did not think there could be ſo much goodneſs and generoſity in an American, or, indeed in any body but a Scotchman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHILE the recovery of Captain M'Pherſon was doubtful, he deſired that General Putnam would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a friend in the Britiſh army at Brunſwick to come and aſſiſt him in making HIS WILL. General Putnam, who had then only fifty men in his whole command, was ſadly embarraſſed by the propoſition. On the one hand, he was not content that a Britiſh Officer ſhould have an opportunity to ſpy out the weakneſs of his poſt,
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:022578_0303_0FB99562D5EDCCD0"/>
—on the other, it was ſcarcely in his nature to refuſe complying with a dictate of humanity. He luckily bethought himſelf of an expedient, which he haſtened to put in practice. A Flag of Truce was diſpatched with Captain M'Pherſon's requeſt, but under an injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to return with his friend until after dark. In the evening, lights were placed in all the rooms of the College, and in every apartment of the vacant houſes throughout the town. During the whole night, the fifty men, ſometimes all together and ſometimes in ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, were marched from different quarters by the houſe in which M'Pherſon lay. Afterwards it was known, that the Officer who came on the viſit at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn reported, that General Putnam's Army upon the moſt moderate calculation could not conſiſt of leſs than four or five thouſand men.</p>
            <p>THIS winter's campaign (for our troops conſtantly kept the field after regaining a footing in the Jerſeys) has never yet been faithfully and feelingly deſcribed. The ſudden reſtoration of our cauſe from the very verge of ruin, was interwoven with ſuch a tiſſue of inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table cauſes and extraordinary events, that, fearful of doing the ſubject greater injuſtice by a paſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition than a purpoſed ſilence, I leave it to the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of abler pens. The ill policy of the Britiſh doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs contributed to accelerate this event. For the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, impolitic as inhuman, in which they managed their temporary conqueſts, tended evidently to alienate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their adherents, to confirm the wavering in an oppoſite intereſt, to rouſe the ſupine into activity, to aſſemble the diſperſed to the Standard of America, and
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:022578_0304_0FB99566744AB418"/>
to infuſe a ſpirit of revolt into the minds of thoſe men, who had from neceſſity ſubmitted to their power. Their conduct in warring with fire and ſword againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of youth and the decrepitude of age; againſt the Arts, the Scienceſ, the curious Inventions and the elegant improvements in civilized life; againſt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Widow, the miſerable Orphan, the peaceable profeſſor of humane Literature, and the ſacred Miniſter of the Goſpel, ſeemed to operate as powerfully, as if purpoſely intended to kindle the dormant ſpark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance into an inextinguiſhable flame. If we add, to the black catalogue of provocations already enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their inſatiable rapacity in plundering friends and foes indiſcriminately; their libidinous brutality in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the chaſtity of the female ſex, their more than Gothic rage in defacing private Writings, public Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, Libraries of learning, Dwellings of individuals, Edifices for education and Temples of the Deity; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their inſufferable ferocity (unprecedented indeed among civilized nations) in murdering on the field of battle the wounded while begging for mercy, in cauſing their priſoners to famiſh with hunger and cold in Priſons and Priſon-Ships, and in carrying their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice beyond death itſelf by denying the decent rites of ſepulture to the dead,—we ſhall not be aſtoniſhed that the Yeomanry in the two Jerſeys, when the firſt glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of hope began to break in upon them, roſe as one man, with the unalterable reſolution to periſh in the generous cauſe or expel their mercileſs invaders.</p>

THIS manner of doing duty not only put our own poſts beyond the reach of ſudden inſult, and ſurprize; but ſo exceedingly harraſſed and intimidated the enemy, that foragers were ſeldom ſent out by them, and never except in very large parties.

As the bridge was poſſeſſed and defended by three field pieces, ſo that it could not be paſſed; General Dickenſon, at the head of four hundred militia, broke the ice, croſſed the river (where the water was about three feet deep) reſolutely attacked and totally defeated the foragers.

But the enemy did not remove from their winter-quarters until the ſeaſon arrived when green forage could be ſupplied. In the intermediate period, the correſpondence on the part of General Putnam with the Commander in Chief conſiſted principally of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and enquiries concerning the treatment of ſome of the following deſcriptions of perſons: either of thoſe who came within our lines with flags and pretended flags, or who had taken protection from the enemy, or who had been reputed diſaffected to our cauſe, or who were deſigned to be comprehended in the American Proclamation, which required that thoſe who had taken protections ſhould give them to the neareſt American Officer, or go within the Britiſh lines. The letters of his Excellency in return, generally adviſory, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative of confidence and approbation.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Spring had now ſo far advanced that it was obvious the enemy would ſoon take the field; the Commander in Chief, after deſiring General Putnam to give the officers who was to relieve him at Princeton all the information neceſſary for the conduct of that poſt,
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:022578_0311_0FB9957A0FD3AE78"/>
appointed that General to the command of a ſeparate Army in the Highlands of New-York.</p>
            <p>IT is ſcarcely decided, from any documents yet pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, whether the prepoſterous plans proſecuted by the Britiſh Generals in the Campaign of 1777, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the reſult of their Orders from home, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they partially originated from the contingences of the moment. The ſyſtem, which, at the time, tended to puzzle all human conjecture, when developed ſerved, alſo, to contradict all reaſonable calculation. Certain it is, the American Commander in Chief, was for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time ſo perplexed with contradictory appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that he knew not how to diſtribute his troops, with his uſual diſcernment, ſo as to oppoſe the enemy with equal proſpect of ſucceſs in different parts. The gathering tempeſts menaced the northern Frontiers, the poſts in the Highlands and the City of Philadelphia: but it was ſtill doubtful where the ſury of the ſtorm would fall. At one time Sir William Howe was forcing his way by land to Philadelphia, at another relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Jerſeys, at a third facing round to make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den inroad, then embarking with all the forces that could be ſpared from New-York, and then putting out to ſea—at the very moment when General Burgoyne had reduced Ticonderoga, and ſeemed to require a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation in another quarter.</p>
            <p>ON our ſide, we have ſeen that the old Continental Army expired with the year 1776: ſince which, inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been tortured with expedients and zeal with efforts to levy another. For on the ſucceſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:022578_0312_0FB9957B94FE6B90"/>
ſervice depended the ſalvation of the country. The ſucceſs was ſuch as not to puff us up to preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or depreſs us to deſpair. The army in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, under the orders of the General in Chief, conſiſted of all the troops raiſed ſouth of the Hudſon: that in the northern department, of the New-Hampſhire Brigade two Brigades, of Maſſachuſetts, and the Brigade of New-York, together with ſome irregular Corps: and that in the Highlands of the remaining two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Maſſachuſetts, the Connecticut Line conſiſting of two Brigades, the Brigade of Rhode-Iſland and one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of New-York. Upon hearing of the loſs of Ticonderoga, and the progreſs of the Britiſh towards Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, General Waſhington ordered the northern army to be reinforced with the two Brigades of Maſſachuſetts then in the Highlands—and, upon finding the army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his immediate command out-numbered by that of Sir William Howe, which had by the circuitous route of the Cheſapeak invaded Pennſylvania, he alſo called from the Highlands one of the Connecticut Brigades and that of Rhode-Iſland to his own aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>IN the neighbourhood of General Putnam there was no enemy capable of exciting alarms. The army left at New-York ſeemed only deſigned for its defence. In it were ſeveral entire Corps, compoſed of Tories who had flocked to the Britiſh ſtandard. There was, beſides, a band of lurking miſcreants, not properly enrolled, who ſtaid chiefly at Weſt Cheſter: from whence they infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Country between the two armies, pillaged the cattle and carried off the peaceable inhabitants. It was an unworthy policy in Britiſh Generals to patronize
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:022578_0313_0FB99583837A3688"/>
Banditti. The Whig inhabitants on the edge of our lines, and ſtill lower down, who had been plundered in a mercileſs manner, delayed not to ſtrip the Tories in return. People, moſt nearly connected and allied, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently became moſt exaſperated and inveterate in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Then the ties of fellowſhip were broken—then, friendſhip itſelf being ſoured to enmity, the mind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gave way to private revenge, uncontroled retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and all the deforming paſſions that diſgrace huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Enormities, almoſt without a name, were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated—at the deſcription of which, the boſom, not fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen to apathy, muſt glow with a mixture of pity and indignation. To prevent the predatory incurſions from below and to cover the County of Weſt-Cheſter, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Putnam detached from his Head-Quarters, at Peek's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Kill, Meigs's Regiment, which in the courſe of the Campaign ſtruck ſeveral partizan ſtrokes and atchieved the objects for which it was ſent. He likewiſe took meaſures, without noiſe or oſtentation, to ſecure himſelf from being ſurpriſed and carried within the Britiſh lines by the Tories, who had formed a plan for the purpoſe. The information of this intended enterprize, conveyed to him through ſeveral channels, was corroborated by that obtained and tranſmitted by the Commander in Chief.</p>
            <p>IT was not wonderful that many of theſe Tories were able, undiſcovered, to penetrate far into the country and even to go with letters or meſſages from one Britiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to another.

Sometimes the moſt active Loyaliſts (as the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wiſhed to denominate themſelves) who had gone into the Britiſh Poſts and received promiſes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions upon enliſting a certain number of Soldiers, came back again ſecretly with Recruiting Inſtructions. Sometimes theſe and others who came from the enemy within the verge of our Camps, were detected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death in conformity to the uſages of war.

            <p>A PERSON by the name of Palmer, who was a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in the Tory new Levies, was detected in the Camp at Peek's-Kill. Governor Tryon, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the new Levies, reclaimed him as a Britiſh Officer, repreſented the heinous crime of condemning a man commiſſioned by his Majeſty, and threatened vengeance in caſe he ſhould be executed.

            <p>IMPORTANT tranſactions ſoon occurred. Not long after the two Brigades had marched from Peek's-Kill to Pennſylvania, a reinforcement arrived at New-York from Europe. Appearances indicated that offenſive o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations would follow. General Putnam, having been reduced in force to a ſingle Brigade in the field, and a ſingle Regiment in garriſon at Fort Montgomery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly informed the Commander in Chief that the poſts committed to his charge muſt in all probability be loſt, in caſe an attempt ſhould be made upon them; and that, circumſtanced as he was, he could not be reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the conſequences. His ſituation was certainly to be lamented, but it was not in the power of the Commander in Chief to alter it, except by authoriſing him to call upon the Militia for aid—an aid always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; and often ſo tardy, as when obtained to be of no utility.</p>
            <p>ON the fifth of October, Sir Henry Clinton came up the North River with three thouſand men. After mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many feints to miſlead the attention, he landed, the next morning, at Stony Point, and commenced his march
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:022578_0316_0FB99589C37C0760"/>
over the mountains to Fort Montgomery. Governor Clinton, an active, reſolute and intelligent officer, who commanded the Garriſon, upon being appriſed of the movement, diſpatched a letter by expreſs to General Putnam for ſuccor. By the treachery of the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the letter miſcarried. General Putnam, aſtoniſhed at hearing nothing reſpecting the enemy, rode, with General Parſons and Colonel Root his Adjutant General, to reconnoitre them at King's Ferry. In the mean time, at five o'clock in the afternoon, Sir Henry Clinton's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, having ſurmounted the obſtacles and barriers of nature, deſcended from the Thunder-Hill, through thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets impaſſable but for light troops and<note n="*" place="bottom">The Author of theſe Memoirs, then Major of Brigade to the firſt Connecticut Brigade, was alone at Head-Quarters when the firing began. He haſtened to Colonel Wyllys, the ſenior officer in camp, and adviſed him to diſpatch all the men not on duty to Fort Montgomery, without waiting for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. About five hundred men marched inſtantly under Colonel Meigs; and the author, with Doctor Beardſley, a Surgeon in the Brigade, rode at full ſpeed through a bye-path, to let the garriſon know, that a reinforcement was on its march. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the haſte theſe officers made to and over the river, the Fort was ſo completely inveſted, on their arrival, that it was impoſſible to enter. They went on board the new Frigate, which lay near the fortreſs, and had the miſfortune to be idle, though not unconcerned, ſpectators of the ſtorm. They ſaw the minuteſt actions diſtinctly when the works were carried. The Frigate, after receiving ſeveral platoons, ſlipped her cable and proceeded a little way up the river: but the wind and tide becoming adverſe, the crew ſet her on fire, to prevent her fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the hands of the enemy, whoſe ſhips were approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—The louring darkneſs of the night, the profound ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that reigned, the interrupted flaſhes of the flames that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the waters, the long ſhadows of the cliſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

redoubts. The garriſon, inſpired by the conduct of their leaders, defended the works with diſtinguiſhed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. But, as the poſt had been deſigned principally to prevent the paſſing of ſhips, and as an aſſault in rear had not been expected, the works on the land ſide were incomplete and untenable. In the duſk of twilight the Britiſh entered with their bayonets fixed. Their loſs was inconſiderable. Nor was that of the garriſon great. Governor Clinton, his brother General James Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Colonel Dubois, and moſt of the officers and men effected their eſcape under cover of the thick ſmoke and darkneſs that ſuddenly prevailed. The capture of this fort by Sir Henry Clinton, together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent removal of the chains and booms that obſtructed the navigation, opened a paſſage to Albany, and ſeemed to favor a junction of his force with that of General Burgoyne. But the latter having been compelled to capitulate a few days after this event, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Militia having arrived from New-England, the ſucceſsful army returned to New-York—yet not before a detachment from it, under the Orders of General
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:022578_0318_0FB9958FEB810DF0"/>
Vaughan, had burnt the defenceleſs town of Eſopus, and ſeveral ſcattering buildings on the banks of the river.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the army in the Highlands had been ſo much weakened (for the ſake of ſtrengthening the armies in other quarters) as to have occaſioned the loſs of Fort Montgomery, yet that loſs was productive of no conſequences. Our main army in Pennſylvania, after having contended with ſuperior force in two inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive battles, ſtill held the enemy in check. While the ſplendid ſucceſs, which attended our arms at the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, gave a more favorable aſpect to the American af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, at the cloſe of this campaign, than they had ever before aſſumed.</p>
            <p>WHEN the enemy fell back to New-York by water, we followed them a part of the way by land. Colonel Meigs, with a detachment from the ſeveral Regiments in General Parſons's Brigade, having made a forced march from Crompond to Weſt-Cheſter, ſurpriſed and broke up for a time the band of freebooters, of whom he brought off fifty, together with many Cattle and Horſes which they had recently ſtolen.</p>
            <p>SOON after this enterprize, General Putnam advanced towards the Britiſh lines. As he had received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that ſmall bodies of the enemy were out with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from Governor Tryon to burn Wright's Mills, he prevented it by detaching three parties of one hundred men in each. One of theſe parties fell in with and captured thirty-five, and another forty of the New Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies. But as he could not prevent a third hoſtile party
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:022578_0319_0FB995921887E070"/>
from burning the houſe of Mr. Van Taſſel, a noted Whig and a Committee man, who was forced to go along with them, naked and barefoot, on the icy ground, in a freezing night: he, for the profeſſed purpoſe of retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſent Captain Buchanan, in a Whale-boat, to burn the houſe of General Oliver Delancey on York Iſland. Buchanan effected his object, and by this expedition put a period for the preſent to that unmeaning and wanton ſpecies of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>WHILE General Putnam quartered at New-Rochel, a ſcouting party which had been ſent to Weſt Farms, below Weſt-Cheſter, ſurrounded the houſe in which Colonel James Delancey lodged, and, notwithſtanding he crept under the bed the better to be concealed, brought him to Head-Quarters before morning. This Officer was exchanged by the Britiſh General without delay, and placed at the head of the Cow-Boys, a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Corps of irregulars, who, in the ſequel, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unheard-of depredations and exceſſes.</p>
            <p>IT was diſtreſſing to ſee ſo beautiful a part of the country ſo barbarouſly waſted; and, often to witneſs ſome peculiar ſcene of female miſery. For moſt of the female inhabitants had been obliged to fly within the lines poſſeſſed by one army or the other. Near our quarters was an affecting inſtance of human viciſſitude. Mr. William Sutton of Maroneck, an inoffenſive man, a merchant by profeſſion, who lived in a decent faſhion, and whoſe family had as happy proſpects as almoſt any in the country, upon ſome imputation of Toryiſm went to the enemy. His wife, oppreſſed with grief in the
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:022578_0320_0FB99594C999AC10"/>
diſagreeable ſtate of dereliction, did not long ſurvive. Betſey Sutton, their eldeſt daughter, was a modeſt and lovely young woman, of about fifteen years old, when at the death of her mother, the care of five or ſix young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er children devolved upon her. She was diſcreet and provident beyond her years. But when we ſaw her, ſhe looked to be feeble in health—broken in ſpirit—wan, melancholy, and dejected. She ſaid <q>that their laſt cow, which furniſhed milk for the children, had lately been taken away—that they had frequently been plundered of their wearing apparel and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe believed, by both parties—that they had little more to loſe—and that ſhe knew not where to procure bread for the dear little ones, who had no father to provide for them</q>—<hi>no mother</hi>—ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have ſaid—but a torrent of tears choaked articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In coming to that part of the country, again, after ſome campaigns had elapſed, I found the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſolate and the garden overgrown with weeds. Upon enquiry, I learnt, that, as ſoon as we left the place, ſome ruffians broke into the houſe, while ſhe lay in bed, in the latter part of the night: and that, having been terrified by their rudeneſs, ſhe ran half-naked into a neighbouring ſwamp, where ſhe continued until the morning—there the poor girl caught a violent cold, which ended in a conſumption. It finiſhed a life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpot—and a career of ſufferings commenced and continued without a fault.</p>
            <p>SIGHTS of wretchedneſs always touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration the feelings of General Putnam, and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his generous ſoul to ſuccor the afflicted. But the
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:022578_0321_0FB9959A33F6E310"/>
indulgence, which he ſhewed (whenever it did not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate againſt his duty) towards the deſerted and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing families of the Tories in the State of New-York, was the cauſe of his becoming unpopular with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable claſs of people in that State. On the other ſide, he had conceived an unconquerable averſion to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the perſons, who were entruſted with the diſpoſal of Tory-property, becauſe he believed them to have been guilty of peculations and other infamous practices. But, although the enmity between him and the Sequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators was acrimonious as mutual; yet he lived in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of amity with the moſt reſpectable characters in public departments, as well as in private life.</p>
            <p>His character was alſo reſpected by the enemy. He had been acquainted with many of the principal Officers in a former war. As flags frequently paſſed between the out-poſts, during his continuance on the lines, it was a common practice to forward News-Papers by them; and as thoſe printed by Rivington, the Royal Printer in New-York, were infamous for the falſehoods with which they abounded, General Putnam once ſent a Packet to his old friend General Robertſon with this Billet: <q>Major General Putnam preſents his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Major General, Robertſon and ſends him ſome American News-Papers for his peruſal—when Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Robertſon ſhall have done with them, it is requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they be given to Rivington, in order that he may print ſome truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>LATE in the year we left the lines and repaired to the Highlands. For upon the loſs of fort Montgomery,
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:022578_0322_0FB9959B0BA15F08"/>
the Commander in Chief determined to build another fortification for the defence of the river. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, accordingly, wrote to General Putnam to fix upon the ſpot. After reconnoitering all the different places propoſed, and revolving in his own mind their relative advantages for offence on the water and defence on the land, he fixed upon WEST POINT. It is no vulgar praiſe to ſay, that to him belongs the glory of having choſen this rock of our military ſalvation. The poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for water batteries, which might ſweep the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel where the river formed a right angle, made it the moſt proper of any for commanding the navigation; while the rocky ridges, that roſe in awful ſublimity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind each other, rendered it impregnable, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being inveſted by leſs than twenty thouſand men. The Britiſh, who conſidered this poſt as a ſort of American Gibraltar, never attempted it but by the treachery of an American officer. All the world knows that this project failed, and that Weſt Point continues to be the receptacle of every thing valuable in military preparations to the preſent day.</p>
            <p>IN the month of January, 1778, when a ſnow two feet deep lay on the earth, General Parſons's Brigade went to Weſt Point and broke ground. Want of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering for the troops, together with want of tools and materials for the works, made the proſpect truly gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and diſcouraging. It was neceſſary that means ſhould be found, though our currency was depreciated and our treaſury exhauſted. The eſtimates and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Colonel la Radiere, the Engineer who laid out the works, altogether diſproportioned to our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:022578_0323_0FB9959CDAA99F60"/>
ſerved only to put us in mind of our poverty, and, as it were, to ſatirize our reſources. His petulant behavior and unaccommodating diſpoſition added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther embarraſſments. It was then that the patriotiſm of Governor Clinton ſhone in full luſtre. His exertions to furniſh ſupplies can never be too much commended. His influence, ariſing from his popularity, was unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: yet he heſitated not to put all his popularity at riſque, whenever the federal intereſts demanded. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the impediments that oppoſed our progreſs, with his aid, before the opening of the campaign, the works were in great forwardneſs.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to a reſolution of Congreſs, an enquiry was to be made into the cauſes of military diſaſters. Major General M'Dougall, Brigadier General Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Colonel Wiggleſworth compoſed the Court of Enquiry on the loſs of Fort Montgomery. Upon full knowledge and mature deliberation of facts on the ſpot, they reported the loſs to have been occaſioned by want of men, and not by any fault in the Commanders.</p>
            <p>GENERAL Putnam, who during the inveſtigation, was relieved from duty, as ſoon as Congreſs had approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Report, took command of the right Wing of the Grand Army, under the Orders of the General in Chief. This was juſt after the Battle of Monmouth, when the three armies which had, laſt year, acted ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, joined at the White Plains. Our effective force, in one camp, was at no other time ſo reſpectable as at this juncture. The army conſiſted of ſixty regular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of foot formed into fifteen Brigades, four Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:022578_0324_0FB995A05A4B1058"/>
of Artillery, four Regiments of Horſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corps of State Troops. But as the enemy kept cloſe within their Lines on York-Iſland, nothing could be attempted. Towards the end of Autumn, we broke up the Camp, and went firſt to Frederickſburg, and thence to winter quarters.</p>
            <p>IN order to cover the country adjoining to the <hi>Sound,</hi> and to ſupport the garriſon of <hi>Weſt Point,</hi> in caſe of an attack, Major General Putnam was ſtationed for the winter at Reading in Connecticut. He had under his Orders the Brigade of New-Hampſhire, the two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades of Connecticut, the Corps of Infantry commanded by Hazen, and that of Cavalry by Sheldon.</p>
            <p>THE troops, who had been badly fed, badly cloathed, and worſe paid, by brooding over their grievances in the leiſure and inactivity of winter-quarters, began to think them intolerable. The Connecticut Brigades form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſign of marching to Hartford, where the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly was then in Seſſion, and of demanding redreſs at the point of the bayonet. Word having been brought to General Putnam, that the ſecond Brigade was under arms for this purpoſe, he mounted his horſe, galloped to the Cantonment and thus addreſſed them: <q>My brave lads, whither are you going? Do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deſert your Officers, and to invite the enemy to follow you into the country? Whoſe cauſe have you been fighting and ſuffering ſo long in, is it not your own? Have you no property, no parents, wives or children? You have behaved like men ſo far—all the world is full of your praiſes—and poſterity
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:022578_0325_0FB995A3F92862A0"/>
will ſtand aſtoniſhed at your deeds: but not if you ſpoil all at laſt. Don't you confider how much the country is diſtreſſed by the war, and that your officers have not been any better paid than yourſelves? But we all expect better times, and that the Country will do us ample juſtice. Let us all ſtand by one another' then, and fight it out like brave Soldiers. Think what a ſhame it would be for Connecticut-men to run away from their Officers.</q>—After the ſeveral Regiments had received the General as he rode along the line <hi>with drums beating and preſented arms;</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants, who had then the command, brought the men <hi>to an Order,</hi> in which poſition they continued while he was ſpeaking. When he had done, he directed the acting Major of Brigade to give the word for them to ſhoulder, march to their Regimental parades and lodge arms. All which they executed with promptitude and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good-humor. One Soldier only, who had been the moſt active, was confined in the quarter-guard: from whence, at night, he attempted to make his eſcape. But the centinel, who had alſo been in the mutiny, ſhot him dead on the ſpot, and thus the affair ſubſided.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the middle of winter, while General Putnam was on a viſit to his out-poſt at Horſe-Neck, he found Governor Tryon advancing upon that town with a corps of fifteen hundred men—to oppoſe theſe, General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam had only a Picquet of one hundred and fifty men, and two iron field pieces without horſes or drag-ropes. He, however, planted his cannon on the high ground by the meeting-houſe, and retarded their reproach by firing ſeveral times, until, perceiving the horſe (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:022578_0326_0FB995A773D30F30"/>
by the infantry) about to charge, he ordered the picquet to provide for their ſafety by retiring to a ſwamp inacceſſible to horſe; and ſecured his own by plunging down the ſteep precipice at the church upon a full trot. This precipice is ſo ſleep, where he deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to have artificial ſtairs compoſed of nearly one hundred ſtone-ſteps for the accommodation of foot paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers. There the Dragoons, who were but a ſword's length from him, ſtopped ſhort. For the declivity was ſo abrupt that they ventured not to follow: and, before they could gain the valley by going round the brow of the hill in the ordinary road, he was far enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their reach. He continued his route unmoleſted to Stanford, from whence, having ſtrengthened his pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet by the junction of ſome militia, he came back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and in turn, purſued Governor Tryon in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. As he rode down the precipice, one ball, of the many fired at him, went through his beaver. But Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Tryon, by way of compenſation for ſpoiling his hat, ſent him ſoon afterwards, as a preſent, a complete ſuit of cloaths.</p>
            <p>IN the Campaign of 1779, which terminated the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of General Putnam's ſervices, he commanded the Maryland line poſted at Butter-milk falls, about two miles below Weſt Point. He was happy in poſſeſſing the friendſhip of the officers of that line, and in living on terms of hoſpitality with them. Indeed there was no family in the army that lived better than his own. The General, his ſecond ſon Major Daniel Putnam, and the writer of theſe Memoirs compoſed that family. This campaign, principally ſpent in ſtrengthening the works
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:022578_0327_0FB995A9DD0A1500"/>
of Weſt Point, was only ſignaliſed for the ſtorm of Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Point by the Light Infantry under the conduct of General Wayne, and the ſurpriſe of the poſt of Powles Hook by the Corps under the command of Colonel Henry Lee. When the army quitted the field and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Morris Town into winter-quarters, General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam's family went into Connecticut for a few weeks. In December, the General began his journey to Morris Town. Upon the road between Pomfret and Hartford he felt an unuſual torpor ſlowly pervading his right hand and foot. This heavineſs crept gradually on, and until it had deprived him of the uſe of his limbs on that ſide, in a conſiderable degree, before he reached the houſe of his friend Colonel Wadſworth. Still he was unwilling to conſider his diſorder of the paralytic kind, and endeavoured to ſhake it off by exertion. Having found that impoſſible, a temporary dejection, diſguiſed however under a veil of aſſumed chearfulneſs, ſucceeded. But reaſon, philoſophy, and religion, ſoon reconciled him to his fate. In that ſituation he has conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, favored with ſuch a portion of bodily activity as enables him to walk and to ride moderately; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unimpaired his reliſh for enjoyment, his love of pleaſantry, his ſtrength of memory, and all the faculties of his mind. As a proof that the powers of memory are not weakened, it ought to be obſerved, that he has lately repeated from recollection all the adventures of his life, which are here recorded, and which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been communicated to the compiler in detached converſations.</p>
            <p>IN patient yet fearleſs expectation of the approach of
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:022578_0328_0FB995AAC0243D58"/>
THE KING OF TERRORS, whom he hath full often faced in the field of blood, the Chriſtian hero now enjoys in domeſtic retirement the fruit of his early induſtry. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in youth provided a competent ſubſiſtence for old age, he was ſecured from the danger of penury and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, to which, ſo many Officers and Soldiers worn out in the public ſervice have been reduced. To illuſtrate his merits the more fully, this Eſſay will be concluded with a copy of the laſt letter written to him, by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, in his military character,</p>

                  <p>Your favor of the 20th of May I received with much pleaſure. For I can aſſure you that among the many worthy and meritorious Officers, with whom I have had the happineſs to be connected in ſervice through the courſe of this war, and from whoſe cheerful aſſiſtance in the various and trying viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of a complicated conteſt, <hi>the name of a</hi> PUTNAM <hi>is not forgotten:</hi> nor will be, but with that ſtroke of time which ſhall obliterate from my mind the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of all thoſe toils and fatigues, through which we have ſtruggled for the preſervation and eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Rights, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of our <hi>Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>YOUR congratulations on the happy proſpects of Peace and Independent ſecurity, with their attendant bleſſings to the UNITED STATES, I receive with great ſatiſfaction; and beg that you will accept a return of my gratulations to you on this auſpicious event—
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:022578_0329_0FB995AC845DD7F8"/>
an event, in which, great as it is in itſelf and glorious as it will probably be in its conſequences, you have a right to participate largely, from the diſtinguiſhed part you have contributed towards its attainment.</p>
                  <p>BUT while I contemplate the greatneſs of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for which we have contended, and felicitate you on the happy iſſue of our toils and labors, which have terminated with ſuch general ſatiſfaction; I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you ſhould feel the ungrateful returns of a Country, in whoſe ſervice you have exhauſted your bodily ſtrength, and expended the vigor of a youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſtitution. I wiſh however, that your expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of returning liberality may be verified. I have a hope, they may:—but ſhould they not, your caſe will not be a ſingular one. <hi>Ingratitude has been experienced in all ages,</hi> and REPUBLICS <hi>in particular, have ever been famed for the exerciſe of that unnatural, and</hi> SORDID VICE.</p>
                  <p>THE SECRETARY AT WAR, who is now here, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me that you have ever been conſidered as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to full pay, ſince your abſence from the field; and that you will ſtill be conſidered in that light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the cloſe of the war: at which period you will be equally entitled to the ſame emoluments of half-pay or commutation, as other officers of your rank. The ſame opinion is alſo given by the Pay Maſter Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who is now with the army, impowered by Mr. Morris for the ſettlement of all their accounts, and who will attend to your's whenever you ſhall think
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:022578_0330_0FB995AE9421B790"/>
proper to ſend on for the purpoſe; which it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be beſt for you to do in a ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>I ANTICIPATE, with pleaſure, the day (and that I truſt not far off) when I ſhall quit the buſy ſcenes of a military employment, and retire to the more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil walks of domeſtic life. In that, or whatever other ſituation Providence may diſpoſe of my ſutu days, THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE MANY FRIEND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIPS AND CONNECTIONS I HAVE HAD THE HAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINESS TO CONTRACT WITH THE GENTLEMEN OF THE ARMY, WILL BE ONE OF MY MOST GRATE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL REFLECTIONS. <hi>Under this contemplation, and impreſſed with the ſentiments of benevolence and regard, I commend you, my dear Sir, my other friends, and, with them, the intereſts and happineſs of our dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to the</hi> KEEPING AND PROTECTION OF ALMIGHTY GOD.</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>SINCE the laſt Anniverſary of Independence, my dear fellow-citizens! we have been witneſſes to the complete eſtabliſhment of a new general government: On an event of ſuch magnitude, the voice of congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation has already been heard from one extreme of our land to the other. But as our felicitations can never be more grateful than at the time, when we are convened to commemorate the birth of our nation; it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be expected, from the taſk I am called upon to perform this day, that I ſhould be the organ for expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part we bear in this univerſal joy. I feel a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, from the ſenſations of my own heart, that every boſom in this aſſembly beats high at the thought of our country's happineſs. Even the ardent eyes and the animated countenances of all who compoſe it, atteſt how ſincerely they rejoice in the proſpect before them. But, in the midſt of our rejoicings, we ought to remember, that no occaſion can be more ſuitable than the preſent, for employing our reflections on our political ſituation. I will therefore hope for your indulgence, while I make a few obſervations on the American Revolution: on the neceſſity which afterwards appeared for eſtabliſhing a general government of more energy than the original confederation: on the nature of the government which has lately been carried into effect: and on the national proſperity which we may reaſonably expect will reſult from the faithful adminiſtration of that government.</p>
            <p>AT the commencement of the late war with Great
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:022578_0333_0FB995B7140EEB10"/>
Britain, when we thought ourſelves juſtifiable in reſiſting to blood, it was known to thoſe beſt acquainted with the different conditions of the combatants, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable coſt of the prize in diſpute, that the expence, in compariſon with our circumſtances as coloniſts, muſt be enormous—the ſtruggle protracted, doubtful and ſevere. It was known that the reſources of Britain were almoſt inexhauſtible, that her fleets covered the ocean, and that her troops had harveſted laurels in every quarter of the globe. Not then organiſed as a nation, or known as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the earth, we had no preparations. Money, the nerve of war, was wanting. The ſword was to be forged on the anvil of neceſſity: the treaſury to be created from nothing. If we had a reſource, unknown to our enemy, it was in the unconquerable reſolution, to our citizens, the conſcious rectitude of our cauſe, and a confident truſt that we ſhould not be forſaken by Heaven. The people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered themſelves to the battle; but the means of arming, clothing and ſubſiſting them; as well as of providing the general implements of hoſtility were only to be found in anticipations of our future wealth. Bills of credit were emitted: monies borrowed for the moſt preſſing emergencies: and our men in the field unpaid for their ſervices. At this time the magnanimous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of France reached a foſtering hand to aſſiſt in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening us from ruin. In this manner, peace, attended with every circumſtance that could gratify our reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, was at length obtained. But a load of debt was left upon us. The fluctuation of our paper currency, and the conſequent frequency of ſpeculation in it, had, in too many inſtances, occaſioned vague ideas of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:022578_0334_0FB995B851467C40"/>
produced licentious appetites, and corrupted the morals of men. To theſe immediate conſequences of a fluctuating medium of commerce, may be joined a tide of circumſtances, that flowed together from ſources moſtly opened during and after the war. The ravage of farms, the conflagration of towns, the diminution of agriculture, the extinction of trade, the embarraſſment of ſome who were indebted to Britiſh merchants before the war, the privation in all (during its continuance) of many conveniences of life, the ſubſequent influx of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, the tempting facility of procuring it without preſent payment, the growing taſte for extravagance, and the habit—too ſoon acquired!—of deferring or elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſatiſfaction for juſt obligations, now began to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm the continent with private diſtreſs, bankruptey and breach of faith.</p>
            <p>FROM this period alſo our public affairs were ſeen to decline. I will aſk your attention for a moment, while I ſpeak of the unſatiſfactory part of our old confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the neceſſity that became apparent for inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a different form of government. It is not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of wonder that the firſt project of a federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, formed on the defective models of ſome foreign confederacies, in the midſt of a war, before we had much experience in political affairs; and while, from the concurrence of external danger, and the patriotic impulſe of the moment, implicit obedience was yielded to the requiſitions of an Adviſory Council, ſhould have been imperfect. Our aſtoniſhment ought rather to be excited, that, feeble and inefficient as the government was, it not only carried us in ſafety through the war,
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:022578_0335_0FB995BA6C2C6D08"/>
but kept us from ſeverance until another could be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. By the original confederation, the right to make demands on the ſeveral ſtates for ſuch pecuniary ſupplies as might be neceſſary for defraying the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the war, and for ſupporting the government of the Union, together with ſome other ſpecific preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſovereignty, were committed to Congreſs. But Congreſs, conſtituted in moſt reſpects as a diplomatic body, poſſeſſed no power of carrying into execution a ſingle reſolution, however urgently dictated by prudence, policy, or juſtice. The individual communities, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there exiſted no power of coercion, treated with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, whenever it ſuited their convenience or caprice, the moſt ſalutary meaſures and the moſt indiſpenſable requiſitions of Congreſs. Experience taught us, that the powers given by the members of the union to their federal head, were not ſufficient to enable it to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the purpoſes for which the body politic had been formed. We now touched on the hour of humiliation. The confederacy was found to be a government in name, rather than in reality. Hence the intereſt due on our public debts remained unpaid. Hence many a veteran was reduced to unmerited diſtreſs. Hence we were continually liable on our own part to have infractions made upon treaties, which were equally honorable, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and ſacred. Hence we were in danger of having our faith become as proverbial as that of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, and our name the ſcorn of the earth. Hence there was a nation, which, in ſome meaſure, excluded our veſſels from its ports, burdened our commerce with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable impoſitions, introduced its ſhips into our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying trade, and, becauſe we were deſtitute of a retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:022578_0336_0FB995BB62ECFE88"/>
power, refuſed to enter into a commercial treaty with us. With a debt accumulating from the neceſſity of obtaining repeated loans; with a credit much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired for the want of punctuality, and apprehenſion of national bankruptcy; with cries for juſtice from the widow, the fatherleſs, and the ſoldier worn out in his country's defence, aſcending to that Being who hath purer eyes than to behold iniquity with impunity, who is a God of vengeance as well as a God of juſtice—whither could we turn for ſuccor? where could we fly for refuge?</p>
            <p>THE veil that concealed this melancholy and afflicting picture was at laſt withdrawn. The wiſe and the good ſtood aſtoniſhed at the ſight, none but the ignorant or the wicked reſted unconcerned. Even fearfulneſs ſeized, in many inſtances, upon thoſe well-meaning politicians, whoſe ſecurity had been produced by the ſcantineſs of their information, and the confinement of their views to the local advantages of the ſtates to which they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then it was that men, better informed and more converſant in civil affairs, began to dread that a free, yet efficient government, the object which animated in life, and ſoothed in death, thoſe heroes who had ſealed their principles with their blood, muſt ſtill be loſt: that the proſpect of national happineſs, which invigorated our arms and cheered our hearts through the perilous ſtruggle for Independence, muſt vaniſh for ever from our view: and that the hope of eſtabliſhing the empire of reaſon, juſtice, philoſophy and religion, throughout the extenſive regions of the new world, would be conſidered but the illuſion of a heated imagination. And what
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:022578_0337_0FB995BFA9FD9688"/>
could be more mortifying to every true patriot, than to perceive our countrymen ready to ruſh headlong on their ruin—ready to deſtroy the aſylum which was juſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuffering humanity—ready to verify the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our foes, that our Independence would prove a curſe to its votaries—and (by fruſtrating the faireſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ever afforded for a people to become great and happy in the enjoyment of freedom) to confirm the deteſtable doctrine that mankind, unequal to the taſk of governing themſelves, were made for a ſtate of ſlavery?—Thus our old confederation ſeemed paſſing away. Our day of political probation appeared expiring. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public</hi> was about to aſſume, if I may be allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, a renovated body, prepared for a more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſtate of exiſtence in bliſs or woe. Life and death were in our option. The firſt was involved in UNION under a good general government—the laſt in SEPERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION into a number of miſerable fragments of empire. So long as ſtrength muſt be deemed preferable to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, harmony to confuſion, peace to war, happineſs to miſery, and Independence to ſubjugation, the American People (who will always judge right when they ſhall have the means of information) could not heſitate to prefer the former. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that, amidſt the variety of opinions which prevailed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſyſtem of government proper to be adopted, no man was found ſo hardy as to outrage the feelings of his countrymen, by openly advocating counſels of diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And may we not, uninfluenced by ſuperſtition, believe that Heaven infuſed the idea into our Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to convoke a national aſſembly, at this intereſting and awful criſis!—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="unknown:022578_0338_0FB995C3C8201BD0"/>
THE reſult is ſo well known, that I forbear to dilate upon it. Happily the ſpirit of accommodation, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the Convention, has been diffuſed among their countrymen. The adoption of the government by ſo many communities, diſtinct in their views and intereſts, will be an immortal memorial, of victory gained by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened reaſon over brutal force. Can we contemplate a whole People, like a nation of Philoſophers, diſcuſſing and agreeing on a form of government: can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template a work ſo vaſt in its import, and ſo wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effected—not by violence and bloodſhed, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and conſent—without exclaiming in rapturous admiration, behold a new thing under the fun! and without uttering in grateful adoration, lo, this is indeed the LORD's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes!—</p>
            <p>WITHOUT preſuming to treſpaſs on your patience ſo far as to attempt to analiſe the Conſtitution, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate its merits by logical deductions; I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be permitted juſt to obſerve, that it appears, to be, in its formation, a government of the people, that is to ſay, a government in which all power is derived from, and at ſtated periods, reverts to them—and that, in its operation, it is a government of laws made and executed by the fair ſubſtitutes of the people alone. The elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the different branches of Congreſs by the free men, either directly or indirectly, is the pivot on which turns the firſt wheel of government—a wheel which communicates motion to the whole machine: At the ſame time, the exerciſe of this right of election ſeems to be ſo regulated, as to afford leſs opportunity for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and influence; and more for ſtability and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:022578_0339_0FB995C78424B6F8"/>
than has uſually been incident to popular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nor could the members of Congreſs exempt themſelves from the conſequences of any unjuſt or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical acts, which they might impoſe upon others. For, in a ſhort time, they will mingle with the maſs of the people. Their intereſts muſt therefore be the ſame, and their feelings in ſympathy with thoſe of their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. Beſides, their re-election muſt always depend upon the good reputation which they ſhall have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in the judgment of their fellow citizens. Hence, we may be induced to conclude, that this government is leſs obnoxious to well-founded objections, than moſt which have exiſted in the world. And, in that opinion we may be confirmed on three accounts: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe every government ought to be poſſeſſed of powers ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the purpoſes for which it was inſtituted: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> becauſe no other, or greater powers, appear to be delegated to this government, than are eſſential to attain the objects for which it was inſtituted, to wit, the ſafety and happineſs of the governed: and, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe it is clear, that no government, before introduced among mankind, ever contained ſo many checks or ſuch effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reſtraints, to prevent it from degenerating into any ſpecies of oppreſſion. It is unneceſſary to be inſiſted upon, becauſe it is well underſtood, that the impotence of Congreſs under the former confederation, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency of truſting ſufficiently ample prerogatives to a ſingle body, gave birth to the different branches which conſtitute the preſent general government. Convinced that the balances, ariſing from the diſtribution of the Legiſlative, Executive, and Judicial Powers in this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are the beſt which have hitherto been inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:022578_0340_0FB995C8C5B2FFE8"/>
I preſume not to aſſert that better may not ſtill be deviſed. To avoid a wanton levity of innovation on the one hand, and an unalterable practice of error on the other, are points in policy equally deſirable; though, I believe, a conſtitutional power to effect them never before exiſted. Whether the mode which is pointed out in this Conſtitution, for procuring amendments, be not the wiſeſt, and apparently the happieſt expedient that ever has been ſuggeſted by human prudence, I leave every unprejudiced mind to determine. If, in the mean time, it was a given point, that the late federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not have exiſted much longer; if without ſome ſpeedy remedy a diſſolution of the Union muſt have enſued; if without adhering to the Union we could have no ſecurity againſt falling a prey to foreign invaſion or domeſtic uſurpation; if upon our adherence to the Union depended the protection of our property at home, and the profits of our commerce abroad; if the almoſt unanimous agreement of the federal Convention upon this plan of government (under the local pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and various expectations of the States) could be deemed little ſhort of miraculous; if there was an eaſy proviſion made for the correction of ſuch errors as ſhould be found, from the imbecillity of human nature, to have inſinuated themſelves into it; and if, upon a rejection previous to amendments, there did not appear any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that the ſame ſyſtem could be ſoon enough amended, or any other ſubſtituted in its place by another Convention—ſurely no<note n="*" place="bottom">At this time the States of North-Carolina and Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland had not acceded to the general Government.</note> ſtate ought to have rejected it
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:022578_0341_0FB995CAFB8DB270"/>
without pondering well on the conſequences. Becauſe, enarchy and civil war, with an eventual government of chance or force, appeared but too probable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a general rejection.</p>
            <p>UNDER ſuch circumſtances, it was doubtleſs the part of wiſdom to adopt the Conſtitution. I pretend to no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual foreſight into futurity, and therefore cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to decide what may be its ultimate fate. If a promiſed good ſhould terminate in an unexpected evil, it would not be a ſolitary example of diſappointment. If the bleſſings of Heaven ſhowered thick around us, ſhould be ſpilled on the ground, or converted to curſes, through the fault of thoſe for whoſe uſe they were prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, it would not be the firſt inſtance of folly or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs in ſhort-ſighted mortals. The bleſſed religion, revealed in the word of God, will remain an eternal and awful monument, to prove that the beſt inſtitutions may be abuſed by human depravity; and that they may even, in ſome inſtances, be made ſubſervient to the vileſt of purpoſes, Should hereafter, thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the management of this government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the luſt of domination, and prompted by the ſupineneſs or venality of their conſtituents, break down the barriers of this Conſtitution, and trample on the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated rights of humanity: it will only ſerve to ſhew, that no compact among men, however provident in its conſtruction, and ſacred in its ratification, can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced everlaſting and inviolable—and, if I may ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs myſelf—that no wall of words—that no mound of parchment, can be ſo formed as to ſtand againſt the ſweeping torrent of boundleſs ambition on the one ſide,
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:022578_0342_0FB995CEA1BCAC48"/>
aided by the ſapping current of corrupted morals on the other. But until the people of America ſhall have loſt all virtue; until they ſhall have become totally inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the differences between liberty and ſlavery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſhall have been reduced to ſuch poverty of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as to be willing to ſell that pre-eminent bleſſing of rational beings, the <hi>birth-right of freedom;</hi> in ſhort, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſhall have been found incapable of governing themſelves, and ripe for a maſter—theſe conſequences, ſhould fondly hope, can never arrive.—</p>
            <p>I PROCEED now, in the order propoſed, to treat of the head that was reſerved for the concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: I mean, the national proſperity which we may reaſonably expect will reſult from the faithful admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this government. My chief deſign, in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning a few circumſtances eminently calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our happineſs as a people, is, to increaſe a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to make the beſt poſſible uſe of thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Can there be any purſuit more conſonant to the dictates of reaſon and nature, than that whoſe object is the promotion of the happineſs of our Country? To embrace this object in its utmoſt limit, our imaginations muſt expand with the dimenſions of a Continent, and extend with the revolutions of futurity.</p>
            <p>THE preliminary obſervation, that a free government ought to be founded on the information and morals of the people, will here find its proper place. Happily our citizens are remarkably inſtructed by education, docile to duty, and ingenious for making improvements. More knowledge is, perhaps, at this moment diffuſed among
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:022578_0343_0FB995D150656728"/>
them, than among any other people under Heaven. The conduct and iſſue of the late war may be a criterion to decide, whether they are deſtitute of wiſdom in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, or fortitude in the field. For inveſtigation of the rights of man, for ingenuity in applying principles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered to works of mechaniſm, for inventions in uſeful arts, and for reſearches in ſeveral branches of philoſophy, few have gone before them. Even for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of genius, in ſome of the finer arts, they are thought, by the beſt judges, ſcarcely to have been excelled in the preſent age. The world has applauded their public writings, for the good ſenſe and manly diction by which they are diſtinguiſhed. Yet it is not for us, who claim no more than to be upon a level with our fellow-men, to encourage one another in entertaining too high an opinion of ourſelves. It is enough, that we do not feel a degrading conſciouſneſs of belonging to that inferior claſs of mortals, in which ſome of the Philoſophers of Europe have had the preſumption to place us. On the contrary, peculiar fields of nature and contemplation are peculiarly favorable to the expanſion of the human pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. If we poſſeſs any grandeur of ſoul, any penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thought, any combination for project; the great ſcenes of nature with which we are ſurrounded, and the great political drama in which we are required to take a part, will call them into action. When wereflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our relative ſituation, we cannot conſider ourſelves as members of a petty community, or as being acting for a fleeting moment. We are not, like many of the European States, limited to our preſent numbers. Though it ſhould be the primary object of our rulers to promote the immediate felicity of a nation, as ſingular in its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:022578_0344_0FB995D363F96960"/>
as new to political life; yet they cannot forget, that the happineſs of countleſs millions who are to draw their firſt breath in America may depend, in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, on the diſcipline, inſtitutions and examples of this generation. For certain it is, the population of our country muſt encreaſe almoſt beyond the power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. The ſtream of people, wave propelling wave, muſt, with the lapſe of years, roll back to the lake of the woods. From our geographical poſition, it is not for kings and parliaments, with their aſſumed omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to ſtop thoſe waves in their proper courſe. It is not for impolitic princes, vainly checking our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce for momentary gain, to prevent us from becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a commercial, a rich, and a powerful people. Had they really a deſign of accompliſhing this—it would be adviſable to begin with annihilating our natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, with drying up our innumerable navigable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and with ſteriliſing the uncommon fertility of our ſoil.—</p>
            <p>THE benign effects, which, in all human probability, will be produced by the faithful adminiſtration of this government, muſt not be entirely paſſed in ſilence, though they can be but imperfectly noticed. Hitherto, for want of an efficient government, the felicities that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by our ſituation, and the advantages that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from our Independence, have not equalled our hopes. The harveſt of bleſſings, ſown in fields fattened with the blood of heroes, hath mocked our expectations. But under the preſent Conſtitution, being uncommonly protected in our perſons and our acquiſitions, we ſhall have uncommonly favorable opportunities for encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:022578_0345_0FB995D5A99D6970"/>
and enjoying our natural reſources. We have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed wiſdom by experience. Though mankind are believed to be averſe to the coertions of government; yet no ſooner had our countrymen felt the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſing from the feebleneſs of our former confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than they ſeemed willing to inveſt a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs with a farther portion of their original rights, for the purpoſe of being more fully protected in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the remainder. Thus the diſpoſitions our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen have been gradually matured to receive an ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic government. Heaven be thanked that we have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee its wonders, in our native land not leſs in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tempeſt, than in ſunſhine and ferenity! Now the clouds, that obſcured our political horizon, are burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. The dawn of happineſs begins to appear. We cannot refrain from experiencing the conſolatory joys of futurity, in contemplating the immenſe deſerts, yet untrodden by the foot of man, ſoon to become fair as the garden of God, ſoon to be animated by the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of multitudes, and ſoon to be made vocal with the praiſes of the MOST HIGH. Can it be imagined that ſo many peculiar advantages, of ſoil and of climate; for agriculture, for navigation, and eventually for manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, were laviſhed in vain—or that this vaſt continent was not created and reſerved ſo long undiſcovered, as a Theatre for thoſe glorious diſplays of Divine power and goodneſs, the ſalutary conſequences of which will flow to another Hemiſphere, and extend through the intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſeries of ages! Should not our ſouls exult in the proſpect?—Though we ſhall not ſurvive to perceive, with theſe bodily ſenſes, but a ſmall portion of the bleſſed effects which our revolution will occaſion in the reſt of
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:022578_0346_0FB995D729705278"/>
the world; yet we may enjoy the progreſs of human ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and human happineſs, in anticipation.—We may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in a belief, that intellectual light will yet illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the dark corners of the earth; that freedom of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will produce liberality of conduct; that mankind will reverſe the abſurd poſition, that the <hi>many</hi> were made for the <hi>few:</hi> and that they will not continue ſlaves in one quarter of the globe, when they can become free men in another.</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch animating proſpects before us; with a ſpirit of induſtry becoming every day more prevalent; with habits of oeconomy, firſt prompted by neceſſity, now acquiring force from faſhion; with diſpoſitions that a reverence for public and private juſtice ſhould form the baſis of our national character—we only wanted a good government, well adminiſtered, to eſtabliſh our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at home and our reſpectability abroad. This is the time for fixing our national character and national man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For this purpoſe, the integrity, the talents and the examples of ſuch an aſſemblage of illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, as thoſe who are now employed in the general government were highly requiſite. Notwithſtanding the unanimous ſuffrage of our countrymen in favor of the Supreme Magiſtrate, ſuperſedes the propriety of my mentioning the circumſtances of his coming again into public life, the ſentiments entertained of his character, and the benefits expected from his adminiſtration; yet I may be allowed to ſay, that no ſelection of Sages, in this or any other country, ever merited the confidence of their fellow citizens more than the members of the preſent Congreſs. If then the body of worthy citizens
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:022578_0347_0FB995DC32614720"/>
will co-operate with the general and ſtate governments, in endeavors to promote the public felicity; if the miniſters of religion will exert themſelves in their holy functions to diſſeminate peace and good-will among men; if the executive officers of government will not bear the ſword of juſtice in vain, but be a terror to evil doers and a praiſe to ſuch as ſhall do well: we may congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate ourſelves upon having lived at ſo important a period; and ſeen the eſtabliſhment of a government, calculated to promote the permanent proſperity and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our nation.</p>
