            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM juſt returned from a very intereſting tour, and will employ the few moments I remain in this place in giving you a ſhort, and probably a very imperfect ſketch of it. In my laſt I mentioned having a letter from the <hi>Marquis de la Fayette to
<note place="bottom">March.</note>

his wife.</hi>—I had without conſideration undertaken to forward it to Mr. Morris, our miniſter at Paris; but on reflection I was ſtruck with the impropriety of encloſing him a letter from a man whoſe name alone was treaſon in France, and at a period when all letters were opened, and when the ſlighteſt and moſt innocent correſpondence with emigrants, continually brought numbers to the guillotine.— I endeavoured both at Lauſanne and at Geneva, to find ſome perſon going into France, who would promiſe to deliver it, but I eaſily preceived there was no one who would expoſe himſelf to ſuch a riſk—In this ſituation, the intereſt I felt for the character who wrote the letter, and a deſire of ſeeing France at a period ſo critical, induced me, though ſtill indiſpoſed, to reſolve on being the bearer of it myſelf. I applied to Citoyen Soulavia the French Reſident at Geneva for a paſſport. He told me the one I had from Mr. Pinckney was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any he could give me, but that in a time of revolutions the mereſt trifle might irritate the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and with my Engliſh accent and appearance, he thought it adviſable to give up entirely the idea of going to Paris. Not ſatisfied with his advice, I determined to apply to higher authority, and to wait on a <hi>repreſentant du peuple,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">A member of the Convention.</note> who had lately arrived in the department bordering on Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland. The curious accounts I had heard of of this man made me deſirous of ſeeing him; and I was fortunate enough to meet him a few days afterwards at <hi>Verſoy.</hi> A <hi>repreſentant du peuple</hi> is a ſort of <hi>viceroy</hi> choſen in the boſom of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031947_0005_0FEF5D281D3A0288"/>
and ſent into the departments by the <note n="a" place="bottom">Committee of Public ſafety.</note> 
               <hi>Comite de Salut publique,</hi> with the power to kill, burn and deſtroy, at the riſque of loſing his own head at his return. I was uſhered into a room where this animal was ſummoned by his officers: his dreſs was curious; a <hi>Bonnet Rogue</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Red cap.</note> with the mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, "Liberté Egalité &amp;c." A woolen jacket and trowſers, an enameled <note n="c" place="bottom">Liberty cap.</note>

I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with <note n="d" place="bottom">What doſt thou want, brother?</note> 
               <hi>"Que veux tu mon frere?"</hi> "To know whether I could ſafely go to <hi>Paris</hi> under the protection of a paſſport from the American miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in London" <note n="e" place="bottom">That's none of my buſineſs, get thee to the committee of ſeperintendance.</note> 
               <hi>"Ce n'neſt pas mon Affair Va au Comité de Surveillance."</hi> The preſident of this comité proved to be an uncle to the profeſſor <hi>Pictel</hi> of Geneva.—He was pleaſed to find that I was acquainted with his relation, ſhewed me much politeneſs, ſigned my paſſport; and when I aſked him what the <hi>repreſentant</hi> had done ſince his arrival, he wiſpered me in the ear, <note n="f" place="bottom">He has changed every thing; the rich are impriſoned, all who were in office are diſmiſſed; ah, my friend, the end of of the world is at hand.</note>

Ceux qui etaient en place ne le ſont plus, mon ami, c'eſt la fin du monde qui va ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river."</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Citoyen Gouly</hi> ſent to inform him that he would anſwer with his head for what he was about, that many agents of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pitt had been detected in France with Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can paſſports—Inſtead of <hi>"Monami"</hi> from my friend

the preſident, it was now, <note n="a" place="bottom">Ah, wretch, thou ſhalt be put in the rat trap.</note> 
               <hi>"Ah Scélérat on te metira dans la ratti ére."</hi> and I was on the point of being hurried to <hi>priſon.</hi> I inſiſted on ſeeing the <hi>repreſentant,</hi> gained admittance, and ſo perfectly ſatisfied him reſpecting my being an American, that he inſiſted on my dining with him.—He put his ſeal of office to my paſſport, and told me I might now go to Paris without fear.—The ſcene that ſucceeded was curious, ſervant and maſter, officer and ſoldier, all ſat down to table together, with their hats on. <hi>Gouly</hi> gave us an account of the deſcent that was ſoon to take place in England, and that in two months time, <hi>he</hi> it was that would be ſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Carthage,</hi> and to cut off the heads of <hi>George and of Pitt.</hi> He declared that we had treated the <hi>Citoyen Genet</hi> very ill, that he he had been joined by the <hi>true patriots,</hi> but that <hi>Hamilton</hi> and his ſet were ſold to Pitt.—I obſerved that though traitors were very eaſily to be found in ſome countries of Europe, I flattered myſelf that America had not yet got to that degree of corruption, and that the repreſentative of a nation ſhould never adopt any party.—He then gave us a diſſertation on the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of <hi>Liberté, Egalité, and Fraternité,</hi> ſwore that the people in the departments into which he was ſent were all ariſtocrats or egotiſts—that they had no <hi>eſprit Revolutionaire,</hi> but before he left them, with the aſiſtance of the <hi>guillotine,</hi> they ſhould be <note n="b" place="bottom">Well ſcrewed up to the height of exiſting circumſtances.</note> 
               <hi>"bien montés à l' hauteur des circon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances."</hi> I got up to take my leave, and was not a little ſurpriſed at his throwing his arms around my neck, and giving me the <hi>Baiſer fraternel:</hi> this was an unfortunate compliment for me—it
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031947_0007_0FEF5CED87C43478"/>
gave me ſo much conſequence in the eyes of the people, that before I got out of Verloy I was kiſſed by the Mayor and all the municipality.— The day after, I ſet out on my journey to Paris, and notwithſtanding the ridiculous ſcene I had been witneſs to, I flattered myſelf that I ſhould return with many arguments to ſupport my favourite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, "that after all their follies, and the horrors they had committed, the French would end by rendering themſelves not only feared but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected."</p>
            <p>I left Nyon on the 10th of Jan. but my chaiſe breaking down on the top of the Yurd, I was expoſed for near two days to the moſt inclement weather at a ſmall village called "<hi>les Roupes,</hi> the firſt French port, in <hi>Franche compt.</hi>" I found a great degree of tranquility: they were happy in having the Swiſs for their neighbours, and in the protection of their mountains.—At Dijon, Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere, Sens, &amp;c. the <hi>Eſprit revolutionaire</hi> was in full force.—Croſſes were broken, chapels burnt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny churches entirely deſtroyed, and thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained had ſome part or other torn down; the celebrated convent of the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> near Dijon, a heap of ruins;—all the bells collected together to be turned into cannon; every houſe with the tri-coloured banner at the window, and the mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>"Lib. Ega. &amp;c. &amp;c."</hi> on the door, chaiſes, waggons, carts, all with their little flags;—the <hi>cap of liberté</hi> ſculptured on the mile-ſtones, and the national colours painted even on the trees that line the Great road to Paris.—I had frequently been conducted by the guard to the <hi>comité de Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veillance,</hi> but had never met with any detention. —On my arrival, however, at Ponthieny about
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031947_0008_0FEF5CE1903A76F8"/>
30 miles from Paris, my fears began to increaſe, and I was agreeably ſurpriſed to hear that Saint Port, the country reſidence of Mr. Morris, was juſt oppoſite on the other ſide of the Seine.—I was happy in getting under the protection of his roof, and determined to wait for his advice before I proceeded. The next day I received a polite note from him, informing me that I ſhould meet with no difficulties; and on the 20th I entered Paris for the firſt time. Inſtead of the noiſe and buſtle I expected, there was a dead calm, the road appeared deſerted, and not a carriage was to be ſeen in the ſtreets.—I waited on Mr. Morris, and heard with regret that <hi>Madame de la Fayette</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined near her country ſeat in the South of France, with circumſtances even of <hi>cruelty and indecency.</hi> —He had made a private application in her favour to the miniſter for foreign affairs, and was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, "That ſhe was fortunate in being ſo far from Paris, and that the greateſt ſervice her friends could render her, would be never to mention her name.</p>
            <p>He ſmiled at my obſervations reſpecting the French revolution, and ſaid he would leave me to form my opinion from experience.</p>
            <p>I began by attending regularly the <hi>debates</hi> of the <hi>Convention</hi>—I entered the <hi>Tribune</hi> for the firſt time, with <hi>that reſpect one naturally feels at the idea of ſeeing the rulers of a great nation.</hi>—I found the Preſident ringing his bell with all his might— half a dozen members ſpeaking at the ſame time, and when they could not be heard from the chair, they attacked each other. It proved to be a quarrel reſpecting a member who had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031947_0009_0FEF5D08D597ADF0"/>
The figures of the Roman worthies ornamented the walls, the buſts of <hi>Brutus,</hi> Le <hi>Pelletier,</hi> and <hi>Marat,</hi> ſurrounded the Preſident's chair, oppoſite was a large thing like a <hi>trunk</hi>— It was the <hi>Ark of the Covenant,</hi> covered with tri-coloured ribbons. I had an opportunity ſome days afterwards of ſeeing on the <hi>place of the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> a great <hi>ſtone figure of Liberty</hi> and an <hi>immenſe trough,</hi> out of which the deputies drank large draughts of water to the <hi>Goddeſs</hi> on the adoption of their laſt conſtitution. There was a poor fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low who narrowly eſcaped being guillotined for obſerving, that no doubt many wiſhed it was wine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>National Convention</hi> I ſoon perceived to be <hi>a farce;</hi> of the 749 members of whom it was firſt compoſed—155 had either given in their diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were guillotined, confined, aſſaſſinated, or taken priſoners: 228 from the 17 different comités for the tranſaction of buſineſs; a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are ſent into the departments, and thoſe who ſet in the convention appear to meet merely for the purpoſe of giving an <hi>apparent ſanction</hi> to the meaſures of the <hi>comité de ſalut publique.</hi> The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident is continually engaged in receiving addreſſes, patriotic donations, and in giving the honours of the ſitting and the <hi>Baiſer fraternel.</hi> I was witneſs to a laughable ſcene of this kind;—a deputation from <hi>St. Domingo</hi> entered the hall, it conſiſted of a <hi>white</hi> man, a <hi>mulatto</hi> and a <hi>negro. La Croix</hi> mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the circumſtance ſhould be diſtinguiſhed by the <note n="*" place="bottom">Embrace.</note> 
               <hi>accolade</hi> of the Preſident. The <hi>white</hi> man firſt flew into his arms, and was embraced moſt tenderly—the <hi>mulatto</hi> was hugg'd with ſtill <hi>more affection</hi>—but when he came to the <hi>negro,</hi> had it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031947_0010_0FEF5D4FCF966310"/>
been a <hi>miſtreſs,</hi> he could not have preſſed her more ardently—<hi>there was no end to the kiſſes that were given and received amidſt the repeated applauſe of the Convention and the Tribunes</hi>—The next day, they voted the <hi>emancipation of the ſlaves,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they would form with <hi>all negroes and mulattos</hi> a <q>TRICOLOR'D COALITION which would ſoon deſtroy the combined powers of ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and tyranny</q>—An <hi>old negro wench,</hi> who was in one of the tribunes, thought this ſo fine, that <hi>ſhe fainted away,</hi> ſhe was immediately brought into the boſom of the Convention,—the members crowded round her, and again <hi>fell a kiſſing, not only the negro's, but each other.</hi>—I next attended the <hi>Jacobin club;</hi> they met about 7 o'clock, but the tribunes were filled before 6, with the vileſt collection of people I think I ever ſaw, moſtly women and children. The fitting opened by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>procès verbal</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Journals.</note> of the preceding evening, by which it appeared that a deputation of Blacks had been received moſt fraternally, and that it had unanimouſly decreed, that a flag ſhould be hung over the chair of the Preſident, on which ſhould be a negro, a mulatto, and a French man holding up together the banner tri-coloured. Some bad verſes were afterwards read in favour of the <hi>mountain,</hi> made by a woman, who attended the debates, and to this ſucceeded the epuration <note n="‡" place="bottom">Purification.</note> of the members. The queſtions aſked on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion are where were you on the 10th of Auguſt? How did you vote in the caſe of Marat? Were you ever a banker or an agent de change? <note n="*" place="bottom">Broker.</note> Among others that were to be examined, was
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031947_0011_0FEF34F82CCAEB40"/>
one Chambertoy; as ſoon as he began his anſwer, a black-guard looking fellow who was ſitting next me got up, bawled out for the "parole"<note n="n" place="bottom">The right to ſpeak.</note>—He ſwore that Chambertoy was a raſcal and an ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrat; another declared him to be as much of a patriot as the king of Pruſſia; Chambertoy ſaid a few words, when a woman got up behind him, and gave him the lie in plain terms. The moſt violent noiſe and uproar ſucceeded, and I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that Chambertoy would be turned out; at length, a child about thirteen or fourteen years old, a member of the club, mounted the tribune, made a long ſpeech, obſerved that no perſon ſhould be condemned, without being heard, and gained Chambertoy an opportunity of making his defence; he proved that he was one of the party who propoſed the events of the 10th Auguſt (for they now conſider as the greateſt merit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, what they attributed to their king as the greateſt crime.) He ſhewed a wound he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the Thuilleries, and was re-admitted with unbounded applauſe.—I was indebted, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to my being taken for an Engliſhman, for the pleaſure of ſeeing Robeſpierre—they were ſatisfied, on my ſhewing a certificate from Mr. Morris, ſigned by the miniſter for foreign affairs, and made way for a "brave American"—I had thus an apportunity of approaching very near Robeſpierre at the Jacobin club. He is a little man, very pale and thin, decently dreſſed, in general, a light coloured great coat, and powder in his hair, much the appearance of a petty-fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attorney: He was liſtened to with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and brings out his words with an almoſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031947_0012_0FEF5CF14E96F858"/>
affected ſlowneſs, while every other perſon ſpeaks with violent paſſion.—They diſtributed in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,<note n="o" place="bottom">The galleries.</note> a moſt ridiculous eſſay on the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; when one Brichet got up and moved, that the club, before it debated the great queſtion of a deſcent into England, and the vices of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government, ſhould occupy itſelf in deſtroying the "toads that had crawled up the mountain," and that at leaſt thirty members of the Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be guillotined. Robeſpierre obſerved, that he was an <hi>Intrigant</hi> and an <hi>ultra revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aire.</hi>
               <note n="p" place="bottom">One who ever exceeds revolutionary limits.</note> and moved that he ſhould be turned out, which was immediately decreed; a friend of Brichet got up to take his part; Robeſpierre moved that he ſhould ſhare the ſame fate, and they turned him out alſo.</p>
            <p>Frequently on leaving the convention, I paſt through the <hi>garden of the Thuilleries</hi> to the <hi>place de la revolution,</hi> in order to get there after the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions</hi> had taken place, and was once or twice ſo unfortunate as to be a witneſs of them. It is out of my power, my dear friend, to give you a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent idea of this ſcene. Near the door of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention you ſee two men with great fur caps and long beards, reading to the people the <hi>crimes of the kings of France</hi> and abuſing them all from <hi>Charlemagne to Louis XVI.</hi> A little further is a woman ſinging patriotic ſongs and giving leſſons of morality; on the other ſide, is a man <hi>preaching againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Every where you are peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>journals</hi> and the productions of <hi>Pere Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheine and Camaille des Moulines.</hi> At the entrance
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031947_0013_0FEF5CF3C1425788"/>
of the gardens, are two reſtauratives<note n="q" place="bottom">Eating-houſes, or ordinaries.</note> filled with people, <hi>eating drinking and laughing—oppoſite is the guillotine,</hi> and at ten yards from it is a <hi>puppet ſhow,</hi> where <hi>punch</hi> is guillotined! Here you ſee figures dancing on wires, <hi>there</hi> an exhibition of pictures, and a <hi>calf born with a national cockade on its fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>—a crowd of women, and a collection of dogs immediately under the <hi>guillotine; children peeping into the hampers</hi> that hold the bodies, and men ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of thoſe who have juſt ſuffered, and crying out "<hi>Venez domain n'y manquez pas, vous en aurez pluſieurs, vous aurez des femmes</hi>
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Come again to-morrow, dont fail, you'll have ſeveral more, you'll have ſome women guillotined.</note>. It is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſay which are moſt mad, the ſpectators or their ſufferers. I have heard people in the ſtreets obſerve to each other, <hi>"ou allons nous, voulez vous aller au caffe ou a la guillotine?"</hi>
               <note n="s" place="bottom">Where ſhall we go? will you go to the Coffee-houſe or to the guillotine?</note> I have ſeen wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men go to be executed, as if to an entertainment, chattering and paying compliments to each other, even at the ſcaffold; ſome laughing, cry, <q>vive la republique,</q> the people call for the head, to ſee whether it ſtill ſmiles. But what adds the greateſt horror to the ſcene, is the gaiety, that reigns on every countenance!</p>
            <p>I attended many of the trials at the tribunal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; you there find the forms of juſtice, but none of the reality. It conſiſts of two courts, the <hi>ſalle de la liberté</hi> and the <hi>ſalle de l'egalité;</hi> each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of three judges, beſides the preſident and an accuſateur publique—all dreſſed in black gowns, and black feathers in their hats; round their necks a national ribbon, to which hangs a gold medal.—
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031947_0014_0FEF5D1A87334300"/>
The jury conſiſts of ten perſons, the clerk reads the accuſation. The witneſſes are examined, the accuſed is aſked if he has any thing to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the accuſateur publique ſpeaks, and is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the defender choſen by the priſoner. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident declares the debate to be finiſhed. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed is carried out, the jury give in his verdict, and the accuſed is brought back to hear his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; if he is condemned, he wiſhes the company a good morning, and goes away to be executed within 24 hours. If he is acquitted he embraces the whole court; ſome of the ſpectators are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when this happens to be the caſe, but I have heard others ſay, "je n'aime pas les voir echap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per à la guillotine;"<note n="t" place="bottom">I don't like to ſee them eſcape the guillotine.</note> not only the judges, and the accuſateurs publiques, but the jury alſo, are nominated by the convention, that is, by <hi>comité de ſalat publique,</hi> and you may eaſily conceive the ſpirit which they receive; accuſer, judge and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, all appear anxious to find the priſoner guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and if he is noble or has property he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſure of being condemned.</p>
            <p>Paris is perfectly quiet! One part is a deſert, the other is plunged into the profoundeſt apathy; and no where is there ſo little appearance of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the affairs of France as in its own capital. There are from ſixteen to twenty <hi>ſpectacles</hi> (thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres) every evening, and once each Decade all the theatres are opened gratis, to the populace, when ſome patriotic piece is given. The guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine was generally the beſt attended; but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the piece ſufficiently amuſing and wind up the eſprit revolutionaire, they are obliged at times to execute women, or ſome remarkable character.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031947_0015_0FEF5D45303F70C0"/>
There are a ſet of people paid to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the Jacobin club, the Tribunal revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaire, and the guillotine, to keep up an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of popularity.</p>
            <p>There is no truth of which I am ſo perfectly convinced, as that the great majority of the people in France are already againſt the revolution, and would be happy to change for any government whatever, the <hi>horrid tyranny</hi> under which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. One of the members of the <hi>comite de ſalut publique</hi> has been heard to ſay, "We know that nine out of ten are againſt us; but the tenth man ſhall make the other nine march." A preſident of a jacobin club not far from Paris, has whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me <note n="†" place="bottom">A weak king is a ſcourge</note> "Un roi foible eſt un fleau;" and I have never had an opportunity of converſing with any perſon above the loweſt claſs, who did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrate the tyrants of the day. In the mean time, the military diſpoſition of the French, the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is paid to the army, the unlimited pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>comite de ſalut publique,</hi> and the immenſe riches on which they have ſiezed, will give the ruling faction the means of making the ſtrongeſt reſiſtance, and it is poſſible they may involve in their own deſtruction the ruin of all France. There was a time when, beſides the Vendee, Bourdeaux, Toulon, Marſeilles, Lyons, Straſburg, were all for a counter revolution, and had the combined pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, inſtead of the deteſtable policy of diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing France, been ſeriouſly occupied with the idea of putting Louis XVII. on the throne, it might have been effected. The Vendee was left to be deſtroyed by numbers after giving repeated proofs of the moſt aſtoniſhing bravery. Bourdeaux was
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031947_0016_0FEF5D1F30DF8150"/>
on the point of declaring, but the mayor, who was a man of property, heſitated, Lyons became a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Bourdeaux eſcaped, but the mayor was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotined; Marſeilles ſtill ſuffers under the wrath of the convention; Lyons, though obliged to adopt the language of the day, fought for royalty, ſhe expected aſſiſtance, but was cruelly diſappointed; Straſburg offered itſelf to general Wurmſer, if he would accept it for Louis XVII. His orders were to take it for his maſter: in the mean time the repreſentatives of the people entered the city and guillotined all who were ſuſpected. The oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity has been neglected and humanity ſhudders at the approach of the next campaign. For two years paſt it has been expected, and even wiſhed by ſome, that the want of proviſions would put an end to the exertions of France. Thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained ſuch hopes did not reflect that the army would be the laſt to ſuffer and the innocent the firſt victims. The papers mention but 5450 perſons, but I know from good authority that there are at leaſt 15,000 confined at Paris, and thoſe who are arreſted in the departments may amount to about 250,000. Would not theſe as the "Bouches inutiles"<note n="†" place="bottom">Uſeleſs mouths.</note> be the firſt ſacrificed? In ſome places already, the ſoldiers receive good bread while the people are obliged to eat that which is made of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes and bran. The proſpects of a famine in France were probably never more ſerious than at the preſent moment, and the French may ſuffer greatly before their harveſt; but they will not ſtarve. In many cantons the bread is good and cheaper than in Switzerland: in Paris it is bad, but is ſold at the maximum; in ſome few places the wheat was expended: the occaſion of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031947_0017_0FEF5D29A2BA0B90"/>
is that all grain remains in requiſition in each canton—wheat is in general ſcarce. I have ſeen ſome of the people laugh at their own wants, and cry <note n="‡" place="bottom">There is no miſery in France.</note> 
               <hi>"il n'y a point de miſère en France,"</hi> and when I have aſked the poſtillion which was the beſt inn, at the place I was going to, he anſwered in the greateſt levity, <note n="‖" place="bottom">"There are two, but there's no bread. "What do people do in that caſe?" "They warm themſelves."</note> "<hi>Il y en a deux mais on n'a pas de pain, et que fait on alors? On s'echauffe!</hi> There is one circumſtance which after much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I found to be certain, that in the department through which I paſt, there was as much corn planted as at any former period.</p>
            <p>I went to Paris by the northern road, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by <hi>Nevers, Moulins and Lyons;</hi> at the firſt of theſe places many of the populace were intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated, and I could hardly get any perſon to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine my paſſport; they had juſt taken up about 70 <hi>prieſts;</hi> theſe unfortunate men had <hi>conformed</hi> to all the decrees of the Convention; ſome of them had married—<hi>many were old and ſome invalids;</hi> they were crowded with great inhumanity on board a batteau to be ſent to Breſt. I aſked one of them who attended, what was to be done with them? I believe, ſaid he, <hi>they are going to drown them—this they call the New Baptiſm of Prieſts. Moulins</hi> was formerly famous for its manufactories in cutlery; its commerce was deſtroyed as well as that of every other city in France. <hi>But imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot conceive the miſerable ſituation of Lyons; all that was beautiful in building, rich in commerce, or reſpectable in inhabitants, is totally deſtroyed: the place de Belle Cour,</hi> formerly one of the <hi>moſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031947_0018_0FEF5D2D36DF2268"/>
beautiful in the world,</hi> does not exiſt. The noble range of buildings near the Rhone, a heap of ruins, and the duſt that ariſes from the hordes they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to demoliſh, renders the air almoſt ſuffocating. <hi>They had juſt torn to pieces</hi> 60 <hi>perſons with grape-ſhot;</hi> the bodies were afterwards ſhifted by <hi>women and children,</hi> with the utmoſt degree of <hi>indecency.</hi> The <hi>Guillotine</hi> had been <hi>illuminated</hi> on the anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of the king's execution. It had cut off 28 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the day before my arrival, and was again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Adjoining to it is the grand <hi>Autel de la pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Altar of the country.</note> where there are fetes every decade. I went into the <hi>Hotel de Ville</hi> to get my paſſport ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined; I was ſurrounded by officers—here a crowd were waiting to be <hi>married,</hi> there they were waiting to be <hi>divorced.</hi> I ſaw a burial; the corpſe was on a bier half uncovered, with the <hi>bonnet rogue</hi> on the head; all thoſe who attended had their heads ornamented in the ſame manner, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the body ſinging the carmagnole. The executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at Lyons, had already amounted to above 3000 perſons, and to thoſe who ſpoke of mercy, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentans</hi> had anſwered, "that there were 10,000 more to ſuffer." There are two tribunals conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually employed in condemning. The "commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion militaire and the tribunal populaire." and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, have been carried to the guillotine, to be witneſſes of the execution of their huſbands, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for having ſolicited their pardon. I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain at Lyons near two days from the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of getting horſes, and was happy to get out of it and relieve my eyes from ſuch a ſcene of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and madneſs. The great inſtigator of all the cruelites that are committed in this unfortunate
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031947_0019_0FEF5D574BEFFC08"/>
city is Collot d'Herbois; this man was not long ago an inferior comedian, and has often acted at the theatres of Lyons and Geneva; he was the preſident of the comite that formed the laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; at preſent heads that party which is called by ſome <hi>Ultra Revolutionaire,</hi> and as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here always join thoſe who go to the greateſt exceſſes, it is probable that Collot d'Herbois, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, the author of the Pere Duchene, and their ſet, may treat Robeſpierre and the Marates as they did the Briſſotines. When any man gets to the top of power, he naturally feels himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the welfare of the country, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly adopts moderation as one of the means of increaſing his popularity. Robeſpierre wiſhed to have a motion paſt for liberating all thoſe who had been arreſted without any grounds of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; the number of whom you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be very great, when for ſome time every perſon who denounced another received 100 livres. Such however was the clamour, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to abandon the idea. He next, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing himſelf, ſet Camille des Deſmoulins to write againſt the violent party: he begins by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf a votary of the <hi>divine Marat.</hi> He was however expelled from the Jacobin Club for having mentioned <hi>comité de clemence:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could be re-admitted, was obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his error. It is the violent party, who, to amuſe the people, have ſtarted the idea of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into England. Robeſpierre declares, that the Engliſh only merit their contempt; that if they are deſirous of having their liberty, they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of gaining it for themſelves, and if they are not, a deſcent into England would only be throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves into the ſnares of Pitt.</p>

               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031947_0020_0FEF5CE316A001E8"/>The Jacobin Club is the ſource of power, and thoſe who lead it govern France. It keeps up an intimate correſpondence with all the inferior clubs in the different departments, and takes care that they ſhall be formed of none but the vileſt and moſt ignorant of the inhabitants, entirely devoted to itſelf. It is the ſeat of information, gives what impreſſion it pleaſes, and a defeat in the north is repreſented in the ſouth as a victory. It has cauſed all the miſeries of France, and compoſed as it is at preſent, no good can ever be expected from it: God knows what will be the end, and we are at a loſs what to hope. The French ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear incapable of being free; the government of an uſurper only leads to new convulſions; the people when fatigued with the preſent mode of government may change it for ſomething new. Liberty is at preſent the faſhion in France; you meet it at all the corners of the ſtreets; it is ſtuck up in large characters on every houſe; it ſpouts at the theatre; it ſtruts at the opera; it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a by-word—I never heard ſo much, and never ſaw ſo little of it. The "Ancien Regime" has totally diſappeared, and decade is as much in vogue as if Sunday had never exiſted. But will not a people who have, with ſo much levity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned their religion, forget in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their liberty? Such appears to be the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the French, a ſoil where every thing flouriſhes for a time but nothing takes root; if well or ill directed, a character capable of the greateſt extremes of virtue or of vice.</p>
            <p>I entered France one of the warmeſt advocates of the revolution; I firmly believed that the great body of the people had juſt ideas of liberty, were
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031947_0021_0FEF5CF64B826D28"/>
acquainted with their rights, and after defeating the attempts of their enemies, would then eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an equal and well regulated government. I left it with ſentiments of indignation, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and diſguſt, convinced that there never was a people in the world ſo little calculated to enjoy the bleſſings of freedom.</p>
            <p>During my ſtay at Paris, I found nothing ſo intereſting as the converſation of Mr.  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               </gap>  He had been ſo obliging before my arrival, as to take lodgings for me near his own hotel; and I had the pleaſure of ſeeing him every day. He was formerly exceedingly well received at court, and poſſeſſed in a great degree the confidence of its miniſters, and has ſince been able to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though not liked, yet reſpected by all the parties that have ſucceeded: though a man of great abilities, he muſt have found it difficult to have ſteered ſo far with ſafety, through the ſtorm: and America is indebted to him for remaining in a ſituation, which, though none can fill it with more capacity, cannot but be particularly irkſome to him. All thoſe for whom he could have felt any conſideration, have either emigrated, been arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or guillotined, and from being in the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſociety, he is left with hardly an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in France: the conduct he has purſued was the only one of avoiding all parties and maintaining in every reſpect the dignity of his ſituation. He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deteſted the Briſſotines, whoſe <hi>policy it was to draw America into the war,</hi> and had they not been guillotined, Genet might have done us conſiderable miſchief.

            <p>A party of Americans have petitioned the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in favor of Tom Paine; they were invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the honours of the ſitting, but could not be much flattered when a few days after a ſet of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes were received with far greater attention. As the French have no farther occaſion for Common Senſe, or the Rights of Man, Tom Paine ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in priſon, where he abuſes Mr. Morris for not claiming him as an American, and amuſes himſelf, I'm told, with writing a book againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to meet with beauty at Paris, all the pretty women are in requiſition; they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and employed in making ſhirts for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. I endeavoured to conſole myſelf at the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery of Paintings, which is without exception the fineſt in the world—a collection of all the moſt valuable paintings that exiſted in France. Many Americans have been arreſted on their firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Republic, and you are ſearched half a dozen times before you are permitted to leave it. I returned by Geneva and found the violent party worthy imitators of their neighbours—they had found that their laſt project of a conſtitution was impracticable, and accepted a new one, which the day after was violated. As there was a <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> in France, they were determined to have one alſo. It conſiſted of one houſe and of one man, a Mr. Miquily; his houſe was ſurrounded, his
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031947_0023_0FEF5D0A5D0D6C78"/>
furniture deſtroyed, and himſelf thrown into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Comité proviſoire accompanied the <hi>Marſellois</hi> who went on this expedition in order to prevent miſchief, but ſuch was their impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that a poor man was torn to pieces, before their faces for refuſing to put on the Bonnet Rouge. On entering Switzerland I felt as if I had at length eſcaped from a mad houſe and again got into the ſociety of reaſonable beings.</p>
            <p>I have without thinking, permitted my letter to run on to an immoderate length; you will I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, excuſe not only the length of it, but alſo the hurry in which I have written it.</p>
            <p>The active life I led at Paris, and the excellent table of Mr. —, have been of ſervice to my health, and ſince I have found that exerciſe is a remedy, I ſhall not remain idle; I leave this place immediately for Milan, where my carriage hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have been arrived near two months. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to paſs the Holy week at Rome. The heat will ſoon oblige me to leave Italy, when I propoſe going to Vienna, to which place I have excellent letters.</p>
            <p>I am anxious to hear from you, pray write to me frequently. There is no expreſſing the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt I feel in whatever paſſes in America.</p>

            <head>MR. NOAH WEBSTER's ATTACK ON PORCUPINE.</head>
            <opener>
               <dateline>FROM THE MINERVA, <hi>Of New-York,</hi>
                  <date>
                     <hi>March</hi> 21, 1797.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>IN a late paper, we inſerted ſentiments of this kind, that the putting up in the Coffee Houſe, a card, on which was painted the Engliſh flag, was a low pitiful buſineſs, equalled only by the meanneſs of putting up a French flag, and that it is ſervile to be bandied about between the flags of different foreign nations. We ought to unite under our <hi>own flag</hi> and learn to be a nation.</p>
            <p>Peter Porcupine has copied the paragraph with diſapprobation, and ſays it contains more of <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar prejudice,</hi> and miſtake, than of juſtice or good policy. He obſerves that it is the <q>quo animo,</q> the intention of the act that ſtamps its character. He would have no foreign flag hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a rallying point for malcontents againſt their own government; but to unite the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Eagle with the Britiſh Lion againſt an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious enemy, he thinks, would be an act that we need not be aſhamed of. He then ſpeaks of an alliance of that kind, as honourable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to both parties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:031947_0025_0FEF5D3F4DEED948"/>No comment will be made on the inſinuation of "Vulgar Prejudice," againſt the Editor of the Minerva. When Peter becomes acquainted with the editor's real character, he will learn, that in a combat of that kind, he himſelf muſt certainly be the loſer.</p>
            <p>But we conteſt Peter's principles. It was ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpected many months ago, that his principles are not very friendly to the independence of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and ſtill leſs ſo, to the form of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This ſuſpicion has been greatly increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the manner in which his gazette has been conducted. His retailing abuſe againſt la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette, whoſe ſufferings (even ſuppoſe him to have been in fault, which is doubtful or not admitted) are far too ſevere, and call for the ſympathy of all mankind, denotes a man callous to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his ſpecies, and extremely diſreſpectful to the opinions of the Americans, who entertain friendſhip and gratitude for la Fayette. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo whole columns of ſome of the firſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Peter's gazette, filled with <q>apologies for the old government of France,</q> that is, for the feudal ſyſtem, though in a relaxed ſtate, and for as corrupt a ſyſtem of deſpotiſm as Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope ever witneſſed.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of Peter's pen, in attacking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic factions of our country, has perfectly intoxicated him; and he miſtakes the <hi>ſenſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> extremely, when he ſuppoſes the danger we have eſcaped of being proſtrated at the feet of France, will urge us to lay our country at the feet of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:031947_0026_0FEF5D0BE4606890"/>No, Peter; your abuſing the men who fought for our Independence, and your recommending the old Government of France, are not the means by which your popularity is to be maintained. The old government of France was not ſo bad, as the Jacobin government, it is true; but there is a government different from both, which la Fayette ſought, and which the people of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will rejoice to ſee introduced, that is, a <hi>Free Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to an alliance with Great-Britain, we want none except what is dictated by commercial views. Here our intereſt, calls for mutual aid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. So far as Great Britain will protect our trade, for her own ſake, we ſhall gladly receive it, and no farther.</p>
            <p>We aſk <hi>no favours</hi> of Great-Britain, nor of any other nation; for this would lay the foundation for more <hi>claims of gratitude,</hi> with which we have been outrageouſly tormented by the French, and their hirelings. The United States and Great Britain are <hi>allied by intereſt.</hi> Setting aſide ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of language, habits and private connections, no two countries are ſo cloſely united by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial advantages. Nor can this union of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, for a long time to come, have a competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. It is as much for Great-Britain's intereſt (not to ſay more) to protect our veſſels, as it is ours to have them protected. So far an alliance will ariſe out of neceſſity and convenience, which will require very little modification by expreſs agreements. As to any thing like a general trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, offenſive and defenſive, God forbid. Sooner may the United States be doomed to encounter
<note place="bottom">March.</note>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:031947_0027_0FEF5D0E59D0BBF0"/>
another eight years war for Independence, than hold the bleſſing at the mercy of any foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>No, Peter; the man who writes this, once vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily bore arms to defend Independence, in purſuance of the ſame principles, he <hi>firſt</hi> propoſed publicly the plan of a National Conſtitution, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in the ſame principles, he aſſailed the monſter, FACTION, the moment it appeared, in the inſidious form of popular clubs: and from that moment to this, he has never ceaſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the artifices of the French agents to lay this country at the feet of France. With the ſame determined zeal and firmneſs, Peter, he now openly declares war againſt the man who dares to vilify the defenders of American Independence, or to propoſe an alliance that would commit that independence to the power of a foreign ſtate, or to the fate of European conteſts.</p>
            <p>Americans deſire peace, and rejoice that the flags of all nations ſtream in their harbours. But the man who unites a foreign flag with that of his own country, on the territory of the United States, without an order of government, is a <hi>factious man,</hi> and has not the honour of his country at heart. This little emblem of national honour ought no more to be the ſignal for mobs and for violence in a neutral country.</p>
            <p>Such, Peter, is my political creed—I know no party, but that of MY COUNTRY. My country is INDEPENDENT; it is for our intereſt, the intereſt of Great Britain, and of all Europe, that it ſhould be ſo; and the man who ſeeks to tack it on any foreign country, to involve it in European broils,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031947_0028_0FEF5D55C591CFD0"/>
or make its independence the ſport of European policy, is conceived to be an ENEMY. As ſuch, his intrigues will be expoſed and his influence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, by all thoſe decent and legal means, that diſtinguiſh the gentleman and the good citizen.</p>
            <p>P. S. If Peter Porcupine's views are miſtaken, it belongs to him to remove the impreſſions which his writings made on the genuine friends of this country.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>SOME days ago I promiſed you an anſwer to your Addreſs (or whatever elſe you may pleaſe to call it) of the 21ſt of March. It luckily matters little how this anſwer begins. Aware I ſuppoſe of the uncouth manners of the man you were about to aſſail, you kindly contrived that the rudeneſs of your attack ſhould furniſh an ample apology for his want of politeneſs.</p>
               <p>Your Addreſs treats of your important ſelf, of me, and of the propoſed alliance between the United States and Great Britain. This alliance is a ſubject of two much conſequence to be blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an enquiry into your and my character, principles, and conduct, I ſhall therefore reſerve it for a ſeparate letter; not loſing, however, the preſent opportunity of declaring, that your reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031947_0031_0FEF5CCFCE8CCAE0"/>
inſtead of convincing me that I was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, has ſtrengthened, as far as any thing in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf contradictory can ſtrengthen, the opinion which gave ſo much offence to your wiſdom.</p>
               <p>You ſet out with telling the public, that, <q>in a late paper, we inſerted ſentiments of this kind, that the putting up in the Coffee Houſe, a card, on which was painted the Engliſh flag, was a <hi>low pitiful buſineſs,</hi> equalled only by the <hi>meanneſs of putting up a French flag,</hi> and that it is ſervile to be bandied about between the flags of different foreign nations. We ought to unite under our <hi>own flag</hi> and learn to be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You then complain of my having quoted the paſſage <hi>"with diſapprobation,"</hi> which with the application of the words <hi>vulgar prejudice,</hi> was, it ſeems, a ſtretch of preſumption which your pride could not forgive.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that, to venture to quote "with diſapprobation" the oracular precepts flowing from the lips of the high prieſt of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, was rather bold; but (and with due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be it ſpoken) it was not ſo much your advice as your <hi>partiality,</hi> your <hi>verſatility,</hi> that I diſapproved of. You have uttered ſuch cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of ſentiments, that it is abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you ſhould recollect one half of them; and as, in politics particularly, you are led by no fixed, no polar-ſtar principle, it is as impoſſible that you ſhould ever be conſiſtent long together. Your ſaying that the putting up of an Engliſh flag "was a <hi>low pitiful</hi> buſineſs," ſounds well; but did you ſay this when the <hi>French flag</hi> was
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031947_0032_0FEF5CF95A85D738"/>
put up? No; you called that neither <hi>low</hi> nor <hi>pitiful:</hi> it was even honoured with your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, as far as a man, who looks upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as the excluſive poſſeſſor of all that is praiſe-worthy, can applaud the actions of others. The hoiſting of the French flag was attended with feaſting and noiſe, little inferior to what <hi>we</hi> have witneſſed at the celebration of the murder of the Swiſs Guards: yet it eſcaped your cenſure: it was ſuffered to hang very peaceably, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the adoration of the devout ſans-culottes of New-York: folly was permitted to revel at the foot, as it were, of the ſhrine of wiſdom, for the ſpace of three whole years, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving either chaſtiſement or rebuke. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the difference! The moment a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Britiſh flag appears, though painted on a bit of paper only, and intended merely to produce a little ſport, you caſt off your lethargic forbearance. Your patriotiſm, that patriotiſm, which ſlept like a dormouſe, while the French flag was not only hanging up in the Coffee-Room, but was borne about your ſtreets to elections and town-meetings; that drowſy patriotiſm, which ſeemed ſcarcely to perceive a banner of two yards ſquare, though it bruſhed its very noſe, became all alive, took fire in a moment, upon ſight of a Britiſh flag in miniature.</p>
               <p>You do, indeed, now talk about the <q>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of putting up a French flag;</q> but when do you find courage to do this? At the moment the people around you are got tired and aſhamed of their bauble. Far were you from calling it a <hi>meanneſs,</hi> and ſo far from it that your voice was one of the moſt ſonorous in the ridiculous and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031947_0033_0FEF5CD32D455B00"/>
diſgraceful hue-and-cry, raiſed againſt thoſe who pulled it down, in the month of May, 1795.— On that occaſion you very patrioticly obſerved, that <q>
                     <hi>it was hoped</hi> that the flags of the ſiſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics would have <hi>remained undiſturbed</hi> by the <hi>enemies of our peace;</hi>
                  </q> and then, on you go to expreſs your abhorrence of the conduct of the ſacrilegious wretches whoſe impious hands had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved them. And, recollect, that you took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care not to utter a ſyllable againſt the ſavages, who attempted to murder a Britiſh Officer, to avenge "the <hi>mighty wrong.</hi>" To intrude your precepts, therefore, at this time; to ſtrut and hector over the poor fallen <hi>Tricolor,</hi> and to call on your readers to <q>
                     <hi>unite under their</hi> own flag, <hi>and</hi> learn to be a nation,</q> entitles you to but very little praiſe. Your advice comes too late. The patient was in a ſtate of convaleſcence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ventured to preſcribe: French priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, jails, whips, and irons, had effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the malady of the public, while you ſtood fumbling its pulſe. Had the ſame ſtupid admiration of the French, that prevailed, and that you participated in, for ſeveral years; had this admiration and its concomitant partiality ſtill exiſted, you would never have dared (with all your <hi>heroiſm</hi>) to call the hoiſting of their flag "a low pitiful buſineſs:" you would prudently have left that to a writer of leſs caution and more ſincerity, reſerving to yourſelf the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able taſk of endeavouring to disfigure his motives and blaſt his fame.</p>
               <p>And, was it then ſuch a heinous offence to quote a writer of your ſtamp <q>with diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</q> or apply to him the charge of <hi>vulgar
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031947_0034_0FEF5CD4B654DBF8"/>
prejudice?</hi> It would be curious to hear, on what it is that you ground your right of exemption from all cenſure and criticiſm. Beſides, to ſay that a man has adopted a <hi>vulgar prejudice,</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to give offence to no one but an illiterate booby, who does not know the meaning of the words, or a captious, inflated ſelf-ſufficient pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. Yet it is this phraſe, and this alone, that has provoked you to ſeek retaliation, and retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, too, of the moſt baſe and malicious ſpecies. —<q>We <hi>conteſt</hi> (ſay you, after declaring that <hi>I am unable to cope with you</hi>) We conteſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's principles. It was ſtrongly ſuſpected <hi>many months ago,</hi> that his principles <hi>are</hi> not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry friendly to the independence of America, and ſtill leſs ſo to the form of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The grammatical inaccuracy of this laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, though fallen from the pen of a <hi>language-maker,</hi> it would be foreign to my purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on: it is the ſlander it conveys, that it is my duty to expoſe.—<hi>"It was ſtrongly ſuſpected."</hi> This is the true goſſiping, calumniating ſtyle. All verbal aſſaſſins ſpeak in the <hi>paſſive voice,</hi> that, what they cannot prove, they may at laſt throw on public report. If you had ſaid, <q>
                     <hi>I</hi> ſuſpected many months ago,</q> though it would have led to a detection, you would have acted more like a man; and this might have been expected too, in a volunteer of your <q>determined zeal and firmneſs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>However, as you are very fond of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous plural number and paſſive voice, perhaps, it is but fair to ſuppoſe, that you mean to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<note place="bottom">March.</note>
                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:031947_0035_0FEF5D20BB2DDF30"/>
that <hi>you</hi> ſuſpected my principles <hi>many months ago;</hi> and, if this was really the caſe, pray how came you to recommend my pamphlets to the peruſal of your readers, as the beſt antedote to the anarchical principles of the enemies of the government? <hi>How many</hi> months ago was it that your penetration made the grand diſcovery? When I propoſed publiſhing a paper, which was no more than about <hi>ſix weeks</hi> anterior to the date of your Addreſs, you told the public in an exulting manner, that I ſhould <q>prove a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcourge to the patriots,</q> meaning Bache, Greenleaf, and all the antifederal crew. <hi>Six weeks</hi> 'Squire Webſter, is not <hi>many months.</hi> If you really ſuſpected my enmity to the government, and to the independence of America, you were a very great hypocrite, if not ſomething of a traitor, to applaud my undertaking; and, if on the other hand, you had no ſuch ſuſpicion, and have now feigned it merely for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging what your haughtineſs has conſtrued into an affront, I leave the public to determine what name you are worthy of.</p>
               <p>But, you do not ſtop at ſuſpicions. You ſeem to have foreſeen that your readers would require ſomething more than mere ſurmiſe, and you were determined to furniſh it. When a man is once got into miſchief, he does not ſtick at trifles. —<q>This ſuſpicion, ſay you, has been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encreaſed by the manner in which Peter's Gazette has been conducted.</q>—Now, who, upon reading this, would not imagine, that my Gazette had diſcovered a departure from the principles which I had before profeſſed; a ſpirit hoſtile to the government of this country, or

at leaſt unfriendly to it. Who would imagine that you, or any other man who wiſhes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the leaſt pretenſions to candour, would have ventured to accuſe another of enmity to the government upon a foundation ſlighter than this? Yet you can produce no ſuch thing. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having turned and rummaged my poor gazette over and over again, pryed into every paragraph, and weighed each ſingle expreſſion, all you can collect to <hi>"increaſe"</hi> your ſuſpicion, is, my <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing abuſe againſt <hi>la Fayette,</hi>
                  </q> and my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing whole columns, <q>filled with apologies for the old government of France!</q> as if the ſentiments of a man, reſpecting la Fayette and the French monarchy, formed a criterion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to eſtimate his attachment to the Conſtitution and Independence of the United States! Futile indeed muſt be the charge, that has no other ſupport than ſuch round-about kind of evidence as this.</p>
               <p>I certainly might paſs over with ſilent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, what, if ſtrictly true, goes not an inch towards juſtifying your malignant inſinuation; but, as you have been mean enough to take ſhelter under the popular, the <q>vulgar preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</q> that prevails in favour of la Fayette and againſt monarchical governments, I ſhall take one ſtep out of my way, in order to convince the public, that I ſhall never decline a combat with Noah Webſter, though backed with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed partiality of millions.</p>
               <p>What you are pleaſed to term, <q>retailing <hi>abuſe</hi> againſt la Fayette,</q> and, in another place, <q>
                     <hi>vilifying</hi> the defenders of American Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</q>
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:031947_0037_0FEF5D2FA7EC1BA8"/>
all this put together, is, the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſpeech of Mr. Burke, on the motion brought forward in the Britiſh Parliament, for the purpoſe of prevailing on the king to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for la Fayette's releaſe. This ſpeech was publiſhed in my Gazette, of the 7th March; and, ſo far from its being an abuſive, vilifying ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, though it is one of thoſe pieces of ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that will for ages be an ornament to the proceedings of the Britiſh Commons, it is not more remarkable for its eloquence than for its <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You, indeed, tell us, that la Fayette's being "<hi>in fault,</hi> is <hi>doubtful,</hi> or <hi>not admitted:</hi>"—and in this ſhort ſentence, you have given a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſpecimen of the <hi>equivoque</hi> than is to be found in Boileau's famous poem on the ſubject. In the firſt place, we know not whether you expreſs the opinion of others, or your own: next, if you are underſtood as expreſſing your own opinion, you declare the queſtion doubtful, you do not admit the fault, and yet you do not venture to declare your friend innocent: laſtly, ſhould ſome warm partizan, whether royaliſt or republican, call you to account for heſitating on the ſubject, ſtill you have a ſhift left; for you do not ſay, or even hint, whether it be la Fayette's crimes againſt the king, or thoſe againſt the aſſembly, that you doubt of.—It was in the wars, I preſume, that you learnt this precaution, of always ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing a ſafe retreat.</p>
               <p>To one, who ſo carefully diſguiſes his ſentiments, it is next to impoſſible to make a ſatisfactory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: however, ſuppoſing you to doubt of la
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031947_0038_0FEF5D46B928EF40"/>
Fayette's fault with reſpect to his ſovereign, I would aſk you, where you have lived for theſe ten years laſt paſt? To hear you ſtart <hi>doubts</hi> on this ſubject, one would imagine you had dwelt in a dormitory or a hermitage; that you had been abſorbed in heavenly meditation; that your veſſel (as the puritans call it) had been a reſevoir of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in place of being what, alas! it is, a mere channel for news.</p>
               <p>To enter into a minute examination of la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ett's conduct, during his ſhort-lived career in the French revolution, would be giving an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to his character which it does not deſerve. It is true that he always was an underworker, like many others; and, therefore, is not to be reckoned among the miſcreant Mirabeaus, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorcets, &amp;c. whoſe puppet he was; but, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs comes in for a conſiderable ſhare of that cenſure which is due to a combination of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, determined to build their own fame and greatneſs on the ruins of a mighty empire, without remorſe for the miſeries it muſt produce. One fact, when the merits of la Fayette are to be tried, ought never to be forgotten: it was his revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary brain that conceived the French <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> of which no more need be ſaid, than that they are the very text from which Tom Paine has ever ſince been preaching the duty of <hi>holy inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would willingly believe that gratitude for the ſervices which la Fayette rendered America, has now called forth your compaſſion for his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and your reſentment againſt my paper, or rather againſt me. I would willingly trace your
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031947_0039_0FEF5CFCB005FDB8"/>
aſperity back to this amiable ſource; but your paſt conduct tells me that I ſhould attempt it in vain. How come you to be grateful to la Fayette <hi>alone?</hi> Has no other friend to the American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution lain on the damp floor of a dungeon? Never did you, (with ſhame be it ſpoken, Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) never did you utter a word of compaſſion for the unfortunate friendleſs Louis XVI. when this ſame la Fayette was leading him in triumph from priſon to priſon. Never did you talk of cruel treatment, when the Queen of France was dragged in ſlow proceſſion to Paris, while the myrmidons of this ſame la Fayette carried the ghaſtly heads of her murdered guards before her. No; you rejoiced at all this; and yet, I believe, no one will have the impudence to pretend, that la Fayette's ſervices to this country, were a millionth part ſo great as thoſe of poor Louis and his conſort.—Nay, you ſaw the head of this fallen prince roll from the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; you ſaw his family cut off one by one; you ſaw his innocent child lingering in a dungeon, robbed of ſleep, terrified four times an hour with orders to prepare for death, and at laſt you ſaw his bloated and livid corpſe ſtretched in a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart.—On all this you looked with a philoſphic eye. Not a tear eſcaped you; not a groan, not a ſigh, was heard from the tender-hearted <hi>Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> who now tells us that "<hi>la Fayette's</hi> ſufferings call for the <hi>"ſympathy of all mankind."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No, Sir, nor did you ever feel any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of compaſſion for la Fayette himſelf, or you would have expreſſed your abhorrence of the cruel and ſavage meaſures adopted againſt him and his family by the pretended republicans of France. That was the time for your gratitude
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031947_0040_0FEF5D233576B8C8"/>
and friendſhip to have ſhown itſelf. You, who <q>once voluntarily bore arms to defend indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and who now with determined zeal and firmneſs openly declares war againſt the man who <hi>dares</hi> vilify the defenders of it,</q> among whom you count la Fayette; you, Sir, ſhould have ſtood forth againſt the then popular Convention, who had fixed a price on the head of your friend; who had, by law, authorized the citizens to ſhoot him, or knock his brains out, like a dog; nay, had impoſed it on them as a duty. Then was the time for the <hi>blue-eyed Maid</hi> to graſp her javelin, and ſhelter the injured hero beneath her ample ſhield. As ſhe neglected to do this; as ſhe ſhrank from the encounter with popular fury; as ſhe tamely yielded to the <hi>vulgar prejudice</hi> that then prevailed in favour of every act of the mock legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of France, however cruel and infamous, ſhe will now receive but little applauſe, from men of ſenſe, for her cenſure of the Emperor of Germany, whoſe title alone, ſhe well knows, will, with the groſs of <hi>her readers,</hi> be a ſufficient apology for any departure from decency and truth.</p>
               <p>No, Sir; it is too clear, that a deſire to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate yourſelf with the deceived part of the public, together with that of injuring me, led you to bring forward the ſtalking horſe la Fayette, and not any friendſhip, gratitude, or compaſſion that you entertained for him. This your manner of proceeding inconteſtibly proves. Firſt, you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſuſpect my enmity to the independence of America; then you artfully produce my publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Burke's cenſure of la Fayette, as a proof of that enmity, leaving your readers to draw the natural concluſion, that I had "retailed
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031947_0041_0FEF5D25B1C53600"/>
abuſe" againſt him, merely <hi>for his having fought in the cauſe of Independence.</hi>—Never did envy and revenge ſuggeſt a baſer inſinuation, or one, the falſhood of which was more eaſy to detect.</p>
               <p>If I bear malice againſt la Fayette, if I have publiſhed a cenſure on him, if I have "<hi>retailed abuſe</hi> againſt him," as you are pleaſed to call it, on account of his having ſerved here, during the revolutionary war; pray, does it not follow, that I muſt bear the ſame malice, and feel the ſame inclination to cenſure every one who aided the cauſe of Independence? If ſuch be the motive from which I act, I certainly could look round among thoſe who did more injury to the cauſe of Great Britain in one day, nay in one minute, than la Fayette did during the war, or could have done in his whole life time. I call on you, then, to ſay whether I have ever, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, diſcovered an inclination to defame any man, merely becauſe he was inſtrumental in eſtabliſhing the independence of this country. Have I ever attempted to aſperſe, have I ever hinted any thing to the diſhonour of, Mr. Jay, Mr. Adams, or General Waſhington? Theſe gentlemen, the moſt eminent actors on the great drama of the revolution, have all been attacked, ſlandered and abuſed, by thoſe who are among the eulogiſts of la Fayette; and I leave the public to determine, who has ſhown the moſt diligence, zeal and courage, in defence of their characters, <hi>Peter Porcupine</hi> or <hi>Noah Webſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In purſuance of the ſame view it was, that you choſe to comment on my having publiſhed <q>an
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031947_0042_0FEF5CD8A4F549D8"/>
apology for the old government of France,</q> which you aſſert to be <q>as corrupt a ſyſtem of <hi>deſpotiſm</hi> as Europe ever witneſſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To call the old government of France, which all the civilians have reckoned among the <hi>limited monarchies;</hi> to call this government a <hi>deſpotiſm,</hi> argues a mind ſtrongly tinctured with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of liberty and equality; but, to ſay that it was as corrupt a ſyſtem of deſpotiſm <hi>as Europe ever ſaw,</hi> puts you upon a level with the ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous haranguers of the ſuburbs of St. Antoine and St. Marceaw. He that can call the monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical government of France the worſt of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, would make little ſcruple to imitate the <hi>vénérable Père Du Chène,</hi> in branding St. Louis, Henry IV. and Louis the XVI. with the name of tyrants.</p>
               <p>You do, however, allow that there is one ſpecies of government ſtill worſe than that of the French monarchy; and here your conſiſtency is well worth attention. Firſt the old government is <hi>as bad a one as Europe ever ſaw;</hi> then the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobin government <hi>is worſe.</hi> This is not amiſs; but you do not let us off ſo. After having thus acknowledged that the Jacobin government is <hi>worſe</hi> than <hi>the worſt,</hi> you have the conſcience to quarrel with me, to wage eternal war with me, for cenſuring one of the principal founders of this very Jacobin government! You had forgot, or you never knew, the hiſtory of the firſt years of the French revolution. You contemplate your friend in the dungeon of Almutz only; you do not look back, and behold him in the tribune of the Jacobin Club at Paris. la Fayette was one
<note place="bottom">March.</note>
                  <pb n="94" facs="unknown:031947_0043_0FEF5CE49E13A948"/>
of the very firſt, that took the name of Jacobin: he was a founder of the ſect, and continued to be a member of it, till July, 1792. Even then he did not <hi>withdraw</hi> himſelf, but was <hi>expelled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The old government, ſay you was not ſo bad as the Jacobin government, it is true; but there is a government different from both, which la Fayette <hi>ſought,</hi> and which the people of this country will rejoice to ſee introduced; that is, a <hi>Free Government.</hi>
                  </q>—Now, ſir, what do you mean by a government that la Fayette <hi>ſought?</hi> To hear you, one would imagine, that he had been foiled in ſome precious project for the good of his country; that his councils had been rejected, and himſelf perſecuted on account of his probity and wiſdom; whereas the very reverſe of all this was the caſe. His projects ſucceeded to the utmoſt of his wiſhes. The famous <hi>rights of man,</hi> of which he was the propoſer, became a fundamental law, was ſanctioned and ſworn to by the whole nation. The Conſtitution, grounded on thoſe rights, he ſaw completed, and he retired from the legiſlative ſcene well pleaſed with his work. In ſhort, the government he <hi>ſought,</hi> he <hi>obtained,</hi> and a moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, baſe and cruel government it was. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that acknowledged the horrid act of inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to be a ſacred duty, and that, in its prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, made a beginning in that career of ſacrilege, plunder and aſſaſſination, which has been ſo unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittingly purſued by ſucceeding and more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful uſurpers. And this is what you call a <hi>Free Government;</hi> one that the people of America will be glad to ſee eſtabliſhed in France! If the people of America are ſilly or wicked enough to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any ſuch wiſh, I ſincerely hope it may not be
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031947_0044_0FEF5CDB12913450"/>
accompliſhed. The government they have now in France, is certainly a moſt abominable deſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, but it is not ſo deſtructive either in principle or practice, as that which la Fayette <hi>ſought</hi> and aſſiſted to form.</p>
               <p>What involves you in theſe inconſiſtencies and contradictions is evident enough: you were a long time a very great admirer of the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I will not ſay that I could make <hi>you</hi> bluſh, but I am certain I could make your friends bluſh, by a quotation from your paper in <hi>approbation</hi> of Tom Paine's <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> the manuel of Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biniſm. Exactly how far you went hand in hand with the revolutioniſts, I know not; nor do I be-believe that you yourſelf know. You are in the predicament of a great many others, who, when they are aſked what they approved and what they did not approve, anſwer, that they went <hi>as far as la Fayette,</hi> but <hi>no farther;</hi> and God knows that was far enough.</p>
               <p>You, and all thoſe who thus pinned their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical faith on the ſleeve of this unfledged ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would ſtill have been revolutioniſts in the fulleſt ſenſe of the term, had not the uſurpers been preparing to extend their fraternal graſp to this government and country. Till then you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided ſaying a word againſt them: all their moſt atrocious deeds were ſmoothed over; their plundering decrees, their invitations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, were all right, till they caſt their looks this way: then your eyes were opened at once: like Bailly and la Fayette, you adored the holy right of inſurrection, till it began to operate againſt yourſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:031947_0045_0FEF5CE808CD1128"/>From this digreſſion, which your ſtraggling from your ſubject invited, I return to examine more cloſely the accuſation of having publiſhed "an apology for the old government of France." This apology is contained in certain extracts from Gifford's anſwer to lord Lauderdale's letters to the Peers of Scotland. The writer obſerves with great juſtneſs, that <q>one of the moſt ſucceſsful modes of <hi>exciting ſentiments favourable to the French Revolution,</hi> has been the imputation of every vice creative of diſguſt to the old govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of France.</q> He then notices the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous neglect of candour and truth, that has been diſplayed in the performance of this taſk: the unfair mode of arguing that has been adopted, and the exaggeration and calumny that has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on the uninformed. The object of all this, it is evident, has been not only to juſtify the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutioniſts in deſtroying the monarchy, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate a belief, that the people, notwithſtanding their preſent miſery, are ſtill gainers by the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm that has been raiſed on its ruins.</p>
               <p>To expoſe the falacy of this reaſoning, to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the miſconceptions of the weak, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the miſrepreſentations of the wicked, Mr. Gifford enters into a candid examination of the ſubject, during which he proves, and that moſt ſatisfactorily, that the acts of oppreſſion imputed to the French government, were generally, not to ſay always, exaggerated; that in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the charges were totally unfounded, and even ridiculous; that in ſhort, to the happineſs of France, no revolution was neceſſary; and of courſe, that this dreadful ſcourge is to be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ambition and treachery of the uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing legiſlators.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:031947_0046_0FEF5D10C7239B30"/>With reſpect to the extracts, in themſelves conſidered, the facts they contain are of indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able authenticity; as to the ſtyle, it is as far above the criticiſm of Noah Webſter, as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his imitation; and I defy you to cull out a ſingle ſentiment, from beginning to end, which, by the moſt violent contorſion, can be called hoſtile to true liberty. The elegant and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writer is an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and conſequently knows how to eſtimate the bleſſings of freedom full as well, if not better than you. He is <hi>a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> and, which is more as to the preſent point, the author of a hiſtory of France, which has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the applauſe of the whole literary world, and which is the fruit of a long and painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, during many years of reſidence in that country: of courſe his knowledge (particularly of whatever relates to the monarchy of France) is not to be ſunk to a competition with that of a man, the greateſt extent of whoſe travels has been from Connecticut to New-York, and the utmoſt exertion of whoſe talents is to be ſought for in the compilation of a ſchool-book. Laſtly, the author of the <q>Apology for the old govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of France</q> is <hi>an independent gentleman,</hi> whoſe ſole object in writing muſt be the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of honeſt fame; and who is not therefore, like a retailer of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and news, obliged to vary his politics to the more than female caprice of the multitude.</p>
               <p>But, to do you juſtice, I really believe, you poſſeſs too much good ſenſe not to be, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, charmed with what you pretend to diſapprove of. Whether you will be pleaſed to hear your judgment thus complimented at the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031947_0047_0FEF5D62D35445D0"/>
expence of your ſincerity, I neither know nor care; but it certainly was me, and not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts in my paper that you were angry with, and that it was your object to decry. You wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propagate a belief that I was an enemy to the Independence of America, and alſo to the form of the federal government. The former charge, which has already been refuted, was to be looked upon as proved by my publiſhing Mr. Burke's cenſure on la Fayette; and the latter by my publiſhing, from Gifford, an apology for the old government of France.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſhameful abandonment of candour, the ſame jeſuitical ſpirit of perverſion, that you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in your comments on what reſpects la Fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ette, is ſtill more apparant in what you ſay of the apology.—You tell your readers, that you ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my enmity to the <hi>form of government</hi> under which we live; and add, that this ſuſpicion is encreaſed by my publiſhing an <hi>apology for the old government of France.</hi> Here you ſtop without ſaying that my intention is to introduce the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter form of government here: however, leſt you ſhould be miſunderſtood, of which you ſeem to have been much afraid, you afterwards revive the ſubject, and, addreſſing yourſelf to me, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gravely and very maliciouſly obſerve, that my <q>
                     <hi>popularity,</hi> is not to be maintained by <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending</hi> the old government of France;</q> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by intimating that I had actually propoſed the old government of France, which you call the worſt of deſpotiſms, as a ſubſtitute for the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government of the United States! What a wretched attempt at impoſition. This may well be termed, in your own flag language, <q>
                     <hi>a

a</hi> low pitiful buſineſs.</q>—You beſt know what ſtock of ſtupidity the readers of the Minerva are bleſſed with, but this I am certain of; that the clumſieſt and moſt impudent vagabond Jugler never ventured to play off ſo barefaced a decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the gaping clowns at a country fair.—And were you, could you be, ſo completely infatuat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed as to hope that any man in his ſenſes, any thing in human ſhape, would become the dupe of your ſpiteful inſinuation? The thing is beyond the compaſs of belief: to attempt to diſprove it would be uſeleſs: to give it a formal denial, or even to call it a lie, would be doing it too much honour.</p>
               <p>After having ſhown the abſurdity, the malice, of your pretended ſuſpicions with reſpect to my political principles, you will permit me to aſk you once more, why thoſe ſuſpicions were never awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened 'till lately?—Many of the men who fought for American Independence have been treated, in my writings, with much leſs mercy than Mr. Burke's ſpeech treats la Fayette. Nay, I have never ſpared la Fayette himſelf, when I have had occaſion to ſpeak of him (and that has been very often) either individually or as a member of the Conſtitution making Aſſembly. And, as to the old government of France, I have often paſſed higher commendations on it, than Mr. Gifford does in the extracts you complain of. To be ſure I never <hi>recommended</hi> it to the people of America, as you ſillily inſinuate I have done in publiſhing thoſe extracts; but I have ventured <q>to predict, that, ſooner or later, the French will return to that form of government under which they were happy, and under which alone they can

ever be ſo again;</q> and this I did in my <hi>Life and Adventures.</hi>—How came theſe things to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape your awful cenſure ſo long? How came you never before to think it your duty to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them as an indication of my enmity to the government and Independence of your country? You let me go on uninterrupted, pamphlet after pamphlet, for three whole years; yea, and even applauded my efforts all the time; and now, at laſt, you find me to be a dangerous fellow, and burſt out upon me all at once, like a thunder from a ſummer cloud.</p>
               <p>In vain would you make me believe, that any real ſuſpicion, that any apprehenſion of my inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, has cauſed this change in your conduct towards me. It is poſſible, and barely poſſible, that your vanity has been unable to ſupport the charge of <hi>vulgar prejudice,</hi> and has ſtimulated you to this unmanly mode of revenge. But, are you ſure, Webſter, that <hi>envy,</hi> curſed <hi>envy,</hi> has had nothing to do in the "<hi>low pitiful</hi> buſineſs?"

               <p>It is ever painful to be obliged to think ill, and much more ſo to ſpeak ill, of thoſe that we have been accuſtomed to eſteem, and I ſhould hardly bring myſelf to impute your enmity to ſo diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a cauſe, were I not well aſſured that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is juſt.</p>

The letter which I wrote you, when I requeſted you to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the propoſals for my Gazette (a letter written in the fulleſt confidence) muſt have convinced any man, of a mind not indued with the quality of turning its nutriment to poiſon, that the American government had not a more ſincere, more zealous, or more devoted friend than I. This letter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reluctance I might on any other occaſion feel to ſuffer its appearance in print, I now call on you to publiſh in your paper; and, if you have one ſingle grain of candour or juſtice left, you will not heſitate to comply with my requeſt.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhould cloſe, but there are two or three paſſages more in your Addreſs, which ſo ſtrongly invite attention, that your vanity might, perhaps, take the alarm again, were they to paſs totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed; and, after having taſted ſo ſeverely of the effects of your wrath, it is not to be wondered at, if I feel no inclination to brave it a ſecond time.</p>
               <p>You are ſo good as to inform me, <q>that you once <hi>voluntarily</hi> bore arms to defend Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that, in purſuance of <hi>the ſame</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, you <hi>firſt</hi> propoſed publickly the plan of a National Conſtitution; that, perſevering in the ſame principles, you aſſailed the monſter <hi>faction,</hi> the moment it appeared in the inſidious form of popular clubs; and that, from that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this preſent writing, you have never ceaſed to expoſe the artifices of the French agents to lay this country at the feet of France.<note place="bottom">March.</note>

                      rendition="simple:additions"/>How all this got into a letter written about an Engliſh flag, I can't for my ſoul conceive. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis <hi>news,</hi> and as ſuch I am, in common with the reſt of the trade, obliged to you for it.</p>
               <p>I have read the hiſtory of the American war over and over again, but I do not recollect ever having ſeen the name of <hi>Noah Webſter</hi> in it. That you were not very famous is therefore certain, and it is more than probable that you were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as mere food for powder, a ſituation that, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be the cauſe you were made uſe of in, is nothing at all to boaſt of.</p>

                     <hi>firſt</hi> who publickly propoſed a National Conſtitution,</q> is a curious anecdote enough; and I cannot ſay but I am glad it is come to light, as it will tend to quaſh, or at leaſt to moderate, the exhorbitant pretenſions of that unconſcionable dog Tom Paine, who puts in an abſolute claim to the whole credit of the invention. Tom does, indeed, confeſs, that he was anticipated by one writer on the ſubject, who inſiſted, that <hi>thirteen ſtaves, without a hoop, would never make a barrel;</hi> and if you can make it out, as I have not the leaſt doubt you can, that you were the real le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate author of this ſhrewd and learned obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Tom muſt give way to you, or, at leaſt, you muſt be permitted to come in with him for a ſhare of the honour.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee I do not diſpute your pretenſions to military or conſtitution making fame, but as to your boldneſs in <q>aſſailing the monſter FAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION; as to your perſeverance and ſucceſs in expoſing the artifices of the French;</q> theſe I
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031947_0052_0FEF5D1363ADA2F0"/>
do diſpute, and not only diſpute, but poſitively deny. You have, indeed, as far as you have found it prudent to go, <hi>latterly</hi> eſpouſed the cauſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and conſequently that of the government; but, to do this with effect, you ſhould have begun long enough before you did, and ſhould have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a tone that never has been heard from the <hi>Minerva.</hi> At firſt you were a warm partizan of inſurrection; you were among the abuſers, the calumniators, of Burke, and the eulogiſts of Paine. At this epocha you were bold, becauſe you acted with the crowd. When Genet's inſolence awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened the ſuſpicions of the people here, then you began to veer, to ſhuffle and to trim; and, from that time to the preſent moment you have been playing that double handed game, which, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profitable you may contrive to make it, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles you to the character of a Vicar of Bray. If my worthy patron, Bradford, is to be believed, your old friend, and <hi>partner in the language trade,</hi> Doctor Franklin, was ſix weeks in Congreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any one could divine whether he was a Whig or Tory; and I have frequently been at a loſs to gueſs, ſuch a compound is your politics, whether I ought to claſs you among the Federaliſts or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrats. If theſe words have any meaning, as applied to you, you are a Democrat in principle, and a Federaliſt for convenience.</p>
               <p>Not content with a malignant miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my motives and the meaning of my words, you muſt inſult me with your <hi>advice.</hi> You tell me that I do not proceed in the right way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my <hi>popularity,</hi> and caution me againſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing what is "<hi>diſreſpectful</hi> to <hi>the opinions of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans;</hi>" and thus you diſcover a ſervility of mind,

that would be diſgraceful even in a mendicant. When you form a jugment of me, Maſter Webſter, and of what is likely to produce a change in my conduct, be ſo good as not to conſult your own heart, for it will aſſuredly deceive you. <hi>Populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> may be your God, as indeed, it evidently is: ſo is it not mine. Small is the ſacrifice that I would make at its ſhrine. A volume of the beſt of praiſe is not, with me, worth its weight in bread and cheeſe; and as to the ſtupid plaudits of a partial and prejudiced throng, I ſhould think that they covered me with infamy inſtead of honour.</p>
               <p>According to your notions of the liberty of the preſs, a man muſt not publiſh a word againſt la Fayette, though it be extracted from ſome other writer; becauſe, forſooth, <q>it is extremely <hi>diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful</hi> to the opinions of Americans!</q> In other words, nothing muſt appear in a news-paper that does not perfectly chime in with the prevalent prejudice, however prepoſterous that prejudice may be, or however dangerous its tendency; and thus the preſs, in place of a cenſor, is to be a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſite, to the public; inſtead of being a terror to evil doers, it is to be the pander of folly and of vice.</p>
               <p>That this has, for a long time, been the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the American Preſs, as far as relates to news-papers, is but too true. Every one ſeems to have been upon the watch to find out the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the public, and to accommodate his ſentiments and even his news accordingly: hence it is that we have ſeen hundreds of eulogiums upon Robeſpierre and Marat, and have been ſeriouſly told that the French gained a victory

The people are not told what is their intereſt, but what it is their wiſh, or rather the wiſh of the multitude, to hear. If any one dares to ſpeak what he thinks; to publiſh what he conceives to be uſeful, if it happens to be contrary to the <hi>vulgar prejudice,</hi> he is told that he is <hi>diſreſpectful</hi> to the opinions of Americans.</p>
               <p>According to the cant of the day, the people of a ſtate, not governed by a monarch, is called the <hi>ſovereign.</hi> For my part, I never hear talk of a <hi>ſovereign people,</hi> of a ſociety every individual of which is liable to the graſp of a catch-pole; I never do or can hear talk of ſuch a <hi>ſovereign</hi> without laughing. But, as ſuch <hi>you</hi> look upon the people. Well then, to have an idea of your own ſervility, tell me what you would ſay of a news-printer in England, who ſhould cenſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for publiſhing ſentiments extremely <hi>diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful</hi> to the <hi>opinions of the king?</hi> Would you not call him a ſlave, a poor rampant ſpaniel-like ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant? And, where is the difference, I would be glad to know, between crawling to a ſovereign with one head and a ſovereign with many?—No, Webſter, your inſinuations that I treat the people of America, or rather their <hi>opinions,</hi> with <hi>diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> will never deter me from following the bent of my own inclination. In my publications, I hope, I ſhall always be guided by truth: how few I may pleaſe, or how many I may diſpleaſe, is to me a matter of very little moment. I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I truſt, a due reſpect for the real people of

I have no pretenſions to <hi>patriotiſm,</hi> and as to <hi>diſintereſtedneſs,</hi> it is nonſenſe to talk of it; but, though gain be one principle object of my labours, I ſcorn to purſue it by the baſe means of trimming and truckling. No, Webſter, the public will is not my guide: when my readers become ſo unreaſonable as to require a ſuppreſſion of every ſentiment that does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with their own, I will quit the trade of a news-monger, hire a garret, write Carmagnole bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads for the diverſion of the ſovereign people, and elegies on the departed liberty of the preſs.</p>
               <p>You conclude by declaring your reſolution to annoy me <q>by all thoſe decent and legal means that diſtinguiſh the <hi>gentleman</hi> and the <hi>citizen.</hi>

            <p>SINCE I took up the calling that I now follow, I have received about forty threatening letters; ſome talk of fiſticuff, others of kicks, but far the greater part menace me with out-right murder. Several friends (whom by the bye I ſincerely thank) have called to caution me againſt the lurking cut-throats; and it ſeems to be the perſuaſion of every one, that my brains are to be knocked out the firſt time I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from home in the dark.</p>
            <p>Under theſe terrific circumſtances, it is impoſſible that Death ſhould not ſtare me in the face: I have therefore got myſelf into as good a ſtate of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as my ſinful profeſſion will, I am afraid, admit of; and as to my worldly affairs, I have ſettled them in the following <hi>WILL,</hi> which I publiſh, in order that my dear friends, the Legatees, may, if they think themſelves injured or neglected, have an opportunity of complaining before it be too late.</p>

I PETER POR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUPINE, Pamphleteer and News-Monger, being (as yet) ſound both in body and in mind, do, this fifteenth day of <hi>April,</hi> in the Year of our LORD, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-ſeven, make, declare, and publiſh, this my LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT, in manner, form, and ſubſtance following; to wit:</p>
            <p>IN PRIMIS, I LEAVE my body to Doctor Michael Lieb, a member of the Legiſlature of Pennſylvania, to be by him diſſected (if he knows how to do it) in preſence of the Rump of the Democratic Society, In it they will find a heart that held them in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, that never palpitated at their threats, and that, to its laſt beat, bade them defiance. But my chief motive for making this bequeſt it, that my ſpirit may look down with contempt on their cannibal-like triumph over a breathleſs corps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> As I make no doubt that the above ſaid Doctor Lieb (and ſome other Doctors that I could menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) would like very well to ſkin me, I requeſt that they, or one of them, may do it, and that

the ſaid Lieb's father may tan my ſkin; after which I deſire my Executors to have ſeven copies of my Works complete, bound in it, one copy to be preſented to the five Sultans of France, one to each of their Divans, one to the Governor of Pennſylvania, to citizens Maddiſon, Giles, and Gallatine one each, and the remaining one to the Democratic Society of Philadelphia, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved among their archieves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councils of the City of Philadelphia, I bequeath all the ſturdy young huckſters, who infeſt the market, and who to maintain their baſtards, tax the honeſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants many thouſand pounds annually. I requeſt them to take them into their worſhipful keeping; to chaſten their bodies for the good of their ſouls; and moreover, to keep a ſharp look-out after their gallants: and remind the latter of the old proverb: <hi>Touch pot, touch penny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To T— J—ſon, Philoſopher, I leave a curious Norway Spider, with a hundred legs and nine pair of eyes; likewiſe the firſt black cut-throat general he can catch hold of, to be flead alive, in order to determine with more certainty the real cauſe of the dark colour of his ſkin: and ſhould the ſaid T— J—ſon ſurvive Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neker the Almanack-Maker; I requeſt he will get the brains of ſaid Philomath carefully diſſected, to ſatisfy the world in what reſpects they differ from thoſe of a white man.</p>

               <hi>Item,</hi> To the Philoſophical Society of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a correct copy of Thornton's plan for aboliſhing the uſe of the Engliſh language and for introducing in its ſtead a republican one, the repreſentative characters of which bear a

ſtrong reſemblance to pot-hooks and hangers; and for the diſcovery of which plan, the ſaid ſociety did, in the year 1793, grant to the ſaid lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage maker 500 dollars premium.—It is my earneſt deſire, that the copy of this valuable performance, which I hereby preſent, may be ſhown to all the travelling literati, as a proof of the ingenuity of the author and of the wiſdom of the ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To Doctor Benjamin Ruſh, I will and bequeath a copy of the Cenſor for January, 1797; but, upon the expreſs condition, that he does not is anywiſe or guiſe, either at the time of my death, or <hi>Six months after,</hi> pretend to ſpeak, write or publiſh an eulogium on me, my calling or character, either literary, military, civil, or political.</p>

               <hi>Item,</hi> To my dear fellow labourer Noah Webſter, gen|"tleman-citizen," <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and News-man, I will and bequeath a prognoſticating barometer of curious conſtruction and great utility, by which, at a ſingle glance, the ſaid Noah will be able to diſcern the exact ſtate that the public mind will be in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year, and will thereby be enabled to <hi>trim by degrees</hi> and not expoſe himſelf to detection, as he now does by his ſudden lee-ſhore tacks. I likewiſe bequeath to the ſaid "gentleman citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen," ſix Spaniſh milled dollars, to be expended on a new plate of his portrait at the head of his ſpelling-book, that which graces it at preſent being ſo ugly that it ſcares the children from their leſſons; but this legacy is to be paid him only upon condition that he leave out the title of <hi>'Squire,</hi> at the bottom of ſaid picture, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely odious in an American ſchool-book, and muſt inevitably tend to corrupt the political prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031947_0060_0FEF5D66E99128B8"/>
of the republican babies that behold it. And I do moſt earneſtly deſire, exhort and conjure the ſaid 'Squire-news-man, to change the tittle of his paper, <hi>The Minerva,</hi> for that of <hi>The Political Centaur.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To Tom the Tinker, I leave a liberty cap, a tri-colored cockade, a wheel-barrow full of oyſters, and a hogſhead of grog: I alſo leave him three blank checks on the Bank of Pennſylvania, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him the taſk of <hi>filling them up;</hi> requeſting him, however, to be rather more merciful than he has ſhown himſelf heretofore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the Governor of Pennſylvania, and to the late Preſident and Caſhier of the Bank of the ſaid State, as to joint legatees, I will and bequeath that good old proverb: <hi>Honeſty is the beſt policy.</hi> And this legacy I have choſen for theſe worthy gentlemen, as the only thing about which I am ſure they will never diſagree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To T— Coxe, of Philadelphia, citizen, I will and bequeath a crown of hemlock, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his attempt to throw an odium on the adminiſtration of General Waſhington; and I moſt poſitively enjoin on my executors, to ſee that the ſaid crown be ſhaped exactly like that which this ſpindle-ſhanked legatee wore before Gen.

               <hi>Item,</hi> To Thomas Lord Bradford (otherwiſe called Gooſy Tom), Bookſeller, Printer, News-man,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031947_0061_0FEF5CDD8D418A18"/>

               <hi>Item,</hi> To Edmund Randolph, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> late Secretary of State, to Mr. J. A.

I likewiſe bequeath to the ſaid John a ſmall treatiſe by an Italian author, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſecret of pleaſing the ladies is developed, and reduced to a mere mechanical operation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt dependance on the precarious aid of the paſſions. Hoping that theſe inſtances of my liberality will produce, in the mind of the little

               <hi>Item,</hi> To the editor of the Boſton Chronicle, the New York Argus, and the Philadelphia Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants' Advertiſer, I will and bequeath one ounce of modeſty and love of truth, to be equally divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between them.

            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To Franklin Bache, editor of the Aurora of Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a ſmall bundle of French aſſignats, which I brought with me from the country of equality. If theſe ſhould be too light in value for his preſſing exigencies, I deſire my executors, or any one of them, to beſtow on him a ſecond part to what he has lately received in Southwark; and as a further proof of my good will and affection, I requeſt him to accept of a gag and a brand new pair of fetters, which if he ſhould refuſe, I will and bequeath him in lieu thereof—my malediction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To my beloved countrymen, the people of Old England, I will and bequeath a copy of Doctor Prieſtley's Charity Sermon <hi>for the benefit of poor Emigrants;</hi> and to the ſaid preaching philoſopher himſelf, I bequeath a heart full of diſappointment, grief and deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the good people in France, who remain attached to their ſovereign, particularly to thoſe among whom I was hoſpitably received, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath each a good ſtrong dagger; hoping moſt ſincerely that they may yet find courage enough
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031947_0063_0FEF5D15DF1156B0"/>
to carry them to the hearts of their abominable tyrants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To citizen M—oe, I will and bequeath my chamber looking-glaſs. It is a plain but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true mirror: in it he will ſee the exact like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a traitor, who has bartered the honour and intereſt of his country to a perfidious and ſavage enemy.</p>

               <hi>Item,</hi> To the republican Britons, who have fled from the hands of juſtice in their own country, and who are a ſcandal, a nuiſance and a diſgrace to this, I bequeath hunger and nakedneſs, ſcorn and reproach; and I do hereby poſitively enjoin on my executors to contribute five hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars towards the erection of gallowſes and gibbets, for the accommodation of the ſaid imported pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, when the legiſlators of this unhappy ſtate ſhall have the wiſdom to countenance ſuch uſeful eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> My friend J. T. Callender, the run-away from Scotland, is of courſe a partaker in the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned legacy; but as a particular mark of my attention, I will and bequeath him twenty feet of pine plank, which I requeſt my executors to ſee made into a pillory, to be kept for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſe, till a gibbet can be prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To Tom Paine, the author of <hi>Common Senſe, Rights of Man, Age of Reaſon,</hi> and a <hi>letter to General Waſhington,</hi> I bequeath a ſtrong hempen collar, as the only legacy I can think of that is worthy of him, as well as beſt adapted to render his death in ſome meaſure as infamous as his life: and I do hereby direct and order my Executors to ſend it to him by the firſt ſafe conveyance,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031947_0064_0FEF34F65C0F9030"/>
with my compliments, and requeſt that he would make uſe of it without delay, that the national razor may not be diſgraced by the head of ſuch a monſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To the gaunt outlandiſh orator, vulgarly called the Political Sinner, who in the juſt order of things follows next after the laſt mentioned le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatee, I bequeath the honour of partaking in his cataſtrophe; that in their deaths, as well as in their lives, all the world may exclaim; <q>See how rogues hang together!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To all and ſingular the good people of theſe States, I leave peace, union, abundance, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, untarniſhed honour, and an unconquerable everlaſting hatred to the French Revolutioniſts and their deſtructive abominable principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> To each of my Subſcribers I leave <hi>a quill,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that in their hands it may become a ſword againſt every thing that is hoſtile to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and independence of their country.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Laſtly,</note>To my three brothers, Paul, Simon and Dick, I leave my whole eſtate, as well real as perſonal (firſt paying the foregoing legacies) to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided between them ſhare and ſhare alike. And I do hereby make and conſtitute my ſaid three brothers the Executors of this my LAST WILL; to ſee the ſame performed, according to its true intent and meaning, as far as in their power lies.</p>
