            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Author is inclined to think, that the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting</hi> occa≈øion <hi>on which the following di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe was delivered, and the tender feelings of the bearers thereby excited, more than any peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in the Sermon, cau≈øed them to reque≈øt its publication: But a hope, that the great, the plain and important truths it contains, may be the means of doing good, together with a di≈øpo≈øition to oblige them, prevails with him to comply with it.‚ÄîThe addre≈øs at the clo≈øe, in particular, he is ≈øen≈øible may expo≈øe him to the cen≈øure of the critic; but it claims the candor of the public, as it was nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ≈øpoken without much premeditation or penning of the ≈øentiments, the preacher expecting to ≈øpeak to the pri≈øoner under a ≈øentence of death,(it being the de≈øign of the meeting) 'till the news of the pardon arrived about half an hour before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For the ≈øame rea≈øon the reader is de≈øired to excu≈øe it, if it is not exactly recollected as it was ≈øpoken: The ≈øub≈øtance, it is ≈øuppo≈øed, is here giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>‚òû<hi>So ≈øingular an in≈øtance of ≈øovereignty in pardoning a criminal, condemned for murder, ≈øhews the attention of the Supreme Executive of the State to</hi> ju≈øtice, <hi>as well as clemency. It was a free and generous act of grace; but a rea≈øon exciting it, is ≈øuppo≈øed to be, ≈øome evidence appearing after the trial, in favour of the criminal, which was judged material; and which the jury on the trial certified, would, if it had been adduced, have altered the verdict, from murder, to man-≈ølaughter.</hi>

            <p>HE who <hi>made</hi> all things, is GOD. To whom do we owe our <hi>obedience,</hi> but to him who gave us <hi>being?</hi> From whom mu≈øt we derive <hi>happine≈øs,</hi> but from <hi>him,</hi> who placed Man in a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> State? That Man, as he came out of the forming hands of GOD, was holy, and con≈øequently happy, the ≈øcriptures inform us.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024540_0006_0FC7B05E3ADC5C00"/>
That the ca≈øe is now, with us, <hi>far otherwi≈øe,</hi> we may ≈øee by ≈øad experience, as well as are told in the word of GOD, The ≈øame revelation teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us the fatal cau≈øe of ≈øo generally calamitous a ≈øtate.‚Äî<hi>By the ≈øin of man.</hi> 
               <q>By one man ≈øin entered into the world, and death by ≈øin; and ≈øo death pa≈ø≈øed upon all men, for that all have ≈øinned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ON this occa≈øion, <hi>mercy</hi> triumphed, GOD, moved with pity toward us, to the glory of his wi≈ødom and grace, provided a way for our relief; and gave a promi≈øe of a Saviour, who ≈øhould be "the ≈øeed of the woman," and being <hi>the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Per≈øon,</hi> God <hi>with us,</hi> the SON of GOD in human nature, ≈øhould open to man a door of <hi>hope,</hi> the way of return to GOD and happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>HE was long foretold by the prophets.‚ÄîAt length the promi≈øed Saviour appears: But in a very different <hi>manner</hi> from what was generally expected by the Jews. They being in ≈øubjection to the Romans, and entertaining high notions of "the Me≈ø≈øiah" promi≈øed, looked for him as a <hi>temporal</hi> Prince and Saviour, to deliver them from <hi>that</hi> bondage; little con≈øidering their need of him as a Saviour from the <hi>wor≈øt</hi> of bondage, from ≈øin, guilt, and its dreadful con≈øequence, eternal death. Too many, like them, would rejoice at
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024540_0007_0FC7B05F2CB12980"/>
the news of a Saviour and deliverer from the evils and ≈øufferings of <hi>this</hi> life, and <hi>temporal</hi> death; but ≈øee not their <hi>need</hi> of one, to re≈øcue them from more <hi>fatal</hi> evils‚Äîfrom the power of ≈øin, and Satan, and from death eternal. But the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> gave him the name of JESUS, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, "becau≈øe he ≈øhould <hi>≈øave his people</hi> from their ≈øins."</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>mi≈øtaken</hi> notion, however, infected the nation in general. Even the cho≈øen di≈øciples were not free from it. As "two of them walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed" together on "the third day" after his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, and JESUS joined their company, (he being ri≈øen) "they were talking" of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy event of his death, as it appeared to them; and they ≈øaid to him, "We tru≈øted it had been he, who ≈øhould have "redeemed I≈ørael." In the evening of the ≈øame day, when the di≈øciples were "a≈ø≈øembled together," he came and "≈øtood in the mid≈øt, and ≈øaid, <q>Peace be unto you: But they were terrified and affrighted; and ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed they had ≈øeen a ≈øpirit: But he ≈øhewed them his hands and his feet,</q> which were wounded on "the cro≈øs;" yet they were hardly per≈øuaded that it was <hi>he.</hi> 
               <q>And he ≈øaid unto them, The≈øe are the words which I ≈øpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you while I was yet with you, that all things
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024540_0008_0FC7B06133C65178"/>
mu≈øt be fulfilled which were written in the law of Mo≈øes, &amp; in the prophets, and in the p≈øalms concerning me: Then opened he their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that they might under≈øtand the ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And ≈øaid unto them</q> (as in our text) <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behaved CHRIST to ≈øuffer, and to ri≈øe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins ≈øhould be preached in his name, among all nations; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jeru≈øalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we find CHRIST him≈øelf explaining to <hi>them</hi> and to <hi>us</hi> the whole my≈øtery and nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of his incarnation, death and re≈øurrection; and preaching to ≈øinners, <hi>repentance and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, in his name</hi>‚Äîthat, in that very <hi>way</hi> by which the di≈øciples were ≈øo much ≈øtumbled, and which was ≈øo contrary to <hi>human</hi> wi≈ødom, and the general expectation of the <hi>favored</hi> people of I≈ørael, he was to bring <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> to men. The very mention of which, methinks, if rightly con≈øidered, is enough to melt down the harde≈øt heart, and to ≈øoften it to compliance; <hi>Thus it behoved CHRIST to ≈øuffer, and to ri≈øe from the dead the third day,</hi> with this expre≈øs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign, <hi>that repentance and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins ≈øhould be preached in his name,</hi> and that ≈øo exten≈øively, <hi>among all nations, beginning at Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the

≈øcene of his ≈øufferings, and to them by whom he had been ≈øo lately, ≈øo cruelly treated and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Behold the extent and degree of his compa≈ø≈øion! And what relief is here for the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; guilty, undone and helple≈øs! Let the crowd of ideas of ≈øin, guilt, ruin and the ample reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy provided, deeply affect us, while we proceed to con≈øider,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>The foundation and encouragement for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and forgivene≈øs of ≈øins, from the death and re≈øurrection of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>The nature and nece≈ø≈øity of repentance.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>THE <hi>fir≈øt</hi> law, the law of <hi>nature,</hi> gave no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it.‚ÄîThat GOD ≈øhould <hi>require our obedience,</hi> he thought right and ≈øit.

            <p>Now, the covenant which man was placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at his creation, required, as was mo≈øt ≈øit and ≈øuitable for the holy GOD to require, a perfect obedience of him <hi>per≈øonally</hi> as the condition of <hi>life.</hi> A <hi>threatening,</hi> to deter him, was annexed to the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the law, in which the <hi>promi≈øe</hi> of it was implied; a threatening adapted to his ≈øituation, as <hi>living happy</hi> in GOD's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and favor; even <hi>death,</hi> implying the lo≈øs of that happy life and a ≈øen≈øe of it, and together therewith, a ≈øen≈øe of the di≈øplea≈øure of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whom he offended.

            <p>MAN di≈øobeyed; and <hi>death</hi> was the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.

This is but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ≈øorrows, an anticipation in part, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta≈øte of that "<hi>death,</hi>" which "is the wages of ≈øin."

            <p>IN the covenant of <hi>works</hi> there was no <hi>room</hi> for repentance; no condition on which pardon might be obtained, if man ≈øinned; nor provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion for any relief.

The <hi>go≈øpel</hi> brings us <hi>good news, glad tidings</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> for the rebellious, upon their repentance; that <hi>≈øinners may repent,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting may be <hi>forgiven;</hi> and if forgiven, then received to the <hi>favor</hi> of their offended Creator, and be <hi>happy</hi> in him, and with him for ever.

grace,</hi> provides for this. Nothing but <hi>free</hi> and <hi>≈øovereign</hi> grace could provide relief, or give any ground of <hi>hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE text informs us of the <hi>way</hi> in which it is brought about, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of JESUS CHRIST. The ≈øinner, as he could ≈øee no <hi>room</hi> for repentance, or <hi>way</hi> to e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, ≈øo he could have no <hi>power</hi> or <hi>di≈øpo≈øition of heart</hi> to repent or <hi>hope</hi> for forgivene≈øs. Divine wi≈ødom and grace contrived a plan, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the mediation and ≈øacrifice of JESUS CHRIST. To "deliver us from going down to the pit" of eternal death. GOD " has found a ran≈øom:" The <hi>death</hi> of CHRIST is <hi>the ran≈øom;</hi> and his re≈øurrection from the dead te≈øtifies its ≈øufficiency, and acceptablene≈øs with GOD on <hi>our</hi> behalf. This lays the <hi>foundation of encouragement</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and hope for the forgivene≈øs of ≈øin.</p>
            <p>THIS was <hi>nece≈ø≈øary.</hi> GOD did not ≈øee it <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>≈øuitable,</hi> though his <hi>mercy</hi> is <hi>≈øo great,</hi> to give his holy SPIRIT to work in ≈øinners a di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repent, and in a meer <hi>Sovereign</hi> way to pardon their ≈øins, without a ≈øatisfaction; ≈øo great is the <hi>evil</hi> of ≈øin, and the <hi>di≈øhonor</hi> it ca≈øts on him and his government; as it ≈øtrikes at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all moral obligation, and even aims to ca≈øt GOD out of his throne.

honored, which is thereby violated, and ju≈øtice ≈øatisfied.</p>
            <p>THE covenant of <hi>redemption,</hi> which is to us the covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> provides that this be done by a <hi>≈øurety;</hi> and that the SON of GOD be the per≈øon; that in order thereto, he take <hi>our nature</hi> and become <hi>man</hi>‚Äîbe made under the law which we had broken, and be made a <hi>cur≈øe</hi> for us, by ≈øuffering the <hi>accur≈øed death</hi> of the cro≈øs; that we might be freed from the cur≈øe.

WHICH brings us to con≈øider,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The nature and nece≈ø≈øity of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the work of a <hi>≈øinner.</hi> Before man ≈øinned, he was required to obey the law and keep all the commandments of GOD. But <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> was no part of his religion.‚ÄîBut ≈øince the <hi>fall,</hi> it is nece≈ø≈øary; and no religion can be accepted without it. It is the <hi>proper</hi> work of a ≈øinner: His <hi>character calls</hi> for it, and makes it <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary.</hi> If there were any <hi>without ≈øin,</hi> they would have no <hi>occa≈øion</hi> for Repentance: <q>But now, GOD commandeth all men every where to repent.</q> Sin gives <hi>cau≈øe</hi> for Repentance. It occa≈øions <hi>≈øorrow of heart,</hi> when rightly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as brings the ≈øorrow of <hi>≈øuffering.</hi> When it is a <q>godly ≈øorrow, it worketh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Salvation; not to be repented of: but the ≈øorrow of the world,</q> or that which is merely of a worldly nature, "worketh death."</p>
            <p>A di≈øtinction therefore is nece≈ø≈øary. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance implies in its nature <hi>conviction</hi> of ≈øin‚Äîan <hi>afflictive</hi> ≈øen≈øe and <hi>heart-aching</hi> for it. But not <hi>merely</hi> a conviction, as having done evil, and <hi>di≈øtre≈øs</hi> of mind ari≈øing therefrom: So, <q>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed</q> his Lord <q>repented him≈øelf, ≈øaying, I have ≈øinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood:‚ÄîAnd he ca≈øt down the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024540_0016_0FC7B085A6362290"/>
pieces of ≈øilver in the temple, and departed and went and hanged him≈øelf:</q> Such was his <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>de≈øpair.</hi> But, this was not the <hi>Repentance</hi> to which there is a promi≈øe of <hi>remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"REPENTANCE is a ≈øaving grace, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary mean of attaining life and Salvation," wrought by the SPIRIT of GOD in the heart; which is a <hi>further</hi> operation of the SPIRIT, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>conviction</hi> of ≈øin; imparting a ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>evil</hi> of it, as again≈øt GOD. The hearts of all per≈øons, by nature, are <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>in≈øen≈øible</hi> of ≈øin; not only as to its <hi>moral</hi> evil, but its <hi>ill de≈øert.</hi>‚ÄîThe SPIRIT of GOD, who≈øe operations are the effect of CHRIST's purcha≈øe, a≈ø≈øi≈øting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural con≈øcience to do its office, "convinces of ≈øin," and awakens to a <hi>concern</hi> for their ≈øafety. This may be <hi>preparatory</hi> to <hi>true</hi> repentance. So that he who has not had a real <hi>conviction</hi> of ≈øin and guilt, and been awakened to a <hi>deep concern</hi> "what he ≈øhall do to be ≈øaved," has not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he is yet blind and hardened.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>true repentance</hi> there is a <hi>clearer conviction</hi> of ≈øin‚Äîit di≈øcovers its <hi>evil nature,</hi> as again≈øt GOD; and ≈øo ≈øets the <hi>guilt</hi> of it in a ju≈øter light; even the guilt of the lea≈øt ≈øin appears great. It appears <hi>≈øo great an evil</hi> to ≈øin again≈øt GOD at all, as to de≈øerve his wrath for ever: So that he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024540_0017_0FC7B086F128EE30"/>
would be <hi>ju≈øt</hi> to ca≈øt him off eternally; not only for the more open gro≈øs ≈øins of his life, which are ju≈øtly dete≈øtable in the eyes of the civilized world; but for ≈øecret ≈øins, ≈øins of heart, and its unlikene≈øs and oppo≈øition to GOD, the ≈øin of <hi>nature</hi> as well as practice, ≈øins of omi≈ø≈øion as well as commi≈ø≈øion: For he ≈øees that he has to deal with a heart-≈øearching GOD, "who ≈øeeth not as man ≈øeeth."‚ÄîSome particular <hi>gro≈øs</hi> act of ≈øin, and tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of the law of GOD, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the <hi>leading</hi> cau≈øe or occa≈øion of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of mind: But, in <hi>evangelical</hi> repentance, the ≈øin of unbelief, and contempt of CHRIST, and his go≈øpel‚Äîhis ingratitude for and abu≈øe of the goodne≈øs and love of GOD, in providing a Saviour, and of CHRIST, the compa≈ø≈øionate Redeemer; and his re≈øi≈øting, and ≈øtifling the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the SPIRIT of grace;‚Äîhis blindne≈øs of mind, his ≈øtupidity and in≈øen≈øibility of the things of GOD, deeply affect his heart. The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his heart, and the corruption of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, con≈øidered as the <hi>fountain</hi> of ≈øin in the <hi>outward</hi> act, excite bitter groanings; and cau≈øe him to feel the propriety of and adopt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the apo≈øtle Paul, <q>O wretched man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this death;</q> this deadly body or ma≈øs of ≈øin!</p>

INDEED the true penitent is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>mourns</hi> that he is a <hi>≈øinner,</hi> and that by ≈øin he has <hi>di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored</hi> GOD, and <hi>polluted</hi> his own ≈øoul; whereby he is rendered <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> in the ≈øight of a holy GOD.

≈øay, "We lie down in our ≈øhame, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion covereth us:" as being a≈øhamed to lift up our heads before GOD, or look up, "for we have ≈øinned again≈øt the LORD our GOD."</p>
            <p>CONFESSION of ≈øin, is the part of a penitent; a duty encumbent upon him, as a mark of the penitence of his heart, and a vi≈øible renunciation of ≈øin. When "John preached the bapti≈øm of repentance, for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins," they that "were baptized of him" in token of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, "confe≈ø≈øed their ≈øins." Not that there is any propriety that people ≈øhould lay open their <hi>≈øecret</hi> ≈øins before the world: But three things may be implied, <abbr>viz.</abbr>. I. Confe≈ø≈øion of all our ≈øins, that we are con≈øcious of, to GOD.‚ÄîThus, the P≈øalmi≈øt profe≈ø≈øed that he did and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived forgivene≈øs, P≈ø. 32, 5. <q>I acknowledged my ≈øin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I ≈øaid, I will confe≈øs my tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions unto the LORD; and thou forgave≈øt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ≈øin.</q>‚ÄîIf we attempt to <hi>hide</hi> our ≈øins from GOD, or, if we do not confe≈øs them to him, we cannot expect a pardon from him.

He that covereth his ≈øins, ≈øhall not <q>pro≈øper; but who≈øo confe≈ø≈øeth and for≈øaketh them, ≈øhall have mercy.</q> 2. Confe≈ø≈øion, to

               <hi>injured</hi> per≈øons in particular, if opportunity can be had, is nece≈ø≈øary, in token of repentance, with de≈øire of <hi>their</hi> forgivene≈øs‚ÄîAlthough none but GOD can <hi>forgive</hi> ≈øins, or <hi>di≈øcharge</hi> from guilt and puni≈øhment; yet, where an offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again≈øt one or more of our <hi>fellow-men,</hi> the lea≈øt we can do to repair the injury, is, <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> our fault with penitence, as we would hope for forgivene≈øs from GOD; again≈øt whom, all ≈øin is ultimately committed. 3. There ought to be <hi>public confe≈ø≈øion,</hi> where the offence is of a <hi>public nature;</hi> and e≈øpecially <hi>again≈øt</hi> the public. A great part of the <hi>evil</hi> of ≈øin which is of a public nature, lies in the evil <hi>example</hi> of it, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the hurtful, dangerous <hi>tendency</hi> of it, to the ≈øociety; which makes it nece≈ø≈øary that <hi>public te≈øtimony</hi> be borne again≈øt it: And, when any per≈øon has openly tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed, or committed an overt-act of offence again≈øt the State, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, he ought to do all in his power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bad tendency and prevent the pernicious effects of his crime, to the public; by confe≈ø≈øing it; and profe≈ø≈øing his ≈øen≈øe of the <hi>evil</hi> of it; and <hi>deep ≈øorrow</hi> for it; which will be al≈øo to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD: As <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi> told <hi>Achan,</hi> 
               <q>My ≈øon, give I pray thee, glory to the LORD GOD of I≈ørael, and make confe≈ø≈øion unto him.</q>

before the people, Jo≈øh vii, 19. This would be to the glory of his ju≈øtice, and in a mea≈øure ≈øecure the honor of his government.</p>
            <p>SORROW of heart is an attendant of this grief, and mourning for ≈øin and confe≈ø≈øion of it. As the penitent is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>mourns,</hi> ≈øo he is <hi>≈øorry</hi> from his heart for the <hi>di≈øhonor</hi> that he has done to GOD, by his ≈øins; and the <hi>offence</hi> given him: For this rea≈øon, e≈øpecially, he is ready to ≈øay, "O that I never had committed them;" more than for any trouble brought on him≈øelf thereby.</p>
            <p>HUMILIATION before GOD, and <hi>brokene≈øs of heart</hi> for ≈øin is another attendant of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He is brought down from all high thoughts of him≈øelf, of his own worthine≈øs and goodne≈øs. His proud, ≈øtubborn ≈øpirit is broken; which before was "as a bullock unaccu≈øtomed to the yoke," and he is brought to ≈øubmit to GOD's government, as ju≈øt and right. He lies low, as it were at GOD's foot≈øtool, ≈øen≈øible of his de≈øert of his dreadful di≈øplea≈øure; and that he is ju≈øt in his threatenings, and would be ≈øo in his damnation; and therefore that his only hope is in his mercy. However great di≈øtre≈øs and horror of con≈øcience the legal penitent may feel for ≈øin, he is not <hi>humbled:</hi> He continues as proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and ≈øtubborn, as oppo≈øite to GOD in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024540_0022_0FC7B09BEAD0CCD8"/>
the temper of his mind as ever, and as unwilling to ≈øubmit to the divine government‚Äîhas no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his glory, but only to his own ea≈øe and ≈øafety.</p>
            <p>THE true penitent thus humbled, ca≈øts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, at the feet of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> GOD, as one de≈øerving death and damnation, having nothing to plead but <hi>free grace.</hi> In which ca≈øe, the way is opened for his compliance with the <hi>go≈øpel;</hi> the <hi>≈øcope</hi> and <hi>de≈øign</hi> of which are to aba≈øe the pride of man, and exalt the glory of GOD: Wherein his ju≈øtice is a≈ø≈øerted, the honor of his government ≈øecured, and mercy exerci≈øed to the ≈øinner, penitent and believing in the atonement and righteou≈øne≈øs of JESUS CHRIST, which alone give relief and comfort. Therefore,</p>
            <p>TRUE go≈øpel-repentance includes <hi>an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben≈øion of the mercy of GOD, in CHRIST, and faith in this great Redeemer:</hi> This nece≈ø≈øarily belongs to its nature.

The free mercy of GOD in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Saviour,‚Äîthe mediation of CHRIST‚Äîhis perfect obedience to the Divine law, and his ≈øufferings and death upon the cro≈øs, afford the only encouragement to a ≈øinner to think of returning to GOD, to a≈øk and hope for a pardon of his ≈øins, and for favor with his offended Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and a principal mean of ≈øoftening the heart of a rebel to a compliance with the offer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. As the law of GOD pronounces a cur≈øe in po≈øitive terms upon him that fails of fulfilling it, the ≈øinner mu≈øt have ≈øo remained under the ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, &amp; in hardened oppo≈øition again≈øt GOD, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs ≈øoftened by the <hi>emollients of grace.</hi> The <hi>te≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> of GOD in his word, of CHRIST be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our ≈øurety, bearing our ≈øins on the cro≈øs, paying our debt of ≈øuffering, and procuring a righteou≈øne≈øs for our ju≈øtification, <hi>i.e. </hi> for all that embrace him, being received by <hi>faith,</hi> is this ble≈ø≈øed <hi>≈øoftening remedy,</hi> that draws, that wins, that gains the heart of a ≈øinner; that otherwi≈øe would dread and ≈øhun with aver≈øion the pre≈øence of GOD‚Äîthat cau≈øe him to relent, to repent of his ≈øins and oppo≈øition again≈øt him, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thankfully, and obediently to return to him, in the name of and with faith in this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

all-≈øufficient Saviour, and with hope in the mercy of GOD. Which faith, implies not only an a≈ø≈øent of the mind, to the truth of the go≈øpel, but a con≈øent of the heart and will, to this way of Salvation; and a cordial receiving of and tru≈øting in this great Redeemer, his atonement and righteou≈øne≈øs, for pardon, acceptance to the favor of GOD, grace for ≈øanctification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation, and eternal life. Thus, <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> when either is true and genuine, are in≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united; and "repentance," thus connected with faith, is "unto Salvation," "and not to be repented of;" but is followed with the joy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>I WOULD briefly add, as a <hi>mark</hi> of go≈øpel-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that it is accompanied and followed with <hi>hatred</hi> of ≈øin, re≈øolution of heart again≈øt and for≈øaking it in practice, and turning to the LORD in new obedience. The true penitent, it appears from this view of the ≈øubject, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences and e≈ø≈øential change of mind, and change of heart. All the powers of his mind are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their former bias; ≈øin is imbittered, a fixed <hi>hatred</hi> of all ≈øin ari≈øes in the heart; ≈øo that he becomes an irreconcileable enemy to it, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from and degree; even when his ≈øen≈øible grief, ≈øorrow and mourning for it is a≈ø≈øuaged

and abated, by the comforts of the holy GHOST, and ≈øen≈øe of pardon: His <hi>hatred</hi> of ≈øin ari≈øes from a view of its <hi>evil nature,</hi> and contrariety to GOD and his law, and continues and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes in proportion to his experiences of his grace and manife≈øtations of his love. The ≈øame view and ≈øen≈øe of ≈øin, will influence him to <hi>turn</hi> from it; as it is natural to <hi>fly</hi> from that which we <hi>hate:</hi> He therefore for≈øakes ≈øin, &amp; turns to the LORD; he is made willing to ≈øubmit to his government, and to give up him≈øelf to him in an everla≈øting covenant, never to be forgotten; re≈øigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to him and his di≈øpo≈øal, in life, and death, and to all eternity. As he before "walked contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to GOD, after the imagination of his own heart," he now "walks with GOD," in faith and love, <q>with purpo≈øe of heart cleaves to the LORD,</q> and <q>brings forth fruit meet for repentance; being made free from ≈øin," as to its dominion, and become a ≈øervant to GOD, he has his fruit unto holine≈øs, and his end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verla≈øting life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, we may ob≈øerve, repentance is <hi>nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of things, as it is a laying down the weapons of rebellion again≈øt GOD, and a ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to his government in CHRIST, the mediator and "king whom he hath ≈øet in Zion:"

and as it is made the <hi>condition</hi> of the be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pardon to the ≈øinner, by the <hi>con≈øtitution</hi> of the go≈øpel; as will further appear. Though it does not <hi>merit</hi> any favor from GOD, it is mo≈øt fit and ≈øuitable, as a <hi>condition</hi> of pardon being granted to the offender, and his being admitted as a meet ≈øubject of his kingdom of grace, in this world, and an heir of the kingdom of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Without which, it is impo≈ø≈øible that he ≈øhould reli≈øh the joys of heaven, or ever be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there; for, "without holine≈øs no man ≈øhall ≈øee the LORD."

            <p>III. To ob≈øerve the <hi>connexion of forgivene≈øs, in the name and for the ≈øake of CHRIST, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have ≈øeen that there is <hi>provi≈øion</hi> made in the covenant of grace, for the repentance of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that he that repents ≈øhould be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: CHRIST has purcha≈øed this favor‚Äîhas prepared the <hi>way</hi> for the honorable exerci≈øe of mercy to ≈øinners, being <q>≈øet forth of GOD to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou≈øne≈øs for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins‚Äîthat he might be ju≈øt;</q> ju≈øt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, his law and government, <q>and the ju≈øtifier of him which believeth in JESUS.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT GOD hath con≈øtituted a certain and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024540_0027_0FC7B0B7B772D6E8"/>
unfailing connexion between <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins,</hi> appears from the text; when the Saviour declares, that for this end, CHRIST <hi>≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and ro≈øe from the dead the third day; that repentance,</hi> as the condition, <hi>and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins,</hi> as the happy con≈øequence, <hi>≈øhould,</hi> (or might) <hi>be preached in his name;</hi> and al≈øo, from the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his apo≈øtles, that in con≈øequence of his ≈øufferings on the cro≈øs, <q>GOD hath exalted him with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; to give both repentance and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øins.</q> This is the gracious condition in the covenant, which is ≈øealed by the blood of CHRIST; that, the ≈øinner that repents, ≈øhall freely and fully forgiven all his ≈øins.

So that it appears to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024540_0028_0FC7B0B968831418"/>
               <hi>decree of heaven,</hi> that, the ≈øinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, ≈øhall be forgiven; and, being forgiven, ≈øhall be received to the favor of his Creator, and become an heir of eternal life.</p>
            <p>THIS mercy is granted to ≈øinners <hi>in the name</hi> and <hi>for the ≈øake</hi> of CHRIST, and in no <hi>other</hi> way. This is the "foundation-≈øtone, the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-≈øtone" of the foundation of the ≈øinner's hope of pardon and life eternal. <q>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we mu≈øt be ≈øaved.</q> As it was te≈øtified by the law of Mo≈øes, by the ≈øacrifices and rites of that di≈øpen≈øation, that <q>without ≈øhedding of blood is no remi≈ø≈øion;</q> ≈øo, <q>now, once in the end of the world, hath CHRIST appeared to put away ≈øin, by the ≈øacrifice of him≈øelf.</q> And <q>to him gave all the prophets witne≈øs, that through his name, who≈øoever believeth in him, ≈øhall receive remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins.</q> The true <hi>penitent,</hi> therefore, having <hi>a believing</hi> re≈øpect to the atonement of CHRIST, receives the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givene≈øs of his ≈øins <hi>in his name,</hi> and <hi>for the ≈øake</hi> of his ≈øufferings and death on the cro≈øs, for the ≈øins of men. Repentance is not the <hi>meritorious</hi> cau≈øe of forgivene≈øs, nor yet is any other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in us: But it is wholly a≈øcribed to the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024540_0029_0FC7B0C282E04078"/>
merit of the blood or ≈øufferings and death of the Son of GOD; which is ≈øufficient for that purpo≈øe, for <hi>any,</hi> and for <hi>all</hi> the human race; So that whoever of "all nations," ages and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions does truly repent, may be a≈ø≈øured by the word of GOD, of the remi≈ø≈øion of his ≈øins, in the name and for the ≈øake of CHRIST; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with <hi>faith</hi> in him, as, it implies, not merely <hi>a≈øking</hi> for mercy and forgivene≈øs in his name, but receiving him, and relying on his infinite atonement. For this end he <hi>≈øuffered,</hi> that repentance and remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins ≈øhould be preached in his name, <hi>among all nations, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jeru≈øalem,</hi> the ≈øence of his ≈øufferings:‚Äîto the very <hi>people</hi> and <hi>per≈øons</hi> who had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of the horrid crime of the murder of the SON of GOD. By which is held up the idea of the infinite merit of his death, and of the riches of GOD's grace, with the freene≈øs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the greate≈øt offenders; as well as, that it is his will, that pardon ≈øhould be <hi>fir≈øt</hi> offered to a <hi>covenanted</hi> people, who have revolted from him, and that <hi>back≈øliders</hi> ≈øhould be called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and be a≈ø≈øured of forgivene≈øs, upon their repentance; <q>though their ≈øins be as ≈øcarlet, and though they be red like crim≈øon,</q> ever ≈øo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated and heinous; to ≈øhew them that GOD
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024540_0030_0FC7B0C5C90B98F8"/>
is mindful of <hi>his</hi> covenant, however they act unworthy of <hi>their's,</hi> and al≈øo, that GOD, in the be≈øtowment of mercy to ≈øinners, deals with them in the way of a <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> by which they are brought <hi>nigh</hi> to him;‚Äîrepentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins was to be preached in his name, <hi>among all nations,</hi> but <hi>beginning at Jeru≈øalem.</hi> So that upon the whole it appears, that how great ≈øoever, or numerous or aggravated his ≈øins are, that can be <hi>no bar</hi> in the way of forgivene≈øs, to the per≈øon that repents, with faith in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy, through CHRIST; they cannot exceed his merits, or the mercy of GOD in him toward ≈øinners.</p>
            <p>THE rea≈øon why any <hi>de≈øpair,</hi> is not that their ≈øins are <hi>too great to be forgiven,</hi> nor yet that they have a <hi>greater ≈øen≈øe</hi> of them, or of their aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than the <hi>true penitent</hi> that finds mercy, but, that they <hi>reject the atonement</hi> of CHRIST, the only <hi>way</hi> to obtain mercy and forgivene≈øs. The <hi>true penitent,</hi> is ready to think him≈øelf to be the <hi>wor≈øt</hi> of ≈øinners, becau≈øe he ≈øees more of <hi>him≈øelf,</hi> and of his ≈øins, than of any others; but yet he <hi>does not de≈øpair.</hi> Indeed he <hi>does de≈øpair</hi> in any <hi>other</hi> way, but <hi>one</hi>‚Äîbut in the view and belief of that which GOD has provided, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of CHRIST; which is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024540_0031_0FC7B0C93582DA40"/>
of his comfort and hope. The mercy of GOD, <hi>in him</hi> and his all-perfect <hi>atonement</hi> and <hi>righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> are all his ≈øupport: Take this away, and the <hi>lea≈øt</hi> ≈øin would ≈øhut him up under ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting de≈øpair: But, while this foundation which GOD hath laid, remains, though he may at times, greatly doubt and fear, yet, his faith and hope will not utterly fail him. One ≈øin, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, is enough to damn the ≈øoul, eternally: For, though every ≈øin may not particularly be recollected in repentance; yet, <hi>all ≈øin, as ≈øin, ≈øo far</hi> as it is known, the oppo≈øition of nature and practice to GOD, mu≈øt be repented of. And, whoever truly repents, with apprehen≈øion of the mercy of GOD, as it is exerci≈øed in and through the <hi>mediator</hi> need never de≈øpair; let his ≈øins be ever ≈øo great, or numerous, or aggravated; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too great to be forgiven, in this way; they cannot be more than <hi>infinite:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cannot exceed the merit of the atonement and ≈øatisfaction of CHRIST; which is <hi>infinite:</hi> and mu≈øt therefore be ≈øufficient to cancel the guilt of all ≈øin. Yea, it is not only <hi>≈øufficient</hi> for that purpo≈øe, but infinitely <hi>free</hi> for the greate≈øt ≈øinners; not only for <hi>≈øome</hi> but for <hi>any</hi> for all, who≈øoever will with "the prodigal return to the father" of all, and <hi>penitently a≈øk</hi> for mercy: For there
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024540_0032_0FC7B0CBE2BBFF90"/>
there is "joy in heaven over one ≈øinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents," ≈øo peculiarly is GOD plea≈øed with it, <q>more than over ninety and nine ju≈øt per≈øons that need no repentance,</q> if any ≈øuch there were; "becau≈øe he delighteth in mercy."‚ÄîBut, enough has been ≈øaid to ≈øhew the unfailing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of forgivene≈øs, in the name and for the ≈øake of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>with repentance.</hi>

               <hi>SOLEMN, intere≈øting, and affecting have been the ≈øcenes, which have pa≈ø≈øed before you, within the≈øe ≈øacred walls. You have ≈øeen the human judgment ≈øet, and the books opened. You have ≈øeen a fellow-mortal arraigned at the Bar, indicted for murder, the murder of his friend and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, convicted upon the indictment, by the judgment of his peers. You have heard the ≈øentence of death pronounced, in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn and affecting manner, while every heart ≈øhuddered, and every eye wept. You have ≈øeen the unhappy Pri≈øoner, wearing the badges of his guilt, from ≈øabbath to ≈øabbath pre≈øented to wor≈øhip before GOD, with the expectation that the ≈øentence would ≈øoon be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the pro≈øpect of ≈øuch woe has been too great for him to bear; it has deranged his intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual faculties, and pre≈øents him to us, in another view, an object of pity and compa≈ø≈øion. A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this morning to improve the≈øe Providences, and to ≈øeek wi≈ødom and grace from him, who gives liberally and upbraids not, our ears have been ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the voice of pardon; we have ≈øeen the grace re≈øerved in the bo≈øom of our Con≈øtitution called into exerci≈øe, the ≈øhackles knocked off, and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024540_0047_0FC7B1052FDE6118"/>
the Pri≈øoner ≈øet at liberty. While we congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late our≈øelves, and one another, that the ≈øolemn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this week is by this grace prevented, let us direct our meditations to the judgment that is to come, and, from an earthly tribunal, a≈øcend to that which is above, where we mu≈øt be arraigned, and receive a decided ≈øentence. The words that are cho≈øen as a motto to this di≈øcour≈øe are in the</hi> Epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of JUDE, the latter part of the ≈øixth ver≈øe.
<q>THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT DAY.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE <hi>is a ≈øpirit in man, and the in≈øpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty giveth him under≈øtanding.</hi> We are made capable of reflecting upon events that are pa≈øt, and of reviewing the way in which we have walked. We are al≈øo capable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating events certainly future, of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating ≈øcenes in which we mu≈øt be actors, and of con≈øidering what manner of per≈øons we ought to be. In the due exerci≈øe of the≈øe faculties, con≈øi≈øts much of our duty, our wi≈ødom, and our happine≈øs.</p>
            <p>AMONG events that are future, the mo≈øt ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and intere≈øting, are DEATH and JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:024540_0048_0FC7B106680BF7E8"/>
IN the found human mind, there is no doubt, I believe, of the futurition of the≈øe events. We ≈øee that death pa≈ø≈øes upon all men. We feel the ≈øentence in our≈øelves; and we mu≈øt be ≈øtrangely inattentive, if we are not convinced, that <hi>the days approach that we mu≈øt die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DEATH would not be ≈øo intere≈øtingly ≈øolemn and important, were it not for the judgment that follows, and the eternity that ≈øucceeds. If death put a period to our being, if all con≈øciou≈øne≈øs cea≈øed with the la≈øt ga≈øp of life, though, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted as we are, we could not but ≈øtartle at <hi>this</hi> de≈øtruction, yet it would be our duty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or brave the great event, and indulge our heart in all its joys: But the ≈øtroke that returns the body to the du≈øt, returns the immortal ≈øpirit to GOD who gave it, from him to receive a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ≈øentence, according to its true character, and the deeds done in the body.</p>
            <p>DIVINE impre≈ø≈øions cannot be wholly era≈øed;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>There's a divinity that ≈øtirs within us,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>That trembles at futurity,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And intimates eternity to man.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Con≈øcience, the vicegerent of heaven in the human brea≈øt, though it may be benumbed by infidelity, ≈øtupified by ≈øen≈øuality, and have its ordinary voice drowned in carnal plea≈øures, will ≈øometimes a≈ø≈øert its dignity, arre≈øt the ≈øinner,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024540_0049_0FC7B109333E9F30"/>
and place him, trembling at the bar of GOD. There has been no nation ≈øo barbarous as not to acknowledge the being of a GOD; neither has there been any ≈øo incon≈øi≈øtent, as, with this acknowledgment, to deny him the right of governing and judging the creatures he has made, according to their capacities and de≈øerts. But it is not my de≈øign to offer proofs of a day of Judgment, GOD has written it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every man's con≈øcience, <hi>and given a≈ø≈øurance unto all men in that he hath rai≈øed JESUS CHRIST from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My de≈øign is, to meditate a little upon the greatne≈øs of this day‚ÄîTo contemplate it with reference to our intere≈øt in it‚Äîand endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ≈øuch an improvement as may be profitable to us.</p>
            <p>WHILE I am ≈øpeaking, may that GOD, at who≈øe tribunal we mu≈øt appear, ≈øolemnize our minds, aid our meditations, and ≈øo realize to our view, the things we contemplate, that they may have a powerful practical influence upon us, and in≈øtrumentally prepare us to meet our JUDGE, "when he ≈øhall come to be gorified in his ≈øaints, and to be admired in all them that believe."</p>
            <p>THE ≈øoul, at death, returns to GOD who gave it, and there is, doubtle≈øs, ≈øomething like
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024540_0050_0FC7B10BE237B848"/>
a ≈øentence, upon every ≈øoul, immediately after its departure from the body; or a ≈øecret con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousne≈øs determines it to the place for which it is ≈øubjectively prepared. There is no intermediate ≈øtate, or ≈øea≈øon of in≈øen≈øibility, between death &amp; the re≈øurrection, which would be a cha≈øm in ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exi≈øtence; GOD, who is ≈øtill the GOD of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, I≈øaac, and Jacob, is not the GOD of the dead; but of the living.</hi> The expiring SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR ≈øaid to the expiring thief‚Äî<hi>This day ≈øhalt thou be with me in Paradi≈øe.</hi> In the parable, which is given us for in≈øtruction upon this ≈øubject, it is ≈øaid‚Äî<hi>The beggar died, and was carried by Angels into Abraham's bo≈øom. The rich man al≈øo died, and was buried: and in hell lift up his eyes, being in torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ≈øtate of happine≈øs of mi≈øery, with every individual ≈øoul, commences at death: but in the end of time, when all the purpo≈øes of infinite wi≈ødom, as to this world, are accompli≈øhed, and the pre≈øent frame of things is di≈ø≈øolved, there will then be a day of general Judgment. Then will be exhibited all that is de≈øcribed in the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pages, GOD will erect his tribunal, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his glory, and ≈øummon all his rational offspring to appear before him. This is, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, <hi>the day of Judgment,</hi> and is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024540_0051_0FC7B1130307C5A8"/>
tended in the text. It may be thought, that the nece≈ø≈øity of this day of general judgment is ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øeded, if there is this particular prior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the day of death. Were the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the day of Judgment, to decide the fate of rational creatures, the thought would be ju≈øt. But the object of that day is to vindicate the divine admini≈øtration, and ju≈øtify GOD in the deci≈øions he has made; di≈øclo≈øing, to the view of Angels and of men, what GOD has done, and wherefore he has done it: That every mouth may be ≈øtopped, and the <hi>Maje≈øty of Heaven</hi> appear, in this mo≈øt glorious character, <hi>the ju≈øt</hi> GOD, <hi>the</hi> SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>THIS will be, indeed, a great day. All its appendages con≈øpire to make it great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Being, who will then appear, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely great. He is no other than the LORD JESUS CHRIST; who is characterized, in the ≈øacred page, as the <hi>brightne≈øs of the Father's glory, the expre≈øs image of his per≈øon, in whom dwells the fulne≈øs of the godhead bodily.</hi> CHRIST, in him≈øelf, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øes every divine perfection. It is the will of heaven that all men ≈øhould honor the SON, even as they honor the FATHER; <hi>He is over all GOD ble≈ø≈øed for ever.</hi> Once has he appeared in a ≈øtate of humiliation. The

            <p>THE favored Exile of Patmos, had, in vi≈øion, a view of the glory of this divine per≈øonage, and, it was ≈øo overwhelming, he fell at his feet as dead, and, probably, never would have ari≈øen again, had <hi>he</hi> not laid his creating and ≈øupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand upon him, and rai≈øed him up, Rev. i, 13‚ÄîFarther, CHRIST is great with re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the office which he ≈øu≈øtains, and which he will then come to execute.

JESUS CHRIST by faith. See that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the regenerating influences of the HOLY SPIRIT‚Äîa ≈øealed pardon of all your ≈øins, and that you ≈øecure an inheritance, among them that are ≈øanctified. Give not ≈øleep to your eyes, nor ≈ølumber to your eye-lids, 'till you have made ≈øome ≈øerious effort to e≈øcape from hell and fly to heaven.

            <p>WILL you ≈øay the Preacher is warm‚Äîand is there not a cau≈øe? Can I addre≈øs you in the coldne≈øs of ≈øpeculation, when viewing my≈øelf and you on the borders of Eternity? It would be improper to preach my life away in a ≈ømooth moral harangue and entertain you with pretty ≈øentiments when your ≈øouls are at ≈øtake. This would be indeed <hi>to fix pillows under arm-holes, and wrap your blood in my ≈økirts.</hi> You have ≈øeen this our fellow-mortal tried for his life: Did you think his advocates too warm, when their ≈øouls were on fire, and they poured fourth the tide of eloquence to obtain a favorable ≈øentence? It was only his life for which they plead; that which mu≈øt be ≈øoon given up if now it were pre≈øerved. But, my Brethren, your ≈øoul is the object of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,

that precious immortal principle which mu≈øt exi≈øt forever, and unle≈øs you repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in CHRIST, mu≈øt exi≈øt in mi≈øery.

Let me then urge and entreat you, by all that is intere≈øting and important in time and eternity, by the value you ≈øet upon your own ≈øouls, by the mercies of GOD, and the blood of the Cro≈øs, to break off your ≈øins by repentance, and lay hold on eternal life. Fly to the SAVIOUR, and yield your≈øelves up as condemned malefactors, yet hoping in his mercy, that he will forgive your ≈øins, cancel all your guilt, and re≈øcue you from condemnation. If you do, truly, repent, and believe in CHRIST, the pro≈øpect of this day and its intere≈øting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences, will be gloriou≈øly changed; for its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ≈øoften into the mo≈øt plea≈øing ≈øolemnity, in the view and expectation of the a≈ø≈øured chri≈øtian.

by a living faith‚Äîbeing comfortably per≈øuaded of this mighty change, he knows, that there <hi>is no condemnation due unto him.</hi> He ≈øees an infinite fulne≈øs in CHRIST to ≈øecure and defend him, and the pro≈øpect of the Judgment awakens ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in his brea≈øt ≈øimilar to tho≈øe which the SAVIOUR encouraged, when he ≈øaid, <hi>When the≈øe things begin to come to pa≈øs, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi>

            <p>THE a≈ø≈øured believers in CHRIST look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this augu≈øt ≈øea≈øon, as the time of their complete deliverance; when their poor bodies of humiliation, that have long been kept, by the care of heaven, in the bed of death, ≈øhall be rai≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>incorruptible,</hi> be fa≈øhioned like to CHRIST's <hi>glorious body</hi> and being re-united with their alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy glorified ≈øpirits, they ≈øhall be confirmed in happine≈øs, ≈øuited to their natures, and eternal as their duration.‚ÄîThough it does not yet appear what they ≈øhall be, they, neverthele≈øs, know, <hi>that when he who is their life ≈øhall appear, they ≈øhall be like him for they ≈øhall ≈øee him as he is, and ≈øhall appear with him in glory.</hi> The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Archangel, which will be a terror to the wicked, will be mu≈øic in their ears; With tran≈øport they will echo to the≈øe accents from heaven, <hi>Awake and ≈øing ye that dwell in du≈øt.</hi>

ESPECIALLY is the pro≈øpect of this glorious day, ≈øupportingly plea≈øant to the per≈øecuted ≈øaint, who ≈øuffers unju≈øtly from the hands of men.</p>
            <p>MANY of the faithful ≈øervants of GOD have had their judgment taken away, in the pre≈øent life. They have been loaded with reproach which they did not de≈øerve, and hi≈ø≈øed from the ≈øtage where they ought to have been applauded: But in that day GOD <hi>will bring forth their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs as the light, and their judgment as the noon day.</hi> And having in this trying particular had fellow≈øhip with CHRIST, in his ≈øufferings, they will al≈øo have fellow≈øhip with him in his glory. Farther,</p>
            <p>As the glory of GOD is a dear object with the Saints, and their hearts are pained with the reflections that are ca≈øt upon him, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration, they rejoice in the pro≈øpect of that glorious ≈øea≈øon, when all the≈øe reflections ≈øhall be wiped away, with tran≈øport will they hear, and with rapture will they join, in this heavenly Allelujah, <hi>Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power unto the LORD our GOD, for true and righteous are his judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ye believers, ye friends of JESUS‚ÄîThis will be to you a mo≈øt glorious day. The day of your complete triumph. You will reap the

fruit of all your toil and patience, and the ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings you have endured will not appear worthy to be compared with the glory that ≈øhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, when ye ≈øhall hear the≈øe enrapturing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, <hi>Come, ye ble≈ø≈øed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the World.</hi>

            <p>IT will be expected, I pre≈øume, before I clo≈øe my di≈øcour≈øe, that a few thoughts ≈øhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øed to the unhappy man who is the ≈øpecial occa≈øion of our a≈ø≈øembling. Among the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have attended the ≈øcenes through which the Pri≈øoner has pa≈ø≈øed, it is not the lea≈øt, that his ideas have become ≈øo confu≈øed and deranged, that, at pre≈øent, he ≈øeems ≈øcarcely capable of moral in≈øtruction. We hope the happy change in his ≈øtate will be attended with as happy a one in his mind, and that he may yet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and u≈øeful.</p>
            <p>MY Friend, We view you this day with the mixed emotions of joy and ≈øorrow, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mingle condolence with our congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. You have known what it is to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at a human tribunal‚Äîto be tried for your life, upon a mo≈øt awful indictment‚Äîto be found guilty, in the judgment of your peers‚Äîand to have the dreadful ≈øentence of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024540_0073_0FC7B15FB3D5F948"/>
upon you. You have been bound in affliction and iron, becau≈øe of your tran≈øgre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and your friends have trembled for your approaching fate: But, in the my≈øteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence of GOD, events have been ≈øo ordered, that the grace of the Commonwealth is extended to your ca≈øe, and his EXCELLENCY the GOVERNOR, and the HONORABLE COUNCIL, have granted you a free and full pardon. We have ≈øeen your badges of infamy knocked off, and you ≈øat at liberty. We congratulate you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this happy change. How thankful ought you to be to your great deliverer‚Äîto him who brings the pri≈øoner out of the pri≈øon-hou≈øe‚Äîand chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ≈øhadows of death into the light of the morning. What emotions of gratitude ≈øhould ari≈øe in your brea≈øt toward tho≈øe who have ≈øo deeply intere≈øted them≈øelves in your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances. You can never think of the names of LYMAN, SEWALL, PARSONS, or DAVIS, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tear of ≈øen≈øibility trickling down your cheeks. Your ≈øpared life ≈øhould be ≈øpent in prai≈øing your deliverer, &amp; praying for your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: In endeavouring to le≈ø≈øen the injury you have done, by ≈øoftening the ≈øorrows of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and fatherle≈øs, reduced to this unhappy ≈øtate in your impa≈ø≈øioned moments.

≈øhould the life, which you have now a pro≈øpect of enjoying, be ≈øpent in preparing for that more ≈øolemn trial which yet awaits you. For, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Sir, you mu≈øt yet ≈øtand at the <hi>tribunal</hi> of JEHOVAH. The pardon you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved extends no farther than to acquit you of your offence again≈øt the laws of your ≈øellow-men.‚Äî<hi>None can forgive ≈øins but GOD only.</hi> If the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray with your neighbor was ≈øo circum≈øtanced as to reduce your crime below the letter of the indictment, you mu≈øt be ≈øen≈øible that there was great criminality in your conduct. A friend, a fellow-mortal, has been hurried into eternity, in an impa≈ø≈øioned moment, by your deadly weapon.‚ÄîThink how you will meet him at the bar of GOD. Or how you will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him who hath ≈øaid, <hi>He that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his brother without a cau≈øe, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Judgment‚ÄîAnd he that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart, is a murderer.</hi> It will be of little con≈øequence to be pardoned of men, if you are not pardoned of GOD: to be acquitted now, if you are condemned in the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>LET me then entreat you, if you are capable of receiving the exhortation, to think ≈øeriou≈øly of your ≈øituation. Improve the re≈øpite granted you, to repent ≈øincerely of this and all your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
