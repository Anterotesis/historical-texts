            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE Author is inclined to think, that the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting</hi> occaſion <hi>on which the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was delivered, and the tender feelings of the bearers thereby excited, more than any peculiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence in the Sermon, cauſed them to requeſt its publication: But a hope, that the great, the plain and important truths it contains, may be the means of doing good, together with a diſpoſition to oblige them, prevails with him to comply with it.—The addreſs at the cloſe, in particular, he is ſenſible may expoſe him to the cenſure of the critic; but it claims the candor of the public, as it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſpoken without much premeditation or penning of the ſentiments, the preacher expecting to ſpeak to the priſoner under a ſentence of death,(it being the deſign of the meeting) 'till the news of the pardon arrived about half an hour before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For the ſame reaſon the reader is deſired to excuſe it, if it is not exactly recollected as it was ſpoken: The ſubſtance, it is ſuppoſed, is here giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the public.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>☞<hi>So ſingular an inſtance of ſovereignty in pardoning a criminal, condemned for murder, ſhews the attention of the Supreme Executive of the State to</hi> juſtice, <hi>as well as clemency. It was a free and generous act of grace; but a reaſon exciting it, is ſuppoſed to be, ſome evidence appearing after the trial, in favour of the criminal, which was judged material; and which the jury on the trial certified, would, if it had been adduced, have altered the verdict, from murder, to man-ſlaughter.</hi>

                  <hi>LUKE, XXIV,46,47.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>THUS IT IS WRITTEN, AND THUS IT BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HOVED CHRIST TO SUFFER, AND TO RISE FROM THE DEAD THE THIRD DAY: AND THAT REPENTANCE AND REMISSION OF SINS SHOULD BE PREACHED IN HIS NAME, AMONG ALL NATIONS; BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINNING AT JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUSALEM.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HE who <hi>made</hi> all things, is GOD. To whom do we owe our <hi>obedience,</hi> but to him who gave us <hi>being?</hi> From whom muſt we derive <hi>happineſs,</hi> but from <hi>him,</hi> who placed Man in a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> State? That Man, as he came out of the forming hands of GOD, was holy, and conſequently happy, the ſcriptures inform us.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024540_0006_0FC7B05E3ADC5C00"/>
That the caſe is now, with us, <hi>far otherwiſe,</hi> we may ſee by ſad experience, as well as are told in the word of GOD, The ſame revelation teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us the fatal cauſe of ſo generally calamitous a ſtate.—<hi>By the ſin of man.</hi> 
               <q>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ON this occaſion, <hi>mercy</hi> triumphed, GOD, moved with pity toward us, to the glory of his wiſdom and grace, provided a way for our relief; and gave a promiſe of a Saviour, who ſhould be "the ſeed of the woman," and being <hi>the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Perſon,</hi> God <hi>with us,</hi> the SON of GOD in human nature, ſhould open to man a door of <hi>hope,</hi> the way of return to GOD and happineſs.</p>
            <p>HE was long foretold by the prophets.—At length the promiſed Saviour appears: But in a very different <hi>manner</hi> from what was generally expected by the Jews. They being in ſubjection to the Romans, and entertaining high notions of "the Meſſiah" promiſed, looked for him as a <hi>temporal</hi> Prince and Saviour, to deliver them from <hi>that</hi> bondage; little conſidering their need of him as a Saviour from the <hi>worſt</hi> of bondage, from ſin, guilt, and its dreadful conſequence, eternal death. Too many, like them, would rejoice at
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024540_0007_0FC7B05F2CB12980"/>
the news of a Saviour and deliverer from the evils and ſufferings of <hi>this</hi> life, and <hi>temporal</hi> death; but ſee not their <hi>need</hi> of one, to reſcue them from more <hi>fatal</hi> evils—from the power of ſin, and Satan, and from death eternal. But the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> gave him the name of JESUS, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, "becauſe he ſhould <hi>ſave his people</hi> from their ſins."</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>miſtaken</hi> notion, however, infected the nation in general. Even the choſen diſciples were not free from it. As "two of them walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed" together on "the third day" after his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, and JESUS joined their company, (he being riſen) "they were talking" of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy event of his death, as it appeared to them; and they ſaid to him, "We truſted it had been he, who ſhould have "redeemed Iſrael." In the evening of the ſame day, when the diſciples were "aſſembled together," he came and "ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid, <q>Peace be unto you: But they were terrified and affrighted; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they had ſeen a ſpirit: But he ſhewed them his hands and his feet,</q> which were wounded on "the croſs;" yet they were hardly perſuaded that it was <hi>he.</hi> 
               <q>And he ſaid unto them, Theſe are the words which I ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you while I was yet with you, that all things
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024540_0008_0FC7B06133C65178"/>
muſt be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moſes, &amp; in the prophets, and in the pſalms concerning me: Then opened he their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they might underſtand the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And ſaid unto them</q> (as in our text) <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behaved CHRIST to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, among all nations; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we find CHRIST himſelf explaining to <hi>them</hi> and to <hi>us</hi> the whole myſtery and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his incarnation, death and reſurrection; and preaching to ſinners, <hi>repentance and remiſſion of ſins, in his name</hi>—that, in that very <hi>way</hi> by which the diſciples were ſo much ſtumbled, and which was ſo contrary to <hi>human</hi> wiſdom, and the general expectation of the <hi>favored</hi> people of Iſrael, he was to bring <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Redemption</hi> to men. The very mention of which, methinks, if rightly conſidered, is enough to melt down the hardeſt heart, and to ſoften it to compliance; <hi>Thus it behoved CHRIST to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day,</hi> with this expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, <hi>that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name,</hi> and that ſo extenſively, <hi>among all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem,</hi> the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024540_0009_0FC7B064E8DEAD50"/>
ſcene of his ſufferings, and to them by whom he had been ſo lately, ſo cruelly treated and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Behold the extent and degree of his compaſſion! And what relief is here for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; guilty, undone and helpleſs! Let the crowd of ideas of ſin, guilt, ruin and the ample reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy provided, deeply affect us, while we proceed to conſider,</p>
            <p>I. <hi>The foundation and encouragement for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and forgiveneſs of ſins, from the death and reſurrection of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>The nature and neceſſity of repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>The connexion of forgiveneſs in the name and for the ſake of CHRIST, with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. Then, we are to conſider the <hi>foundation and encouragement for repentance</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of ſins, from the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrection of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>firſt</hi> law, the law of <hi>nature,</hi> gave no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of it.—That GOD ſhould <hi>require our obedience,</hi> he thought right and ſit. The law which requires it, expreſſes his will, and ariſes from his nature: It muſt therefore be holy, juſt and good, as himſelf; and unchangeable, like himſelf—That he ſhould <hi>puniſh</hi> man, if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, he deemed but <hi>juſt:</hi> Juſtice, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and good moral government required it: As in a good civil government, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024540_0010_0FC7B06911E47D78"/>
and neceſſary for the good of the whole, that tranſgreſſors be puniſhed, according to the good laws of the State. In either caſe, to be <hi>ſorry,</hi> does not make ſufficient <hi>amends;</hi> even if the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor ſhould really diſcover ſuch a diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>Now, the covenant which man was placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at his creation, required, as was moſt ſit and ſuitable for the holy GOD to require, a perfect obedience of him <hi>perſonally</hi> as the condition of <hi>life.</hi> A <hi>threatening,</hi> to deter him, was annexed to the tranſgreſſion of the law, in which the <hi>promiſe</hi> of it was implied; a threatening adapted to his ſituation, as <hi>living happy</hi> in GOD's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and favor; even <hi>death,</hi> implying the loſs of that happy life and a ſenſe of it, and together therewith, a ſenſe of the diſpleaſure of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whom he offended. The threatening againſt diſobedience was <hi>poſitive;</hi> as in the prohibition of <q>eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</q> As it related to an <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> being, as man, and there were no intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an eſcape from it, there was implied an eternal ſenſe of loſs, and conſequent ſuffering of the anger of GOD, a ſenſe of good, loſt, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, procured, which is that <hi>death,</hi> which "is the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024540_0011_0FC7B075C0585D18"/>
               <hi>wages of ſin:"</hi> For who can endure this, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever, and not be ſaid to <hi>die</hi> eternally?</p>
            <p>MAN diſobeyed; and <hi>death</hi> was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It began to take place <hi>immediately. </hi> It muſt have followed in the full extent, if mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had not interpoſed: We feel it in part: There is a foreboding of miſery, in this world, in the <hi>awakened</hi> conſcience. This is but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſorrows, an anticipation in part, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of that "<hi>death,</hi>" which "is the wages of ſin." But yet there is no diſpoſition of heart to <hi>repent,</hi> nor <hi>encouragement,</hi> that, repenting, he may be forgiven; till the grace of the goſpel is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his view.</p>
            <p>IN the covenant of <hi>works</hi> there was no <hi>room</hi> for repentance; no condition on which pardon might be obtained, if man ſinned; nor provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for any relief. What then muſt be the conſequence? Muſt the whole race of men pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for ever, ſeeing we are told that "all have ſinned?" The <hi>goſpel</hi> brings us <hi>good news, glad tidings</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> for the rebellious, upon their repentance; that <hi>ſinners may repent,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting may be <hi>forgiven;</hi> and if forgiven, then received to the <hi>favor</hi> of their offended Creator, and be <hi>happy</hi> in him, and with him for ever. The <hi>new covenant,</hi> emphatically called the <hi>covenant of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024540_0012_0FC7B077317846B0"/>
grace,</hi> provides for this. Nothing but <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſovereign</hi> grace could provide relief, or give any ground of <hi>hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE text informs us of the <hi>way</hi> in which it is brought about, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of JESUS CHRIST. The ſinner, as he could ſee no <hi>room</hi> for repentance, or <hi>way</hi> to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, ſo he could have no <hi>power</hi> or <hi>diſpoſition of heart</hi> to repent or <hi>hope</hi> for forgiveneſs. Divine wiſdom and grace contrived a plan, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by the mediation and ſacrifice of JESUS CHRIST. To "deliver us from going down to the pit" of eternal death. GOD " has found a ranſom:" The <hi>death</hi> of CHRIST is <hi>the ranſom;</hi> and his reſurrection from the dead teſtifies its ſufficiency, and acceptableneſs with GOD on <hi>our</hi> behalf. This lays the <hi>foundation of encouragement</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and hope for the forgiveneſs of ſin.</p>
            <p>THIS was <hi>neceſſary.</hi> GOD did not ſee it <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>ſuitable,</hi> though his <hi>mercy</hi> is <hi>ſo great,</hi> to give his holy SPIRIT to work in ſinners a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to repent, and in a meer <hi>Sovereign</hi> way to pardon their ſins, without a ſatisfaction; ſo great is the <hi>evil</hi> of ſin, and the <hi>diſhonor</hi> it caſts on him and his government; as it ſtrikes at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all moral obligation, and even aims to caſt GOD out of his throne. His <hi>law</hi> muſt be
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024540_0013_0FC7B078B1BFF258"/>
honored, which is thereby violated, and juſtice ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>THE covenant of <hi>redemption,</hi> which is to us the covenant of <hi>grace,</hi> provides that this be done by a <hi>ſurety;</hi> and that the SON of GOD be the perſon; that in order thereto, he take <hi>our nature</hi> and become <hi>man</hi>—be made under the law which we had broken, and be made a <hi>curſe</hi> for us, by ſuffering the <hi>accurſed death</hi> of the croſs; that we might be freed from the curſe. As <hi>death</hi> was the <hi>poſitive threatening</hi> to man, for ſins ſo, the death of CHRIST on the croſs, as <hi>our ſurety,</hi> ſecures the honor of GOD's law, truth and juſtice, thereby to make an atonement: As the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was the <hi>altar</hi> on which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> "which ſanctifies the gift;" it was of infinite value in the ſight of GOD. As he is a <hi>Divine</hi> Perſon, GOD eſteemed his death a ſufficient <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> to his juſtice, as a manifeſtation of his righteous <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt ſin. This he teſtified to all worlds, by <hi>raiſing</hi> him from the dead, as he foretold, on the <hi>third</hi> day: For, as he died a victim to divine juſtice for the ſins of men, he could not otherwiſe have been releaſed from the bands of the grave, than by having made full ſatisfaction: By which, he eſtabliſhed this as the <hi>only way</hi> for ſinners to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024540_0014_0FC7B07A2C9D7688"/>
               <hi>hope,</hi> as laying the foundation for the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable</hi> exerciſe of mercy, and of beſtowment of the gift of the holy SPIRIT, to work repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in their hearts. In conſequence of which, <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>pardon</hi> are proclaimed to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty world.</p>
            <p>OF this atonement, the prophets foretold, and the law of Moſes teſtified, by the ſacrifices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in inſtituted; this ſignifying, that without <q>ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood there is no remiſſion. To him gave all the prophets witneſs</q> (ſaith the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Peter) <q>that through his name whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</q> The GOD of our fathers raiſed up JESUS, <q>whom ye ſlew (ſaith he to the Jews) and hanged on a tree. Him hath GOD ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of ſins.</q> The whole deſign and the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of his death, and reſurrection to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it, are expreſſed by CHRIST in the text, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved CHRIST to ſuffer, and to riſe from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024540_0015_0FC7B0842C4DB0A8"/>
WHICH brings us to conſider,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The nature and neceſſity of Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is the work of a <hi>ſinner.</hi> Before man ſinned, he was required to obey the law and keep all the commandments of GOD. But <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> was no part of his religion.—But ſince the <hi>fall,</hi> it is neceſſary; and no religion can be accepted without it. It is the <hi>proper</hi> work of a ſinner: His <hi>character calls</hi> for it, and makes it <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi> If there were any <hi>without ſin,</hi> they would have no <hi>occaſion</hi> for Repentance: <q>But now, GOD commandeth all men every where to repent.</q> Sin gives <hi>cauſe</hi> for Repentance. It occaſions <hi>ſorrow of heart,</hi> when rightly view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as brings the ſorrow of <hi>ſuffering.</hi> When it is a <q>godly ſorrow, it worketh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to Salvation; not to be repented of: but the ſorrow of the world,</q> or that which is merely of a worldly nature, "worketh death."</p>
            <p>A diſtinction therefore is neceſſary. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance implies in its nature <hi>conviction</hi> of ſin—an <hi>afflictive</hi> ſenſe and <hi>heart-aching</hi> for it. But not <hi>merely</hi> a conviction, as having done evil, and <hi>diſtreſs</hi> of mind ariſing therefrom: So, <q>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed</q> his Lord <q>repented himſelf, ſaying, I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood:—And he caſt down the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024540_0016_0FC7B085A6362290"/>
pieces of ſilver in the temple, and departed and went and hanged himſelf:</q> Such was his <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>deſpair.</hi> But, this was not the <hi>Repentance</hi> to which there is a promiſe of <hi>remiſſion of ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"REPENTANCE is a ſaving grace, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary mean of attaining life and Salvation," wrought by the SPIRIT of GOD in the heart; which is a <hi>further</hi> operation of the SPIRIT, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>conviction</hi> of ſin; imparting a ſenſe of the <hi>evil</hi> of it, as againſt GOD. The hearts of all perſons, by nature, are <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>inſenſible</hi> of ſin; not only as to its <hi>moral</hi> evil, but its <hi>ill deſert.</hi>—The SPIRIT of GOD, whoſe operations are the effect of CHRIST's purchaſe, aſſiſting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience to do its office, "convinces of ſin," and awakens to a <hi>concern</hi> for their ſafety. This may be <hi>preparatory</hi> to <hi>true</hi> repentance. So that he who has not had a real <hi>conviction</hi> of ſin and guilt, and been awakened to a <hi>deep concern</hi> "what he ſhall do to be ſaved," has not repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he is yet blind and hardened.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>true repentance</hi> there is a <hi>clearer conviction</hi> of ſin—it diſcovers its <hi>evil nature,</hi> as againſt GOD; and ſo ſets the <hi>guilt</hi> of it in a juſter light; even the guilt of the leaſt ſin appears great. It appears <hi>ſo great an evil</hi> to ſin againſt GOD at all, as to deſerve his wrath for ever: So that he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024540_0017_0FC7B086F128EE30"/>
would be <hi>juſt</hi> to caſt him off eternally; not only for the more open groſs ſins of his life, which are juſtly deteſtable in the eyes of the civilized world; but for ſecret ſins, ſins of heart, and its unlikeneſs and oppoſition to GOD, the ſin of <hi>nature</hi> as well as practice, ſins of omiſſion as well as commiſſion: For he ſees that he has to deal with a heart-ſearching GOD, "who ſeeth not as man ſeeth."—Some particular <hi>groſs</hi> act of ſin, and tranſgreſſion of the law of GOD, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be the <hi>leading</hi> cauſe or occaſion of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mind: But, in <hi>evangelical</hi> repentance, the ſin of unbelief, and contempt of CHRIST, and his goſpel—his ingratitude for and abuſe of the goodneſs and love of GOD, in providing a Saviour, and of CHRIST, the compaſſionate Redeemer; and his reſiſting, and ſtifling the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the SPIRIT of grace;—his blindneſs of mind, his ſtupidity and inſenſibility of the things of GOD, deeply affect his heart. The hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart, and the corruption of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſidered as the <hi>fountain</hi> of ſin in the <hi>outward</hi> act, excite bitter groanings; and cauſe him to feel the propriety of and adopt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the apoſtle Paul, <q>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this death;</q> this deadly body or maſs of ſin!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:024540_0018_0FC7B08A824DA150"/>
INDEED the true penitent is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>mourns</hi> that he is a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and that by ſin he has <hi>diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored</hi> GOD, and <hi>polluted</hi> his own ſoul; whereby he is rendered <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> in the ſight of a holy GOD. Being enlightened to ſome juſt views of GOD, and of his ſins againſt him, by the SPIRIT of the LORD, ( with Job) he <q>abhors himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and repents in duſt and aſhes Remembering and reflecting on his own evil ways, and his doings that were not good;</q> ( as it was foretold of Iſrael becoming penitent) <q>he loathes himſelf, in his own ſight, for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and for his abominations.</q> Not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſhame and puniſhment before men, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the divine vengeance, to which he is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for his tranſgreſſions, do extort grief and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; but <hi>ſin</hi> in general, <hi>as ſin,,</hi> 
               <q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing exceeding ſinful,</q> excites genuine unaffected <hi>mourning,,</hi> 
               <q>as one mourneth for his only ſon,</q> and <hi>bitterneſs of ſoul,</hi> 
               <q>as when one is in bitterneſs for his firſt-born.</q> Whereas, before this, he was ready to palliate and excuſe his <hi>crimes,</hi> or plead innocence, and was diſpoſed to ſet a high value on any <hi>good</hi> deeds done by him; he now confeſſes his ſins, with ſhame and abhorrence of them: As the prophet Jeremiah ſpeaks in behalf of Iſrael, ſo, true penitents may
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024540_0019_0FC7B0950B011F98"/>
ſay, "We lie down in our ſhame, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion covereth us:" as being aſhamed to lift up our heads before GOD, or look up, "for we have ſinned againſt the LORD our GOD."</p>
            <p>CONFESSION of ſin, is the part of a penitent; a duty encumbent upon him, as a mark of the penitence of his heart, and a viſible renunciation of ſin. When "John preached the baptiſm of repentance, for the remiſſion of ſins," they that "were baptized of him" in token of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, "confeſſed their ſins." Not that there is any propriety that people ſhould lay open their <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins before the world: But three things may be implied, <abbr>viz.</abbr>. I. Confeſſion of all our ſins, that we are conſcious of, to GOD.—Thus, the Pſalmiſt profeſſed that he did and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived forgiveneſs, Pſ. 32, 5. <q>I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the LORD; and thou forgaveſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my ſin.</q>—If we attempt to <hi>hide</hi> our ſins from GOD, or, if we do not confeſs them to him, we cannot expect a pardon from him. It is made a <hi>condition</hi> of finding <hi>mercy,,</hi> in Prov. xxiv, 13. He that covereth his ſins, ſhall not <q>proſper; but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy.</q> 2. Confeſſion, to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024540_0020_0FC7B099CDDA5B30"/>
               <hi>injured</hi> perſons in particular, if opportunity can be had, is neceſſary, in token of repentance, with deſire of <hi>their</hi> forgiveneſs—Although none but GOD can <hi>forgive</hi> ſins, or <hi>diſcharge</hi> from guilt and puniſhment; yet, where an offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt one or more of our <hi>fellow-men,</hi> the leaſt we can do to repair the injury, is, <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi> our fault with penitence, as we would hope for forgiveneſs from GOD; againſt whom, all ſin is ultimately committed. 3. There ought to be <hi>public confeſſion,</hi> where the offence is of a <hi>public nature;</hi> and eſpecially <hi>againſt</hi> the public. A great part of the <hi>evil</hi> of ſin which is of a public nature, lies in the evil <hi>example</hi> of it, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the hurtful, dangerous <hi>tendency</hi> of it, to the ſociety; which makes it neceſſary that <hi>public teſtimony</hi> be borne againſt it: And, when any perſon has openly tranſgreſſed, or committed an overt-act of offence againſt the State, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, he ought to do all in his power to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bad tendency and prevent the pernicious effects of his crime, to the public; by confeſſing it; and profeſſing his ſenſe of the <hi>evil</hi> of it; and <hi>deep ſorrow</hi> for it; which will be alſo to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD: As <hi>Joſhua</hi> told <hi>Achan,</hi> 
               <q>My ſon, give I pray thee, glory to the LORD GOD of Iſrael, and make confeſſion unto him.</q> 
               <hi>i.e.</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:024540_0021_0FC7B09A72BDDA58"/>
before the people, Joſh vii, 19. This would be to the glory of his juſtice, and in a meaſure ſecure the honor of his government.</p>
            <p>SORROW of heart is an attendant of this grief, and mourning for ſin and confeſſion of it. As the penitent is <hi>grieved</hi> and <hi>mourns,</hi> ſo he is <hi>ſorry</hi> from his heart for the <hi>diſhonor</hi> that he has done to GOD, by his ſins; and the <hi>offence</hi> given him: For this reaſon, eſpecially, he is ready to ſay, "O that I never had committed them;" more than for any trouble brought on himſelf thereby.</p>
            <p>HUMILIATION before GOD, and <hi>brokeneſs of heart</hi> for ſin is another attendant of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He is brought down from all high thoughts of himſelf, of his own worthineſs and goodneſs. His proud, ſtubborn ſpirit is broken; which before was "as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke," and he is brought to ſubmit to GOD's government, as juſt and right. He lies low, as it were at GOD's footſtool, ſenſible of his deſert of his dreadful diſpleaſure; and that he is juſt in his threatenings, and would be ſo in his damnation; and therefore that his only hope is in his mercy. However great diſtreſs and horror of conſcience the legal penitent may feel for ſin, he is not <hi>humbled:</hi> He continues as proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and ſtubborn, as oppoſite to GOD in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024540_0022_0FC7B09BEAD0CCD8"/>
the temper of his mind as ever, and as unwilling to ſubmit to the divine government—has no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his glory, but only to his own eaſe and ſafety.</p>
            <p>THE true penitent thus humbled, caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, at the feet of a <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> GOD, as one deſerving death and damnation, having nothing to plead but <hi>free grace.</hi> In which caſe, the way is opened for his compliance with the <hi>goſpel;</hi> the <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of which are to abaſe the pride of man, and exalt the glory of GOD: Wherein his juſtice is aſſerted, the honor of his government ſecured, and mercy exerciſed to the ſinner, penitent and believing in the atonement and righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, which alone give relief and comfort. Therefore,</p>
            <p>TRUE goſpel-repentance includes <hi>an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benſion of the mercy of GOD, in CHRIST, and faith in this great Redeemer:</hi> This neceſſarily belongs to its nature. While a ſight of ſin in its guilt and of the juſtice of GOD in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſhews the need of a Saviour; of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and righteouſneſs, and the neceſſity of repentance, ſome view of this proviſion of GOD's grace is neceſſary ( as has already been ſhewn) as the encouragement to repent, as the motive and incitement to it, as the only barrier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024540_0023_0FC7B09DBA9836B0"/>
deſpair, and foundation of the hope of forgiveneſs. The free mercy of GOD in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a Saviour,—the mediation of CHRIST—his perfect obedience to the Divine law, and his ſufferings and death upon the croſs, afford the only encouragement to a ſinner to think of returning to GOD, to aſk and hope for a pardon of his ſins, and for favor with his offended Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and a principal mean of ſoftening the heart of a rebel to a compliance with the offer of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. As the law of GOD pronounces a curſe in poſitive terms upon him that fails of fulfilling it, the ſinner muſt have ſo remained under the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, &amp; in hardened oppoſition againſt GOD, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoftened by the <hi>emollients of grace.</hi> The <hi>teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> of GOD in his word, of CHRIST be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our ſurety, bearing our ſins on the croſs, paying our debt of ſuffering, and procuring a righteouſneſs for our juſtification, <hi>i.e. </hi> for all that embrace him, being received by <hi>faith,</hi> is this bleſſed <hi>ſoftening remedy,</hi> that draws, that wins, that gains the heart of a ſinner; that otherwiſe would dread and ſhun with averſion the preſence of GOD—that cauſe him to relent, to repent of his ſins and oppoſition againſt him, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thankfully, and obediently to return to him, in the name of and with faith in this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024540_0024_0FC7B0A130C30840"/>
all-ſufficient Saviour, and with hope in the mercy of GOD. Which faith, implies not only an aſſent of the mind, to the truth of the goſpel, but a conſent of the heart and will, to this way of Salvation; and a cordial receiving of and truſting in this great Redeemer, his atonement and righteouſneſs, for pardon, acceptance to the favor of GOD, grace for ſanctification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and eternal life. Thus, <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> when either is true and genuine, are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united; and "repentance," thus connected with faith, is "unto Salvation," "and not to be repented of;" but is followed with the joy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>I WOULD briefly add, as a <hi>mark</hi> of goſpel-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that it is accompanied and followed with <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin, reſolution of heart againſt and forſaking it in practice, and turning to the LORD in new obedience. The true penitent, it appears from this view of the ſubject, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences and eſſential change of mind, and change of heart. All the powers of his mind are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their former bias; ſin is imbittered, a fixed <hi>hatred</hi> of all ſin ariſes in the heart; ſo that he becomes an irreconcileable enemy to it, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from and degree; even when his ſenſible grief, ſorrow and mourning for it is aſſuaged

and abated, by the comforts of the holy GHOST, and ſenſe of pardon: His <hi>hatred</hi> of ſin ariſes from a view of its <hi>evil nature,</hi> and contrariety to GOD and his law, and continues and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in proportion to his experiences of his grace and manifeſtations of his love. The ſame view and ſenſe of ſin, will influence him to <hi>turn</hi> from it; as it is natural to <hi>fly</hi> from that which we <hi>hate:</hi> He therefore forſakes ſin, &amp; turns to the LORD; he is made willing to ſubmit to his government, and to give up himſelf to him in an everlaſting covenant, never to be forgotten; reſigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him and his diſpoſal, in life, and death, and to all eternity. As he before "walked contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to GOD, after the imagination of his own heart," he now "walks with GOD," in faith and love, <q>with purpoſe of heart cleaves to the LORD,</q> and <q>brings forth fruit meet for repentance; being made free from ſin," as to its dominion, and become a ſervant to GOD, he has his fruit unto holineſs, and his end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, we may obſerve, repentance is <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> in the <hi>nature</hi> of things, as it is a laying down the weapons of rebellion againſt GOD, and a ſubmiſſion to his government in CHRIST, the mediator and "king whom he hath ſet in Zion:"
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024540_0026_0FC7B0B62B127D40"/>
and as it is made the <hi>condition</hi> of the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of pardon to the ſinner, by the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of the goſpel; as will further appear. Though it does not <hi>merit</hi> any favor from GOD, it is moſt fit and ſuitable, as a <hi>condition</hi> of pardon being granted to the offender, and his being admitted as a meet ſubject of his kingdom of grace, in this world, and an heir of the kingdom of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Without which, it is impoſſible that he ſhould reliſh the joys of heaven, or ever be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there; for, "without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the LORD." We proceed,</p>
            <p>III. To obſerve the <hi>connexion of forgiveneſs, in the name and for the ſake of CHRIST, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have ſeen that there is <hi>proviſion</hi> made in the covenant of grace, for the repentance of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and that he that repents ſhould be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: CHRIST has purchaſed this favor—has prepared the <hi>way</hi> for the honorable exerciſe of mercy to ſinners, being <q>ſet forth of GOD to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins—that he might be juſt;</q> juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his law and government, <q>and the juſtifier of him which believeth in JESUS.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THAT GOD hath conſtituted a certain and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024540_0027_0FC7B0B7B772D6E8"/>
unfailing connexion between <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins,</hi> appears from the text; when the Saviour declares, that for this end, CHRIST <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and roſe from the dead the third day; that repentance,</hi> as the condition, <hi>and remiſſion of ſins,</hi> as the happy conſequence, <hi>ſhould,</hi> (or might) <hi>be preached in his name;</hi> and alſo, from the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his apoſtles, that in conſequence of his ſufferings on the croſs, <q>GOD hath exalted him with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; to give both repentance and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins.</q> This is the gracious condition in the covenant, which is ſealed by the blood of CHRIST; that, the ſinner that repents, ſhall freely and fully forgiven all his ſins. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nextion is eſtabliſhed, to encourage their return to GOD, and hope in his mercy. The directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the apoſtles to their awakened hearers, ſaying, <q>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of JESUS CHRIST, for the remiſſion of ſins;</q> and again, <q>Repent ye and be converted that your ſins may be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out,</q> plainly imply, an offer of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, upon their repentance; and an aſſurance, that if they "repented," they ſhould receive "remiſſion of ſins,"—their ſins ſhould "be blotted out." So that it appears to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024540_0028_0FC7B0B968831418"/>
               <hi>decree of heaven,</hi> that, the ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, ſhall be forgiven; and, being forgiven, ſhall be received to the favor of his Creator, and become an heir of eternal life.</p>
            <p>THIS mercy is granted to ſinners <hi>in the name</hi> and <hi>for the ſake</hi> of CHRIST, and in no <hi>other</hi> way. This is the "foundation-ſtone, the chief cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone" of the foundation of the ſinner's hope of pardon and life eternal. <q>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we muſt be ſaved.</q> As it was teſtified by the law of Moſes, by the ſacrifices and rites of that diſpenſation, that <q>without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion;</q> ſo, <q>now, once in the end of the world, hath CHRIST appeared to put away ſin, by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</q> And <q>to him gave all the prophets witneſs, that through his name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</q> The true <hi>penitent,</hi> therefore, having <hi>a believing</hi> reſpect to the atonement of CHRIST, receives the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of his ſins <hi>in his name,</hi> and <hi>for the ſake</hi> of his ſufferings and death on the croſs, for the ſins of men. Repentance is not the <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſe of forgiveneſs, nor yet is any other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in us: But it is wholly aſcribed to the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024540_0029_0FC7B0C282E04078"/>
merit of the blood or ſufferings and death of the Son of GOD; which is ſufficient for that purpoſe, for <hi>any,</hi> and for <hi>all</hi> the human race; So that whoever of "all nations," ages and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions does truly repent, may be aſſured by the word of GOD, of the remiſſion of his ſins, in the name and for the ſake of CHRIST; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with <hi>faith</hi> in him, as, it implies, not merely <hi>aſking</hi> for mercy and forgiveneſs in his name, but receiving him, and relying on his infinite atonement. For this end he <hi>ſuffered,</hi> that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould be preached in his name, <hi>among all nations, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſence of his ſufferings:—to the very <hi>people</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> who had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrators of the horrid crime of the murder of the SON of GOD. By which is held up the idea of the infinite merit of his death, and of the riches of GOD's grace, with the freeneſs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to the greateſt offenders; as well as, that it is his will, that pardon ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> offered to a <hi>covenanted</hi> people, who have revolted from him, and that <hi>backſliders</hi> ſhould be called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and be aſſured of forgiveneſs, upon their repentance; <q>though their ſins be as ſcarlet, and though they be red like crimſon,</q> ever ſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated and heinous; to ſhew them that GOD
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024540_0030_0FC7B0C5C90B98F8"/>
is mindful of <hi>his</hi> covenant, however they act unworthy of <hi>their's,</hi> and alſo, that GOD, in the beſtowment of mercy to ſinners, deals with them in the way of a <hi>covenant of grace,</hi> by which they are brought <hi>nigh</hi> to him;—repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins was to be preached in his name, <hi>among all nations,</hi> but <hi>beginning at Jeruſalem.</hi> So that upon the whole it appears, that how great ſoever, or numerous or aggravated his ſins are, that can be <hi>no bar</hi> in the way of forgiveneſs, to the perſon that repents, with faith in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy, through CHRIST; they cannot exceed his merits, or the mercy of GOD in him toward ſinners.</p>
            <p>THE reaſon why any <hi>deſpair,</hi> is not that their ſins are <hi>too great to be forgiven,</hi> nor yet that they have a <hi>greater ſenſe</hi> of them, or of their aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than the <hi>true penitent</hi> that finds mercy, but, that they <hi>reject the atonement</hi> of CHRIST, the only <hi>way</hi> to obtain mercy and forgiveneſs. The <hi>true penitent,</hi> is ready to think himſelf to be the <hi>worſt</hi> of ſinners, becauſe he ſees more of <hi>himſelf,</hi> and of his ſins, than of any others; but yet he <hi>does not deſpair.</hi> Indeed he <hi>does deſpair</hi> in any <hi>other</hi> way, but <hi>one</hi>—but in the view and belief of that which GOD has provided, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of CHRIST; which is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:024540_0031_0FC7B0C93582DA40"/>
of his comfort and hope. The mercy of GOD, <hi>in him</hi> and his all-perfect <hi>atonement</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> are all his ſupport: Take this away, and the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſin would ſhut him up under ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſpair: But, while this foundation which GOD hath laid, remains, though he may at times, greatly doubt and fear, yet, his faith and hope will not utterly fail him. One ſin, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, is enough to damn the ſoul, eternally: For, though every ſin may not particularly be recollected in repentance; yet, <hi>all ſin, as ſin, ſo far</hi> as it is known, the oppoſition of nature and practice to GOD, muſt be repented of. And, whoever truly repents, with apprehenſion of the mercy of GOD, as it is exerciſed in and through the <hi>mediator</hi> need never deſpair; let his ſins be ever ſo great, or numerous, or aggravated; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too great to be forgiven, in this way; they cannot be more than <hi>infinite:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, cannot exceed the merit of the atonement and ſatisfaction of CHRIST; which is <hi>infinite:</hi> and muſt therefore be ſufficient to cancel the guilt of all ſin. Yea, it is not only <hi>ſufficient</hi> for that purpoſe, but infinitely <hi>free</hi> for the greateſt ſinners; not only for <hi>ſome</hi> but for <hi>any</hi> for all, whoſoever will with "the prodigal return to the father" of all, and <hi>penitently aſk</hi> for mercy: For there
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024540_0032_0FC7B0CBE2BBFF90"/>
there is "joy in heaven over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents," ſo peculiarly is GOD pleaſed with it, <q>more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons that need no repentance,</q> if any ſuch there were; "becauſe he delighteth in mercy."—But, enough has been ſaid to ſhew the unfailing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of forgiveneſs, in the name and for the ſake of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>with repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SHALL now endeavour to aſſiſt your <hi>improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of what has been ſaid.—And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT a <hi>wonderful plan</hi> is that revealed in the goſpel, for the relief of ſinners; ruined and helpleſs! When man, being under a righteous law of GOD, requiring his obedience, had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, brought guilt and ruin on himſelf and his poſterity, and was ſhut up under a ſentence of condemnation, to eternal death, without a gleam of hope; the mercy of God appeared for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the helpleſs! his wiſdom contrived the way; a plan, at which heaven and earth may well ſtand aſtoniſhed!—that the SON of GOD ſhould come down into our world, take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "being found in faſhion as a man," yea, "make himſelf of no reputation," but "take upon him the form of a ſervant"—obey the law which we had broken, and die the accurſed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024540_0033_0FC7B0CDA12CF350"/>
and ignominious death of the croſs, to ſatisfy divine juſtice, for our ſins—that GOD might be juſt, and the juſtifier of the ſinner that will believe in him, with repentance of ſins—that the ſinner might repent, and repenting, might be forgiven: a plan, wherein <q>mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have embraced each other.</q>—Well may the "angels" intently "look into theſe things!" But, how much more, ſhould <hi>we</hi> be deeply affected with and admire the wonderful ſcheme of divine wiſdom and grace! For, though <q>the preaching of CHRIST crucified, was, unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and unto the Greeks fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</q> and is ſo, to many, in the preſent age; <q>yet, unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks,</q> and of whatever nation, <q>CHRIST the power of GOD and the wiſdom of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">From what has been ſaid, we may ſee the propriety, and neceſſity, that ſinners be deeply <hi>concerned</hi> what will become of them—<q>what they ſhall do to be ſaved.</q> A ſinner, out of CHRIST, is an <hi>undone</hi> creature; &amp;, in himſelf, helpleſs: Guilt hands heavy upon him, and ſin hinders his return to GOD;—he is in the road to final, remedileſs ruin, and nothing but ſovereign mercy can prevent it.—If any ſituation, that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024540_0034_0FC7B0D49E276028"/>
can be imagined on this ſide of <hi>eternal</hi> miſery calls for <hi>concern,</hi> this does: <hi>That</hi> indeed, in thoſe regions of deſpair, would be of no avail; but <hi>this</hi> may; as they are yet within the limits of mercy; it is with them <hi>a day of grace:</hi> The goſpel opens to ſinners a glorious door of <hi>hope;</hi> but, it is only an hope that they <hi>may</hi> become the ſubjects of the ſpecial grace of GOD, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace and reconciliation with him.—For ſinners, while within the reach of mercy, to be concerned "what they ſhall do to be ſaved," may be attended with the happieſt conſequences: As the direction of the prophet is adapted to them, "Turn ye to the ſtrong hold, ye priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hope". For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE only conſiſtent and ſatisfactory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that can be given to ſuch enquirers, is that given by the apoſtles, Peter and Paul, upon like occaſions, "<hi>Repent</hi>—Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST": Peter, added, to them who were not baptized—"And be baptized every one of you in the name of JESUS CHRIST, for the remiſſion of ſins," which is of the ſame import with Paul's direction, "Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST:" For, repentance and faith muſt go together—they cannot be ſeparated, if true and real: And a promiſe is implied, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024540_0035_0FC7B0D71E1A8718"/>
of <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> and of <hi>Salvation.</hi>—And, <q>Bleſſed is he whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, whoſe ſin is covered: Bleſſed is the man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the LORD imputeth not iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To become a true <hi>penitent</hi> for ſin, and ſo, to be entitled to the forgiveneſs of it, implies, <hi>a great change</hi> in the perſon's ſtate and condition, both <hi>real</hi> and <hi>relative:</hi> It muſt come from the heart; there muſt be an awakening out of ſecurity, conviction of ſin—a ſenſe of the evil of it—real grief, mourning, ſelf-loathing, with ſorrow of heart for it, hatred of and reſolution to forſake it, and faith in the LORD JESUS CHRIST; a faith, that "purifieth the heart;" and "worketh by love:" In ſhort, there muſt be a change of <hi>nature,</hi> producing, as there is opportunity, amendment of <hi>life.</hi> It is ſo great a change, that it is expreſt by the Saviour, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "born again:" without which, he moſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declares, no perſon "can ſee" or <q>enter into the kingdom of GOD.</q> The <hi>relative</hi> change, is equally great, in his being pardoned, and acquitted from guilt; that <q>he ſhall not come into condemnation; but is paſſed from death unto life:</q> become a favorite of GOD, and an heir of glory.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:024540_0036_0FC7B0DAF7525A80"/>
HENCE, we may ſee <hi>the neceſſity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> which are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by CHRIST, to enable a perſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;—to open his eyes, to excite his concern, to give him to ſee the evil of ſin, and an heart to repent. Some, may think, that they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at <hi>any</hi> time; and ſo put it off for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: This is preſumption. We may ſee, by melancholy obſervation, the fallacy of ſuch an opinion. Nothing but the grace of GOD will enable a perſon to repent. A blind, ſecure, hard, impenitent heart, is natural to man; and, nothing but the operations of the holy SPIRIT can awaken him, and give him a ſight of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of ſin, and an heart to repent of it.—It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſinners, to endeavour to realize their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on divine grace, to enquire of GOD, and ſeek him to open their eyes to ſee their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to give them an heart to repent. For,</p>
            <p n="6">SINCE repentance is ſo neceſſary, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins is ſo ſtrictly connected with it, it is an inſtance of <hi>unwarrantable preſumption, to reſt without it.</hi> To entertain an expectation or hope of pardon of ſin for CHRIST's ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance, is the height of folly, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity; and therefore, expoſes the perſon to the danger of periſhing in his ſins. It coſt him
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024540_0037_0FC7B0DDF3E4F920"/>
               <hi>death,</hi> &amp; the moſt amazing ſufferings, to prepare the way for the repentance of ſinners; to take away their ſins, and to procure a pardon. And can it be, that a ſinner can be pardoned without <hi>repentance?</hi>—It is impoſſible, by the conſtitution of the goſpel.—This would be to contradict the very deſign of CHRIST's ſufferings, and of the whole goſpel-plan.—And, without a pardon of ſin, guilt would ſink the ſoul down to the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deſpair and woe: For, the righteous law of GOD muſt be fulfilled; its ſentence muſt be executed. Thoſe that have no intereſt in the ſurety, CHRIST JESUS, (by compliance with the goſpel) muſt bear it themſelves. He muſt be madly bent on his own ruin, that will flatter himſelf with the hope of an eſcape and ſafety, in any <hi>other</hi> way. There is no pardon, no favor with GOD, no heaven for the ſinner, without repentance.</p>
            <p>How great ſoever may be a perſon's fear and diſtreſs—how dreadful ſoever his ſituation, we have no warrant to declare any <hi>other</hi> way, any <hi>eaſier</hi> terms of pardon and peace; even, if he was expecting, in <hi>a few hours</hi> or <hi>a few minutes</hi> to appear before GOD, in the world of ſpirits: I repeat it, I could direct to no other way, for pardon, and peace, and life. This is honorable
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024540_0038_0FC7B0E0E08E3A80"/>
for GOD, and ſafe and happy for us, for the guilty creature.—Wherefore, let the view of your guilt, the ſenſe of your danger, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of your caſe, alarm the ſecure and careleſs.</p>
            <p n="7">FROM what has been ſaid, we may infer, the <hi>abundant encouragement</hi> and animating motives there are, for ſinners to repent, and hope for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, through CHRIST; from the conſideration of his death and reſurrection. He <hi>died</hi> for this end, even to prepare the <hi>way</hi> and, by his riſing from the dead, the third day, was moſt fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted GOD's acceptance of the atonement, and that the way is prepared for ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and obtain remiſſion of ſins. What <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi>—what powerful motives are ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to induce ſinners to repentance, from hence! As alſo, from the <hi>love</hi> of GOD in the gift of his SON—from the <hi>free offer</hi> of mercy through him, and of the grace of the holy SRIRIT, the bleſſed effect of his purchaſe, the ſum of all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: Every argument, every motive thereto, centers in this; the <hi>death and reſurrection</hi> of CHRIST.</p>

You will not—you cannot excuſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from guilt in the ſight of GOD, in that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py affray.—If you had not an intention or thought of killing, yet, it was a haſty, raſh, &amp; unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deed; and you have cauſe for deep humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, before GOD, that you was the inſtrument of ſo ſuddenly putting an end to the life of your neighbour.—I fear you have not a proper ſenſe of the evil of ſin, and its deſtructive conſequences: For this, and all your ſins you need the mercy of GOD, to pardon you—you need an intereſt in the great ſacrifice of CHRIST, to expiate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your guilt: Without this, you remain under a ſentence of death ſtill, which, if executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you in the full extent, will not be a few ſtruggles of diſſolving nature, but a ſtate of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024540_0042_0FC7B0F23B4DD2E0"/>
without end, which is "the ſecond death;" dreadful, beyond the power of thought, in the preſent ſtate to conceive! "for the wages of ſin is death:" To this, you are expoſed, without a pardon from GOD.—Oh! prepare to meet your judge: Remember you muſt yet die; for it is appointed unto all: Be concerned to have your peace made with GOD. Seek for the remiſſion of your ſins. Be concerned to exerciſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which has been deſcribed; which is accompanied with faith in the great Redeemer; &amp; followed with an obedient life, which is "unto Salvation," and "not to be repented of." And ſee that you "bring forth fruits meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance." Carefully guard againſt the out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of paſſion; watch againſt haſty and raſh anger, which is productive of ſo fatal effects!</p>
            <p>CONSIDER, alſo, your need of the grace of GOD, to renew and ſanctify you; "giving you a new heart and putting a new ſpirit within you," thatyou may perform ſuch a ſervice to him as in his ſight will be accounted a religious ſervice,&amp; thro' his grace, in CHRIST, be entitled to the rewards of eternal life. Seek for this; attend diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the means of his appointment; &amp; improve the dealings of his providence, for ſo deſirable in end. Oh! ſeek earneſtly for the grace of GOD,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024540_0043_0FC7B0F7424010A8"/>
which, alone, is able to effect in you this great, this important change, that you may be ſafe and happy in life, and in death, and to eternity. Wherefore, to conclude, I would only add the words of the prophet to you, and to all whoſe character and condition call for the exhortation; <q>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our GOD, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>SOLEMN, intereſting, and affecting have been the ſcenes, which have paſſed before you, within theſe ſacred walls. You have ſeen the human judgment ſet, and the books opened. You have ſeen a fellow-mortal arraigned at the Bar, indicted for murder, the murder of his friend and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, convicted upon the indictment, by the judgment of his peers. You have heard the ſentence of death pronounced, in the moſt ſolemn and affecting manner, while every heart ſhuddered, and every eye wept. You have ſeen the unhappy Priſoner, wearing the badges of his guilt, from ſabbath to ſabbath preſented to worſhip before GOD, with the expectation that the ſentence would ſoon be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the proſpect of ſuch woe has been too great for him to bear; it has deranged his intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual faculties, and preſents him to us, in another view, an object of pity and compaſſion. Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this morning to improve theſe Providences, and to ſeek wiſdom and grace from him, who gives liberally and upbraids not, our ears have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the voice of pardon; we have ſeen the grace reſerved in the boſom of our Conſtitution called into exerciſe, the ſhackles knocked off, and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024540_0047_0FC7B1052FDE6118"/>
the Priſoner ſet at liberty. While we congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ourſelves, and one another, that the ſolemn e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this week is by this grace prevented, let us direct our meditations to the judgment that is to come, and, from an earthly tribunal, aſcend to that which is above, where we muſt be arraigned, and receive a decided ſentence. The words that are choſen as a motto to this diſcourſe are in the</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of JUDE, the latter part of the ſixth verſe.
<q>THE JUDGMENT OF THE GREAT DAY.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE <hi>is a ſpirit in man, and the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty giveth him underſtanding.</hi> We are made capable of reflecting upon events that are paſt, and of reviewing the way in which we have walked. We are alſo capable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating events certainly future, of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating ſcenes in which we muſt be actors, and of conſidering what manner of perſons we ought to be. In the due exerciſe of theſe faculties, conſiſts much of our duty, our wiſdom, and our happineſs.</p>
            <p>AMONG events that are future, the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and intereſting, are DEATH and JUDG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:024540_0048_0FC7B106680BF7E8"/>
IN the found human mind, there is no doubt, I believe, of the futurition of theſe events. We ſee that death paſſes upon all men. We feel the ſentence in ourſelves; and we muſt be ſtrangely inattentive, if we are not convinced, that <hi>the days approach that we muſt die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DEATH would not be ſo intereſtingly ſolemn and important, were it not for the judgment that follows, and the eternity that ſucceeds. If death put a period to our being, if all conſciouſneſs ceaſed with the laſt gaſp of life, though, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted as we are, we could not but ſtartle at <hi>this</hi> deſtruction, yet it would be our duty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get or brave the great event, and indulge our heart in all its joys: But the ſtroke that returns the body to the duſt, returns the immortal ſpirit to GOD who gave it, from him to receive a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſentence, according to its true character, and the deeds done in the body.</p>
            <p>DIVINE impreſſions cannot be wholly eraſed;
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>There's a divinity that ſtirs within us,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>That trembles at futurity,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>And intimates eternity to man.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Conſcience, the vicegerent of heaven in the human breaſt, though it may be benumbed by infidelity, ſtupified by ſenſuality, and have its ordinary voice drowned in carnal pleaſures, will ſometimes aſſert its dignity, arreſt the ſinner,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024540_0049_0FC7B109333E9F30"/>
and place him, trembling at the bar of GOD. There has been no nation ſo barbarous as not to acknowledge the being of a GOD; neither has there been any ſo inconſiſtent, as, with this acknowledgment, to deny him the right of governing and judging the creatures he has made, according to their capacities and deſerts. But it is not my deſign to offer proofs of a day of Judgment, GOD has written it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every man's conſcience, <hi>and given aſſurance unto all men in that he hath raiſed JESUS CHRIST from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My deſign is, to meditate a little upon the greatneſs of this day—To contemplate it with reference to our intereſt in it—and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make ſuch an improvement as may be profitable to us.</p>
            <p>WHILE I am ſpeaking, may that GOD, at whoſe tribunal we muſt appear, ſolemnize our minds, aid our meditations, and ſo realize to our view, the things we contemplate, that they may have a powerful practical influence upon us, and inſtrumentally prepare us to meet our JUDGE, "when he ſhall come to be gorified in his ſaints, and to be admired in all them that believe."</p>
            <p>THE ſoul, at death, returns to GOD who gave it, and there is, doubtleſs, ſomething like
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:024540_0050_0FC7B10BE237B848"/>
a ſentence, upon every ſoul, immediately after its departure from the body; or a ſecret conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs determines it to the place for which it is ſubjectively prepared. There is no intermediate ſtate, or ſeaſon of inſenſibility, between death &amp; the reſurrection, which would be a chaſm in ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al exiſtence; GOD, who is ſtill the GOD of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaac, and Jacob, is not the GOD of the dead; but of the living.</hi> The expiring SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR ſaid to the expiring thief—<hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> In the parable, which is given us for inſtruction upon this ſubject, it is ſaid—<hi>The beggar died, and was carried by Angels into Abraham's boſom. The rich man alſo died, and was buried: and in hell lift up his eyes, being in torments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſtate of happineſs of miſery, with every individual ſoul, commences at death: but in the end of time, when all the purpoſes of infinite wiſdom, as to this world, are accompliſhed, and the preſent frame of things is diſſolved, there will then be a day of general Judgment. Then will be exhibited all that is deſcribed in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pages, GOD will erect his tribunal, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his glory, and ſummon all his rational offspring to appear before him. This is, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, <hi>the day of Judgment,</hi> and is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:024540_0051_0FC7B1130307C5A8"/>
tended in the text. It may be thought, that the neceſſity of this day of general judgment is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded, if there is this particular prior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the day of death. Were the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the day of Judgment, to decide the fate of rational creatures, the thought would be juſt. But the object of that day is to vindicate the divine adminiſtration, and juſtify GOD in the deciſions he has made; diſcloſing, to the view of Angels and of men, what GOD has done, and wherefore he has done it: That every mouth may be ſtopped, and the <hi>Majeſty of Heaven</hi> appear, in this moſt glorious character, <hi>the juſt</hi> GOD, <hi>the</hi> SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>THIS will be, indeed, a great day. All its appendages conſpire to make it great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Being, who will then appear, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely great. He is no other than the LORD JESUS CHRIST; who is characterized, in the ſacred page, as the <hi>brightneſs of the Father's glory, the expreſs image of his perſon, in whom dwells the fulneſs of the godhead bodily.</hi> CHRIST, in himſelf, poſſeſſes every divine perfection. It is the will of heaven that all men ſhould honor the SON, even as they honor the FATHER; <hi>He is over all GOD bleſſed for ever.</hi> Once has he appeared in a ſtate of humiliation. The
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:024540_0052_0FC7B113EE3B3C50"/>
WORD was made fleſh and dwelt among us. He, who thought it no robbery to be equal with GOD, took the form of a ſervant, that he might finiſh the work which the myſterious counſels of heaven aſſigned him to do but, in his ſecond coming, he will exhibit all the majeſty of his character as the almighty GOD.</p>
            <p>THE favored Exile of Patmos, had, in viſion, a view of the glory of this divine perſonage, and, it was ſo overwhelming, he fell at his feet as dead, and, probably, never would have ariſen again, had <hi>he</hi> not laid his creating and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand upon him, and raiſed him up, Rev. i, 13—Farther, CHRIST is great with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the office which he ſuſtains, and which he will then come to execute.

This judgment is not upon the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or lives of men, but upon their ſouls—their everlaſting intereſts; they, whom the Judge ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, are made for ever; they, whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, are eternally undone: executing this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

Carnal reaſon ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns his diſpenſations, and boldly ſays, How can theſe things be? ſanctified reaſon ſtartles, is amazed, and, with David, its feet are almoſt gone, its ſteps do well nigh ſlip, while it ſees the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the righteous, and the proſperity of the wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But in that day, it will appear, that the <hi>Judge of all the earth, invariably, does right; and that mercy and truth go before his face.</hi> More particularly—There will be a judgment upon every one of our race.—"So then," ſaith the apoſtle, "We muſt, every one of us, give an account of himſelf to God," We muſt give an account of all the deeds done in the body.—The apoſtle John, who had this auguſt ſcene
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:024540_0058_0FC7B1295C6F8698"/>
repreſented to him in viſion, thus deſcribes it—"I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before GOD; and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which was the book of life, and the dead were judged out of the things that were written in the books, according to their works."</p>
            <p>IT has been a queſtion, whether the ſins of believers will be diſcloſed in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether they are not ſo obliterated, by the forgiving love of GOD, that, when ſought for, they ſhall not be found: there are ſome ſcripture expreſſions that favor this hypotheſis; ſuch as their being blotted out—being caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind GOD's back—being ſunk in the depths of the ſea—and remembered no more: But theſe expreſſions may be reconciled with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations that follow—"There is nothing covered that ſhall not be revealed; nor hid that ſhall not be known. If the chriſtian, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Chriſt, is ſaved the painful diſcloſure, the impenitent and unbelieving will have all things brought to light." "<hi>For GOD will bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing; and will judge the ſecrets of all hearts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the goſpel."</hi> Oh! what a revelation will that day exhibit! What crimes will be brought

That which has been ſpoken in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall be heard in the light; and that which has been ſpoken, in the ear, in cloſets, ſhall be proclaimed before the aſſembled univerſe. How awakening ought this conſideration to be, to the hypocritical profeſſor, and the ſecret ſinner! How may the following paſſage ſound like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his ears. <hi>"Be ſure your ſin will find you out."</hi> May GOD awaken you before it is too late.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE judgment of this day will be great, on account of the ſolemn and intereſting conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it.</p>
            <p>THE judgment of the great day, there is no poſſibility of eluding, and from it there lies no appeal. From ſome human tribunals there lie appeals, cauſes may be ſubject to reviſion; and in ſome caſes, as in that which has this day, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened us, mercy may be extended, where the law has condemned. The ſentence may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, pardon may be proclaimed, and the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling expectant of ignominious death may be reſtored to liberty and peace.

            <p>How great—how ſolemn—how intereſting is this important day! what are all other days, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this! In this day, my Brethren, muſt we all appear, and in the tranſactions of it be deeply intereſted. Every thing important to us will then be decided, and our ſtate unalterably fixed for a never-ending ETERNITY. <hi>Seeing we expect ſuch things, what manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

            <p>To ſtand arraigned at a human tribunal—to be ſurrounded with the guards and appendages of courts—to be the ſubject of criminal proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, eſpecially, to be tried for life—to be condemned in the trial, and hear the ſentence of death—how ſolemn! how affecting!—Of this ſcene you have been ſpectators—Thoſe walls have heard the awful ſentence.<note n="*" place="bottom">For the accommodation of ſpectators, and to add to the ſolemnity of the tranſaction, capital trials are ordinarily held in Churches, Mr. Abbot had his trial in York-Church, and there received ſentence of death.</note> To have this ſentence executed, the life cut off in the midſt, and cloſed in ignominy and reproach, is too dreadful for

Let your recollection of what is paſt, aid your imaginations as to what is future, and if an earthly tribunal is ſo ſolemn, think what muſt be the ſolemnity of the great day! The ſentence of mortals can only kill the body; it cannot go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the preſent life; There may be error in judgment, there is room for repentance, and the ſoul may be ſaved in the day of the LORD JESUS. But the trial in which we muſt ſtand, in the great day of Judgment, is upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and immortal ſoul—The ſentence, whether of acquittal or condenmnation, is for eternity—There is no appeal—There is no repentance.—The condemned ſhall <hi>go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi>

            <p>O how awfully ſolemn is this ſubject! How deeply ought it to intereſt our affections, and impreſs our minds! How awakening ſhould it be to all!

and ſecret, and have not repented and returned to give GOD glory. Suffer me to addreſs you, O impenitent unbelievers, and in the bowels of compaſſion, entreat you to awake and conſider your ſituation. You may be putting far away this evil day, and boaſting yourſelves of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow. You may be flattering yourſelves in the ſecrecy of your ſins, or in their not having equalled, in their aggravations, the ſins of many others.—You may be crying peace and ſafety, and delighting yourſelves in your deluſions—But, know, aſſuredly, <hi>the day of the LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the Judgment of the great day.</hi> It is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of your ſafety, and will be no mean of your ſecurity, that you are unconcerned.

What will you do when the exerciſes of your hearts, and the actions of your lives are compared with the ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and demands of the divine law? <hi>When he, who has looked upon a woman to luſt after her, will be ſtiled an Adulterer. He who has hated his brother in his heart, will be convicted of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and he who has ſaid, thou fool, will be in danger of hell-fire?</hi> Think, O thou, who haſt held the balances of deceit, who haſt defrauded and oppreſſed, embezzled and concealed, what thou wilt do in this revealing day! However you may walk concealed from men, theſe things committed, and unrepented of, will appear in the day of viſitation. What will you anſwer? What plea will you make? Will you ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your defence, and ſtrike hands with GOD? Your own conſciences will be inſtead of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand witneſſes and accuſers.

               <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all the nations that forget GOD.

And he will render indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, to every ſoul of man, that doth evil, to the Jew firſt and alſo to the Gentile.</hi> Say I theſe things, as a man? both law and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſay the ſame.

And can you expect to endure this ſentence?—Oh! what an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! or do you hope to obtain a deliverance from it? ſuch a hope is built on the ſand, it will be as the ſpider's web. The whole appearance of revelation, in its plain and obvious import, is, that as it is a ſolemn, ſo it will be a final, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive ſentence, and if you are ſo unhappy, as to be condemned in the Judgment, you are undone forever: ETERNITY is written on your awſul ſtate.</p>

KNOWING theſe terrors of the LORD, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of them than barely reading them in the bible with the coldneſs of ſpeculation, I would warn you of them: I would faithfully declare them before you, and perſuade you to flee from this <hi>wrath to come;</hi> that you may be hid in the day of the LORD's anger; for yet there is hope concerning you, if you will be arouſed.</p>
            <p>YOUR condition, my friends, is dangerous, but it is not deſperate—It is yet an accepted time, and a day of Salvation—You are on pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ground—You have a ſpace for repentance—The throne of grace is acceſſible—You have an ADVOCATE with the FATHER—You have the offers of mercy—GOD, though not ſlack concerning his promiſes, as ſome men count ſlackneſs, <hi>is long-ſuffering, not willing that any ſhould periſh; but that all ſhould come to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE blood of CHRIST is ſufficient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all your guilt, to cancel all your crimes, and take out all your ſtains. It was ſufficient to juſtify the humbled Manaſſah, who had ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs; and who had made the people of Iſrael to do worſe than the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then—to purge away the pollutions of a Mary Magdalene, and the crimſoned guilt of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying

Jews. <hi>The blood of JESUS CHRIST cleanſeth from all ſin—And he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt: But there is ſalvation in no other: And they who will not that he ſhould reign over them, will be brought forth and ſlain before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BE intreated then, my friends, to attend to your ſituation. No longer continue in ſin—No longer diſſemble or conceal your ſins—<hi>Do not bleſs yourſelves in your heart, and ſay you ſhall have peace though you walk in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your heart. The</hi> LORD <hi>will not ſpare</hi>—Come to the feet of JESUS, and make a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, frank, and penitent confeſſion of your ſins. See how your ſins have deceived you, and how they have ſlain you. Break off any in which you may be conſcious that you are now living, and yield yourſelves up to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to be diſpoſed of by him. <hi>Let the wicked ferſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our GOD, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Put forth all the ardor of your ſouls, for ſpiritual bleſſings. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate</hi>—to poſſeſs and exerciſe that repentance which we have heard ſo largely deſcribed. Be ſatiſfied with nothing ſhort of vital union with the LORD

JESUS CHRIST by faith. See that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the regenerating influences of the HOLY SPIRIT—a ſealed pardon of all your ſins, and that you ſecure an inheritance, among them that are ſanctified. Give not ſleep to your eyes, nor ſlumber to your eye-lids, 'till you have made ſome ſerious effort to eſcape from hell and fly to heaven. Let me addreſs you, as the angel did Lot, and ſay, <hi>Eſcape for thy life, look not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee, neither tarry thou in all the plain—eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape to the mountains, leſt thou be conſumed.</hi>

            <p>WILL you ſay the Preacher is warm—and is there not a cauſe? Can I addreſs you in the coldneſs of ſpeculation, when viewing myſelf and you on the borders of Eternity? It would be improper to preach my life away in a ſmooth moral harangue and entertain you with pretty ſentiments when your ſouls are at ſtake. This would be indeed <hi>to fix pillows under arm-holes, and wrap your blood in my ſkirts.</hi> You have ſeen this our fellow-mortal tried for his life: Did you think his advocates too warm, when their ſouls were on fire, and they poured fourth the tide of eloquence to obtain a favorable ſentence? It was only his life for which they plead; that which muſt be ſoon given up if now it were preſerved. But, my Brethren, your ſoul is the object of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024540_0069_0FC7B15342F1C4D8"/>
that precious immortal principle which muſt exiſt forever, and unleſs you repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in CHRIST, muſt exiſt in miſery. Is it poſſible to be too much engaged for ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in ſuch circumſtances? Let me then urge and entreat you, by all that is intereſting and important in time and eternity, by the value you ſet upon your own ſouls, by the mercies of GOD, and the blood of the Croſs, to break off your ſins by repentance, and lay hold on eternal life. Fly to the SAVIOUR, and yield yourſelves up as condemned malefactors, yet hoping in his mercy, that he will forgive your ſins, cancel all your guilt, and reſcue you from condemnation. If you do, truly, repent, and believe in CHRIST, the proſpect of this day and its intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, will be gloriouſly changed; for its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſoften into the moſt pleaſing ſolemnity, in the view and expectation of the aſſured chriſtian. For though he is conſcious that he has commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſin, and that he merits nothing at the hands of GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet being alſo conſcious that he has ſied for refuge to the hope of the GOSPEL, that his taſte and views are changed, that he has come over into his Saviour's intereſt, has judged and condemned himſelf, &amp; is united to CHRIST

by a living faith—being comfortably perſuaded of this mighty change, he knows, that there <hi>is no condemnation due unto him.</hi> He ſees an infinite fulneſs in CHRIST to ſecure and defend him, and the proſpect of the Judgment awakens ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in his breaſt ſimilar to thoſe which the SAVIOUR encouraged, when he ſaid, <hi>When theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE aſſured believers in CHRIST look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this auguſt ſeaſon, as the time of their complete deliverance; when their poor bodies of humiliation, that have long been kept, by the care of heaven, in the bed of death, ſhall be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>incorruptible,</hi> be faſhioned like to CHRIST's <hi>glorious body</hi> and being re-united with their alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy glorified ſpirits, they ſhall be confirmed in happineſs, ſuited to their natures, and eternal as their duration.—Though it does not yet appear what they ſhall be, they, nevertheleſs, know, <hi>that when he who is their life ſhall appear, they ſhall be like him for they ſhall ſee him as he is, and ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi> The trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Archangel, which will be a terror to the wicked, will be muſic in their ears; With tranſport they will echo to theſe accents from heaven, <hi>Awake and ſing ye that dwell in duſt.</hi>

ESPECIALLY is the proſpect of this glorious day, ſupportingly pleaſant to the perſecuted ſaint, who ſuffers unjuſtly from the hands of men.</p>
            <p>MANY of the faithful ſervants of GOD have had their judgment taken away, in the preſent life. They have been loaded with reproach which they did not deſerve, and hiſſed from the ſtage where they ought to have been applauded: But in that day GOD <hi>will bring forth their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the light, and their judgment as the noon day.</hi> And having in this trying particular had fellowſhip with CHRIST, in his ſufferings, they will alſo have fellowſhip with him in his glory. Farther,</p>
            <p>As the glory of GOD is a dear object with the Saints, and their hearts are pained with the reflections that are caſt upon him, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, they rejoice in the proſpect of that glorious ſeaſon, when all theſe reflections ſhall be wiped away, with tranſport will they hear, and with rapture will they join, in this heavenly Allelujah, <hi>Salvation, and glory, and honor, and power unto the LORD our GOD, for true and righteous are his judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ye believers, ye friends of JESUS—This will be to you a moſt glorious day. The day of your complete triumph. You will reap the

            <p>IT will be expected, I preſume, before I cloſe my diſcourſe, that a few thoughts ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the unhappy man who is the ſpecial occaſion of our aſſembling. Among the infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which have attended the ſcenes through which the Priſoner has paſſed, it is not the leaſt, that his ideas have become ſo confuſed and deranged, that, at preſent, he ſeems ſcarcely capable of moral inſtruction. We hope the happy change in his ſtate will be attended with as happy a one in his mind, and that he may yet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and uſeful.</p>
            <p>MY Friend, We view you this day with the mixed emotions of joy and ſorrow, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but mingle condolence with our congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. You have known what it is to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned at a human tribunal—to be tried for your life, upon a moſt awful indictment—to be found guilty, in the judgment of your peers—and to have the dreadful ſentence of death pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024540_0073_0FC7B15FB3D5F948"/>
upon you. You have been bound in affliction and iron, becauſe of your tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and your friends have trembled for your approaching fate: But, in the myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence of GOD, events have been ſo ordered, that the grace of the Commonwealth is extended to your caſe, and his EXCELLENCY the GOVERNOR, and the HONORABLE COUNCIL, have granted you a free and full pardon. We have ſeen your badges of infamy knocked off, and you ſat at liberty. We congratulate you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this happy change. How thankful ought you to be to your great deliverer—to him who brings the priſoner out of the priſon-houſe—and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the ſhadows of death into the light of the morning. What emotions of gratitude ſhould ariſe in your breaſt toward thoſe who have ſo deeply intereſted themſelves in your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. You can never think of the names of LYMAN, SEWALL, PARSONS, or DAVIS, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the tear of ſenſibility trickling down your cheeks. Your ſpared life ſhould be ſpent in praiſing your deliverer, &amp; praying for your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors: In endeavouring to leſſen the injury you have done, by ſoftening the ſorrows of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and fatherleſs, reduced to this unhappy ſtate in your impaſſioned moments. But, eſpecially,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024540_0074_0FC7B1611FB2BF00"/>
ſhould the life, which you have now a proſpect of enjoying, be ſpent in preparing for that more ſolemn trial which yet awaits you. For, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Sir, you muſt yet ſtand at the <hi>tribunal</hi> of JEHOVAH. The pardon you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved extends no farther than to acquit you of your offence againſt the laws of your ſellow-men.—<hi>None can forgive ſins but GOD only.</hi> If the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray with your neighbor was ſo circumſtanced as to reduce your crime below the letter of the indictment, you muſt be ſenſible that there was great criminality in your conduct. A friend, a fellow-mortal, has been hurried into eternity, in an impaſſioned moment, by your deadly weapon.—Think how you will meet him at the bar of GOD. Or how you will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before him who hath ſaid, <hi>He that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with his brother without a cauſe, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Judgment—And he that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his heart, is a murderer.</hi> It will be of little conſequence to be pardoned of men, if you are not pardoned of GOD: to be acquitted now, if you are condemned in the judgment of the great day.</p>
            <p>LET me then entreat you, if you are capable of receiving the exhortation, to think ſeriouſly of your ſituation. Improve the reſpite granted you, to repent ſincerely of this and all your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:024540_0075_0FC7B16B755D25E8"/>
