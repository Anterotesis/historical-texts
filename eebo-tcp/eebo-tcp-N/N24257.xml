            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>ECCLESIASTES IX.I.</bibl>
                  <p>—The Righteous, and the Wiſe, and their Works, are in the hand of God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE uniformity of the divine diſpenſations towards the righteous, and the wicked, was to Aſaph, as he informs us in the 73d Pſalm, a ſource of great perplexity and diſtreſs. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he was deeply, and for a long time, employed in meditating on this myſterious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and, the more he conſidered it, the more he doubted and deſponded. Reduced, at length, to a ſtate bordering on agony and deſpair, he exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>From the proſperity of the wicked, and his own great adverſity, he was led ultimately to indulge theſe unhappy ſentiments, and to feel as if God had no reſt, no kindneſs, no peculiar care, for righteous men. This dangerous miſtake was however rectified, and theſe cenſurable feelings were removed, when he afterwards went to the ſanctuary of God. Then underſtood he the end of the wicked. He ſaw them ſet in ſlippery pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ready to be caſt down to deſtruction. He
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032069_0004_0FF10F4241E52F08"/>
ſaw, that whatever apparent errors were found in the diſpenſations of God, in the preſent world, would be finally proved not to be errors, by their connection with future diſpenſations; that the Providence of God was one great ſcheme, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through time, and through eternity; that the parts of it, exiſting here, were to be explained by their conſequences, exiſting hereafter; that, thus explained, all would be, and would be found to be, right; and that God would appear, as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf, and as a perfect Being muſt be, the uniform friend of the Righteous, and the uniform enemy of the impenitently Wicked.</p>
            <p>Solomon, a man of more extenſive views, cloſe obſervation, and profound reſearch, than Aſaph, and aſſiſted by the very diſcoveries made to Aſaph, was enabled by the Divine Spirit to form more comprehenſive, and more accurate ideas of this myſterious ſubject. Calmly and carefully exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the circumſtances of men, and the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, he ſaw clearly, that "all things come alike to all; and that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked." With theſe views he alſo determined eaſily and certainly, that there is "no knowledge of the love or hatred" of God to any perſon "by all" that part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence "which is before us"—by his proſperity, or his adverſity; and that he may be in either of theſe ſituations, and ſtill be wicked, or ſtill be righteous.</p>
            <p>For all theſe things Solomon alſo diſcovered a reaſon, which ſatisfied him of the propriety of ſuch a ſyſtem of diſpenſations; viz. that all theſe things are in the hand of God. This Infinite Being, who rules all things, the greateſt and the leaſt, the beſt and the worſt, alike, with univerſal and irreſiſtible
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032069_0005_0FF10F4DC1D6CB70"/>
dominion, rules them, alſo, with a government perfectly wiſe and good. In the hand, and under the management, of ſuch a Being, nothing, which is wrong, whatever may be the appearance to us, can exiſt; and nothing, which is right, and upon the whole deſirable, can fail to he accompliſhed. Things, which to our Minds are ſtrange and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing, do indeed exiſt in immenſe multitudes. But this ought to be expected. The works of an infinitely wiſe and powerful Being muſt of courſe tranſcend our comprehenſion. They muſt ſuit the nature, the ſkill, wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, of ſuch a Being, and muſt wear the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and proofs of his Character. Such a Character, we know, is far removed from our comprehenſion; the particular diſplays of ſuch a Character muſt, therefore, be often equally incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. The works of ſuch a Being muſt be deſigned to reach, either in their nature, or in their conſequences, through eternity and immenſity. Hence the propriety of their exiſtence muſt, in a great meaſure, depend on things wholly unknown to us, and muſt, in a great meaſure, be hidden from our fight.</p>
            <p>No works of God ought to be expected to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of this myſterious character more than his diſpenſations to the righteous, and to the wicked. Moral beings are formed for endleſs duration; and all diſpenſations towards them muſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, have a future reference, and involve conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which will extend through eternity. Hence all the Providence of God reſpecting ſuch beings muſt be in the number of the moſt myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious and incomprehenſible events. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and perplexities found in this ſubject ought then to be conſidered as things of courſe, as things neceſſarily ariſing from the nature of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:032069_0006_0FF10F9BC9CA5518"/>Solomon has, therefore, exhibited this ſubject in the manner, which is moſt proper, moſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with truth, and moſt adapted to quiet unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and relieve perplexity. We do not, indeed, ſee the reaſons, why things are as they are; but we ſee ſufficient reaſons to believe, that, though thus unknown, they are wiſely ordered, and will terminate in the moſt deſirable manner.</p>
            <p>Among the myſterious diſpenſations of God to the righteous, and the wicked, the prolongation of the lives of the wicked, when uſeleſs, and when noxious to ſociety, and the untimely termination of the lives of the righteous, when moſt uſeful, has, to me at leaſt, ſeemed peculiarly perplexing. The wicked often live to annoy and diſtreſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and live to advanced age, ſafe from ſickneſs, accident, and violence; while the righteous, not unfrequently, are cut off in the morning, or in the meridian, of their uſefulneſs; when all their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, their knowledge, experience, and wiſdom, their virtue, weight, and influence, are in their full ſtrength, and appear to have riſen to this height, only to be deſtroyed. In this ſituation the Mind, adopting the words of Inſpiration, ſlightly altered, almoſt inſtinctively cries, "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou made ſuch men in vain?"</p>
            <p>To remove theſe impreſſions, and to introduce into their place ſuch, as are more juſt and evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, is the object of this diſcourſe, and the drift of the text, on which it is founded. If the melancholy event, which has called together this Aſſembly, has affected them in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch thoughts, as it has affected me, ſcarcely any ſubject can be more ſuited to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. The deceaſed was taken from the world in the full ſtrength of all his uſefulneſs, and while
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032069_0007_0FF10F916323AE88"/>
employing all his faculties in the great buſineſs of doing extenſive good. In the view of ſuch an event the ſerious Mind ſearches for a ſatisfying cauſe of the diſpenſation, and is ready to ſpend its thoughts, if not in murmuring and repining, yet in uſeleſs wonder, and cenſurable perplexity.</p>
            <p>To diſpel theſe thoughts, and the emotions ſpringing from them, no conſideration can operate ſo effectually as that, ſuggeſted by Solomon in the text. "The Righteous, and the Wiſe, and their works, are in the hand of God." To a coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with me in this opinion my Audience may perhaps be advantageouſly led by the following obſervations, in which I ſhall endeavour to ſtate the real force of this important declaration.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, it teaches us, that there is no reaſon why we ſhould wonder, that they are ſo diſpoſed of, or that their concerns are ordered in ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>In the great kingdom of the univerſe purpoſes infinitely numerous, and infinitely important, are to be accompliſhed, of which we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. As the purpoſes are unknown to us, ſo the proper means of accompliſhing them are alſo unknown. If we knew the ends, we ſhould probably often ſee the means to be proper, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the end. The uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God intends to make of the righteous and their works, when he removes them from the preſent world, we cannot know. It lies beyond the grave, in a world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, in a ſtate unknown. Were we acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that world, with the ſtate of intellectual ſociety in it, and with the employments and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the inhabitants, the difficulties, attending ſuch events of Providence, as reſpect them, might probably vaniſh; but, while theſe things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032069_0008_0FF10F37C224CC30"/>
we can form no judgment of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or impropriety, of ſuch meaſures. In the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the caſe, therefore, we ſee ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to determine, that God muſt, of courſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Providence in this reſpect, in a manner myſterious to us. That it ſhould be myſterious is wholly to be expected, and that it ſhould not be myſterious cannot rationally be expected. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, therefore, of wondering why this part of Divine Providence is myſterious, we ought rather to wonder if at any time we ſee it diveſted of myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. The diſpenſations are myſterious, becauſe they are the works of God, becauſe they are plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and executed by an infinite Mind, and becauſe they reach in their conſequences throughout e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. The ways of ſuch a Being reaching through ſuch an extent muſt be neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to beings of yeſterday, who know comparatively nothing. With this conſideration in view, our doubts, of this nature, retire of courſe, our perplexities vaniſh, our fears, that the world is not wiſely and happily governed, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and our murmuring againſt that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is effectually prevented.</p>
            <p>Aſaph, had he thus thought, and thought as extenſively as Solomon appears to have done, would never have concluded, that he had cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart in vain. With his excellent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would willingly have left the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, unknown as it was, to the diſpoſal of God, and reſted quietly on his wiſdom, equity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the univerſe. All who are like Aſaph in diſpoſition, will, if they remember, and realize, tne declaration of Solomon, entertain the ſame views, and experience the ſame reſignation.</p>
            <p n="2">2ndly. The ſame declaration aſſures us, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032069_0009_0FF10F50F888D2F8"/>
the Righteous are diſpoſed of by deſign, and not by accident, and according to the pleaſure of God, and not of any other.</p>
            <p>We are accuſtomed frequently to call the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence by names, very ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their real character. We ſtile them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and contingencies, good and ill luck, good and ill fortune, happy and unhappy chances. Our ſucceſs and our diſappointments, we attribute to our forecaſt and prudence, or to the want of them, to our induſtry and exertions, or to our negligence and ſloth, or to an unknown ſomewhat, which we term nature, fortune, or chance. With ſuch words in our mouths, and the correſponding ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in our hearts, we often boaſt of our attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and glory in our talents and efforts.</p>
            <p>Our wiſdom and energy have, at times, unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably a ſhare in effectuating the good, which we enjoy; as our folly and indolence have in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing the evil which we ſuffer. God uſes us as his inſtruments in promoting his deſigns. His kingdom is a kingdom of means, in which the faculties and exertions of his creatures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually employed by him to accompliſh his own glorious purpoſes. At the ſame time it is ſtill true, that "a man's goings are of the Lord." Paul at the utmoſt can only plant; Apollos can only water; God, and God only can give the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. Pride and boaſting have, therefore, no foundation in the nature of things. Reaſon, as well as Revelation, ſays, "Let him, that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, glory in the Lord."</p>
            <p>Providence, while it employs our faculties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences alſo by ten thouſand unforeſeen events our various purpoſes, directs our ſteps, and regulates our lot, both in the preſent and future world.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032069_0010_0FF10F43D45D3608"/>
A ſtroke of lightning, the ſtumbling of a horſe, a defect in a bridge, a leak in a ſhip, a worm, a fly; an atom, have deeply affected the affairs of men, diſconcerted ambitious deſigns, ruined vaſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and changed wholly the ſtate of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, nations, and ages. Creatures, on whom theſe things can ſo greatly operate, ought to be far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from boaſting of themſelves, or of their attainments.</p>
            <p>Luck, fortune, chance, and accident, are names, which, if ſeriouſly uſed, have no meaning. Not a ſparrow falls to the ground without our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father. Not a hair leſs, nor more, than the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted number, is found on our heads. All things are providential; all are of God; all are the reſult of wiſdom, contrivance and determination. The leaſt ſuſtain this character as truly as the greateſt. From this the only juſt view of events the mind is naturally and greatly led off by a cuſtomary uſe of the language, which I have reprobated.</p>
            <p>Whether we are diſpoſed to this method of conſidering events, or not, we cannot heſitate to regard in this manner thoſe events, which reſpect the righteous, if we receive and realize the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They, and their works, their talents, and their intereſts, are in the hand of God. Nothing, which befals them, can be the reſult of accident. Every thing, on the contrary, muſt be foreſeen, choſen, and provided for, and of courſe is adopted from full knowledge of the propriety of its exiſtence.</p>
            <p>As God is the ſupreme, and all preſent, as well all knowing diſpoſer, ſo nothing can befal the righteous, but in accordance with his will, and as the reſult of his pleaſure. The oppoſing wiſhes, aims, and efforts, of other beings are here exerted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032069_0011_0FF10F46E8960F78"/>
in vain. "My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure"—"I work, and who ſhall let it?" —is his own language on this ſubject. None can let, i. e. hinder, his work. Every dictate of that counſel, however minute, will be exactly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Theſe declarations, true as applied to all things, have a peculiar ground of truth as applied to the righteous. He, who attends ſo minutely to ſparrows, as to number their days, and limit their lives by exact bounds; who ſuffers not a hair of our heads to fall without his providence; knows perfectly, that righteous men, rational, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and deſtined to dignified employments and endleſs happineſs, are of more value than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſparrows. Raiſed by their character, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſervices, to that rank of being, in which he vouchſafes to call them his friends, they are had in everlaſting remembrance. No mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fleets through the reign of time ſo rapidly, no period rolls ſo diſtantly in eternity, as ever to occaſion them to be forgotten. Every thing which they do, and every thing which they need, is freſh in the Infinite Mind; the former will be certainly and bountifully rewarded; the latter will be punctually and amply beſtowed.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. That the Righteous are diſpoſed of with equity.</p>
            <p>"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" is a queſtion, carrying its anſwer in itſelf to the conſcience and conviction of every conſiderate man. Injuſtice finds here no room for admiſſion, even in thought. The proofs of the juſtice of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſpenſation, indeed, may not, and often will not appear; but the proofs, that all, which is done by God, is done with perfect juſtice, are too plain, and too concluſive, to need a refutation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:032069_0012_0FF10F93458252F8"/>Scarcely more neceſſary is it to mention the amazing importance of this conſideration. The terrible effects of injuſtice, even in an earthly rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are ſo dreaded by all men, as to create, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they appear, the greateſt agitation and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. No human convulſions have more ſhaken, or aſtoniſhed, the world than thoſe, which have chiefly originated from this cauſe. Thrones have been ſubverted, rulers deſtroyed, oceans of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure expended, and oceans of blood poured out, to avert, or to remedy, the evil.</p>
            <p>On known and exact juſtice all men, on the contrary, wholly and comfortably rely for ſuch deciſions and meaſures, as are moſt intereſting to their wellbeing. All men alſo, who are not themſelves unjuſt, acquieſce in ſuch meaſures and deciſions, as are ſeen to be juſt; nor can a higher commendation be given, nor a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duty required of him, who ruleth over men, than that <hi>he</hi> is, or <hi>muſt be, juſt ruling in the fear of God.</hi> So high a place, indeed, does the virtue of juſtice, or righteouſneſs, hold, that it is perhaps, as often as any other, made to ſtand as a deſcription of all that is virtuous. The Text is one example, and the pages of Scripture teem with innumerable others.</p>
            <p>In the Infinite Ruler this glorious attribute claims an infinite diſtinction. From all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of earthly rulers, as well as from private wrong, there is beyond the grave, a final appeal. There a tribunal is erected, at which, there a Judge exiſts, before whom, every wrong, ſuffered here, will be redreſſed, and every right denied or wreſted here, will be ſecured. Fraud may here plunder, luſt pollute, ambition enſlave, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty torture; but the victim will there find a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032069_0013_0FF10F610AC82990"/>
remedy for his wrongs, and an ample recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe rendered into the boſom of his enemies. The poor, the deluded, and the ſuffering, will there be gloriouſly exalted, and the proud man fall, and the mighty man be brought low before them. This is the final ſolace for every preſent wrong, the refuge, the home, of the perſecuted and oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>But from that tribunal there is no appeal. Whatever deciſions are there given will be ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate deciſions. No future, wiſer, juſter judge is yet behind, to reviſe and correct the errors there committed, or to redreſs wrongs there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Eternity is written on every ſentence, and immutability inſtamped on every allotment. How dreadful, beyond meaſure, in this caſe would be injuſtice? injuſtice remedileſs and hopeleſs? Through what a duration would it extend, with what knowledge would it be contrived, with what power would it be enforced? The Creation would be one great priſon, clanking with the chains, and echoing the groans, of agony and deſpair.</p>
            <p>Againſt all theſe wrongs, againſt every wrong, all creatures are by the perfect juſtice of God wholly ſecured. The Righteous, particularly, neither in their death, nor in their future being, will find a right invaded, or an injury done. The determinations of God will command their entire approbation, and reflect the higheſt glory on his government. To all that he orders, and to all that he does, Wiſdom and Virtue will ſubjoin their ſolemn Amen.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That they are diſpoſed of with wiſdom.</p>
            <p>By this obſervation I intend, that in the diſpoſal of the righteous valuable ends are propoſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. No caprice, prejudice, or paſſion,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032069_0014_0FF0D3ACACDF0B98"/>
is indulged or gratified. On the contrary, with a complete knowledge of all that is practicable, neceſſary, or deſirable, and a diſpoſition to purſue that, and that only, which is moſt deſirable, a plan is formed and purſued, by which, in the moſt direct manner, the purpoſe will be certainly brought to paſs.</p>
            <p>The ends, which are here in view, reſpect both the individuals, who are the immediate ſubjects of the diſpoſal, and their fellow creatures, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly are found both in the preſent and the future world.</p>
            <p>We are not uſually able to trace with preciſion the ends, which are by theſe diſpenſations to be accompliſhed, in the preſent world; yet we have ſufficient reaſon to believe, that ſuch ends are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in view, and are actually accompliſhed. All events, here, lead to thoſe, which follow them; and they to others, in perpetual progreſs. In ſome caſes we are able, at leaſt in an imperfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to perceive the connection and deſign. This, however, can never be done, until the events re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, have taken place. The foreſight of man reaches but a little diſtance, and that diſtance in a manner very imperfect. Future objects are involved in miſt and obſcurity; and the human eye, when it ſees them at all, ſees them in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive colours, and of forms and ſizes, which mock detection, and elude inquiry.</p>
            <p>The wiſdom, virtue, friendſhip, inſtructions, and example, of a righteous man obviouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, after his deceaſe, greater effects on thoſe, whom he leaves behind him, in many inſtances at leaſt, than the ſame cauſes produced, when he was living. Dying words are always affecting words; and the inſtructions of a righteous man,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032069_0015_0FF10F6327856A98"/>
who has left the world, poſſeſs the character, and the power, of dying words. They are remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with more care and ſolemnity, and felt with greater force, than when he was alive. When he was preſent and acting with us, when his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts at times claſhed, or were thought to claſh, with ours, when by his example he caſt a ſhade on our conduct and character, and when with his voice he reproved and reſtrained our faults, we naturally became impatient, cool, unfriendly, and prejudiced. His worth in our minds was leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or denied; his inſtructions doubted and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; and his perſon viewed with diſlike, and even with malignity. But when he is gone, our prejudices ceaſe. We call to mind his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with a more candid ſpirit, and view his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct without the intervention of ſelfiſh intereſts. Many things, which in his life he ſaid, and did, and which were then unfavourably received by us, are now acknowledged to be true, juſt, and important. His whole character becomes thus more amiable and excellent in our view, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands more extenſively our reverence and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From one righteous man the tranſition is eaſy to others, and to all; and from them our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is naturally extended to their diſtinguiſhing attribute. Righteouſneſs, which makes them the peculiar objects of our regard, becomes itſelf more valuable in our eyes; and gives birth to a train of ſentiments in our minds, which not unfrequently grow into reformation and excellence of life.</p>
            <p>This is but one of the numerous important ends, accompliſhed in this world by the removal of the righteous. Not unfrequently are they removed from this world, that they may be taken away from the evil to come. From ſin and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032069_0016_0FF10F55B5E9A2C0"/>
from toil and ſorrow, from the degeneracy of their children and the miſeries of their friends, from the ſufferings of their country and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the church of Chriſt, a deliverance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably deſirable is granted to them by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely merciful God. Their bodies reſt from their labours in the peaceful grave, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, aſcending to the manſions of eternal quiet, gain a ſimilar releaſe from the bondage of ſin. From every ſnare, and every enemy, they finally eſcape, and calumny, injuſtice, and envy, follow them with eyes vainly malignant, and with curſes that roar unheard and unregarded.</p>
            <p>When perſons of high eminence for talents and virtue have long acted a conſpicuous part on the ſtage of life, and appear to be neceſſary to the well-being of mankind, God not unfrequently intends, when he calls them away, to ſhew the ſurviving world, that he is perfectly able to carry on the deſigns of his providence without their agency. The importance of individuals to the ſyſtem of things riſes, at times, too high in the public eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and prompts us to forget the all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of God, in the ſtrong ſenſe we entertain of the excellence of men. This, though a natural, is an unhappy error, and is often beſt eradicated by the removal of thoſe, who have innocently and virtuouſly contributed to its exiſtence.</p>
            <p>In many inſtances he teaches us in an affecting manner, that we have regarded the deceaſed with affections undue and unwarrantable. Good men can be loved too much. Among the numberleſs idols of the human heart, they, not unfrequently, find a place. To love them is felt to be juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and known to be commanded. The mind, conſcious of rectitude in this indulgence of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032069_0017_0FF10F6A2B864DB0"/>
is frequently inattentive to the danger of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging it to exceſs. A darling child, a venerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent, a beloved huſband, or wife, ſteals, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, the heart from God; and often renders the return difficult, perhaps impoſſible, without a removal of the idolized object.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the contrary evil is not leſs frequent, or unhappy. The value of righteous men is often unſeen, neglected, and deſpiſed; their ſervices are requited with obloquy and unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and their perſons are made the objects of hatred, abuſe, and perſecution. No inhabitant of Sodom was probably leſs eſteemed, or befriended, than Lot; and no Iſraelite of his time than Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah. From men thus diſpoſed the righteous are removed, in judgment. Nor is the judgment leſs, becauſe it is unregarded, or regarded with pleaſure. The death of a good man, which is conſidered by us as a benefit, will on that account prove the more certainly a curſe. The hardneſs of heart, which is thus manifeſted, is of all curſes the moſt dreadful, and by the very event, which excites our pleaſure, is ſurely and dreadfully increaſed.</p>
            <p>This detail might be eaſily extended beyond the limits of your patience. The inſtances already mentioned are ſufficient to illuſtrate the point in diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>Of the particular ends, deſigned at in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture world, by the removal of good men from this, we know nothing. A general exhibition, only, is made to us in the ſcriptures, of the ſtate of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the grave. From this we are aſſured, that their tranſlation to that world is intended to accompliſh purpoſes, in the higheſt degree impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and deſirable. None, there, are idle, or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; but all are far more active, able, and uſeful,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032069_0018_0FF10FA8164A2570"/>
than they could have been here. Superiour pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, directed to ſublimer objects, and actuated by more excellent diſpoſitions, are there engaged in nobler exertions, and more dignified employments. To theſe exertions, and employments, they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſummoned by their Maker, and enter upon a career of more diſtinguiſhed uſefulneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their fellow creatures, and their God, which will know no end</p>
            <p n="5">5. That they are diſpoſed of with kindneſs and mercy.</p>
            <p>We know, ſaith the Apoſtle, that all things do work (or labour) together, for good to them that love God; to them who are the called, according to his purpoſe. This is the end of the united labours of all beings, and all events, of God, and of good and evil beings in his creation. In the hands of a Being, who has contrived, and who is directing, all things for this glorious end, thoſe who love him cannot but find unſpeakable good will manifeſted in every employment, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concern.</p>
            <p>From this world of toil, of ſorrow, and of ſin, they are removed forever. No more ſhall their ſtrength be waſted by wearineſs, their health im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by langour and pain, or their comfort and peace deſtroyed by enemies and dangers. No more ſhall their eyes be pained by the ſight of families corrupted, perverſe, and hopeleſs; of friends ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from God, religion, and life; and of a world in guilt and ruin. No more ſhall they be called to war with luſt, to ſtruggle with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to endure the ſtings of ſcorn, the ſhafts of malice, or the iron hand of oppreſſion. Their hearts ſhall no more be wounded by conſcious guilt, and ſhameful backſliding. When they take
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032069_0019_0FF10F585E95E520"/>
their flight from this great priſon, they will bid a final adieu to every enemy and evil, and ſee the diſtance between themſelves and their enemies widening forever. Toil, pain, ſorrow, fear, and death, time, temptation, and ſin, recede from their flight, and the tumult roar, and rage, behind them in vain.</p>
            <p>In the mean time they aſcend to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their final home. In his children they find none but friends, from his hand no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication but of love, and in his houſe nothing but joy. With expanded minds, and purified hearts, with ſtrength incapable of decay, and activity ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to fatigue, they enter on a courſe of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perpetually enlarging. Ranſomed of the Lord, returned and come to Zion with ſongs and everlaſting joy upon their heads, they are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſons, and kings, and prieſts, to God the Father, and live and reign with him forever and ever.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, whom they leave behind them, will, if informed with the evangelical ſpirit, and regarding the ſolemn diſpenſation with attentive wiſdom, ſhare in the kindneſs, of which their deceaſed friends ſo largely partake.</p>
            <p>The grave of a good man is one of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all earthly objects. We there behold the end of the courſe even of virtuous life; of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as well as of ambition; of worth as well as of wickedneſs. The humble origin of man is there traced in our kindred to corruption, to worms, and to duſt. There we ſummon up to ſolemn view the trials, the labours, and the excellencies of him who is gone; the patience with which he bore affliction, the fortitude with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured danger, the reſolution with which he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032069_0020_0FF10F95A8813B70"/>
difficulties and vanquiſhed enemies, the peace with which he heightened enjoyment, the faith with which he quickened diligence, the hope which gleamed through the gloom of deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, and the prayers which invoked and drew down from heaven the ſupporting energy of the Infinite Spirit. What objects can ſo intereſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, quicken, and ſuſtain? In what other place can theſe poſſeſs equal influence?</p>
            <p>From this affecting ſcene we alſo lift our eyes to the diſtant, inviſible world, and trace our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend far on his final and glorious flight, haſtening to the endleſs reward of all his labours, ſufferings, and virtues. We ſee him eſcaped from every danger, and victorious over every enemy. The conflict is paſſed; the day is won; and the palm of eternal triumph awarded.</p>
            <p>Here, more than in any other place, we learn ſo to ſtruggle, endure, and overcome. Here we learn to lean upon the God, on whom he has leaned, and to truſt in the Saviour, in whom he has truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to deſpiſe the world, which he has proved to be vanity, and to ſeek the inheritance, which, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſincere, he has ſought, and obtained. In a word, heavenly mindedneſs, the ornament and beauty of virtue, is a plant, which eminently flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and bloſſoms around the grave of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man.</p>
            <p>To the affecting occaſion, which has called us together, theſe obſervations are ſo naturally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that my audience have probably anticipated me in making the application. We are called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, my friends and brethren, to follow to the houſe, appointed for all living, a wiſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man. In his death each of us finds an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concern. To one is moſt ſtrongly preſented
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032069_0021_0FF10F9FF3CED910"/>
the image of a departed friend; to another of a departed miniſter. One will moſt deeply regret an obliging neighbour, another a prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, a third a loſt benefactor, and a fourth a ſpiritual guide. All naturally form their claims upon the preacher; and their claims he feels and acknowledges. The demand is too juſt, and the occaſion too affecting, to be unfelt by any heart, not wholly unacquainted with feeling.</p>
            <p>Among thoſe, who are moſt deeply concerned in the departure of the Deceaſed, the ſurviving Family claim our firſt regard. To them he ſtood in moſt of the important relations, in which he is remembered by others; and in ſome, in which he was known to them only; relations peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly important and endearing. To them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to the bereaved widow, and her mourning children, to the brethren, ſiſters, and other near relatives, let me firſt addreſs the inſtructions and conſolations of the text.</p>
            <p>While you, Madam, your Children, and your near Connections, are mourning the loſs of this beloved Friend, to you and your children the beſt of all friends, God only excepted; while your more diſtant Connections around you ſtand uniting their ſorrows with yours, and mingling with your tears their own tears of ſympathy; let me, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it now is, attempt to adminiſter to you, and to your fellow mourners, ſuch conſolations, as your diſtreſſes will permit. Imperfect they may be; but they may ſtill be found of real uſe.</p>
            <p>The heart, when ſorely wounded, is, I am well aware, ready to revolt at the thought even of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. In ſuch a caſe, the words of Thomas are but too naturally adopted, "Let us go alſo, that we may die with him." Still the ſcriptures
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032069_0022_0FF10F6654B289C8"/>
furniſh comfort in every diſtreſs. The conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they give, are the conſolations of God, who knows perfectly the nature of the wound which he has made, and who, in his Word, has mercifully provided a balſam to aſſuage its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Be mine the taſk to point it out to you, to induce you to uſe it, and to aid you to poſſeſs yourſelves of its healing power.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe no conſiderations are, unleſs I greatly miſtake, more naturally, or effectually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted, than thoſe ſuggeſted by the text. When events deeply and ſorely affect us, it is no ſmall ſupport fully to realize, that they are contrived, choſen, and accompliſhed, by the infinite God; that, though myſterious in themſelves to ſuch ſhortſighted creatures as we are, though contrary to our wiſhes and expectations alike, and though oppoſed to all which we ſhould think proper to be done, there is ſtill in them nothing of chance, of caprice, or of enmity to us. The conſideration riſes ſtill higher, and our ſupport becomes ſtill ſtronger, when we call to mind, that this deſign and its accompliſhment are directed by perfect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; and that the diſpenſation, when ſcrutiniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtricteſt eye, muſt be approved of as perfectly right. Still more pleaſingly muſt we be affected, when we remember, that conſummate Wiſdom conducted the event, purſued import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ends, and ſelected this as a neceſſary mean of promoting them; and that ſuch ends may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized by ourſelves, if we wait with patience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine with care, and act with wiſdom and piety. But our conſolation will be moſt effectually found, when we further remember, that the ſame event is the fruit of infinite kindneſs and mercy to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:032069_0023_0FF10F5AAD8676F8"/>All theſe ſupporting conſiderations attend the death of a righteous man, and all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his death. It may be ſudden, awful and peculiarly painful to the human eye. He may die, far from his family and friends; and they may be prevented of the power, and fruſtrated of the wiſh, to attend him in the laſt moments, and to do for him the laſt kind offices. All theſe are unavoidably diſtreſſing to us; but every one of them, however unaccountable it may ſeem, is contrived and executed by God with entire wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, juſtice, kindneſs, and mercy. The Lord doth not willingly afflict the children of men; but, as a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</p>
            <p>Say not then, my ſuffering friends, that your cup is filled with bitterneſs only. Bitter indeed it is, but it is ſtill ſweetened with mercy. Think what would be your ſituation, if you were now mourning, as thoſe mourn, who have no hope. Call up to view the image of a graceleſs huſband, of an unprincipled father, of an abandoned bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compare it with the character of him whom you have loſt. How affecting the contraſt? How incalculably different might your ſituation have been; how unſpeakably more pungent and agonizing your ſorrows? In your remembrance nothing riſes, but the prudence, the care, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the kindneſs, of the friend, the father, and the huſband; the wiſdom, the piety, and the dignity, of the chriſtian, and the miniſter. What a train is here preſented to the mind? Who, when called to mourn, would not chooſe ſo to mourn?</p>
            <p>All this, you will inſtinctively anſwer, is a mere deſcription of the greatneſs of our loſs. Let me

reply. Could you wiſh the caſe otherwiſe? Could you at this moment be willing, that one virtue leſs, or in any leſs degree, had entered into the character of the deceaſed?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, let me exhort you not to forget bleſſings, becauſe they are paſt. How much longer than the common lot have you enjoyed the preſence, inſtructions, and kind offices of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed? How long has he formed, and increaſed, conjugal happineſs; trained up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; commanded his houſhold to follow after God; and walked exemplarily before them in the ſtatutes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Redeemer? How long, how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and how uniformly, has he exhibited the benevolence of a friend, and a brother? Forget not, in the height of your affliction, ſuch bleſſings as theſe. Forget not, that they came from the ſame God, who has now called you to ſorrow and tears.</p>
            <p>Let me alſo exhort you affectingly to remember all thoſe amiable things in the deceaſed; whoſe value you declare by the ſorrow, with which you lament the loſs of them, and to remember them as motives, as guides, and as an example, all prompting you to purſue the ſame deſirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. "Go thou, and do likewiſe," is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which ſhould cloſe the account, and the remembrance, of every virtuous example. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſo near, ſo beloved, cannot want motives to enforce it. All the juſt, important, evangelical things, which the friend whom you mourn has ſaid, and done, will now, as they riſe in your view, appear inveſted with a new force and ſolemnity. They will come as inſtructions from the inviſible world, and as an example from beyond the grave.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032069_0025_0FF10F9E54476FD0"/>
In this affecting character let them be heard, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced and obeyed.</p>
            <p>Commending you now to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified, ſuffer me to direct my attention to the Congregation, over which the deceaſed has ſo long preſided as a Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>My friends and brethren, you are bereaved of a friend, connected with you in a relation, which is plainly one of the neareſt and moſt important in the preſent world. With the manner in which he has ſuſtained this relation, and diſcharged the duties of it, to you, I am not, though a ſtranger to you, wholly unacquainted. From his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and converſation, and from the information of others, I know him to have adopted the doctrines of grace; doctrines acknowledged as the true, doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Chriſt by the great body of thoſe, who, in every age and country, have been eſteemed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Chriſtians. In accordance with theſe doctrines he looked for ſalvation for himſelf, his family, and his flock. Theſe were the object of his unſhaken attachment, and the ſubject of his fervent exhortations; were extenſively underſtood by him, and ably defended. In theſe he lived, and in theſe he died.</p>
            <p>From his mouth you have heard them weekly, and I need not tell you, with what ability, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, fervour, and uniformity, ſet forth in full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play from the beginning to the end of his miniſtry. In conformity to theſe doctrines you have ever been called to Faith and Repentance in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Love of God and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. You have been taught, that man is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and ruined creature, condemned by the law
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032069_0026_0FF10FA250F99C90"/>
of God, and with no means of return, or reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, in himſelf; that in Chriſt alone is your hope for forgiveneſs, acceptance, and eternal life; that your ſalvation is a reward not of works, but of the grace of God; that the faith of the Goſpel is Faith which worketh by love, purifieth the heart, and produceth every good fruit; and that by this Faith alone you are united to Chriſt, and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bleſſings of his redemption.</p>
            <p>All theſe are doctrines humbling to human pride, and wounding to human obſtinacy. They lay man low at the footſtool of divine mercy, and unclothe him of that ſelf righteouſneſs, which he thinks his ornament and glory, but which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a garment of rags, and a wreath of ſhame. Nor leſs alarming are they to the fears, than hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to the pride, of ſinners. That quiet and ſecurity, in which a hard heart and a ſtupid mind love to reſt, they diſturb and deſtroy; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to impenitence nothing but danger, terror, and death.</p>
            <p>Men who love to be at eaſe in Zion, and who cheriſh the pride and pleaſure of ſelf righteouſneſs, are uſually enemies to the doctrines, which I have mentioned. While theſe doctrines, and the preachers of them, are a ſavour of life unto life to them who are ſaved, they are alſo a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death unto death to them that periſh. To many of the Congregation in this town, both living and dead, they have doubtleſs proved the means of life; to ſome, perhaps, they have ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only as means of awakening reſentment, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, hardneſs of heart, and final unbelief.</p>
            <p>According to theſe doctrines the deceaſed lived before you; daily exemplifying their influence on his faith, and on his conduct. The example, which he ſet, was the example of prudence, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032069_0027_0FF10F488162B4B0"/>
truth, juſtice, kindneſs, and godlineſs. In all the relations, of life he ſhewed, that he believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and lived, as he urged you to believe and live. You know, though I am ignorant, whether you received his words, as the words of a friend and a miniſter of Chriſt, or whether he has all the day long ſtretched out his hands to a gainſaying and diſobedient people. Search your hearts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the account, which you will ſoon be obliged to give.</p>
            <p>He is now gone; gone to the world of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits; gone, we truſt, to receive the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his Lord, and the reward of a faithful ſervant. He is removed from your eſteem, your love, your kind offices, your communion and your knowledge. At the ſame time he is placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of your reſentment, oppoſition, and unkindneſs. Intercourſe between you and him has, in this world, ceaſed forever. But let me exhort you to remember, that you will meet again, and at the cloſe of a little period will ſtand face to face. Both he and you will be called to give an account of his miniſtry, and the manner in which it was received by you; of what you believed, and what you practiſed. You will then meet with other views, and other feelings, than ſome, which you have been wont to experience here. Here many intereſts, aims, purſuits, prejudices, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of this world have occupied your minds, and greatly coloured and obſcured your views of future things. But eternity will then have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to you, and all theſe earthly things will have diſappeared. Paſſion and prejudice will then have ceaſed to operate, and truth naked and entire will be brought out to view.</p>
            <p>At that time, thoſe of you, who have cordially received from his lips the inſtructions of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032069_0028_0FF10FA5C02A9E28"/>
will meet him with joy. His witneſs will redound to your everlaſting happineſs, and yours will be to him a crown of glory. He will bleſs God for giving you to him as a diadem of beauty, as an everlaſting crown which ſhall never fade away; and you will bleſs the ſame God for giving him to you, as a miniſter of righteouſneſs, and the means of your ſalvation. What a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will this be? What a progreſs will be made in friendſhip thus begun, a friendſhip to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and improved through an endleſs duration?</p>
            <p>How different will be the interview between him and thoſe of you, ſhould any ſuch be found, who have rejected his words of truth? Are you prepared to alledge, before his Judge and yours, the reaſons which induced you, when he called, to refuſe; and, when he ſtretched out his hand, to diſregard; to ſet at nought his counſel, and to receive none of his reproof. Are you ready to declare to your Judge, that you hated this truth, kingdom, and character, deſpiſed his grace, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſpirit, accounted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and crucified afreſh the Lord of glory by your unbelief? Soon will you follow him to the grave, and be numbered, as he is, with the dead. Soon will you ſtand before God, and give an account of every work done in the body, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. This, of all conſiderations the moſt affecting, the moſt amazing, can never be more properly urged, or more happily realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than on the preſent occaſion. Let it not paſs without ſome laſting good to you. Think, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, how ſoon you are going—to whom— on what errand—with what preparation—to what end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032069_0029_0FF10F3EF0D82680"/>You have loſt a miniſter, long ſettled over you in the things of the Lord. Many of you know not by experience either the difficulties, or the dangers, of ſuch a ſituation. Moſt of you have arrived at manhood ſince he commenced his min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry; many of you have been born ſince that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; and not a few have been baptized by his hand. In this ſituation ſuffer a friend to you, and to your children, to ſuggeſt to you a few intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truths.</p>
            <p>In former years you have been happily united; within a period of moderate length, I have been informed, your union has been leſs perfect; in your preſent ſtate it may become leſs perfect ſtill. A variety of cauſes, incapable of being foreſeen by men, may lead a flock, without a ſhepherd, to ſcatter and to ſtray. But if diſunited, you can be neither virtuous nor happy.</p>
            <p>To prevent this ſore evil, let me, not wholly unexperienced in caſes of this nature, exhort you to mark any, who may attempt to cauſe diviſions among you, and to avoid them. Cultivate, with ſedulous care, peace and good will in your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods. In all your affairs conduct yourſelves with calmneſs, with deliberation, without paſſion, and without haſte. Shun hard ſpeeches. Watch, with alarm, the beginnings of party ſpirit; and remember, that the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace, of them that make peace.</p>
            <p>Carefully regulate your families, and punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerve your family worſhip. Train up your children for God, and walk before them in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Make your houſes houſes of God, and your families families of piety, peace, and love. As your public privileges are leſſened, prize your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones more.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:032069_0030_0FF10F5DCEAF9908"/>Continue the public worſhip of God among you, without ceasing, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>Recal to mind, as far as you can, the juſt and evangelical things, which from time to time have been ſaid to you by your deceaſed paſtor; lay them up in your hearts, and practiſe them in your lives.</p>
            <p>As ſpeedily as you can, reeſtabliſh among you the miniſtry of the Goſpel. Seek an evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal miniſter, who will not ſhun to declare to you all the counſel of God. Such an one will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, declare to you many painful and humiliating things; but they will ſtill be the things of God, and will make you and yours wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>In your cloſets aſk daily of God his direction and bleſſing. Prayer, offered with ſincerity and faith, was never offered in vain. If you will thus aſk, he will give, and give liberally without up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Let me now addreſs the ſubject to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt who are preſent.</p>
            <p>My beloved brethren, a great man is fallen in our Iſrael to day; a man of diſtinguiſhed learning and underſtanding, of unuſual prudence, and of ſingular ſkill and experience in the concerns of congregations, churches; and miniſters. Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by tried wiſdom, he was, as you well
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032069_0031_0FF10F5F61DBE478"/>
know, very extenſively employed, and confided in by both miniſter and people, throughout the ſtate. By both were his uſeful labours acknowledged in compoſing their differences, and directing their intereſts. To you, to me, to all with whom he was connected, the loſs is great and affecting. In the congregations, in the churches, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Univerſity, of this ſtate, every weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concern will remind us of his important ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and force us to feel what we have loſt. His talents were not only great and diſtinguiſhed, but they were alſo of that moſt uſeful kind, which we call practical. Such talents are eminently fitted for the ſervice of God, and for uſefulneſs to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In whatever he was called to judge, or act, he made it his firſt buſineſs thoroughly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and fully to underſtand. This he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by diligent ſcrutiny, cloſe attention to both ſides of diſputable points, a careful inveſtigation of principles, and a cautious conſideration of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. For this important buſineſs his thorough knowledge of the human character qualified him in an eminent degree, as did alſo his ſtrong pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of judging, and his peculiar coolneſs and ſelf poſſeſſion. Not leſs important were his attention, patience, and perſeverance, in inveſtigating. In theſe moſt uſeful things he was at once an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent bleſſing to mankind, and a moſt profitable example to us. No man living probably ſo well underſtood the intereſts of our Univerſity, or for more than twenty years took ſo active and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a part in its concerns. Few ſo well knew the intereſts of our churches, or ſo ably and ſo extenſively ſerved them. I truſt his ſervices will be, by us at leaſt, gratefully remembered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:032069_0032_0FF10F689F1D9768"/>God has now taken him from us in the full ſtrength of all his powers, and at the height of his uſefulneſs. Let this diſpenſation be, at once, a ſolemn monition to us of our own approaching diſſolution, and of our duty to imitate his diligence. Let us be quickened by it to faithfulneſs, zeal, and conſtancy, in the ſervice of our Maſter. Times like theſe furniſh a miniſter with abundant em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and demand of him unuſual diligence, faithfulneſs, and fortitude. The induſtry of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, their perſeverance, their fanaticiſm, preſent to us a powerful ſtimulus to equal, if we cannot excel, them in conſtancy and exertion. Long has it been a juſt and melancholy complaint, that vile men are more aſſiduous in their labours, than vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men; and that a bad cauſe is uſually ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with more vigorous and unremitted efforts, than a good one. Let us endeavour, that this ſhall no more be truly ſaid, where we are engaged. Troubles and dangers, inſtead of diſcouraging, ought only to quicken our reſolution, faithfulneſs, and zeal. They that are with us are more, and mightier, than they that are againſt us. For diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement there is no room; for exertion there is abundant. When our fathers and brethren are taken away, their labours devolve on thoſe, whom they leave behind. Let us reſolutely take up the burden, and God will give us ſtrength to carry it. What will give us boldneſs and peace in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt at the judgment? What, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his ſervice?</p>
            <p>We ſhall indeed meet with rebuffs and ſcoffs, with obloquy and oppoſition. But to us theſe things are of no real conſequence. God is far more ſlighted, abuſed, and reviled, than we are. In the ſame manner was Chriſt treated; and in a
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032069_0033_0FF10F4B43BD7560"/>
degree unſpeakably more groſs and injurious. Like him, let us ſet our faces as a flint againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and he will ſupport and bleſs us. Let us be conſtant and unwearied in our prayers and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and we ſhall certainly be heard and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I will now cloſe the diſcourſe with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to this numerous Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The Friend, the Miniſter, whoſe remains are ſhut up in yonder coffin, a few days ſince was liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting in the midſt of you, his neighbours, his friends, and his flock. He has finiſhed his earthly courſe, and has been ſummoned by his Maſter to the inviſible world to give an account of his ſtewardſhip. He will not return to you, but you will ſoon go to him. You will ſoon cloſe your eyes in the iron ſleep, will inhabit the dark and narrow houſe, will become the prey of corruption, and the feaſt of worms. Your bodies will be mingled with the common duſt, and be changed into the cold clod of the valley. But they reſt not here. There is beyond the grave a reſurrection to immortal being.</p>
            <p>How vain, how momentary, is your preſent life, when viewed as a period of enjoyment for a reaſoning mind? How important and ſolemn, as a period deſtined to ſecure the attainment of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs virtue and happineſs? On it, tranſient and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary as it is, hang heaven and hell, immortal glory and excellence, and interminable wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and depravation. Aſk the firſt hoary head, which you meet, and he will tell you, that his own protracted years are, in his view, a vapour, which has appeared for a little time, and is now vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away; that, compared with that ocean of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, on the ſhore of which he now ſtands,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032069_0034_0FF10F702EB029E8"/>
ready to launch into the boundleſs deep, it ſhrinks into a ſingle drop; that its contentions were the jarrings of children, its hopes the dreams of a night, and its happineſs the painted form of a cloud, changing, fleeting, eluding the graſp, and mocking enjoyment. How few of you will reach the period to which he has arrived? How many of you will probably die, before you are aware, ſuddenly, early, unprepared?</p>
            <p>Aſk yourſelves how you will feel, and what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance you will make, when your bodies, at the call of the Archangel, and the trump of God, ſhall ſpring from the grave, when bone ſhall rejoin its bone, when the frame ſhall be clothed with fleſh, when the Spirit of God ſhall breathe upon the lifeleſs maſs, and cauſe it to awaken into endleſs exiſtence; and when you, together with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbered millions of the great family of Adam, ſhall again ſtand upon your feet, as an army of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible multitude? What will be your emotions, when you ſhall ſee the Son of Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from heaven in the clouds; and all the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds of the earth ſhall wail becauſe of his coming? Stretch your view forward to this amazing ſcene, and bring it home to your thoughts; conſider the final day as arrived, and realize your perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and concern, in its affecting tranſactions. Behold the Redeemer, arrayed in the glory of his Father, and ſurrounded with the innumerable company of Angels. Liſten to the ſhout, which burſts from the mouths of all the hoſt of heaven, and rends the univerſe. Mark around you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe congregation of ſaints and ſinners, of the friends and the enemies of the Judge; his friends arrayed with the ſmiles of tranſport, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies overwhelmed with diſmay and horror.

the one great company exclaim, O Death! where is now thy ſting? O grave! where is now thy victory? and the other call to the rocks and to the mountains to fall on them, and hide them from the wrath of the Lamb. But they call in vain; for lo! the mountains and the rocks themſelves, with the great world in which they ſtand, are kindling on every ſide with ten thouſand fires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſſolving in one immenſe, united conflagration, ſurrounding the earth, and aſcending to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.

Trembling, amazed, deſpairing, they are forced to the left hand, the place of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, confuſion, and miſery. Liſten to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſentence, "Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom, prepared for you from the foundation of the world;" and mark the extaſy on the faces of the happy throngs, who are thus welcomed to endleſs life. Liſten again! What do ye hear? "Depart, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſcene one ſtep farther. Behold the Judge, again aſcending through the heavens, with his glorious and happy followers, to the world of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting joy. Purſue their path through yonder ſkies, and trace them riſing, approaching, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manſions of life eternal.

ſorrow and deſpair. See them for the laſt time vaniſhing from your ſight, while the gulf yawns to receive them, and cloſes on them forever.</p>

            <p>THE Reader will probably not be diſpleaſed with a ſhort account of the life of Doctor Goodrich. Doctor Goodrich was born of a reputable family in the pariſh of Stepney, in Wethersfield, Octo. 26, O. S. 1734; He received his literary education at Yale-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts A. D. 1752, and to that of Maſter of Arts A. D. 1755, and was the ſame year appointed a Tutor in that ſeminary. In 1756, Nov. 24, he was ordained paſtor of the Church and Congregation at Durham; and, in 1776, was choſen a member of the Corporation of Yale-College. Nov. 17, 1797, he ſet out from his houſe on an annual viſit to the Collegiate Lands in the County of Litchfield. The following Sabbath he preached at Litchfield, and on Monday rode to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk. He lodged at the houſe of Capt. Titus Ives, and went to bed in his uſual health and cheerfulneſs. In the morning he roſe early, and, having partly dreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, fell upon the floor in an apoplectic fit, and expired, in the 64th year of his age, and the 42d of his miniſtry. His remains were brought to Durham on the ſucceeding Saturday, and followed to the grave by his Family, Church, and Congregation, and a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
