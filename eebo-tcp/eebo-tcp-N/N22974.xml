            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOST of the following pages originally appeared in the FAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER'S WEEKLY MUSEUM, a rural paper of Newhampſhire. Surrounded by plain huſbandmen, rather than by poliſhed ſcholars, the Author, both in the ſelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſubjects, and their vehicle, has been more ſtudious of the uſeful, than the brilliant. To inſtruct the villager, was his primary object. Hence, an eaſy and obvious ſtile was indiſpenſable. To riſe to the gorgeous phraſe of BOLINGBROKE would have been abſurd, to ſink to the vulgarity of L'ESTRANGE would have
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030335_0003_0FE5C29FA7753DF8"/>
been ignominious. The familiarity of FRANKLIN's manner, and the ſimplicity of STERNE's proved moſt auxiliary to his deſign. He, therefore, adventured their union. Diffident of ſucceſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for cenſure, he will not be ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a harſh ſentence from the critical tribunal. The vanity of authorſhip has already cauſed him to prove the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his NATAL TOWN; the ſame paſſion now urges him to try the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the COUNTRY. Should this, like former attempts, ſlide rapidly down the ſlope of oblivion, it will add the laſt item to the catalogue of literary diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and CURE</p>

               <head>"TWO ARE BETTER THAN ONE."</head>
               <p>THIS is SOLOMON's theory, and I like it; his practice was rather too extenſive, for in his luxurious palace, ſeven hundred wives, and three hundred concubines were better than one. Whether the women of Jeruſalem were compoſed of more manageable materials, than modern females, I am at a loſs, for JOSEPHUS, whoſe works I have turned over to gain infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation on this knotty point, ſays nothing of the matter. However, I am inclined to think SOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OMON made his domeſtick arrangement ſoon after he "planted vineyards." Had he choſen a graver moment, he would not have told the moſt confidential of his eunuchs, that ſeven hundred expenſive wives, and three hundred capricious concubines, were better than one. Why the revenues of gold paved Jeruſalem, or the bagnios of its ſuburbs could not have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed robes for the married dames, nor rakes for the free! Men, ſage like SOLOMON, are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030335_0005_0FE5C2A31560B3B8"/>
moderate in their arithmetick of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures. But this was too bold a ſum in multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, even for a polygamiſt to work.</p>
               <p>In all probability, SOLOMON, though the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental writers expatiate upon his reſources, found his ſtock too ſcanty for the many and great claims, which "the daughters of Jeruſalem" muſt have made. For late in life, when the "pitcher" was broken, and the "ſilver cord" of love looſed, and his "deſires failed," we find him gravely compoſing a ſententious proverb, in praiſe of ſociability, and reducing a thouſand companions to one. His reaſons too, are not drawn as they would have been, when he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Seraglio, from paſſion and pleaſure, but from <hi>utility.</hi> For he ſupports his opinion by arguing, in the context, that "two are better than one," becauſe in difficulty, or in battle, they mutually aſſiſt, or bedded in a froſty night, they keep each other warm.</p>
               <p>Although, in remarking upon SOLOMON's voluptuouſneſs, I have been moved from my natural gravity, as a preacher, yet let not the wanton reader, conſtrue my ſermon as a ſatire upon the ſage Prince. After animadverting upon the exceſs of his practice, it is my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to echo the benevolence and utility of his ſocial principle.</p>
               <p>"Two are better than one." Dr. FRANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN thought ſo, when he recommended early marriages. As I am of ſingular continence myſelf, I know nothing of the matter, but St.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030335_0006_0FE5C2A454A59178"/>
PAUL, an apoſtle of experience, tells bachelor and virgin chriſtians, that it is better to marry than burn. If they feel this heat, therefore, let them quench it in <hi>legal</hi> couples, and chooſe for the wedding ring poſy, "Two are better than one." My phyſician declares that in theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate days, when illicit love is common, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marriage is favourable to <hi>health</hi>; the philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophers affirm that it is to <hi>morals.</hi> The Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, therefore, concludes that "two are better than one" applied to matrimony, is a precept productive of <hi>happineſs,</hi> and that a young man, who will reject <hi>all</hi> the concubines, and ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety nine of the wives, which SOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OMON thought neceſſary, may be pronounced wiſer, as it reſpects women, than that Prince.</p>
               <p>In the dark ages, as they were juſtly ſtiled, devotional men uſed to think that St. PETER, the porter of Heaven's wicket, would not open it, but to <hi>one</hi> at a time. Accordingly, monks and hermits would wander, or reſide ſolitary in deſarts and caves, and inſiſt that an error had crept into the proverbs, and that SOLOMON cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wrote "One is better than two." This was a vile interpretation; and, if they had med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated their Bibles well, they would have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that the founder of their religion was never ſo happy, as when "much people" ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him, and that the Apoſtles choſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions</hi> in their travel; the one ſat ſocially at a wedding ſupper, and the others reſorted to the temples, the <hi>town hall,</hi> and the <hi>market place.</hi>

               <p>My ſtudy window overlooks the houſe of an eminent phyſician; he underſtands accurately, the nice movements of the human machine; he is a botaniſt, ſkilled in the properties of plants, the cedar of Libanus, and the "hyſſop on the wall;" he has meditated the ſyſtem of nature, and he has tried many of the proceſſes of art. I ſee him turning over the volumes, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſecrets of medicine, and I hear him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſkilfully the various modes to blunt, or to extract, the arrows of diſeaſe. But alas! my careleſs countrymen, "all this availeth him nothing." The blind, the maim and the halt, of our villages, refuſe bread to this "man of underſtanding," and meaſure their wheat in brimming buſhels, to the quack, who cannot diſtinguiſh between a fever and the gout, who applies his nippers to a wart, and thinks he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a cancer, who poiſons you with mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, curdles your blood with calomel, drenches you with enfeebling teas, and, as a wit once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed it, preſcribes draughts ſo <hi>neutral,</hi> they declare neither for the patient nor the malady. If the Royal Preacher, in whoſe writings I find my text, had ſeen whole villages, clamorous at

the midnight hour, for a foetid quack, and his powders, and "paſſing by on the other ſide," when they ſee the regular practitioner, he would have forgotten, for a moment, all the wiſdom of the Eaſt, and, like provoked PETER, in the Goſpel, would "curſe and ſwear" at ſuch egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious folly.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of my readers, who will gladly turn out of the paths of error, when they hear a warning voice behind them, "here is a better path, walk therein," will I hope learn the value of "men of underſtanding." When their value is once known—the "ſteps of their door" will be hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcended. They will teach us how to think, to ſpeak, and to act. If Divines, they will not attempt to perſuade you, that Heaven cannot be taken, but by the violence of Scotch divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. If Lawyers, they will not demand exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant fees, to ſupport a rotten cauſe. If Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, you will hear them utter no words more cramp than "Temperance," and "Regimen." If Moraliſts, they will mark the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween wiſdom and cunning, they will point out the weakneſs as well as wickedneſs of thoſe petty frauds, thoſe iniquitous contracts, thoſe tricking arts of <hi>jockeyſhip,</hi> ſo frequent and ſo diſgraceful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a rural people, where nought but ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be found. To ſuch divines you will cheerfully vote a more ample annual ſalary, than ſixty pounds, and you will receive in exchange that wiſdom, which we are aſſured, in a volume of the higheſt authority, is better than rubies.</p>

               <p>How tender and affectionate is the reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful queſtion of SOLOMON, in the text. When wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleep? The Jewiſh Prince, whom we know to be an active one, from the temple which he erected, and from the books he compoſed, ſaw, when he caſt his eyes around his city, half his ſubjects aſleep. Though in many a wiſe proverb, he had warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of the baneful effects of indolence, they were deaf to his charming voice, and blind to his noble example. The men ſervants, and the maid ſervants whom he hired, nodded over their domeſtick duties in the royal kitchen, and when in the vineyards he had planted, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for grapes, lo they brought forth <hi>wild</hi> grapes, for the vintager was drowſy.</p>
               <p>At the preſent time, few SOLOMONS exiſt, to preach againſt <hi>pillows,</hi> and never was there more occaſion for a ſermon. Our country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at peace, not a drum is heard to rouſe the ſlothful. But, though we are exempted from the tumult and viciſſitudes of war, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there are many poſts of duty, if not of danger, and at theſe we ſhould vigilantly ſtand. If we will ſtretch the hand of exertion, means to acquire competent wealth, and honeſt fame abound, and when ſuch ends are in view, how ſhameful to wilfully cloſe our eyes. He, who ſurveys the paths of active life, will find them ſo numerous and lengthy, that he will feel the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030335_0012_0FE5C2B0016807F8"/>
neceſſity of early riſing, and late taking reſt, to accompliſh ſo much travel. He, who pants for the ſhade of ſpeculation, will find that Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot flouriſh in the bowers of indolence and monkiſh gloom. Much midnight oil muſt be conſumed, and innumerable pages examined, by him whoſe object is to be really wiſe. Few hours has that man to ſleep, and not <hi>one</hi> to <hi>loiter</hi> who has many coffers of wealth to fill, or many cells in his memory to ſtore.</p>
               <p>Among the various men, whom I ſee in the courſe of my pilgrimage through this world, I cannot frequently find thoſe, who are broad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake. Sloth, a powerful magician, mutters a witching ſpell, and deluded mortals tamely ſuffer this drowſy being to bind a fillet over their eyes. All their activity is employed, in turning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like the door, on its <hi>ruſty</hi> hinge, and all the noiſe they make in this world is a ſnore. When I ſee one, deſigned by nature for noble purpoſes, indolently declining the privilege, and heedleſs, like ESAU, bartering the birthright, for what is of leſs worth than his red pottage of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, for liberty to ſit ſtill and lie quietly, I think I ſee, not a man, but an oyſter. The drone in ſociety, like that fiſh, on our ſhores, might as well be ſunken in the mud and incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſhell, as ſtretched on a couch, or ſeated in a chimney corner.</p>

is a very common, and faſhionable character too in moſt villages, his celebrity deſerves ſome conſideration. The Lay Preacher acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edges that he, like moſt <hi>ſedentary</hi> parſons, is an aukward rider, and ſits too much in his eaſy chair, to ſit gracefully on a horſe. Still, as he is pleaſed with beauty and grace wherever found, he cannot but be ſtruck with the figure of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble animal, diſtinguiſhed for thoſe enchanting qualities. He warmly approves therefore, thoſe, who exerciſe humanity towards the generous ſteed, and who to an animal, which ſafely bears them a rugged journey, are liberal of hay, and ſparing of the laſh. He even allows, to men of property, the indulgence of taſte and whim, in chooſing a creature of ſo much elegance and uſe. But when a man, ſo far forgets his dignity, as to prefer the ſtable to the parlour, to be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companion of oſtlers, to uſe no language but that of the turf, and wear life away in comb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mane, one cannot avoid thinking, that the beaſt he curries is the nobler animal. A more ſerious objection can be made to the profeſſed jockey. He not only devotes too much time to the ſtable, but exerciſes too much craft, in the purchaſe and ſale of his favorite animal. He not only like Richard in the play, cries "a horſe, a horſe, a kingdom for a horſe," but deems it not only pardonable but praiſeworthy, to get what is called the <hi>advantage.</hi> This phraſe means to ſell an article, for treble its worth, and to make the bargain, by falſehood and by fraud!

Do not be offended, my readers, becauſe, this week, I chooſe to deliniate <hi>political,</hi> rather than <hi>moral</hi> truth.

that all the world ſhould be taxed,</hi> and ſometimes inquire <hi>whence come wars and fightings among men.</hi> As the <hi>whig</hi> Divines in "1775," were inſtrumental in deſtroying the <hi>old</hi> government, perhaps a <hi>Federal</hi> parſon may offer ſome reaſons againſt ſubverting the <hi>new.</hi>

               <p>The ſtudies of theology, and the labour of writing theſe ſermons, do not occupy the whole of each week, I have leiſure to talk politicks with my neighbours, and to read many of the newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers from the ſouthward. From them, and, occaſionally, from an evening's chat with ſome traveller from Boſton, I learn that certain reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and perturbed ſpirits, under the plauſible title of "Democrats," are labouring anxiouſly to teach proſelytes the ſoothing doctrines of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and equality. Liberty, ſuch as the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of Paris enjoyed, when they treated a Queen of France, like a proſtitue of the ſtews; and Equality, ſuch as a LEGENDRE and SAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERRE could boaſt, when the butcher's ſtall of the one, and brewer's dray of the other, were, in a <hi>Revolutionary government,</hi> on a level with the throne. I have been in the habit for many years, my readers, of turning over authors, who wrote in the earlieſt ages of the world, men who underſtood the meaning of the word, "Liberty" as well at leaſt as the moderns. From theſe books, and they are of the higheſt authority, I have learned that <hi>civil</hi> liberty conſiſts in doing whatever does not militate with laws, reſtraining individual exceſſes to promote the publick weal.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030335_0027_0FE5C2D0DE1537B8"/>
Obſervation has further ſuggeſted that there are a few, and how few! upon whom the Parent of wiſdom has largely beſtowed that <hi>etherial ſpirit,</hi> that bold and ſublime genius, which he has choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to withhold from the majority of mankind. Yet farther, it is obvious that in the race for <hi>riches, all run,</hi> and ſtill but few reach the goal, and bear the prize. It follows, therefore, that he of ample mind, or ample purſe will direct the councils, and command the ſervice of him who is weak or poor, and that equality is a viſionary whim. God and nature having created ſuch eternal diſtinctions, how preſumptuous, how unavailing for an American bankrupt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in the market place to his deluded hearers, that they had been amuſed with an <hi>old wive's fable,</hi> but that, the ſervant might roam where he liſt, like his maſter, and that the plough boy, conſcious of equality, might journey to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, and claim the Preſidency from WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded that St. PAUL poſſeſſed as erect and independent a ſpirit, and as much ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, as any leader of a club throughout the Union. The government of his own country was a vice royalty, and probably, therefore, a capricious and arbitrary one. He had viſited Rome, felt the power of its Emperors, and lived for years in ſubjection to laws, which we uſually term deſpotick. Yet this amiable apoſtle and man of the world, though bold and original in plan and execution, was ſo convinced of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030335_0028_0FE5C35B2DA038B8"/>
of order and due ſubordination, that, in his epiſtle to the Romans, who, under the reign of NERO, would have been gratified by <hi>revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary</hi> logick, he charges every ſoul to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the higher powers. It is worthy of remark, and will ſhew how important the ſubject was conſidered by the apoſtle, that he maintains the propoſition not by political, but religious arguments, for, after declaring that all power was derived from above, he concludes regularly that reſiſtance to "ordained" government was oppoſition to the ſupreme will.</p>
               <p>I have examined very carefully this great man's epiſtles to various cities of the Eaſt, a quarter of the globe coerced by the ſterneſt laws, and cannot find a ſingle ſentence to induce change of officers, or a popular government. Neither Corinthians nor Epheſians are adviſed to <hi>club</hi> ſubordination away. The <hi>funding ſyſtem</hi> of Rome is tacitly approved, for PAUL enjoins a rigorous payment of the publick debt, and if an Ambaſſador were ſent to negotiate a <hi>Treaty</hi> with the faithleſs Parthians, or the hoſtile Medes, the Saint did not, when the Envoy returned, call upon his god to curſe him, or curſe him himſelf.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe, my countrymen, that we ſhould conſider it ſuperfluous, to have a <hi>King,</hi> or what is the ſame, good government in <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and that every man ſhould be permitted to do what was right in his own eyes. Why, at the great publick table, if each were allowed to <hi>carve</hi> for
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030335_0029_0FE5C2D5C83ACFC0"/>
himſelf, what tid bits would the great ſcramblers devour, and what a ſorry meal would the major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity make! I am convinced that if the fantaſtick viſion of "Equality," could be realized, and men were to roam at large in the <hi>wilds</hi> of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that many would faint by the way, and that more would <hi>hanker</hi> after thoſe <hi>ſavory herbs of Egypt</hi> they had abjured. We ſhould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every ſpecies of outrage and exceſs. We ſhould hear the voice of wild miſrule, in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the mob that rageth, at noon day. If <hi>there was no king</hi> in Iſrael, not to mention what the women would play, men would play the rogue with impunity, and neither life nor prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty would be ſecure. That experiment in pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticks, we are now trying in America, if demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratick projectors, perſevere in interupting the proceſs, would fail ridiculouſly and tyrants might then aver that mankind inſtead of being free by nature, were doomed to be ſlaves.</p>

               <p>YESTERDAY, as I was pondering a theme for my next diſcourſe, with an aching head which checked invention, our town clerk enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030335_0030_0FE5C2D6F0A3DBC8"/>
my ſtudy, with newſpapers in his hand. Men of his claſs being naturally fond of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and anxious for the publick weal, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he read to me with emphaſis that the French had effected the paſſage of the Rhine, liſtened with pleaſure. As he threw pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed papers careleſsly down by his ſide, I pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up, and, as it behoved a Preacher, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the grave and the moral. The man of news and the world will ſmile, when I add, that no articles ſo attached my attention, as the Thankſgiving proclamations of the three neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates. When I ſaw from my window, "our garners full of ſtore," and "preſſes burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing" with the juice of our orchards; when I heard numerous kine low, and "the voice of the turtle in our land," I felt the propriety of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional gratitude, and was delighted, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick commemoration of annual favours, was the cuſtom of our country.</p>
               <p>In the moſt rude, as well as refined ages, a lively perception of benefits, conferred by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, has cauſed mankind to "give a ſweet ſavour, and a memorial of fine flour: and to make a fat offering." Long before Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity had ſhed its luſtre on the nations, we find the Jew, the Roman and the Greek, raiſing the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical hymn to the ſkies. Though their creeds, dictated by ſuperſtitious ignorance were claſhing and various, yet gratitude to the "giver" was one and the ſame. If a general had by enterprize enlarged, or by obſtinacy had
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030335_0031_0FE5C2D874F37F08"/>
defended, empire; if the "ſweet influences of the Pleiades" had operated, and Italian grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries burſt with plenty, the grateful ancients de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the feſtal day, and all orders, careleſs of buſineſs or pleaſure, thronged the temples, and thanked the Beneficent Power. Thankſgiving was one of the firſt acts of devotion, deſcribed by the ſacred Hiſtorian. In the very infancy of time, amid the ſimplicity of paſtoral life, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a ſtriking ſcene, the amiable ABEL, that blameleſs ſhepherd, ſelecting the faireſt of the flock, and ſacrificing them on the firſt altar. From a ſocial ſupper, with his diſciples, from crowds of penitent or applauding Jews, we find the <hi>maſter chriſtian</hi> retiring to the ſolitude of Mount Olivet, to render thanks, that neither the perſecuting Phariſee, nor the ſubtle Sadducees had abridged his life, or invalidated his doctrine. St. PAUL, who combined in happy union, his ſecular and religious duties, amid the horrors of a nocturnal ſhipwreck, toſſing in the Adriatick gulph, and wiſhing anxiouſly for day, did not employ the firſt moments of returning light, in the cares of navigation, but "<hi>gave thanks</hi>" for his ſafety, and partook of bread and meat with the mariners.</p>
               <p>But without recurring to ancient examples to fortify a duty, in which there is ſo much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to animate its exerciſe, I will now cloſe by aſſigning a few reaſons, peculiarly binding on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, for periodical gratitude.</p>
               <p>While moſt of the nations of the elder world,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030335_0032_0FE5C2D9418E8388"/>
are ſmarting under the rod of civil or religious oppreſſion, we are leading "quiet and peaceable lives," protected by a mild government. No Inquiſitor ſummons our ſectaries to the ſtake, and in no cell of our mountains has the clank of religious chains yet been heard, No Turkiſh Sultan abridges life by a nod, and our "exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors" derive a revenue to the Union, neither from our windows, nor our hearths. We are emphatically at peace, though Diſcord has hurl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her brand among the nations. Agonized France beholds the lights of her church extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, her "nurſing father" and "nurſing mother" deſtroyed, and "her nobles in fetters of iron." The olive has yielded its oil to illumine the lantern, and the grape has been trodden by the faltering feet of the intoxicated ſoldier. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent are the halls of the ſovereign, and a "fox looks out of the window."

               <head>"LITTLE CHILDREN, KEEP YOURSELVES FROM IDOLS."</head>
               <p>THIS precept of the Evangeliſt, was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the <hi>nurſery. Infants</hi> of the largeſt growth, we know have their rattles and "idols," and the "little children," whom JOHN meant to keep ſafe, were men and women, who had reached the full meaſure of their ſtature, but who, from levity, might prove too attached to objects "earthly" or "deviliſh."</p>
               <p>A learned commentator upon this paſſage, might here exclaim, O blind Lay Preacher, worthy to be claſſed with the <hi>fooliſh</hi> Galatians, cannot you perceive that your text was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, merely as a warning againſt the worſhip of images, ſet up by the ſuperſtition of Pagans, and that the Gentiles were the little children? This is too partial and narrow an explanation. I am willing to ſuppoſe that JOHN, like other zealous chriſtians of that age, was anxious to ſtrip each Roman temple, of its falſe GOD. But the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030335_0034_0FE5C2DDEB9DC198"/>
Evangeliſt well knew that there were <hi>idols,</hi> the objects of fond adoration, beſides brazen or ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtatues, of Jupiter and Mercury. In this enlightened period, when altars are no more, and the ſmoke of heathen ſacrifice no longer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends, numerous idols are reverenced; and when the Lay Preacher enumerates their names, all his readers will agree with him, that thoſe, who bow the knee to theſe <hi>modern</hi> Baals, are "Little children," always weak and ſometimes wicked.</p>
               <p>A number of pretty women, of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, have and will, in ſpite of my leſſons, ſet up a certain ſmooth faced <hi>idol,</hi> on the top of their toilets. They call it a looking glaſs, and worſhip it hourly. This is a moſt pernicious idol; a great cheat of their time, and an artful flatterer of their beauty. They ſtraightway retire, and forget what manner of perſons they ſhould prove. They forget the fond huſband, and are deaf to the pathetick wailings of the child. They become impatient of every do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick duty, and are careful alone, with much care, to be decked in purple, and perfumed with <hi>all powders of the merchant.—Little</hi> Miſſes, liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to a friend, break your idol, it is brittle I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, read inſtructive books, and ſometimes, on a Sunday, ſermons, much better ones I mean, than thoſe of the Lay Preacher.</p>
               <p>Another ſpecies of <hi>glaſs,</hi> is a more faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idol, than the one recently deſcribed. Its name, ye topers, haunting the temple of exceſs, is <hi>drinking glaſs.</hi> In devotion to this bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

idol, I have ſeen whole companies ſo abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with elevated eyes, and outſtretched hands, that, until I heard execration, I could almoſt fancy them penitent and pious. Reeling, hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupping, and liſping, what nearer reſemblance to "little children," who ſtammer and ſprawl, can be diſcovered than thoſe ſottiſh worſhippers of wine, who have all the imbecillity of infancy, without its innocence.</p>
               <p>The ſons of Sloth might be ſuppoſed ſo ſunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in ſleep, as to be incapable of that degree of activity, neceſſary for proſtration to an idol. But the ingenuity of the ſluggard's mind ſeems to ſupply, in this inſtance, the want of <hi>bodily</hi> exertion. Like thoſe torpid monks, who have contrived, not to court piety abroad, but, to preclude long journeys, keep her ſemblance in their cell, the ſluggard, if I may ſo expreſs it, has <hi>domeſticated his</hi> idol. He does not even wake to bow himſelf before it, but, ſupine in bed, fondly <hi>hugs</hi> his <hi>pillow!</hi> Could ſnorers be rouzed from this dream, and <hi>put away this ſtrange God,</hi> how, in the beautiful phraſe of Dr. YOUNG, "would it bleſs mankind, and reſcue me."</p>
               <p>Popularity is a great <hi>idol,</hi> ſought with more aſſiduity than ever Dagon was by the Philiſtines. What <hi>ſacrifices</hi> are daily offered it by the <hi>ſeekers</hi> of office, and by the demagogues of faction. To the diſcontented, the deſperate, the debtor and the deſigning, at Boſton and Philadelphia, might not a ſober man, whether cloathed with the divine authority of the author of my text,

Happily for the dignity and well being of the Americans, that moſt uſeful and moſt numerous claſs, the landed intereſt, are ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized for deriving their wealth from their own fields, and ſlaking their thirſt at the peculiar ſpring.

lonely paſture, or gloomy wood, far from the clink of Induſtry's anvil, far from the jocund chorus of Muſick's ſongs, I meet a meagre and moping hypocondriack.

               <p>THE hope of gain, and the love of ſociety have now, for centuries, incited men, to riſque many inconveniences, for the ſake of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregating in cities.

Deſperate adventurers, bringing their craft to market would have nothing to loſe, and every thing to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030335_0044_0FE5C2F328ABE168"/>
gain in the throng. Ambition would find in every <hi>ſtreet,</hi> a ladder lofty enough to reach the extent of many a project; and Avarice could find no place more convenient to <hi>drive</hi> a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; than a frequented coffee houſe or an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure alley. Schemes of wealth and aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or pleaſure, thus operating upon hope, the buſieſt and moſt ſanguine paſſion, ſhould we wonder to mark flocks of rovers, eager and upon the wing, expecting by a flight from the <hi>country</hi> to fly from themſelves?</p>
               <p>But wiſely has the wiſe man ſaid, "Better is a handful with <hi>quietneſs,</hi> than both hands full, with travail and vexation of ſpirit." Tranquility chooſes the country for her favorite reſidence, and ſhould you inquire for the peaceable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage in town, every cit would tell you he did not know her, and that ſhe muſt be ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh perſon. In cities I grant there are many <hi>agitations,</hi> which are dignified by the name of pleaſure, but they are a ſpurious brood, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity would not call them her own. The ſtreams of pleaſure in cities are like their common ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: They are turbid, they are full of taint. He who quaffs liberally muſt ſoon be either ſick or drunk; and ſuch morbid influence have they on the brain, that men go from them, like the apoſtle's gazer in the glaſs, "not knowing what manner of perſon, they were."</p>
               <p>They who wiſh never to be cloyed, to reſpire with freedom, to enjoy the pleaſure of reading and reflection, and to ſleep ſweetly, muſt <hi>go forth
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030335_0045_0FE5C2F480378EA8"/>
into the field, and lodge in villages.</hi> Allowing that there are ſome genuine delights in the thronged town, yet they tread too faſt on each other, and weary by conſtant ſucceſſion. A man will pray ſometimes no leſs fervently for a reſpite from pleaſure, than in a fit of the gout, for a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite from pain. The pleaſures of the country, pure, ſimple, not dazzling, not boiſtrous, will gently ſtir the ſtream of life: A ſtream which paſſion ſhould not be ſuffered to vex into whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, nor be "creamed over and mantled" by the ſtagnation of ſloth. To ſaunter along the banks of the brook, and allure the trout from his receſs, to crop the fantaſtick flowers of May, or the ſtrawberries of June, to climb the ſolemn mountain, or loiter in the valley's ſhade, are cheap and real pleaſures, make no man a crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and leave no ſting behind.</p>
               <p>Such is the influence of the atmoſphere upon the human body, that even robuſt conſtitutions are ſenſible of the changes of the air, and invalids are "tremblingly alive" to them. A fluid, that whether we are ſheltered at home, or expoſed abroad, we are obliged perpetually to dabble in, we ſhould attempt to find in the utmoſt purity. But in great towns, on the margin of the main, reeking with the putrefaction of its ſhores: In cities whoſe ſtreets are defiled with frequent feet, and ſcorched by the dogſtar, where every tenth houſe is a hoſpital, it is not air which the ſallow inhabitants breathe, but "a maſs of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive things." Let the chain which binds wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030335_0046_0FE5C2F676170008"/>
priſoners to the crowd be broken, let them "go forth to the field," and if the eaſy play of their lungs, and alertneſs of limbs; if the light ſlumber and the red cheek will not convince them; whence the mighty change in their health has proceeded, they deſerve to die ſoon, and in ſome dirty lane, as a puniſhment for their incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Diſſipation being the characteriſtick of cities, to travel its round will require ſo much time that none will be left to cultivate the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or mend the heart. Whatever ſome indolent fine ladies and fine gentlemen may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we were not ſent into this world merely to go to aſſemblies, to ſaunter at ſhops, to purchaſe of milliners or undergo the three hours operation of a barber. He, who wiſhes to read verſes, or write them, he who means to inſtruct others, or commune with himſelf, muſt ſeek the retirement of the "field" and the "village." In the city, protracted dinners and midnight revel, will murder half, and more than the day, and the long repoſe of the morning will be neceſſary to repair the waſted ſpirit. In ſolitude, as there are few incidents to enchain the mind, and few exceſſes to debaſe it, the ſtudent will bring a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling intellect to the complicated talk, and from a pen put to a rural deſk, all difficulty and hindrance will vaniſh away. He who in city, and broken ſlumbers, has a thouſand times turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pillow and himſelf, and, like SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE's king, has muttered, "O partial ſleep,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030335_0047_0FE5C311E395B5F0"/>
how have I frighted thee," will find that if he would ſleep ſoundly he muſt "lodge in the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage." That exerciſe which in the country, is uſually taken in the day, will induce that laſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ever accompanied by delicious repoſe at night. He may be aſſured that <hi>at the cloſe of the day, the hamlet is ſtill</hi>; no lumbering carts or chariots will baniſh his pleaſant dreams, no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of midnight murder chill his palpitating heart. No noiſe will ſtrike his ear, but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant waterfall, and no fires glitter in his eye, but the innoxious one of the lucid inſect of the meadows. At this genial period, when every June roſe is broad blown, and the garniture of the fields is of the greeneſt hue, the emigrant from town, may, perhaps, find ſome amuſement not inferior to gambling all night, tracing duſty ſtreets or viſiting the ſagacious dog. He will acknowledge the flavour of our ſtrawberry equal to his pine apple, and the notes of the robin, and wren "of little quill," may ſooth him as much and ſound as ſweet as thoſe of the ſong-ſtreſs of the theatre.</p>

               <p>When JOB had been maltreated by ſome <hi>Jacobin,</hi> of Uz perhaps, who wiſhed for a rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution in favour of ſome inſinuating democrat, the wiſh of JOB, "O that my enemy had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a book," though apparently enigmatical, is one of the moſt pertinent and leaſt abſurd wiſhes recorded in hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Profound knowledge of the world, taught him not to pray that his foe, by ſome ſudden impulſe, or ſome ſanguinary paſſion, might render himſelf obnoxious to juſtice. He knew, that in mercy's code, there was perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a ſaving clauſe in favour of the errors of the <hi>heart,</hi> but that for the deliberate effuſions of the <hi>head</hi> there was no proviſo. He knew, that to pronounce his enemy a knave, though it might put the wary Jews on their guard, when he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a pledge, or propoſed a bargain, would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong an uſurious tribe, noted for the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of trade, render him an object of reſpect, rather than of contempt. The irritated man of Uz, therefore, with ſingular ſagacity, implores that he <hi>might write</hi> a book. The vanity of Authorſhip, JOB probably argued, will induce him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ideas, crude or abſurd, and criticizing Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zites

               <p>From the above hiſtory of what probably paſſed in JOB's mind it will appear, that it was his decided opinion nothing could be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to his enemy as a <hi>bad head,</hi> if its owner ſhould hazard a publick expoſure of its thoughts. So few heads are capable of framing uſeful books, that the chance was that a fooliſh one would be produced by that author, who, in oppoſition to all the Eaſt, was preſumptuous and depraved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be the avowed "enemy" of a popular citizen. Such an arrogant ſcribbler would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commit <hi>himſelf</hi> by dogmatical aſſertion, or alarm <hi>others</hi> by libertine argument, his book would be too trite for the wiſe, or too obſcure for the ſimple.</p>

               <p>Daring and impudent as it may appear in this levelling age, to avow reſpect for birth or talents, I confeſs, as a little of the ariſtocratical leaven has poſſibly leavened the whole lump, that my notions on this ſubject are very old faſhioned.

               <p>AND where is the ſullen mortal, who would refuſe to obey ſo pleaſant an injunction as this, coming too on the authority of SOLOMON?</p>
               <p>However, as this doctrine at firſt view, ſeems to flatter the indulgence of the paſſions, and therefore to proceed with an ill grace from a moral teacher, let us look narrowly into SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON's ſyſtem, and endeavor that wiſdom may be juſtified of her children.</p>
               <p>In one of the moſt intereſting and amuſing Journals that we find in the Bible, SOLOMON has narrated to us the hopes and fears, which agitated his buſy life. Born a monarch he could exerciſe ſupreme power, and a courtier of the muſes he acquired the higheſt wiſdom His city was magnificent, his ſubjects loyal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce wafted him all that was rare from Sidon, and the decks of Tarſhiſh ſhips glittered with the pageantry of its peacocks. In a ſituation ſo favorable to enjoyment, it was natural that he ſhould withhold his heart from no joy, and that the luxury of the Eaſt ſhould excite him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine on pleaſure. From his love of letters, his firſt indulgencies were of courſe <hi>mental.</hi> He conned the pithy ſayings of Orientals, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued his faculties with the ſcholaſtick jargon of many a Rabbi. But ſoon diſcovering that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030335_0052_0FE5C2FF673A7EE8"/>
he was directing his thoughts through a track<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs maze, that if ſuch abſtruſe diſquiſitions were too eagerly purſued, wiſdom would turn into folly and too much learning make him mad, he reſolved to deſcend from the pinnacle of ſpeculation, and mix with men in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of life. We then hear of his agricultural experiments, the cares of a numerous houſehold, and his <hi>publick</hi> works. Through the duſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of Paleſtine, he probably conveyed diſtant water to thirſty ſubjects, and overarched the brook Cedron with numerous bridges. But the reſtleſs Prince, when the labors of the day were paſt, and he communed with his own heart in the <hi>inner</hi> chamber of the palace found, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection's ſober hour, that this was a ſore travail and vexation of ſpirit. At length, after nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous experiments on happineſs, he drew a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal compariſon between the various ſituations in life. After ſtating the accompt of human hope and diſappointment, with <hi>clerical</hi> accuracy, that Folly has a funeral ſplendid as that of the wiſe, that the goods of fortune are periſhable, and though attained by induſtry may probably deſcend to an Idler, that the reign of novelty was paſt, and every object wore the uniform of ſameneſs, he concludes, I think philoſophically, by arguing againſt anxiety and enjoining a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate participation of feſtal joys.</p>
               <p>From various paſſages, interſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>volume of our belief,</hi> I am peſuaded that chriſtianity was deſigned to be a <hi>cheerful</hi> ſyſtem.

Miſerable was the perverſion of its precepts by thoſe in early time, who believed that none could prove ſincere votaries, but the moping and the auſtere. It is wonderful that primitive Piety, who muſt be ſuppoſed to hold the Bible conſtantly in her hand, ſhould not diſcern the numerous texts enjoined to ſanctify the moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate uſe of the good things of this world. Not to be too anxious, and to rejoice evermore are particular precepts of the New Teſtament. I hope I ſhall not be accuſed of thinking like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain philoſophers of the ſect of the Epicureans, when I frankly acknowledge that I can ſee no reaſon to forbid the ſtraiteſt of our religion, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a dinner with <hi>ſweet</hi> herbs inſtead of the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ones of the paſſover.

               <p>If a fretful farmer, who in ſome rainy day, thinks no employment is ſo toilſome as that which he exerciſes, will caſt his eyes upon the various idlers, ſauntering along, with pale cheeks and gouty limbs, <hi>from Dan to Beerſheba,</hi> he will be convinced that mowing in July, and haling wood in winter, are leſs fatiguing than pleaſure's race. When an inquiſitive being aſks why there is ſo much vice and miſery in this world, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no anſwer would be more pertinent, than becauſe the vicious and miſerable, have, at ſome period of their lives, been haters of laborious work, and huſbandry.</p>
               <p>What is it but this averſion to labor, and a fantaſtick wiſh to be free from care, that urges
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030335_0055_0FE5C30715375DB0"/>
ſo many to exchange wheat for whiſky, and their money for a game of cards? Why do ſuch numbers beg at rich men's doors? Why are ſo many rheumatick limbs propped by crutches and ſtaves? Why does the attorney commence ſuch frequent ſuits for the innkeeper? And, Why are the debtor's rooms in a jail crowded? If the hoe, the ſpade and the field could ſpeak, they would ſay, becauſe men hearken to the whiſpers of fancy, and forſake us, their beſt allies in life's warfare.</p>
               <p>Unleſs the ſower goeth forth to ſow, he cannot expect ſixty or an hundred fold. Unleſs men ſometimes love laborious work and huſbandry, they will not reckon much fine gold, nor be eagerly <hi>inquired after in the gate.</hi> The ages of miracles are paſt, and I know not whether man has a right to expect that Providence will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe particularly in his favor, and give him bread, if he will not be at the pains to <hi>leaven</hi> it.</p>
               <p>That ancient adjudication, which ſentenced Adam to eat bread in the ſweat of his brow, has been harſhly denominated a curſe, by unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtians.

But if it had been realized, and men, like the auſtere governor in the goſpel, could have reaped where they had not ſown, and gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered where they had not ſtrewed; ſuch a ſtate of inaction would produce an extreme of weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more intolerable than the drudgery of the field. A profound obſerver has remarked, that if all the year were playing holidays, to ſport would be as tedious as to work; and if we mark the men of pleaſure, whom the legacy, or the partiality of parents, has enriched, we ſhall diſcover the truth of the obſervation. Who is ſo anxious, who loſes ſo much reſt, who ſo worketh with his hands, as the nocturnal gameſter? What perils, what ſtorms, what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue the drunkard encounters, navigating the raging ocean of wine; yet it is theſe, who make delight a trade, and what ſhould be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional relaxation, the buſineſs of life. For my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I cannot help thinking, that cutting tender graſs is more eaſy than cutting unlucky cards; that the laborer with a corn baſket on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is leſs burdened than the tipler with the <hi>load</hi> of his ſtomach, and that the flaxen head plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, tracing the ſtraight and undeviating fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, has a lighter taſk to fulfil than he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wilders himſelf in the mazes of wantonneſs, and ſeeks thoſe daughters of Zion, who walk with ſtretched forth necks.</p>

               <p>—WILLING to carry any burdens through thick and thin; the dirtieſt roads the moſt formidable obſtructions, the "hill difficulty" or the "valley of humiliation," are all the ſame to the "ſtrong aſſes" of this world.</p>
               <p>On my return from a viſit to a brother par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſtopped at an inn for refreſhment, and an African hoſtler held my ſtirrup for a weary limb to diſmount. His hat was under his arm, his body bent to more than a curve, and his looks of cringing obſequiouſneſs, for a moment angered me, not at him, for I ſaw <hi>ſlave</hi> in the furrows of his cheek, but at the firſt gold coaſt navigators who thus dared to change humanity into a "ſtrong aſs."—Not ſlaves alone are thus meanly ſubſervient, I obſerved to myſelf. I know ſome in that predicament who are free— Is it poſſible? How free? Why they have the keys to their chamber—they go like the winds,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030335_0072_0FE5C37ABAF52B90"/>
where they liſt—they are not in the cuſtody of the officer—But avarice ſends them on vile er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, and to fetch or carry gold they "couch down," like Iſſachar the "ſtrong aſs."</p>
               <p>I ſometimes ſee a little mercenary attorney "couching down" at the bar, taxing his bill of coſt, and pointing to the careleſs client that he has forgotten "one ſhilling more for this writ." I hear him argue, not with ingenuity, not with eloquence, for then I ſhould do him homage, but by rote; croaking ſentences from the ſtatute book, and heſitating law from his "puddled" memory. I hear him ſcold a trembling culprit, as a toothleſs old woman ſcolds a wayward child; a culprit, for the firſt time, whoſe only offence is cutting a twig from the wayſide tree. But this urchin avenger of publick wrongs, holds his dogs eared law in one hand, and rudely puſhes from him "<hi>ſweet mercy</hi>" with the other. His bray, his ſtupidity, his callouſneſs are all derived from the houſe of "ISSACHAR," and when I ſee him with his <hi>green bag,</hi> moiling for the laſt dollar of the entangled client, verily I ſee as "ſtrong" an "aſs" as the Patriarch did, when he gazed at the moſt ſluggiſh of his children.</p>

When, like ABSALOM, he ſtands at the city gate, taking every ſtranger familiarly by the hand, inquiring his grievances, and hinting that, "if <hi>I</hi> were a ruler in Iſrael how ſoon they would be redreſſed," the moſt careleſs elector may anticipate Virginia politicks, hotter than the ſun, battles againſt the funding ſyſtem, crude calumny againſt the Preſident, zeal for French lanterns, and reſolutions of democratick clubs, enough to fill both panniers of "a ſtrong aſs."</p>

               <p>By the partiality of my ſubjects, and their implicit belief of the excellency of my wiſdom, I have been made <hi>keeper of the vineyard,</hi> or, in other words, monarch of Iſrael. My fame has reached diſtant nations. I have the reputation of poſſeſſing more knowledge, than all my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary philoſophers; than "ETHAN," and "HEMAN," and "CHALCOL," and "DARDA." The Botaniſts aſſure me that I ſpeak learnedly of "trees," and that I deſcribe the various gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era and ſpecies of the vegetable kingdom, from the aſpiring cedar to the lowly hyſſop. HIRAM extols my ſkill in mechanicks, and affirms, that not an architect throughout the realms of Tyre, can rival the ingenuity of my deſigns. My ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jects praiſe the bleſſings of my adminiſtration. Foreigners and travellers vie with each other, in making their court to me: Every man brings his preſent of what is moſt valuable, veſſels of ſilver, and veſſels of gold; even the caprice of a female, has, for once, been reſtrained, and the Queen of Sheba's admiration of my wiſdom, was the ſame when ſhe left, as when ſhe entered my palace.

Have I noted and corrected my own faults with the ſame circumſpection that I remarked and puniſhed thoſe of other men. Am I not obliged, conſcious of the licenſe of my own palace, to ſuffer the men of Judah and Iſrael, to waſte all their time eating and drinking, and making mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and is not this revelry the pernicious reſult of my careleſs example, rather than a chaſtized joy, under my prudent government? Have I conſiſtently arbitrated with rigor the differences between <hi>two</hi> harlots, while <hi>ſeven hundred</hi> are quarrelling in my ſeraglio, for the lawleſs favors of their ſovereign? No, even myſelf, endowed with ſuperior powers, have often proved weak and wicked. Placed upon wiſdom's ſummit, I have deſcended; forgetting my dignity, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of my duties, proſtituting my throne, I have been raviſhed with ſtrange women, and have drunken of the wine which the ſons of riot min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. I have been promoted to the highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible office of keeper of the vineyards, but mine own vineyard I have not guarded vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly.</p>
               <p>If SOLOMON could walk with ſo good a grace through the valley of humiliation, which we are aſſured, on the faith of BUNYAN, is one of the moſt rugged rambles that a chriſtian can take, ſurely in theſe modern and degenerate days, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every man, who is a "keeper," either of vineyards, or any thing elſe, may inquire wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he has at all times been a faithful keeper to himſelf.

Inſtant capture muſt have enſued, had not a certain <hi>poor</hi> man, whoſe mind was better ſtocked, than his purſe, delivered, by the wiſdom of his plans, the city, and freed the inhabitants from their terrors. Here we naturally anticipate a lively picture of the gratitude of the beſieged, towards this political ſaviour. Too many ſtatutes could not be erected in honour of ſuch gallantry and enterprize, too many ſhekels of ſilver could not be given to relieve the poverty of him who had ſo well deſerved. We might ſuppoſe that the wealthy citizens would pay liberal tithes to one, by whom their all had been ſaved. Chaſte dames and coy virgins, exulting that their purity had not been violated, by a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoldiery, would naturally crowd around their protector, and the bluſhes of a thouſand cheeks atteſt that modeſty had not been injured. But he, who ſhould draw this concluſion, and imagine that even uſeful poverty muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be recompenſed, would prove himſelf a raſh and unobſerving man. We might allow the benevolence of his own heart, but what ſhould
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030335_0085_0FE5C3A52F18E668"/>
we think of his knowledge of the hearts of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? That men are not always grateful for ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal favors, that poverty is ever contemptible, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when accompanied by merit, may be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the courſe of every day's experience, may be learned from the ſequel of the ſtory, which began this ſermon. Though <hi>all</hi> men natives of the beſieged city, had ſuch occaſion to recollect their benefactor, yet the mortifying concluſion of the narrative, is, that in the words of my text, <hi>no man remembered that ſame poor man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However penury may be diſdained by thoſe ſelfiſh ones, whom legacies and avarice have enriched, we find that the beſt friend of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in benedictions of the poor. In the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the mount, a much more accurate and eloquent diſcourſe, than any of MASILLON'S, the <hi>poor in</hi> ſpirit are eſpecially named, and a kingdom promiſed them, ſurpaſſing all the thrones and principalities of Europe. It was not the magnificent palace, it was not the Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bank, it was the poor man's hovel, it was the receſs, of the forlorn outcaſt which the ſon of the carpenter viſited. To the <hi>poor</hi> the Goſpel was preached, it was a <hi>poor</hi> widow whoſe two <hi>miles</hi> ſhone more brilliantly in the eyes of one, not likely to be dazzled, than all the gold of thoſe opulent contributers, who caſt in much to the Jewiſh treaſury. The rich man querying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future life, is told that a ſale of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and liberal donations to the <hi>poor</hi> are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to ſalvation. While Wealth and Power
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030335_0086_0FE5C3AC6C9E7C40"/>
and Rank were neglected, <hi>poor</hi> Shepherds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the honor of a glorious annunciation. The companions of the ſon of Mary were not the opulent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phariſee, and the Roman patrican, but the <hi>poor</hi> fiſhermen of Galilee. When diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to exerciſe the functions of apoſtleſhip, they were forbidden <hi>purſe</hi> or ſcrip. The wealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt of them was worth but thirty pieces of ſilver, and thoſe JUDAS gained by ſpeculating upon his ſaviour. The cloſe of the bargain might prove that poverty was better then riches. His title to the caſh proved more rotten than a Georgia purchaſe. As he was hanged for his pains, his money raiſed him for a time, but then "it was fifty cubits higher than he dreamed of."</p>

               <p>IT has been remarked by ingenious moraliſts, that although the negligence of mankind ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers minute diviſions of <hi>Time,</hi> to paſs unregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, yet at the cloſe of <hi>centuries</hi> or <hi>years,</hi> it is common to pauſe and compute in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they have been employed. To juſtify the truth of this obſervation, moſt of my pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have toyed with time, days and months, begin now to grieve that another idle <hi>year</hi> is gone, and reſolve that the next ſhall be more buſy. While all round him are repeating the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſeaſon, and with jocund voices, wiſhing each other "<hi>A happy new year,</hi>" the Lay Preacher, with affectionate zeal, will ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt plans, by which theſe annual wiſhes for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity may be realized.</p>
               <p>Moſt men are criminally idle. I confeſs with candor, that I loiter and ſlumber much, and while I preach induſtry to others, <hi>am myſelf a caſtaway.</hi> But the ſun, which darts his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful rays through the curtain undrawn, at nine o'clock, ſeems to upbraid my ſluggiſhneſs, and to wiſh that I would announce to the lazy of my flock, that they will not, like him, at once ſhine and be of uſe, unleſs, like him, they riſe

ſeaſonably. My readers are therefore vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently exhorted, early to extinguiſh their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and to uſe the Day Lamp, which neither ſputters nor flares, whoſe wick never burns out, and whoſe oil never fails. All who wiſh that the year may be happy, muſt rigorouſly obſerve this injunction. No complaints muſt be heard of the chill of winter mornings, or the ſhortneſs of ſummer nights, but as ſoon as the above <hi>Lamp</hi> begins to glimmer, let them riſe and work. They will ſoon be convinced that it is ſo ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly contrived, its radiance will not offend the eyes, nor its exhalations taint the lungs, like the vulgar tapers of midnight. If the Lay Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er himſelf, ſhould, contrary to his own doctrine, be found ſnoring in his ſtudy, while his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are walking in their vocation, he gives them full permiſſion to call a council, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs him from his office.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of employing the uſual expreſſion, of "a happy new year," it would perhaps, be an improvement to vary the phraſe, and adapt it to the character of the perſon, who is addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhould I compliment a man of feeble knees,, whoſe eyes are red, and whoſe purſe is impoveriſhed by "tarrying late at the wine," I ſhould wiſh him a <hi>ſober</hi> year. I ſhould wiſh that his landlord, when the third bowl or bottle is called for, would refuſe to truſt, and that the liquor he ſwallowed, inſtead of raiſing, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his ſpirits, and that he might peruſe ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,

that chapter of the Prophet, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces "woe to the drunkards of EPHRAIM."</p>
               <p>If I meant that a ſluggard ſhould enjoy a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py year, I ſhould wiſh him an <hi>active</hi> and <hi>labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> one. I would apply to ſome noiſy team<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or ſome importunate client, to bellow at his window, at the dawn of day. I would even advance a dollar from my ſmall ſalary, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a couple of cocks, to crow him up to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The year of the idler, would then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be happy. You would hear from him no complaints of ſpleen, or nervous diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. He would have no bill to pay the apoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecary for pills, to cure indigeſtion. He would not only "ſet his things in order on the firſt month," but habit would cauſe order to appear throughout his affairs, during the year.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that I ſhould tackle a ſleigh, and go with my wife to Boſton. I could not fail, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the market or ſome coffee houſe, of meeting that animal, more reſtleſs than a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bird, called a Democrat or Jacobin. If I wiſhed him a happy new year, he would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude that I meant a <hi>revolutionary</hi> one. He would imagine that my wiſh involved the abdication of WASHINGTON, the execution of JAY, and the introduction of the Guillotine. Now, as I am a good ſubject, and perfectly well ſatisfied with the preſent order of things, noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could be farther from my intention. Guarding againſt a meaning ſo miſchievous, I would expreſs my annual compliment different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

and wiſh him an <hi>obedient</hi> and <hi>well governed</hi> year. I would interdict him from reading French gazettes, forbid his pronouncing the word "RODESPIERRE," and debar him from noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal clubs, or ſpeeches. The man would infallibly become a good federaliſt, and his year would be happy.</p>
               <p>The wiſh for <hi>Gamblers</hi> muſt be expreſſed in a very extraordinary and enigmatical manner. Inſtead of a <hi>happy</hi> new year, it would be the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their <hi>real</hi> friends to pray that it might be an <hi>unlucky</hi> one. An unlucky year would be a year of jubilee to the gameſter. Such a year would operate a thorough reformation. Should the friendly wiſh for <hi>ill luck</hi> be realized, and the gameſter neither hold <hi>pam fluſh, four by honors,</hi> nor the <hi>odd trick,</hi> what a clear ſaving to his purſe, his health and his time! He would ſoon conſider cards as the emiſſaries of Misfortune, he would endeavour to grow rich, by ſurer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, he would not only diſcard <hi>the Knave</hi> from <hi>his hand,</hi> but from his conduct, and be more anxious to turn the penny, than a <hi>Trump.</hi>

               <p>MEN, who have witneſſed the horrors of that tempeſtuous and deformed ſeaſon, which by its cold, contracts the body, and by its gloom depreſſes the mind, naturally feel at the firſt glimpſe of warmth, and vegetation an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribable rapture. Even in the mild climates of the Eaſt, in the ſunny gardens of Paleſtine, the flight, the ſhort, and fleeting winter, was conſidered an enemy to joy; and SOLOMON congratulates the arrival of SPRING, in a ſtrain of uncommon gaiety. In a tone, ſoft as the ſeaſon, and animated as its pleaſures, he exhorts his "fair one" to "riſe," to "come away," and in the open fields to hear the wild muſick of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to obſerve her green and tender tribes, burſting from the ſepulchre of cold. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030335_0095_0FE5C3C398AF1398"/>
is enforced by a moſt lively deſcription of the landſcape; and the appropriate metaphors, SOLOMON employs, ſeem inſpired by the very genius of the ſeaſon, and the liquid, and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious words he ſelects, are reſponſive to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's notes.</p>
               <p>If a native of Jeruſalem could be thus elated, at the ſucceſſion of ſpring, after the <hi>mildeſt</hi> reign of winter, what muſt be the delight of him, who, under our nothern ſkies, beholds, for more than half the year, a waſte of ſnows, hears the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night howl of the ſtorm, and feels the nitrous needles of a frigid atmoſphere, lacerating every pore?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſitions are ſuperfluous. We need only look at the door of the cottage, or ſtray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neareſt paſture, to diſcern the operation of ſpring upon the hopes of the huſbandman. Tired of the dull and ſullen company of the auſtere months, and diſguſted with the chimney corner, which denies room and exerciſe to his plough, at the whiſtle of the firſt robin, he flies, like "the roe," or the "young hart of Bether," to furrows and fields. The genial ſun burniſhes his manly cheek, the ſoft and voluptuous air, vivifies his ſturdy limbs, he ſurveys the riſing blade, and anticipates the golden harveſt.</p>
               <p>But though Nature, in her various exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of verdure and of flowers, and by her chorus of ſinging birds, ſeems at firſt view to have no other object, than to amuſe our ſpecies, as a Painter, or Muſician, yet, on reflection, we

ſhall find her both a provident matron, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring our nutriment, and a uſeful monitor, urging us to toil. As I am entirely of opinion with that Ancient, and with that Poet, who ſaw his duty inſcribed on every leaf, and found a tongue in trees, and books in the running brooks, I think it would not be unprofitable for every man, who looks abroad, to remark that every department both in the animal, and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kingdom is <hi>in action.</hi> Thoſe countleſs tribes, who during winter, were faſt locked in the chambers of froſt, are now each moment on the wing, and inceſſantly employed. No pauſe can be diſcerned in nature's preſent operations, every energy is awake, and even inert matter progreſſing. It ſeems to me impoſſible that an Idler ſhould rove on our mountains, and not be leſſoned into induſtry. In January, when green corn could not wave, and the violet of our val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies was unfolded, he might argue himſelf into a belief, that to <hi>him</hi> a ſuſpenſion of native powers was alike neceſſary. But in May, there is a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion incentives to exertion, and not one reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe for ſupineneſs. Man was deſtined to activity, like the other parts of our ſyſtem, and they call on him to lend a helping hand to their labors. The moſt minute drop of ſap, riſing in its tube, and the embryo germ burſting from bark, to a contemplative liſtner, appear to ſpeak and upbraid the ſlothful man for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in uſeful motion, like themſelves.</p>

The other evening, as I was turning over, agreeably to my uſual practice, the pages o ſcripture, I dwelt with undeſcribable pleaſure upon certain paſſages in the life of the patriarch ABRAHAM.

               <p>ABRAHAM, a moſt affectionate parent, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that his life declined, and zealous with
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030335_0099_0FE5C3CDC1EA0168"/>
the anxiety of old age, for an eſtabliſhment for ISAAC, intreats a confidential ſteward of the houſehold, that he would not ſuffer the inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced heart of his ſon to be captivated by the Canaanitiſh beauties. At the earneſt requeſt of the patriarch, the ſervant binds himſelf to ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it for ISAAC a wife of his own rank, religion and country. After ſanctioning this promiſe, by one of the moſt tremendous oaths among the Jewiſh uſages, he harneſſes his camels, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts for Meſopotamia. On his arrival at the ſuburbs of Nahor, a city of that country, fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a tedious journey, and tender of his drudging camels, he makes, them kneel by a well of water, to take their neceſſary refreſhment. In this weary moment, REBEKAH appears; and the firſt accents that fell from the parched tongue of the traveller, were to ſolicit a little water from the pitcher, which ſhe carried, "<hi>And ſhe made haſte, and let down her pitcher from her ſhoulder, and ſaid, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink alſo.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Let us now gaze earneſtly at theſe ſimple, yet beautiful features.</p>
               <p>The female whoſe courteſy is thus recorded, was a woman of ſome diſtinction, in thoſe paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times. Her father was of a ſtock abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpectable, for he was allied to ABRAHAM, and her brother was the opulent LABAN, whoſe cattle ſtrayed on a thouſand hills. Engaged in domeſtick duty, ſhe meets a ſtranger, in the garb, probably of a hireling, for he is called, in

the text, "ſervant," begrimed with duſt, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no claim to her favor. She is aſked for water, which ſhe cheerfully gives, and the careleſs read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will not be aware of the extent of the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he have not ſurveyed a map of Paleſtine, and adverted to the ſandineſs and thirſt of the ſoil. In that arid region, a brook was a more joyous ſight to a panting ſhepherd, than a bumper would be now to the votary of wine, the invaluable well ſpring, eagerly ſought, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately contended for, by different tribes, was, from the nature of the earth, at ſuch a diſtance below the ſurface, that to obtain water was a work both of toil and time. But, forgetting her home, forgetting herſelf, and "diſdaining little delicacies," ſhe thinks only of the ſufferings of the way faring ſtranger; and with that "<hi>kind charity</hi>" which the Apoſtle emphaſizes, with that genuine, diſintereſted civility, <hi>beyond</hi> the Court of Verſailles, the tedious deſcent of the well ſhe repeatedly tries, and the cooling pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er imparts, not only to the man, but even to his unpetitioning beaſts. "Drink," ſays the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous girl, and, truſt me that I can feel likewiſe for your burdened companions, "for I will give thy <hi>camels</hi> drink alſo." This was benevolence, ſuch as is not generally found. It was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently diſintereſted, prompt and diffuſive. It was diſintereſted; for the tongue which ſhe cooled was not that of a youthful gallant, trol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the oily phraſes of flattery. He, who drained the pitcher, which the aſſiduity of RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEKAH
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030335_0101_0FE5C3CF2BD3D558"/>
filled, was an old man, a ſervant, and a ſtranger. It was prompt; for ſhe "haſted," and ſhe "ran" to do good; and drew water for "all the camels," though the troop conſiſted of ten. It was diffuſive; for <hi>they</hi> were minutely regarded, no leſs than their proprietor.</p>
               <p>I warmly wiſh that the manners of many, who deem themſelves poliſhed, were at the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent day, as excellent as thoſe of this primitive well bred woman. Frequenting no <hi>aſſemblies,</hi> but thoſe of the next green, or meadow, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſſons of good breeding, but thoſe which her own warm heart dictated, we find her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment graceful, though ſhe never paid a dancing maſter, we find her a <hi>maid of honor,</hi> though ſhe never ſaw a Court! True Politeneſs, unlike that of men of the mode, conſiſts in actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rendering little ſervices to our neighbor, rather than in the oſtentatious <hi>promiſe</hi> of great ones. Indifferent to its own eaſe, it thinks much of another's, diſcerns the latent wiſh, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the neceſſity of aſking favors, by ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſtowing them.</p>

of aſtronomy, he muſt have well known before, "That the morning cometh, and alſo the night." Any old Almanack could have ſaid as much. I think that night, however ſooty and illfavoured it may be pronounced by thoſe who were born under a day ſtar, merits a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription. I feel peculiarly diſpoſed to arrange ſome ideas in favour of this ſeaſon. I know that the majority are literally <hi>blind</hi> to its merits, they muſt be prominent indeed to be diſcerned by the <hi>cloſed</hi> eyes of the ſnorer, who thinks that night was made for nothing but ſleep. But the ſtudent and the ſage are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe that it was formed for higher pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and that it not only recruits exhauſted ſpirits, but ſometimes informs inquiſitive, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wicked ones.</p>
               <p>Duty, as well as inclination, urges the Lay Preacher to ſermonize, while others ſlumber. To read numerous volumes in the morning, and to obſerve various characters at noon, will leave but little time, except the night, to digeſt the one or ſpeculate upon the other. The night, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is often dedicated to compoſition, and while the light of the paly planets diſcovers at his deſk the Preacher, more wan than they, he may be heard repeating emphatically with Dr. YOUNG,
"Darkneſs has much Divinity for me."
He is then alone, he is then at peace. No com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions near, but the ſilent volumes on his

ſhelf, no noiſe abroad, but the click of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage clock, or the bark of the village dog. The Deacon has then ſmoked his ſixth, and <hi>laſt</hi> pipe, and aſks not a queſtion more, concerning JO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPHUS, or the Church. Stillneſs aids ſtudy, and the Sermon proceeds.

As my watchful eyes can diſcern its dim beauties, my warm heart ſhall feel, and my prompt pen ſhall deſcribe, the uſes and the pleaſures of the nocturnal hour.</p>
               <p>Watchman, what of the night? I can with propriety, imagine this queſtion addreſſed to myſelf, I am a profeſſed Lucubrator, and who ſo well qualified to delineate the ſable hours, as
"A meagre, muſe rid mope, aduſt and thin."
However injuriouſly night is treated by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>leepy moderns, the vigilance of the antients could not overlook its benefits and joys. In as early a record, as the book of Geneſis, I find that ISAAC, though he devoted his aſſiduous days to action, reſerved ſpeculation till night. "He went out to meditate in the field at the eventide." He choſe that ſad, that ſolemn hour, to reflect upon the virtues of a beloved and departed mother. The tumult and glare of day ſuited not with the ſorrow of his ſoul. He had loſt his moſt amiable, moſt genuine friend, and his unoſtentatious grief was eager for privacy and ſhade. Sincere ſorrow rarely ſuffers its tears to be ſeen. It was natural for ISAAC to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030335_0104_0FE5C3D95BFCEAC0"/>
ſelect a ſeaſon to weep in, which ſhould reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble "the colour of his fate." The darkneſs, the ſolemnity, the ſtillneſs of eve were favorable to his melancholy purpoſe. He forſook therefore the buſtling tents of his father, the pleaſant "ſouth country," and "well of Lahairoi," he went out and penſively meditated at the eventide.</p>
               <p>The Grecian and Roman philoſophers firmly believed that "the dead of midnight is the noon of thought." One of them is beautifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Poet, as ſoliciting knowledge from the ſkies, in private and nightly audience, and that neither his theme, nor his nightly walks were forſaken till the ſun appeared and dimmed his "nobler intellectual beam." We undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly owe to the ſtudious nights of the ancients moſt of their elaborate and immortal produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Among them it was neceſſary that every man of letters ſhould trim the midnight lamp. The day might be given to the Forum or the Circus, but the night was the ſeaſon for the Stateſman to project his ſchemes, and for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et to pour his verſe. Night has likewiſe with great reaſon been conſidered in every age as the aſtronomer's day. <hi>Young</hi> obſervers, with energy, that "an <hi>undevout aſtronomer is mad.</hi>" The privilege of contemplating thoſe brilliant and numerous myriads of planets which bedeck our ſkies is peculiar to night, and it is our duty, both as lovers of moral and natural beauty, to bleſs that ſeaſon, when we are indulged with
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030335_0105_0FE5C3DA259E0910"/>
ſuch a gorgeous diſplay of glittering and uſeful light. It muſt be confeſſed that the ſecluſion, calmneſs, and tranquility of midnight, is moſt friendly to ſerious and even airy contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Milton, in one of his poems, ſays fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently

                     <l>Be ſeen in ſome high lonely tower</l>
                     <l>—To unfold</l>
                     <l>What worlds, or what vaſt regions hold</l>
                     <l>Th' immortal mind, that hath forſook</l>

               <p>The rigid Dr. JOHNSON was ſo convinced that late hours were auxiliary to the <hi>feaſt of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the flow of ſoul,</hi> that he uſed to declare "no man, but a ſcoundrel went to bed before midnight." This expreſſion was perhaps too ſtrong, and he would not have uſed it, had he lived in a farm houſe. But his love of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of men of letters and his experience that Fancy is generally moſt wakeful, when Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſleeps, tempted him to employ a phraſe which muſt ſtartle every laborer, who, by mere laſſitude of limb is compelled early to retire.</p>
               <p>Night being friendly to playful no leſs than to metaphyſical, and abſtract thought, not only the author and ſtateſman watch, but likewiſe the ſons of ſociability and glee. Thoſe, who "eat the bread of carefulneſs," go ſoon to bed, to digeſt their meal, and leave the darkened hours to be enjoyed by men of genius, or waſted by men of pleaſure. St. PAUL avers that they that
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030335_0106_0FE5C3DC3AAA18D0"/>
be drunken are drunken in the night, and I know that its broad mantle is frequently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to cover exceſs from the world. Still, the arrival of night is greeted by many, who wiſh neither to ſleep, nor drink it away. Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation often holds a levee at midnight, and Wit and Sentiment and Song like the Fairies, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſport before the cock crow. I think it treaſon to this ſable power, who holds divided empire with day, conſtantly to ſhut our eyes at her approach. To long ſleep, I am decidedly a foe. As it is expreſſed by a quaint writer, we ſhall all have enough of that in the grave.

               <p>One of my pariſhioners, a very induſtrious and thriving cobler, who ſupports a wife, "<hi>nine ſmall children, and one at the breaſt,</hi>" by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of leather, I knew, "even from his boyiſh days." At fourteen he ſang wicked ballads to his fellow apprentices, drank raw rum, in a frol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, out of the old ſhoes of the ſhop, and burnt the boots of the cuſtomers. At twenty one, three benevolent maidens complained of him to the 'ſquire, and he was obliged to pawn his <hi>freedom ſuit,</hi> to indemnify the pariſh. He next commenced a <hi>roaring</hi> blade, drank flip before breakfaſt, laid out his heel tap money in tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and the tavern clock ſtruck one, when he told the laſt negro ſtory. At length, he picked up Dr. FRANKLIN'S "Poor Richard," and found that this was not "The way to Wealth." He broke his mug, threw away his box, bought ſtock, earned money, <hi>kept it,</hi> and married. I ſtopt at his ſhop, a few mornings ſince, at <hi>ſunriſe,</hi> to try on a pair of ſhoes. As ſoon as the noiſe of <hi>ſix</hi> of his journeymen's hammers ceaſed, I could not forbear comparing the paſt with the preſent.

all the Fathers of the Church have punned, Ah, Mr. CRISPIN, how much more profitable is your <hi>end,</hi> than your beginning.</p>
               <p>PALEY, an Archdeacon of the Church, and, what is much better, a worthy man, tells us, in his book of philoſophy, that there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between beginning with a thouſand pounds, and ending with a hundred, and the reverſe. It is of much import, therefore, if we mean to end well, that we ſhould begin tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.

It is better than ſtock in the ſhop, or a thouſand pounds from a rich father. If a man ſhould take it into his head to <hi>begin</hi> with knavery and theft, it cannot be diſſembled, though the words of SOLOMON are againſt me, that there are <hi>ignominious</hi> ends, and if Hemp grew in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, he ought to know it, if not, I proceed to inform him that a <hi>rope's end,</hi> is one of the moſt pitiful terminations in life.

think, and politer ſcholars than a Lay Preacher, ere of ſimilar opinion, that if SALLUST could have been ſummoned to record the revolt of SHAYS, he could not have produced a work, frugal of words, prodigal of ideas, happy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, like the volume of the Lawyer. But it ſeems that his fellow citizens wanted a PAUL to caution them, for they would not defray the charges, even of binding the book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They quenched <hi>the ſpirit</hi> of the hiſtorian. Eager to know the cauſe of ſuch criminal lack of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, in my laſt journey to the metropolis, I track<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a ſtreet, and lane, in queſt of genius, I looked, and lo! a modeſt man, neither a French philoſopher, nor a dancer on wires, nor a vaulter upon ſteeds, nor a writer in the Chron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icle. Ah, I muttered to myſelf, if the flame of his <hi>ſpirit</hi> has not <hi>blazed</hi> in theſe directions, it is not marvellous, that the cautious Boſtonians, ſhould cry "quench!"</p>

               <p>I believe that I have, ſomewhere, hinted to my readers, that a newſpaper lies occaſionally on my table. But I ſurvey that weekly map of human life, more with the feelings of a moraliſt, than of a politician, and ſhed tears, rather than wine at the intelligence of a victory. If the publick papers recorded the happy marriage, and not the ſudden death, if they painted the tranquility of a <hi>Federal,</hi> and not the turbulence of a <hi>French</hi> government, every ſon of ſenſibility would peruſe them with rapture. But, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially, at this jarring period, when our ears ring with "<hi>the world's debate,</hi>" it is moſt painful to turn over pages, which, crowded with recitals of battles, ſieges, aſſaſſination, and ſlaughter, are nothing more than the records of animoſity. The old world is rent in pieces by "diviſions," Nothing but "wars" and "fightings" can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the reſtleſſneſs of France, the pride of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, and the ſtately ambition of Germany. In France there is jangling in the Cabinet, as well as the ſhock of hoſtile lances in the field. How

many wiſe and virtuous men have felt the edge of a Revolutionary ax, becauſe they differed in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a Revolutionary Tribunal. How many Britons have found untimely death in the dykes of Flanders, who might have been gathered <hi>like a ſhock of corn in his ſeaſon,</hi> had not "diviſions" among the nations urged them far from peace and the plough. However men may talk of univerſal benevolence, and the amiableneſs of the charities of life, yet we hear every day, of diviſion among them, and we are forced <hi>fully</hi> to believe it. In our own country, though the weapons of war are ſheathed, yet "diviſions," frequent and pernicious, like the tares and thorns in the parable, ariſe, and mar the peace of the community. Among the borderers of Pennſylvania, "Diviſion" touched with a brand the head of the whiſky ſtill, and the fiery ſpirits of inſurgency blazed againſt a government, the firſt and faireſt on the earth. <hi>Diviſion</hi> has been the Preſident of many a "club" and "ſelf created ſociety:" Diviſion, a ſcowling monſter, more ugly than the "Green Dragon," whoſe den, ſhe was wont to haunt. Diviſion has looked aſkance at the Treaty, and has even with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious front adventured to aſſail WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, but he <hi>ſteadfaſtly ſmiled</hi> and ſhe vaniſhed away.</p>
               <p>Men diſagree and divide in minute, no leſs than in momentous queſtions. My pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers inform me of various diviſions, and I partly believe them. Thus I hear that two young

girls of equal pretenſions to wit and beauty, cannot poſſibly live in friendſhip together, for, like the CAESAR and POMPEY of LUCAN, one cannot bear a rival, and the other is impatient of a ſuperior. I hear that two neighboring ſhopkeepers will not even look at each other, nor go to the ſame tavern, nor walk the ſame ſide of a ſtreet; all in conſequence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky <hi>diviſion.</hi> Two Counties will contend for years, which ſhall enjoy the privilege of a ſhire, and where the Courthouſe ſhall ſtand, and thus cut out work for lawyers, even before a place is provided for them to wrangle in.

               <p>THE uſual exclamation of prejudice, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or enthuſiaſm in every age.</p>
               <p>In the Acts of the Apoſtles, the occaſion of this phraſe is pleaſantly recorded. St. PAUL and his colleagues, perceiving the abſurdities of the Pagan ſyſtem, ventured to expoſe the futility of the heathen worſhip, and to point out a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter "way" to the heavenly country. But the manufacturers of idols, terribly alarmed at an innovation, which would probably abridge, if not deſtroy the profits of their trade, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convened, though not to deliberate, but to dogmatize. For inſtead of reaſoning coolly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, and attempting to prove to the populace, the celeſtial origin of their goddeſs, and the active concern ſhe took in the affairs of mortals, they gave a looſe to their paſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came full of wrath, and bawled out that DIANA was <hi>great,</hi> without once ſhewing why. Of all that hotheaded multitude, perhaps not an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual had Geography enough to aſcertain the ſite of Epheſus, or Hiſtory enough to inform him of the adventures, or exploits of DIANA. <hi>Craftſmen</hi> had told the ignorant crowd a pomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tale, to allure them to the <hi>ſilver ſhrines,</hi> and they believed, without examination.</p>
               <p>I heartily wiſh, that this cry of enthuſiaſm had ceaſed with the ſuperſtition of the ancients. But noiſes of this nature ſtill tingle in our ears,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030335_0124_0FE5C40CC8891EA0"/>
and a town clerk, at the preſent day, like his temperate predeceſſor at Epheſus, could not walk in the market place out of hearing of "Great is DIANA," or ſome other ſound, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Whether it proceeds from the warm climate in which they live, or the briſk champagne they drink, I know not, but the <hi>French</hi> are ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prone to momentary fits of enthuſiaſm, almoſt bordering on convulſions. They are a very voluble and clamorous race, and if they take it into their heads to like DIANA, they will ſwear, not without geſtures, that ſhe is <hi>great,</hi> though all others affirm ſhe is <hi>little.</hi> MONTESQUIEU might reaſon, or ROUSSEAU might harrangue, but the French would not hear, if thoſe ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary craftſmen, MARAT and ROBESPIERRE, ſhould ſummon them to the Convention, or the Champ de Mars, to aſſaſſinate a King, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a government. Trifles, like theſe, would be "light as air" to a Frenchman, if an inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſperado bawled in his ears the greatneſs and the glory of liberty and equal rights. One unlucky day, they ſet up a certain ſcowling im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, denominated, in their pretty and liquid language, the Guillotine. This to be ſure had a ſhrine, rather of ſteel than ſilver and bowed <hi>heads,</hi> rather than bended knees were the modes of adoration. Thoſe unlucky ſubjects, who during a life of loyalty, had been much in the habit of crying Great is the King, were ſoon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up as a <hi>Jewiſh ſacrifice,</hi> for times were
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030335_0125_0FE5C4134FCF2650"/>
changed, and they ſhould have ſaid great is "the <hi>Mountain!</hi>"</p>
               <p>A degree conferred by a college is a DIANA, whoſe divinity many a dunce has acknowledged. College <hi>honors,</hi> as they are termed by <hi>the craftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> often operate like amulets and charms, and protect a pedant from the warfare of wit and ridicule. They are a ſpecies of ſalt, which has ſaved many a weak and decaying brain, from putrefaction. Not a graduate from Cambridge, but vaunts of of his Alma mater, and cries, how preſcient, how witty, and how wiſe is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity! A ſceptick might doubt the greatneſs of this our <hi>learned</hi> DIANA. Its fore knowledge conſiſts in predicting inviſible eclipſes of the moon, its wit lies at the bottom of a ſyllogiſm, and its wiſdom watches the weathercocks, and compiles a bill of mortality!</p>
               <p>Some have thought that the <hi>Cambridge</hi> DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANA, did not deſerve to be <hi>worſhipped</hi> by the <hi>learned</hi> world. I was once aſked by an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive foreigner, in what alcove of our Univerſity were depoſited its own works. It is agreed, ſays he, that a College is deſigned to read and write in. Doubtleſs many of your Profeſſors were Poets; among your Tutors I expect to hear of a CICERO, and the invention of ſo elevated a character as a Preſident, muſt certainly have produced a Folio in every ſcience. My un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded affection for the College, where I had the honor to pay ſome three or four hundred pounds, for inſtruction in the firſt elements of
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030335_0126_0FE5C41501832178"/>
—<hi>nothing.</hi> My tenderneſs for the character of inſtructors of the moſt bland and accommodating humour, and my zeal for the literary renown of the moſt faſhionable ſeminary in my country, urged my ſilence to this query of the ſtranger, concerning a ſubject ſo delicate. Dear, and learned Sir, I replied, the works of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity are not confined within the narrow precincts of an alcove. The works of the Univerſity Sir, are, ſeen, are ſeen—on <hi>commencement</hi> days. They are diffuſed throughout—I wiſh I knew where, except in the form of <hi>ſtewards' bills,</hi> I muttered to myſelf. The gentleman, perceiving my heſitation, and being a man of great curioſity, and anxious to hear me quote brilliant couplets, from ſome Univerſity Laureat, or whole orations of ſome eloquent Tutor, now inſiſted upon a categorical anſwer. I therefore, in a ſuppreſſed voice, broken by many ſobs, the tears running down my cheeks, and with a world of apologies, was compelled to reveal to him the nakedneſs of literature at Cambridge. To his aſtoniſhment, and to my ſorrow, I narrated facts, "pitiful, wondrous pitiful," like OTHEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LO's ſufferings. I informed him that the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, far from being eloquent, like the orators of antiquity, were in general ſuch raw boys, that they were obliged to ſpell out, even the ſtated prayer, from the confuſed breviary of evening recollection. That the elaborate trifling of one Profeſſor, was protracted through five lectures, to ſhew his pupils what a verb was—no<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

another, in his divinity chair, would inſult his hearers with the ſilly miracles of POLYCARP, and in his publick exerciſes purloin from LELAND, the materials of a funeral eulogy. That Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was pedlared out by the penny worth, and the ſtreams of learning, inſtead of being cheaply and eaſily conducted to each ſtudent, were ſold, in their <hi>muddieſt ſtate,</hi> for a higher price than mineral water. That I never heard that any of the College Principals, were ever Poets or Painters, or produced any work more meritorious than a Greek Grammar. That ſome were of ſuch dubious taſte as to reject from the College Library, the works of STERNE and SWIFT, and to commence, at the age of fifty, the ſtudy of the Britiſh Poets as a <hi>taſk reading</hi>! I informed my friend, that the beſt and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſcholars from Dr. MAYHEW, to the preſent time, were generally ignominiouſly puniſhed for no other crime than that of volatility. I added that if any incorrigible dunce wiſhed to hide his length of ear, by a ſquare hat academical, if dray horſes ſought a ſhelter, or the King of Spain's fourfooted and <hi>braying</hi> ſubjects a dormitory, I could eaſily mark the place.

               <head>"YET DID NOT THE CHIEF BUTLER REMEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER JOSEPH BUT FORGAT HIM."</head>
               <p>A MOST unlucky inſtance of ſhortneſs of memory, and a ſtrange one too, for Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph had expreſsly ſtipulated with the impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned butler, that he ſhould recollect the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able interpreter of his dream, and obtain from PHARAOH an order for his enlargement.</p>
               <p>Forgat him! Is it poſſible? Did the chief butler, as he filled the cup to PHARAOH, taſte the wine ſo often, that it made him ſtupid or mad? Was the vine Juice of Egypt, ever mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with poppy water, that it might, like the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled river of oblivion, drown Memory and her tribes? As I know of no ancient record, that alludes to this practice, and in the biography with which MOSES has indulged us, of the chief butler, not a ſyllable is ſaid, concerning his debauchery, I believe that the ſuppoſition that he was a toper, muſt be waved. We muſt look a little deeper than the bottom of a glaſs, or even a bottle, to diſcover the ſource of a courtier's ingratitude.</p>
               <p>Let us look, therefore, once more into the book of Geneſis, and I truſt, that ſo lucid an Hiſtorian as MOSES, will ſhed light upon this ſombre ſubject.</p>
               <p>It appears that JOSEPH, ſuſpected of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the <hi>virtue</hi> of POTIPHAR's wife, was, by the inſtigation of that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030335_0129_0FE5C418B0F6DDC8"/>
committed to priſon. According to the ſacred text, this was a <hi>State</hi> priſon, a kind of Egyptian <hi>Baſtile,</hi> where, as we read, "<hi>The King's priſoners were bound,</hi>" where meaner fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were excluded, and none were admitted, but ſuch courtiers and retainers to the palace, as had, by their careleſſneſs or their crimes, forfeited the royal favor. It is no great wonder then that a couple of tradeſmen, who had ſuch frequent temptations to cheat, as a butler and a baker, ſhould be put in ward. Light bread and ſour wine had been vended in the palace, and the abuſed palate of PHARAOH was offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. JOSEPH, who had ingratiated himſelf with the chief goaler, was appointed a ſort of deputy, or turnkey of the priſon, and had the charge of theſe very delinquents.</p>
               <p>One morning, "<hi>Behold they were ſad</hi>;" and, when interrogated, concerning the cauſe of their gloom, they informed JOSEPH that they had dreamed, and there was no interpreter. The chief butler then related, that he had ſeen in a viſion a cluſtered vine, of triple branches, whoſe grapes he preſſed into the cup, and gave into the hand of PHARAOH. JOSEPH, after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting the priſoner by familiarly explaining his dream, and promiſing him reſtoration to his poſt in the houſehold, pathetically beſeeches him that he would in his proſperity reflect on his unjuſtly accuſed friend, and mention him to his prince. "Think on me," ſays the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſimple original, "when it ſhall be well
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030335_0130_0FE5C41D821EB980"/>
with thee, and ſhew kindneſs I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me to PHARAOH, and bring me out of this houſe." This was ſurely an eaſy ſervice; and on the third day, when PHARAOH feaſted his ſervants, when, amid the jollity of an entertainment, the releaſed butler ſtood at the elbow of his appeaſed ſovereign, what a favorable moment to ſuggeſt the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of looſing poor JOSEPH, who had been ſo unjuſtly bound. But mark an obſequious, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, cou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tly ſlave. Intent alone upon his own proſperity, he is ſo buſy in filling the ruddy cup for his king and for <hi>himſelf,</hi> that not a thought of him intrudes, who has nothing to drink, but his own tears and the waters of affliction. A ſelfiſh and ungrateful man, though he ſhould outlive the oldeſt of the patriarchs, and allay the thirſt of a lineage of Egyptian monarchs, would not once think of his benefactor, nor call to mind that <hi>viſionary</hi> vine, which he had ſeen in adverſity. No; a chief butler would have much more lucrative employment than think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the "<hi>Sorrowful ſighing of a priſoner.</hi>" A chief butler did not remember JOSEPH, but forgat him.</p>
               <p>Are there not a thouſand <hi>worldly</hi> reaſons for this forgetfulneſs? <hi>Prudence</hi> might whiſper to the butler as he walked through the priſon gate, not to liſp the name of JOSEPH, for poſſibly it might anger PHARAOH, and then his favor would be withdrawn, and <hi>the butlerſhip!</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides we ſhould remember, that this dreamer in

priſon, was a very courtier in the palace. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough of his own, and "dealing out his <hi>promiſes</hi> as liberally as his liquor." When JO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEPH had unravelled his entangled dreams, and foretold that he ſhould again have the keys of PHARAOH's beaufet and cellar, I dare affirm that the butler with cringing complaiſance, with low bows and perpetual ſmile, engaged upon his <hi>honor</hi> not merely to remember, but to renume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his deliveer. This was the promiſe of a courtier —And who is ignorant that his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like "your humble ſervant," at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a challenge, mean, if they have any meaning, nothing but death and deſtruction?— Many are the promiſes of the <hi>chief butlers,</hi> the CHESTERFIELDS, the ſmooth tongued men of the world. They <hi>keep</hi> them too. But ſo <hi>cloſe,</hi> that, when the day of performance arrives, not even their owner can find them—miſlaid in ſome obſcure corner of memory's cheſt!</p>
