            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SOLOMON wiſely decided the comparative merit of characters. Viewing through an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial medium their motives, plans of conduct, and reſpective influence on the public manners and happineſs, "he weighed them in an even bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance," and ſuffered intrinſic excellence only to preponderate.</p>
            <p>The contraſts, exhibited in the text, bring to view a reſpectable proportion of every community. Either impetuoſity or moderation, raſhneſs or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, puſillanimity or fortitude, contentracnt or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, generoſity or avarice are leading features in the character of the principal members. Theſe virtues or vices, according to their natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034648_0004_0FFF45F092FA94E0"/>
lead to the elevation or debaſement of perſonal virtue, and to the promotion or deſtruction of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honor and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Men, who luſt after power, and are ambitious of extenſive dominion, are juſtly characteriſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in reflection, haſty in reſentment, precipitate in deciſion, and inſtead of acting on the broad ſcale of virtue or of public utility, ſolely aim after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal aggrandizement. Blindly purſuing their mad ſchemes, they forget, that an equitable exerciſe of power is the offspring of a well regulated heart, and that to check the turbulency of paſſion, is the beſt aſſiſtant in effecting honorable conqueſts. Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to conſiſtency, deaf to the voice of conſcience, and enemies to reaſon, they impetuouſly preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the accompliſhment of a favorite object, and rely for the pureſt felicity on the ſubjugation of millions to their deſpotic ſway.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a perfect control and delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate indulgence of paſſion lead to juſtneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thought, coolneſs of deciſion, and a proper eſtimate of the views, purpoſes and provocations of individuals and of communities. The man, who is ſlow to anger, ſuffers no ill founded preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, ſuperſicial examination, haſty opinion or wild reſolution to direct his conduct. But relying on the deliberate concluſions of unbiaſſed reaſon, his chief employment is the diſcovery of what is right and fit, and the public benefit is the grand object of his purſuit. Theſe attainments are evidently the reſult of laudable proficiency in ſelf-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When oppoſed to the petulant, to unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034648_0005_0FFF45F216B38DD0"/>
ſeekers after power, or to ſuch as are deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of laying a foundation for univerſal empire, this deſcription of characters is entitled to high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. In their practice is implied a reſpect for the dictates of reaſon and the precepts of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, a commendable ſolicitude for the harmony and happineſs of ſociety, and an active purpoſe to extend the knowledge and to promote the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the divine government.</p>
            <p>The obſervations already made, exhibit the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the characters of thoſe members of ſociety, who give unbounded licenſe to paſſion, and of ſuch as reſtrain it within reaſonable limits. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play more explicitly the properties of perſonal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, as oppoſed to an inſatiable thirſt for power or extenſive conqueſt; to deduce a preference in favor of the former, from the good effects it tends to produce; to confirm our remarks by hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical examples; and to offer ſome reflections ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the ſituation and proſpects of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, form the deſign of the enſuing part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>The general characteriſtic of perſonal diſcipline is the honorable ſupremacy it preſerves over paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the ſubſerviency it extorts from it, to the elevated deſires, purpoſes and purſuits of reaſon.</p>
            <p>No conflict is ever more dangerous, violent or eventful, than this, maintained between theſe two eſſential and important parts of every human character. It is dangerous, becauſe reaſon is likely to be wounded and overcome in the conteſt. It is violent, becauſe the "caſting of fire-brands, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034648_0006_0FFF45F3E31961D0"/>
and death" is the natural product of exceſſive paſſion. It is eventful, becauſe there is no empire ſo deſpotic, no tyranny ſo oppreſſive, no victory ſo haughty and inſolent, as that which is ſupported or gained by paſſion. A riſing ſuperior to this danger, a ſucceſsful oppoſition to this violence, and an entire defeat of the hope of obtaining a victory can only be effected by the man who habitually "ruleth his own ſpirit."</p>
            <p>A criminal error in the ambitious, in men aſpiring after power, whoſe wiſhes are ſcarcely limited by the univerſe, and who cheriſh the intention to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and oppreſs it's inhabitants, is that they neither eſtimate the deſign, dignity, nor capacity of reaſon. Hurried blindfold by luſt, pride or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, perſonal elevation is the motive, riches or grandeur the object, and deathleſs fame the antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated reward of their unabating enterpriſe. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander and Julius Caeſar are ſtriking examples of the deſpotic influence of paſſion. Ignorant of ſelf-command, and fearful of attacking ſo rough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried and formidable a fortreſs as their own hearts, they wandered abroad in purſuit of ſomething, which could equal their ambitious views. Wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the illuſions of fancy, theſe inſolent and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing demagogues vainly hoped, that idiots, with reſpect to the firſt principles of government, might honorably aſpire after, and ſuſtain univerſal em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Theſe are two of numberleſs inſtances of the frenzy and diſtraction, occaſioned by checking the exerciſe, and reſiſting the authority of reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:034648_0007_0FFF45F585F6C390"/>Another diſtinguiſhing property of perſonal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is fortitude, which enables the mind to bear inſolent treatment, originates juſt conceptions of it's nature, and dictates the exerciſe of patience in deviſing means of redreſs.</p>
            <p>To oppoſe inſolence with forbearance is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant chriſtian attainment. This is the genuine fruit of fortitude, which is a chief promoter of the dignity and uſefulneſs of man.</p>
            <p>Rightly to comprehend an injury, to conceive of it's tendency, and to judge of the intended extent of it, are exceedingly neceſſary, to proportion wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our reſentment to it's deſerts. Precipitancy, jealouſy or petulance entirely prevent theſe acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They delude the fancy, contract the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, warp the judgment, and ſear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Certainly then, a perfect ſelf-command will totally exclude theſe vices, as enemies to liberal inveſtigation and oppoſers of truth.</p>
            <p>Fortitude is the deſirable and happy medium between inſenſibility and raſhneſs. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with a keen ſenſe of injuries, neither is it ſuperior to reſentment. It wiſely diſcrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inates between a haſty and inconſiderate ſally of paſſion, and a deliberate provocation.</p>
            <p>Equally diſtant is this virtue from cowardice as from inſenſibility. Although it is not haſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an injury, it is prepared to repel it. Although it admits every honorable expedient to redreſs a grievance, to be preferable to ſudden and open hoſtility, yet ſaith it's brave and pious patron,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034648_0008_0FFF45FB36098EA0"/>
"Though an hoſt ſhould encamp againſt me, yet will I not fear."</p>
            <p>Diametrically oppoſed to the condeſcending qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of this amiable and chriſtian virtue, are the impetuoſity, violence and pride of perſons, whoſe ambition is ſolely directed to the taking of cities. In an oppoſite ſcale with the prudence, forbearance, patient inquiry, firmneſs and magnanimity of ſuch as cultivate the former, may be placed the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſs, temerity, avarice and inſolence of thoſe who cheriſh the latter, and this will lead to an impartial opinion of this part of their reſpective characters.</p>
            <p>As ſelf-government begets a nobleneſs and elevation of ſoul, to eſtimate and endure inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it alſo originates a boldneſs of ſentiment, an animated, rational and inextinguiſhable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
            <p>Temperance and perſeverance in the moment of ſevere trial are prominent features in the heroiſm of a truly valiant man. Neither appalled by the approach of danger, nor alarmed by it's probable conſequences, his manly firmneſs and intrepidity ſerve for a ſhield, which the impetuous ardor of a hoſtile foe can never penetrate.</p>
            <p>True courage is diſtinguiſhed from it's counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit by a conſtant preparedneſs for the ſevereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, by a noble contempt of life and it's moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comforts, when the intereſts of liberty, virtue or religion are at hazard. Every partial or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted conſideration is ſacrificed to the advancement of the public good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:034648_0009_0FFF45FDD4DB3FA8"/>A man of courage exhauſts not his ardor on tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, ludicrous, or unimportant occaſions, but wiſely apportions it to the value of the object, and the urgency of the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>This virtue is eſpecially diſtinguiſhed from the licentious fury of an avaricious purſuer of power or conqueſt, as it is reſtrained by reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives additional and well-directed fervor from exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Having taken this view of ſome of the diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating properties of perſonal diſcipline, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template it's moſt important effects, and aſcertain their preference to the diſgraceful conſequences of an ungoverned luſt of empire.</p>
            <p>Undiſturbed reflections, equanimity and ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comfort are the ſtreams, inceſſantly flowing from this pure ſource, to refreſh the individual.</p>
            <p>Entertaining only moderate views and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expectations, having enlightened reaſon for his unerring and ſure guide, he is not precipitated into the tranſports of paſſion, which occaſion a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from a ſteady courſe of virtuous practice. Always having command of his underſtanding and reflection, he is not fickle in his inclinations, nor unſtable in his purpoſes. Being ſettled, reſolute and conſcientious, his mind is undiſturbed, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience calm, and all his reflections cheerful.</p>
            <p>This perfect ſelf-command is alſo a very happy mean of promoting the true dignity of man. It preſerves in their proper ſubordination the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior qualities of his nature. It gives full ſcope to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034648_0010_0FFF45FF69DBED58"/>
the active energies of the mind. It completes the ſocial, moral and religious character.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, an ambition for power or conqueſt is always reſtleſs. Originating in ſelfiſh and avaricious views, exerciſing the corrupt and perverſe diſpoſitions of the heart, and having for it's object the eſtabliſhment of univerſal deſpotiſm, it tends to enervate the mind, to produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fermention in the heart, and laſtingly to check the exerciſe of every ſocial and pure ſentiment.</p>
            <p>The efficacy of ſelf-government when exerciſed by the members of a community, is alſo particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noticeable, as it's tendency is, to promote and preſerve harmony and order.</p>
            <p>As perſonal comfort is the fruit of a peaceful and undiſturbed mind, ſo the welfare and happineſs of a nation muſt depend on a freedom from the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of unbridled paſſion. A reſtleſs and peeviſh, an irritable and turbulent temper is a principal cauſe of the uneaſineſſes and contentions, the tumults and commotions, which have defaced the beauty, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the order of the moral kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Private grudges and public conteſts, in connexion with the long train of calamities, reſulting from war, may be traced to this impure and corrupt ſource.</p>
            <p>Individuals and nations, who have luſted after conqueſts, have miſtaken their tendency, and the effects, they have generally produced.

extenſively diſtributed, are beyond the reach of being ſuddenly called into action, or of aſſiſting to ward off any unexpected or unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen diſaſter. The Romans therefore, are the only ancient nation, who have grown rich by their conqueſts, and this becauſe they exacted very little in the form of tribute.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtly's Lectures on Hiſtory.</note>

            <p>This diſpoſition, which has often proved ruinous, and laid a foundation for national degradation and diſgrace, it was an expreſs purpoſe of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpenſation to prohibit. They were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to undertake any wars through caprice, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or a diſpoſition for conqueſt, and as a check to the unneceſſary waſte and havock, which are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the practice of other nations, were aſked this ſimple queſtion; Are the trees enemies, which can fight againſt you, ſo that you muſt cut them down?<note n="†" place="bottom">Jews' Letters in anſwer to Voltaire.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The diſpoſition, example and inſtructions of our Divine Maſter and his immediate followers tend to undermine this corrupt principle. The number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs precepts, to guard againſt oſtentation, envy, pride, and to "take heed, and beware of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs," are ſo many moral lectures on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of perſonal diſcipline, and are intended to prevent the growth of a tyrannical and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering temper.</p>
            <p>Hitherto in this country little encouragement has been found for the indulgence of an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſire of power, or a ſpirit of conqueſt. The
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034648_0012_0FFF4604A4B7C7C0"/>
early education and habits of it's inhabitants, the laws, the government, and eſpecially the chriſtian religion are peculiarly favorable to the extinction of an ambitious and diſſocial ſpirit, and give all poſſible patronage to the mild, peaceful and unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring qualities of the heart.</p>
            <p>It ſhould neither be charged to oſtentation nor ambition, if, from the hiſtory of the preſent age, we adduce examples for an unequivocal illuſtration of the ſentiment, we are endeavoring to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>To avail ourſelves of a decided proof, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal diſcipline is preferable to a luſt of empire, we need only contraſt the meek, contented, firm, courageous, unambitious and unaſſuming diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a WASHINGTON, with the proud, oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatious, luſtful, and aſpiring temper of a Buona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte.</p>
            <p>We may alſo ſucceſsfully oppoſe the unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled patience and perſeverance, magnanimity and well regulated independence of an ADAMS, to the headſtrong luſts and paſſions, or even to the moſt reſpectable attainments of all the proud plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and conquerors of the world.</p>
            <p>Still more forcibly to demonſtrate the idea, we may purſue the analogy between the moderation, forbearance, juſtice and unvaried inflexibility of the SUPREME EXECUTIVE of our Nation, and the precipitancy, inconſtancy, violence and outrage, which have prevailingly dictated the meaſures of the Directory of France.</p>
            <p>The event of the preſent conteſt for dominion in the elder world, it is impoſſible certainly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.

It ſeems however, that no limits are fixed to their deſires, nor any bounds ſet to their efforts. If an opinion may be formed from the paſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of providence, it appears, that a nation, which preſumes to wage war with the univerſe, and in effect to aſſume the prerogatives of its SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME FORMER and GOVERNOR, muſt be humbled.</p>
            <p>After their wanton avowal of being in queſt of univerſal empire, and of it's being their fixed pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to fraternize and ſubjugate this weſtern world, the ſons of freedom muſt be ſeized with more than lethargic ſtupidity, not to be arouſed. When reminded of the political annihilation of Venice <note n="*" place="bottom">See the diſpatches from our Envoys Extraordinary in France, to the Executive of the United States.</note> as an example of their future debaſement, and when the inſolent and perfidious treatment of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holland and Switzerland <note n="†" place="bottom">A judicious, impartial and intereſting detail of the conduct of France towards theſe nations, is contained in the "Obſervations on the Diſpute between The United States and France, addreſſed by Robert Goodloe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of South Carolina, to his conſtituents." Every candid peruſer will be ſatisfied, that ſuch inſtances of wantonneſs and inſincerity ſhould inſpire the inhabitants of theſe States with caution and firmneſs.</note> are candidly conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, the native energy of independent Americans will no longer ſleep. The love of rational liberty, for which they are deſervedly characterized, and a juſt appreciation of the earnings of honeſt and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious induſtry, will command an obedient atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the calls of their country, and a willingneſs to make every reaſonable ſacrifice for it's perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſecurity.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:034648_0014_0FFF4608DA9DD7C0"/>In a ſeaſon of common danger, the benefit of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations, formed to extend a knowledge of the military art, is readily perceived. There is then in reſerve a competency of the ſkill, dexterity, firmneſs and heroiſm, which are indiſpenſably requiſite to the ſucceſsful defence of an invaded country. A hopeful proſpect then preſents, of finding experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced veterans, who reſolutely reſiſt the firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of paſſion, and who are impelled to action by a nobler motive than a love of conqueſt. In ſuch ſchools, a knowledge of tactics is acquired, a ſpirit of enterpriſe encouraged, and patterns of patience and intrepidity uniformly diſplayed.</p>
            <p>The exemplary attention, which has been paid to the diffuſion of military ſkill, reflects honor on our rulers, as it is a demonſtration of their una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating vigilance, and is a conſoling circumſtance at the preſent intereſting period. It inſpires a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine belief, that "if imperious neceſſity urge," we ſhall not be found encumbered by a ſtupid lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, neither hurried to action by an impetuous zeal. But perſuaded, that our reſentment is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the cool diſcuſſions of reaſon, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the fortitude, which is the beſt and moſt impregnable armor, the anticipated hour of danger will be realized by us, to be a ſeaſon of perfect ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Neither Lacedaemonian folly or ſuperſtition ſhall ever regulate the vibrations of the hearts of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans. Being ſatisfied that the meaſure of aggreſſion and inſolence is filled up, whether the moon ſhall

            <p>While the general attention of our citizens to the making of laudable acquirements deſerves highly to be applauded, it is with particular pleaſure, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, that we recogniſe the purpoſe of your inſtitution, witneſs it's preſent flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſſure you of our firm reliance on your experience, fortitude and courage.</p>
            <p>Educated in the belief, that temporary amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pleaſure is but a ſecondary conſideration in the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a ſeminary, you will conſider it's primary purpoſe to be a ſchool, in which you may imbibe the principles, cheriſh the views, and form the habits, which are calculated to render you eminently ſerviceable to your country.</p>
            <p>The diſtinguiſhing traits of a good ſoldier are ſkill in his profeſſion, a perfect control over his paſſions, calmneſs in the hour of trial, and an enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriotiſm. Regulated by theſe, you will never-ſuffer your regard to the public intereſts, to vent it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a furious or overheated zeal, neither when difficulty approaches, will you want the courage, reſolutely to embrace every neceſſary mean for the defence of your dear-bought privileges. As a love of power or conqueſt is a debaſing paſſion, when cheriſhed as any other than a ſubordinate motive, you will evidence it to be your prevailing princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034648_0016_0FFF461015AE8D68"/>
to contend rather for ſafety than triumph, for the common good than perſonal glory.</p>
            <p>To the friends of America it is an exhilarating circumſtance, that in your number is perceived ſome of the temperate, yet inflexible, reſolute and active ſupporters of the late glorious revolution. An equally generous principle with that, which then glowed in your boſom, we doubt not, if cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances require, will again ſtimulate you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. On you we rely for an example of prudence to our youth, of reſtraint, to check their natural impetuoſity, and of wiſdom, to direct their ardor into it's proper channel. May the efficacy of your exertions be perceived, the reſpectability of your inſtitution increaſe, and numbers in future be found, worthy of being added to your fair cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Patriots.</p>
            <p>My Fellow Countrymen will permit me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate them on the mixed moderation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, coolneſs and deciſion, wiſdom and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, which dignify the tranſactions of our government. Theſe truly form a ſplendid exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the glorious triumphs of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Every honeſt member of the community will feel indiſpenſably obliged, to cultivate the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific and condeſcending temper. Such are the preſent limits of our country, that extent of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory can be no motive with us, to endeavor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our power, or to enlarge our conqueſts. Our affluence and proſperity have ſo rapidly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that it would be madneſs to apply to this
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034648_0017_0FFF461199692080"/>
ſource for a valuable addition. Unleſs therefore the dignity of our government, or our rights as an independent nation are implicitly or openly diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will be honorable in us, to "ſtudy the things, which make for peace," and to be anxious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain "no other conqueſts, but thoſe of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and no other triumphs, but thoſe of juſtice and humanity."</p>
            <p>For the acquiring of this diſpoſition we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the adventurer in the chriſtian war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is required, to be "temperate in all things." The licentiouſneſs of ungoverned paſſions, and the viſionary projects of inſatiable ambition do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the requiſitions of the goſpel, or the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of it's Divine Author. When pointed to "the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them," which are happily ſuited to nouriſh the vanity of a corrupt heart, ſo perfect was his ſelf-command, that he viewed them as a gilded trifle, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity they promiſed, empty and deluſive.</p>
            <p>In attempting to copy this perfect pattern of ſubjection to the diſcipline of reaſon, it will be laudable in us, to aim after a humble but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible reſemblance. The ſeaſon of combat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our appetites and paſſions, and of endeavoring to ſubject them to the ſuggeſtions of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the laws of the goſpel, will be but ſhort. "Eternity will be long enough to repay us." There will then be a full diſplay of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of reaſon.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:034648_0018_0FFF4613641A1890"/>The fading glories of this world will ſoon loſe their attraction. Uncorrupting palms of victory are promiſed to the perſeveringly patient, reſolute and intrepid. The faithful ſubjects of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and empires are then to be admitted into "a kingdom, which cannot be moved;" where the SUPREME LORD of the univerſe maintains an equitable and impartial dominion, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall come off conquerors, and "more than conquerors" over the enemies of their ſpiritual comfort, "through Him, who hath loved, and who hath given himſelf for us."</p>
