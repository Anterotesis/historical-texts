            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IT is well for us that our ſovereign Father has founded Zion, and laid an elect, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, precious, ſure, and everlaſting, foundation there; and has brought, and daily brings, the poor (the ſpiritually poor) of his people, with reſignation and ſubmiſſion to his ſovereign will, to truſt in it: while thoſe who wage impious war with God's diſcriminating grace, and rebel and kick at the immoveable foundation that he has laid, are led by ſatan into an empty profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in order to ſpy out our liberty, and bring us, if poſſible, into bondage. Theſe compaſs Zion's walls, count her towers, obſerve her pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aces, and mark her bulwarks, only in order to attack her invincible fortreſſes with the feeble force of carnal logic: and, after all the aſſaults that have been made, not one ſtrong hold is brought to ruin, nor ever will be; for <hi>God is in the midſt of her, ſhe ſhall not be moved.</hi> Pſ. xlvi. 5. <hi>The Higheſt himſelf ſhall eſtabliſh her.</hi> Pſ. lxxxvii. 5. Hence it is that not one of her cords have ever been looſed yet, nor ſhall one ſtake ever be moved. To the ſovereignty of this glorious founder, and this elect foundation, the legal workmonger, the wiſe above what is
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030610_0003_0FE8307DCAEA4BD8"/>written, the lofty with his terrible looks, the conſequential child of the fleſh, the ſelf-depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and ſelf-ſufficient Arminian, cannot ſubmit, and therefore are driven to the utmoſt extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. They have hung on the conditional pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the old covenant, and on their own perverſions of the holy ſcriptures, till they have been beaten out of all theſe refuges by the force of ſound argument; and ſome of them have been driven out of the curious web of <hi>fleſhly perfection,</hi> and obliged to eſcape, both wounded and naked, by the devil himſelf, who has led them by ſin into public contempt and ſcandal. They are driven out of ſelf-righteouſneſs alſo by the curſe of the law and the flaſhes of revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wrath, and they begin now to be driven out of all confidence in the fleſh by the mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rebukes, ſolemn appeals, and laſhes, of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conſcience; ſo that they are driven to their wit's end, and begin to relinquiſh all pretenſions to any union with the aſſemblies of mount Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The caſe of theſe hypocrites is more deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate than that of the phariſee, who reſts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the law; more perilous than that of the fool, who truſts in his own heart; worſe than the palace of the ſtrong man armed, which is kept in peace; more terrible than that of the dog, for whom there is hope while joined to all the living; more dangerous than that of Joab at the horns of the altar; and more deplorable than that of thoſe who pray to the rocks and mountains; for theſe tacitly own, even in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic print, that they have no hope <hi>but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the dead,</hi> nor any gueſts <hi>but in the depths of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:030610_0004_0FE8308508197898"/>
I ſay they tacitly acknowledge this, for it is <hi>out of the abundance of the heart</hi> (Chriſt tells us) <hi>that the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Now if Mr. Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's faith and hope do not center in this reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from hell, he preaches what he does not believe; which is acting the part of the worſt of hypocrites; and, if he does believe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be damned himſelf as well as his confed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates, he then fulfils the ſcripture, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that himſelf and his followers <hi>ſhall both fall into the ditch;</hi> and this eſtabliſhes his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>a blind guide.</hi> And certain it is that they muſt be much in the dark, and far enough from <hi>perfect day,</hi> or they would never grope for an anchorage in a bottomleſs pit, or for hope of light in utter darkneſs. But ſo it is; they are come at laſt to <hi>the land of forgetfulneſs,</hi> and to <hi>the generation that ſhall never ſee light;</hi> they are come to <hi>the Gog and Magog army,</hi> to <hi>death the king of terrors,</hi> to <hi>an innumerable company of devils,</hi> to <hi>Lucifer ſon of the morning,</hi> and to <hi>ſatan the king of all theſe.</hi> This is dealing with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſpirits indeed; this is peeping and mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering with a witneſs. But <hi>ſhould not a people ſeek unto their God?</hi> Should they ſeek (inſtead of the living) unto the dead? Iſa. viii. 19; a community without God, without Chriſt, and without one friend in heaven: and theſe are to bribe juſtice by ſuffering in hell fire! But <hi>the congregation of hypocrites ſhall be deſolate, and fire ſhall conſume the tabernacles of bribery.</hi> Job xv. 34. And deſolate they muſt be, or they never would ſcrape acquaintance, claim kindred, or cultivate friendſhip and fellowſhip, with ſuch a company as this. <hi>O, my ſoul, come not thou into their ſecret! unto their aſſembly, mine hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030610_0005_0FE830868EA4B7E0"/>be not thou united!</hi> Gen. xlix. 6. <hi>I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils; ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils; ye canot be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils.</hi> 1 Cor. x. 20, 21. We may now ſound the trumpet, and cry, <hi>To your tents, O Iſrael!</hi> for <hi>the ſword of the Lord and of Gideon,</hi> truth and conſcience, have driven theſe Hebrews into their holes.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Wincheſter writes another <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> he ſhall not need to dreſs up an automa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton figure to cuff about in his book, for he ſhall not want an antagoniſt as long as God ſpares my life and the uſe of my limbs; for I know that there is not one text in the Bible that holds forth, or promiſes, directly or indirectly, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from hell torments, either for men or devils; if there be, let him produce it. He has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one yet. But he calls for "the ſpirit of Moſes and of Chriſt, of meekneſs and love, to canvaſs the ſubject." The meekneſs and love of Moſes were of God; they were graces from him, which Mr. Wincheſter never had, nor can he deſcribe either. The meekneſs of Moſes was exerciſed in the cauſe of truth, not falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and towards the children of Iſrael, not towards the Amalekites, nor devils. Moſes is a ſworn enemy to ſatan and all his friends.—<hi>And they ſhall no more offer their ſacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring: this shall be a ſtatute for ever to them throughout their generations.</hi> Levit. xvii. 7. If the going out of the affections after ſatan in idols be term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>whoring,</hi> and is forbidden by an eternal ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute, what ſhall we ſay of Mr. Wincheſter, who
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:030610_0006_0FE8308B206219A0"/>has entered into a ſolemn league and covenant with them, and has bound himſelf up in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity with devils? Nor does the love of God, as deſcribed by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, extend itſelf to all <hi>intelligences,</hi> like that of Mr. Wincheſter; not to devils, nor yet to the wicked who are dead, nor to all mankind liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Yea, he loved the people; all his ſaints are in thy hand, and they ſat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.</hi> Deut. xxxiii. 3. This is God's eternal love of choice, of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and delight. This is entailed on his ſaints, ſanctified and ſet apart in his eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe are in his hand, preſerved in Chriſt and called, and out of whoſe hands none can pluck them. Theſe are not wiſe above what is written, nor proud, doating about queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when they know nothing; but are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſubmit to divine revelation, and to ſit at the Lord's feet to learn.—They do not fly to Plato, Pythagoras, Socrates, Virgil, and the ſon of perdition, to know the things of eternity.—Every one of theſe ſit at the Saviour's feet, and receive his words. This is the everlaſting love of God to his ſaints, as deſcribed by Moſes; this is all free, and of grace. But the love of God to his other creatures is only ſeen in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence. <hi>God loveth the ſtranger in giving him food and raiment,</hi> (Deut. x. 18) and no further. What right has Mr. Wincheſter to call for the meekneſs and love of Moſes, who is a ſtranger to the love of grace, is in the bed of loves with devils, and who ſtretches the love of God to a reſtoration of all fallen intelligences, when God himſelf has revealed or extended it no further to ſtrangers than giving them food and raiment?
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:030610_0007_0FE8308E694984E0"/>And what right has he to expect or call for the love and meekneſs of Chriſt? Did Chriſt in his day exerciſe meekneſs to ſuch enemies to him as Mr. Wincheſter? Did he doat or fawn over the blind guides, the painted ſepulchres, the graves that appeared not, and the ſcullions who made clean the outſide of the cup and platter? Did he call them Philanthropiſts, men of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, friends to mankind, men of love, of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did judgments, and liberal ſentiments? Did he not call them wolves, devourers of widows' houſes, thieves, and robbers; children of hell, vipers, ſerpents, adulterers; and palm both them and their works upon the devil himſelf, and promiſe them the greater damnation? And did he ſhow, or exerciſe, or entail, any love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe? Did he not tell them that he came into the world for judgment to them, that they that ſaw might be made blind? And he will come for judgment to them the ſecond time, when he will require from that generation all the righteous blood ſhed from the blood of Abel.</p>
            <p>Reader, I have not in this work gone through what he has written upon this ſubject, in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing and ſifting his perverſions and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſophiſtry. This, I find is already done by a Mr. MASON, whoſe book, I believe, is juſt out. It is eaſy for a man to ſit down and quote from ſcripture a thouſand texts, and ſay all theſe favour a notion; but it is another thing to bring one plain text, which, in its lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, grammatical, and received ſenſe, proves it. Mr. Wincheſter has adopted the former method, in order to deter men from anſwering him. For to reinſtate ſuch a multitude of
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:030610_0008_0FE83094B87CEC18"/>texts in their own proper light, and to refute all his carnal arguments drawn from them, would fill a quarto volume, to anſwer a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny ſquib. Mr. Wincheſter was aware of this; and he may thank Satan for his council. What he has aimed to prove is, <hi>the univerſal reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of devils, and all ſinners, from hell to heaven;</hi> and my aim is, <hi>to prove him a liar, and his ſpeech nothing worth.</hi> Job xxiv. 25.—And upon ſcripture ground I am w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ling to meet him; and, by the help of God, to diſpute the point as long as he pleaſes; for God does not allow him one text in the Bible to ſupport his doctrine. He may chooſe which text he pleaſes; I have no doubt but the Lord will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me, or ſome other of his ſervants, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover every text that has fallen among theſe thieves.</p>
            <p>Reader, beware, leſt, being led away by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the wicked, you fall from your own ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs. This awful doctrine is calculated to bolſter up the awakened ſinner, to embolden the hypocrite, and to encourage the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by promiſing life and glory to thoſe who work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs. The Lord deliver us from this, and every other, path of the deſtroyer, for the ſake of his dear Son. Amen and amen.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Treat of a <hi>good Hope.</hi> The word <hi>Hope</hi> is in common uſe among moſt men, and is often uſed in connection with ſalvation: "As I hope to be ſaved" is a common expreſſion, and is often uſed to confirm a word, or clear a perſon ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of falſehood; and generally uſed by thoſe who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſalvation, and deſtitute of all hope in it. There is a <hi>hope,</hi> ſo called, that is from ſelf, not from God: as that of a phariſee, which ſprings from a falſe ſuppoſition of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more holy than other men; which hope is encouraged by an obſervation of the conduct of the moſt openly profane, and comparing himſelf with them, and looking at his own duties through the falſe mirror of the other's exceſs of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot; but then this hope anchors in ſelf, not within the vail; it is founded on legal duties or dead works, not on Chriſt's merit; it centers in a killing commandment, not in a life-giving promiſe; it riſes from deception in the heart, not from a work of grace; it is the hope of the ſelf-righteous,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030610_0010_0FE8309C96CF7658"/>not of the juſtified ſoul; it is the hope of the hypocrite, not of the ſaint, and therefore it muſt periſh with the ſinner. <hi>The hope of unjuſt men periſheth, you the hypocrite's hope ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt, who beſt knows the ſtate of all mankind, has declared that men in a ſtate of nature are <hi>without God, and having no hope in the world.</hi> And every ſinner who is taught of God will ſet to his ſeal that this is true; for, when the killing commandment enters and awakens the ſinner's benumbed conſcience, when revealed wrath and accumulated guilt meet together in the ſinner's ſoul, <hi>his falſe hope</hi> is like <hi>a ſpider's w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> goes into the horrible pit and into the miry clay, into all real and imaginary torment; and down he would go into deſpendency, deſpair, diſtraction, and perdition too, unleſs upheld by almighty power: for the entrance of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wrath makes terrible work with a falſe hope. All reſting in legal performances, all falſe props, and expectations of heaven on the footing of human merit, founded on ſelf-confidence, die, and ſhall never live again. And ſuch is the end of the wicked in death. <hi>But the eyes of the wicked ſhall fail, and they ſhall not eſcape; and their hope ſhall be as the giving up of the ghoſt.</hi> Job ii. 20.</p>
            <p>A ſinner in this ſtate finds himſelf without hope, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help; and it is not in his power either to hope in, or expect any thing from God, without divine aſſiſtance. <hi>Hope</hi> is one of the ſpiritual bleſſings given us in Chriſt Jeſus; it is a free grace gift, and comes to us by the Spirit of promiſe, and is wrought in us. It is a rich grant of a gracious God, which leads the ſoul to Chriſt Jeſus, from whoſe fullneſs it comes, and in whom as in its proper object, it centers. It is an anchor within the vail; and, as it is a free grace gift, and has an Almighty Saviour for its object, it is called, in oppoſition to all falſe hopes, and to all hopes founded in ſelf and ſelf-righteouſneſs, <hi>a good hope through grace.</hi> 2 Theſ. ii. 16.</p>
            <p>Sinners, who are convinced of their ſins by the Spirit, know, by experience, that a hope in God is not the produce of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nor can the awakened ſinner either obtain it by his own power, or even exerciſe the leaſt hope in God until the Spirit enables him. It is not with him, whether he <hi>will</hi> hope and truſt in the Lord, but the great queſtion is, whether he <hi>may.</hi> He can ſee no foundation to hope on till God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers

            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> is not employed about things is us, but about things <hi>before</hi> us; not about things <hi>preſent,</hi> but things <hi>future;</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what we <hi>have,</hi> but what we <hi>want.</hi> For, if I am in full poſſeſſion of a thing, there is no room for hope or expectation about it; for how can I hope for what I have got? or expect what is already my own? The ſelf-loſt and ſelf-deſpairing ſinner, that is favored with the leaſt degree of hope, hopes for the manifeſtation of Chriſt to his ſoul; but, when Chriſt is revealed to him, then he is the hope of glory in him. The guilty ſinner hopes for pardon, or the knowledge of ſalvation by the forgiveneſs of ſins, through Chriſt; and, if God gives him an expectation of it, he ſhall ſurely have it, even though he ſees it not accompliſhed. <hi>For we are ſaved by hope; but hope that is ſeen is not hope; for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi> Rom. viii. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> is a grace beſtowed upon a helpleſs, ſelf-deſpairing, miſerable ſinner; and performs wonders in deſperate caſes. On which account it is called a <hi>helmet,</hi> which is an iron cap to ſcreen the head in the day of battle; and an <hi>anchor,</hi> which is the mariner's chief dependance in a ſtorm, and when in want of ſea room. Hope, therefore, is employed about things hard and difficult, and yet poſſible. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, God ſorely threatened the children of Iſrael, who had married heathen wives. The children of God had married the daughters of Satan. <hi>Judah hath dealt treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and an abomination is committed in Iſrael, and in Jeruſalem; for Judah hath profaned the holineſs of the Lord, which he ought to love, and hath married the daughter of a ſtrange God. The Lord will cut off the man that doeth this, the maſter and the ſcholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob.</hi> Mal. ii. 11, 12. The hope of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, involved, in this profanity, and againſt whom the word of God is ſo explicit and pointed, muſt have hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work; and yet, even in this deſperate caſe, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030610_0012_0FE830A2AF242550"/>Chriſt and his great atonement, ſalvation is poſſible, or elſe there could be no ground for hope; and there was a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ground for hope in this caſe. <hi>And Shechaniah the ſon of Jehiel, of the ſons of Elam, anſwered and ſaid unto Ezra, We have treſpaſſed againſt our God and have taken ſtrange wives of the people of the land, yet now there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> Ezra i. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> is an internal hanging of the mind upon a diſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, attended with expectation of help from the object on which the mind hangs. But then there muſt be ſome way opened for the troubled mind, with her expectations, to enter in at. The broken law reveals God in terrible majeſty: darkneſs is his ſecret pavilion, and dreadful wrath is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The curſe of the law, the ſword of juſtice, are point blank againſt the ſinner; and he ſees it, and feels it: and, as the ſinner knows that he is guilty before God, and under the curſe, law and conſcience both condemn him, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plead innocent. Sins bar him from God; and terrible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty forbids his approach, keeps him at a diſtance, yea, makes the ſoul fly from before him; but he knows not whether to go from his ſpirit, nor where to fly from his terrible preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The awakened ſinner ſees no way of acceſs to an angry God in a broken law; nor can he hope or expect that God will change his mind, repeal his law, or prove falſe to his word, in order to gratify him who is an enemy to him. There is no acceſs without a mediator, no pardon without atonement, no cancelling infinite debts without a ſurety, no gaol delivery without ſatisfaction, nor juſtification without perfect obedience.—And Jeſus Chriſt is all theſe: but while he is hid there is no opening appears, no paſſage through which hope and expectation can poſſibly paſs to God; but in <hi>the valley of Achor he opens a door of hope.</hi> Hoſ. ii. 15.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is the only door; and he that rejects him, and whoſe hope enters not in by this door, has ſomething vile and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable even in his very hope. He hopes that God will not deal with him according to his ſins, nor according to his abſolute threatenings; he hopes that God will change his mind, be perjured in his oath, and lie to his word; which is making God juſt ſuch an one as himſelf; but God is true, and every man a liar. <hi>He is not man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould repent.</hi> Set aſide the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and there is neither refuge nor anchorage for a poor ſinner.

               <hi>We have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us.</hi> Heb. vi. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hope</hi> can only be exerciſed in this world; for, though in general it is of things future<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things to come, and things in heaven, yet it is only in this world that hope is employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. There is no work for hope in heaven, or any foundation for it in hell. In heaven they ſee, enjoy, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, all that they formerly hoped for; and as they ſee and enjoy theſe heavenly glories, there is no room nor exerciſe for hope about them; <hi>for that which is ſeen is not hope.</hi> Nor is there any foundation laid for hope in hel. <hi>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word of God confines all hope entirely to this world, and to men in this preſent ſtate.

            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing that the awakened ſinner hopes for (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved) is the revelation of Chriſt to his ſoul, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and peace through him. The deſire of all nations is to him the one thing needful; and he knows that, if he gets it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030610_0014_0FE830AB6E4A3458"/>not in this world, it cannot be gotten in hell, where "hope never comes, that comes to all." <hi>Milton.</hi> After <hi>this</hi> he ſeeks with his whole heart, and <hi>this</hi> is the earneſt deſire of his ſoul: nor can he ever reſt till he has got it; and every let, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, or hindrance, increaſes his miſery, adds to the ſmart of a wounded ſpirit, and inflames the plague of his heart, which only knows its own bitterneſs. <hi>Hope deferred maketh the heart ſick, but when the deſire cometh it is a tree of life.</hi> Prov. xiii. 12.</p>
            <p>But, when Chriſt manifeſts himſelf to ſuch a ſinner, when he ſhines into his heart, and preſents himſelf to his faith; when he removes the heavy burden of his ſins, and chaſes them from his ſight; when he purges his conſcience, binds up the broken heart, ſpeaks peace to the ſoul, ſilences all its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, caſts out fear and torment, ſoftens his hard ſpirit, and conquers his ſtubborn will; enlarges his ſoul with love, and reſcues his troubled mind from the meditations of terror, and from the gloomy regions of the ſhadow of death; comforts him on every ſide, and fills him with joy and peace in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>then</hi> the deſire of all nations is come, the deſire is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and it is ſweet to the ſoul. This is a diſcovery and a manifeſtation of Chriſt, which ennobles the mind, and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the ſoul with all true riches and ſpiritual treaſure. <hi>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this myſtery among the Gentiles, which is Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Col. i. 27.</p>
            <p>Now the door of hope is not only open, but the way of life is caſt up and made plain. The dreadful receptacle of the damned is out of ſight and out of mind; every gloomy thought has taken its flight, and not one chained down either to death or damnation. They are all brought into ſweet captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. A divine ray ſhines on the celeſtial track, while hope purſues a riſen ſaviour to the unclouded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of eternal day; while faith ſtands gazing at the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight, lays hold of and embraces the refuge, and is no leſs than <hi>the confidence of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen;</hi> while hope goes within the vail, anchors there, and hangs faſt, attended with an aſſured and undoubted expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eternal glory. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who, according to his abundant mercy, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten us again unto a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> 1 Pet. i. 3.</p>

This bleſſed manifeſtation of Jeſus ſo changes the ſcene in the poor ſinner's ſoul, that old things paſs away, and leave for a while little more than the bare remembrance of them; and all things become new.

               </gap>d and difficult; yet nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than thoſe things that a good hope through grace is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed upon. And there is a degree of aſſurance always attends a good hope; which hope, and the aſſurance of it, are in general communicated to the ſinner by the miniſtry of the word; and are nouriſhed, encouraged, and made to abound, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendance on the ſame. The ſoul that is bleſſed with ſaith, hope, and charity, ſhould carry them about to all the feaſts, banquets, and ſabbaths, that are appointed by the Lord, and enjoined to the houſehold of faith. Theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030610_0017_0FE830B4D5F85FD8"/>ſhould be taken amongſt the faithful friends of the Lord, and thoſe that love him in ſincerity and truth. And, by the word explained, and by accounts of the experience of others, theſe graces appear to be genuine, and of the right kind; and are eſteemed as ſuch; and God the author and giver or them is glorified for them. By theſe means we often ſee the difference between the faith of God's elect, and the confidence of fools; between a good hope through grace, and that of the hypocrite; and between the love and joy that ſpring from the ſtirrings of natural affections in a way-ſide hearer, and that divine and undiſſembled love of God which is ſhed abroad in the Heart by the Holy Ghoſt. By the uſe of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means, infidelity gets diſcovered and deteſted; the old man now and then gets ſuch a blow on the head, or a wound in his members, by the maul or the ſharp arrow that makes him ſtagger again; while faith gets brighter, views, hope a deeper hold, and the bowels of charity are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, made to move afreſh, and flow out. We are all <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in one hope of our calling;</hi> and therefore muſt cleave togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and aſſiſt and encourage each other; and be found in a conſtant uſe of the means. <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſurance of hope to the end.</hi>— Heb. vi. 11.</p>
            <p>The future things which hope is exerciſed on, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about, are theſe:—She raiſes the ſoul to hang on Chriſt: and expect, in the great day of the general judgment, to be found wrapt up and enrobed in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; which wedding garment, though now upon us, and all that believe, is but dimly ſeen; but in that day it will appear in all its divine luſtre, and in all its ineſtimable worth, as a raiment of needle work and gold of Ophir; in which alone the ſoul can ſtand the judgment with acceptance, and in which alone the ſoul can be admitted into the realms and manſions of eternal bliſs. It is in this raiment that the queen muſt be brought into the king's palace. <hi>For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteouſneſs which is by faith.</hi> Gal. v. 5.</p>
            <p>Another thing hoped for is the majeſtic glorious, and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous appearance of the ever-bleſſed object hoped in.— When he ſhall deſcend from the third heaven, with all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of infinite divinity, attended with all the glorified ſaints and angelic myriads, to be admired in all that believe, and to be had in honour of all that are round about him, <hi>then</hi> to

            <p>Another thing hoped for is the reſurrection of the body to an immortal life, and the changing of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him as he is. The body of a dying ſaint is leſt in faith to reſt in hope; that, as the body is ſown in weakneſs, it ſhall be raiſed in power; ſown in diſhonour, raiſed in glory; ſown natural, raiſed ſpiritual; ſown in corruption, raiſed in incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Immortality muſt be put on; and mortality put off, and ſwallowed up of life. This is the morning of eternal day, in which the upright ſhall have dominion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe <hi>firſt;</hi> a thouſand years before the wicked. The bleſſed, and the holy, have a part in the firſt reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and none elſe.

            <p>Theſe are the great things, the things, future, and things eternal, that hope enters into, hangs upon, and expects. Take away theſe, the promiſed enjoyment of them, and the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead in order to it, and the wicked would have the advantage of us. For, although there is much of Chriſt enjoyed in firſt love, numberleſs ſweet viſits afterwards by the way, and the abundance of life and peace; yet there is ſo much bitterneſs, wormwood, and gall; ſo many oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reproaches, and ſcandals; ſo much perſecution, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and deſertions; that attend a ſteady profeſſion of, and a cloſe adherence to, Chriſt, that, <hi>if in this life only we have hope in him, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 19.</p>

By <hi>truth</hi> we are to underſtand, in the firſt place, the vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of God. <hi>He is a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is be.</hi> Which truth is pledged in every doctrine of the everlaſting goſpel, and in every promiſe of the better coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant which in the mouth of the Spirit, is the ſoul-quickening word of eternal life. God will be true to his dear ſon, who is our covenant head; and true to his covenant, which was made and which ſtands faſt with him; and he will be true to all his ſeed, and to every promiſe made to them in Chriſt, which <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>muſt,</hi> in the exact fulfilment of every promiſe, and in the accompliſhment of every prediction, reſpecting Chriſt and them. Thus divine truth, accompanying every prophecy of <hi>good,</hi> and every promiſe made to us in the word, comes forth from the God of truth; and which, in the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it to us, in the experience of it, power of it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it, makes us and the whole church the pillar and ground of the truth. And certain it is that the truth of God in his word ſhall never return void: it ſhall accompliſh the end for which it is ſent, and proſper in the thing that pleaſes God: and at laſt in the ſalvation and glorification of God's elect. <hi>Truth ſhall be ſettled in heaven.</hi> Pſalm cxix. 89. But then the non-elect are a ſeed of falſehood; there is no truth in them; their right hand is a right hand of falſehood.—They are not of God; but of their father the devil, who was a liar from the beginning. They cannot deliver their ſouls, nor ſay, <hi>Is there not a lie in my right hand? And as the tree falis, ſo it lies:</hi> it ſhall never be turned, nor the ſtate of it ever be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: <hi>for they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then it may be <hi>objected</hi>—If they that go down into the pit cannot hope for God's truth, it looks as if no branch of divine truth will ever appear there—nothing but falſehood; which is confirming Mr. Wincheſter's doctrine, whoſe hope is, that God will prove a liar, and be perjured in his oath. Muſt not the truth of God appear to the wicked in his unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed law, in his fulfilmeat of the awful threatening, and in the execution of the righteous ſentence according to the juſt demerit of ſin, which ends in an eternal baniſhment from his preſence? I <hi>anſwer</hi>—The truth of God will appear in all theſe: <hi>for as is his fear, ſo is his wrath;</hi> both are for <hi>ever,</hi> and and both are ſure; the former to the ſaint, and the latter to the ſinner. But this branch of truth <hi>is not hoped for,</hi> but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped againſt. Hope is always employed about ſomething <hi>good,</hi> ſomething <hi>deſirable,</hi> and ſomething that the poor ſinner feels his need of: hope of the right kind hopes for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030610_0021_0FE830C49EA13790"/>of God, and the truth of his ſalvation. But theſe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates are <hi>a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will have no mercy on them, and he that created them will ſhew them no favour;</hi> and, if no mercy is to be had on them, nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſhewn to them, <hi>then they that go down into the pit cannot hope for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>truth</hi> we are to underſtand our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the <hi>truth</hi> of his divine nature; who is truly, properly, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and eternally, GOD, in every ſenſe of that great and tremendous name, and in all glorious perfections. <hi>He is the true God, and eternal life;</hi> and in his human nature truly and properly man; and in every covenant character faithful and true. In his prophetic office, in the doctrines he taught, and in the teſtimony that he bore, he is the faithful and true witneſs; yea, he is the truth of all the ancient propheties: <hi>to him gave all the prophets witneſs:</hi> and he is the truth, ſum, and ſubſtance, of every doctrine of the everlaſting goſpel.—He is the angel of the great council, and the firſt elect in the ancient ſettlements of eternity. Predeſtination to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children, and the choice of God to eternal life, are both in him. Redemption and ſatisfaction; juſtification and reconciliation; pardon, peace, and acceptance with God; are all in him, and of him. He is the great and rich gift; and all the invaluable treaſures and bleſſings, that are hold forth in every unconditional promiſe, are what is called <hi>the unſearchable rickes of Chriſt.</hi> He is the ſubſtance of all the ceremonial ſhadows, and the truth of all the legal types.—<hi>The law was given by Moſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is the true tabernacle, which God pitched and not man. And this King, in his divine favour, is the <hi>cloud,</hi> and this Holy One is the <hi>flame,</hi> that followed Iſrael through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the dreary deſart. He is the hidden manna, and the flowing rock; the mercy ſeat, and the ark of our ſtrength, where all the ſecret treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are hid. He is the vail, and the entrance into the holy place; the golden pot, and the blooming rod; the golden table, and the bread of life; the altar, prieſt, and ſacrifice. He is the laborious o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, that bore the legal yoke; the red heifer, that made atonement; the fatted calf, that feods the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; and the lamb of God, that takes away the ſin of the world. He is the day-break, day-ſtar, and day-ſpring, that has viſited us, and who has made all thoſe ſhadows flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and nothing but a <hi>ſolid ſubſtance</hi> is left for us. <hi>God hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The deſtruction of the antedeluvian world, and of the cities of the plain, is an awful diſplay of his inflexible juſtice, and of his holy indignation at all ſin; while the preſervation of Noah and Lot as loudly proclaim his diſcriminating grace and ſovereign clemency. The journals of the patriarchs, and their poſterity, are all attended and beſtrewn with his faithfulneſs and truth to them, both in providence and in grace. His tender care of them is clearly ſeen, and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on them, the proviſion he made for them, his protection of them, and his love tokens to them. <hi>He led them from one nation to another people, and ſuffered none to do them wrong; yea, be reproved kings for their ſakes, ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no barm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, although ſome ſay, "I can ſee nothing of Chriſt in the Song of Sclomon, in the books of Ruth and Eſther, &amp;c." yet the book of Ruth exhibits nothing elſe but the grace of Chriſt, and the wonderful footſteps of Providence; yea, the converſion of that woman, through whom, by the female line, according to the fleſh, Chriſt came, is a wonderful hint of the ſalvation of the <hi>heathen.</hi> And, as for the book of Eſther, the hand of the Lord toward his ſervants, and his indignation toward his enemies, appear almoſt in every line, It was he that ſent them into Babylon for their idolatry; he was a little ſanctuary to them when they came there, and was ſeen <hi>upon a red horſe among the myrtle trees,</hi> when they came back again. Zech. i. 8. He ſtopped the lions' mouths in Daniel's den; walked with the three children in the fiery ſurnace; brought his own captive daughter to the throne of the kingdom; hung Haman at his own expence; and advanced Mordecai from a decreed deſtruction to the dignity of prime miniſter. It was this Michael, the great prince, that ſtood for the children of Iſrael againſt the devil in the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030610_0023_0FE830CCAC3EDFB0"/>courts of Perſia; and it was he that reſiſted him again at the right hand of Joſhua, in the land of Iſrael: in all which he appeared their God, their Saviour, their Ring, and their Mediator. And, as for the Song of Solomon, every line of it proclaims its own author; for there is none that ſpeaketh like him; and, it being a ſealed book to the wile and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhews plain enough that it is ſacred; and, were all the worldly wiſe upon the earth to undertake to make a book like it, there would be no more reſemblance between theirs and the original, than there is between the prophet Iſaiah's predictions and the whims of old mother Shipton. That which flows from a divine ſpring has both a fulneſs and ſatisfaction in it; but that which is preſſed from human brains is nothing but a ſound from emptineſs, and proves a broken ciſtern to all that ſeek entertainment therein. This Jeſus is the truth of all the bible. <hi>Search the ſcriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> But then, ſays the Saviour, <hi>the world ſees me no more.</hi> They ſhall ſee him as their judge in the great day, for then <hi>every eye ſhall ſce him;</hi> and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt.—But, as a Saviour, the world ſees me <hi>no more.</hi> Theſe believe not on him. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall die in your ſins; and whither I go ye cannot come.</hi> John viii. 21. And, if they are to ſee him <hi>no more,</hi> and if they <hi>cannot</hi> come where he is, then <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, by <hi>truth</hi> we may underſtand the Holy Ghoſt in all his convineing, quickening, regenerating, renewing, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, comforting, ſealing, and purifying, work on the ſouls of God's elect. <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſs, becauſe the Spirit is truth.</hi> 1 John v. 6. And ſo are all his operations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. This bleſſed <hi>anointing teacheth us all things, and is truth, and is no lie.</hi> 1 John ii. 27. He guides us into all truth, and bears a true teſtimony with our own conſcience to our juſtification and adoption; and reveals to us the true mind and will of God, and the true ſtate of our ſouls before him. He ſearches the deep things of God, and lets us know what is freely given us of God. He reveals the ſovereign grace of God, and his good will to us; and is the life and truth of all grace in us. He purifies our heads and hearts from guilt and falſchood, and from the falſe notions that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained both of God and ourſelves. He bears a true teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus to us; <hi>he ſhall teſtiſy of me.</hi> He receives the things of Chriſt, and reveals them to us; and ſhews us things to come. It is this ever-bleſſed Spirit of truth that applies the word of God to the elect ſinner; and makes is
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030610_0024_0FE830D22109F260"/>effectual, and the power of God, to ſalvation. The word comes with power, in the Holy Ghoſt, and with much aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He ſoftens the hard heart, meekens the ſtubborn ſoul, and gives the engrafted word both a place and a root. He induences, and mightily perſuades the mind to yield the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith, by crediting the glorious teſtimony; and makes faith work by love, both to the everlaſting goſpel and its adorable author. He helps our infirmities at a throne of grace, as a ſpirit of ſupplication; makes us feel, and points out our wants; dictates every petition that ſhall find acceptance, and attends the ſame with confidence; and ſends them from off the heart with warmth, fervour and energy. And we have the infinite ſatisfaction of ſeeing and feeling that they do not return empty. This holy and ever-bleſſed Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of truth is the earneſt of the great reward; the witneſs, ſealer, and comforter of every ſaint of God. But then this <hi>Spirit of truth the world</hi> CANNOT <hi>receive, becauſe it ſeath him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> John xiv. 17. And, if the world, the non-elected world, <hi>cannot</hi> receive him, then they cannot be ſanctified by him; and without ſanctification by the Holy Ghoſt, there can be no meetneſs for heaven: the unclean cannot enter there; and <hi>without holineſs no man can ſee the Lord.</hi> Hence it follows, that, <hi>except a man be born again</hi> of the Spirit, <hi>be cannot ſee the kingdom of God,</hi> much leſs to enter into it.—<hi>And, as the world</hi> CANNOT <hi>receive this ſpirit of truth, then they that go down into the pit cannot hope for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>truth</hi> we are to underſtand the ſoul-quickening word of God. <hi>Sanctify them through thy truth; thy word is truth.</hi> This word, faithfully and purely preached and cordially received, embraced, and credited, is the incorruptible ſeed, that abides forever. It is called the word of faith, becauſe faith comes by hearing of it, and hearing by the preaching of it. It is called the word of wiſdom, becauſe it makes us wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through the faith of Chriſt: the word of knowledge; becauſe it holds forth, and reveals, all that is eſſential to be known both of God and ourſelves: it is the word of life, by which we are quickened: it is the word of righteouſneſs, by which we are made juſt; the word of reconciliation, by which we are made friends; and the word of truth, by which we are made free. But then this word is only made to Chriſt the elect head, and to his predeſtinated offspring. For thus ſaith God, <hi>This is my covenant with them, the word that I have put in thy mouth, and the ſpirit that I have put upon thee, ſhall never depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, from henceforth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>

There ſhall be nothing of all theſe things communicated to a man in the grave. But ſure I am, that it muſt mean an ungodly man to whom none of all theſe things are to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; for the Spirit of God, that now dwells in all the ſaints, ſhall in the great day quicken their mortal bodies, and reveal the great work of God, and the wonderful device that he has framed. Imperfect knowledge ſhall vaniſh, and perfect knowledge be made known; and the wiſdom of God in the goſpel myſtery ſhall be revealed in all the latitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in all the beauty and glory of it, as ſoon as the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſed Spirit quickens our mortal bodies. For now we know but in part, and propheſy in part, and ſee through a glaſs darkly; but, when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done away; then ſhall we know even as we are known, and ſee even as we are ſeen: and this as ſoon as the body is quickened in the tomb. For it ſhall be <hi>raiſed</hi> immortal; then it muſt be immortal before it is raiſed; yea, raiſed ſpiritual and glorious: and thus it ſhall be <hi>raiſed.</hi>—Therefore there will be, to the ſaints of God, a <hi>wonderful work,</hi> a <hi>ſtrange device, perfect knowledge,</hi> and the moſt <hi>conſummate wiſdom,</hi> revealed to the children of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the <hi>grave,</hi> at the Reſurrection Morning; for they ſhall be raiſed in all this glory. Hence it appears plain, that <hi>as the tree falls, whether towards the north or towards the ſouth, where the tree falleth, there it ſhall lie;</hi> and that the ſinner who dies in his ſins <hi>ſhall find no works, device, knowledge, or wiſdom</hi> (that ſhall avail him any thing) <hi>in the grave whither he goes.

Which word, according to the learned, has various mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iags. The word <hi>ſchool</hi> is uſed in four ſeveral ſenſes in the ſcriptures: Firſt, it is taken for hell metaphorically; that is, for deep plunging into extreme ſorrow, miſery, and danger. Pſ. lxxxvi. 13. Secondly, for the local hell properly. Prov. xv. 11. Thirdly, it ſignifieth the grave. Prov. xxx. 16.—Fourthly, it ſignifieth the lower, deep, and remote parts of the earth, without any relation to the place of puniſhment. Pſ. cxxxix. 8. To which I may add a Fifth acceptation of this word, for the common place or ſtate of the dead; as Pſ. lxix. 47, 48, &amp;c. <hi>School</hi> ſignifieth any devouring gulph, or pit, ſwallowing up the dead; as Numbers xvi. 33.</p>
            <p>That there is an awful and dreadful place of puniſhment, prepared by a juſt God for the devil and his angels, and for ungodly ſinners of mankind, is plain both from the <hi>Old</hi> Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament and from the <hi>New;</hi> and this truth is realized to the ſoul and conſcience of every ſinner ſhut up in black deſpair, and given up to a fearful looking for of judgment in this world; and is often dreadfully feared, and the pains of it deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt, even by the elect of God, when brought under the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of divine juſtice, and arraigned at the bar of a broken law: under which dreadful ſenſations, and awful apprehenſions, have ſprung thoſe fearful cries, and thoſe earneſt petitions, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch grievous complaints, ſo often found in holy writ; put up by thoſe who have ſunk in the horrible pit, and who have known and felt the terrors of the Lord. Firſt,</p>
            <p>We have the outcry of the deſpairing ſinner: <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulneſs hath ſurpriſed the hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Iſaiah xxxiii. 14. Now this people was either in great fear where no fear was, which is not likely; or elſe, like the devils, they believe there is ſuch a place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and tremble at the dreadful apprehenſions of it, and at the diſpleaſure of an angry God, who hath prepared it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the dreadful complaints of the elect under their awful apprehenſions of this place of torment, when the rod of God has been heavy upon them. <hi>Unto thee will I cry, O Lord, my rock! be not ſilent to me, leſt if thou be ſilent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</hi> Pſ. xxviii. 1. And again: <hi>Let not the water-ſtood overflow me, neither let the deep ſwallow me up; and let not the pit ſhut her mouth upon me.</hi> Pſ. lxix. 15 <hi>The captive exile haſteneth that he may be looſed, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030610_0027_0FE830DC793DAFC0"/>that he ſhould not die in the pit.</hi> Iſaiah li. 14. It is clear enough that theſe awakened ſouls had awful apprehenſions of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place of puniſhment; and labored hard to fly from the wrath to come, and to embrace the only hiding place from the ſtorm: <hi>and theſe were delivered from going down to the pit, for God has found a ranſom.</hi> Job xxxiii. 24.</p>
            <p>I know that the word <hi>pit</hi> has various meanings in holy writ: ſometimes it ſignifies a falſe church, or a whore, in a ſpiritual ſenſe: in the communion of which many profeſſors are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled as never to get out. <hi>The mouth of a ſtrange woman is a deep pit; the abhorred of the Lord ſhall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll therein.</hi> And a whore, in a temporal ſenſe, is called a <hi>pit;</hi> whoſe enſnaring charms have held many a priſoner ſo faſt, that all the laſhes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and all the dread of damnation, could never deter him, till he has fallen a ſacrifice to vindictive juſtice. Many a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate has periſhed in this ſnare: <hi>for a whore is a deep ditch, and a ſtrange woman is a narrow pit.</hi> Prov. xxiii. 27.</p>
            <p>Sarah's womb is called a <hi>pit;</hi> who was to be the mother of the elect when paſt age; from which (though impoſſible to nature) Chriſt, according to the fleſh, came, and all the elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thouſands, both of Jews and Gentiles, <hi>in him. Look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged: look unto Abraham your father, and to Sarah that bare you.</hi> Iſa. li. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pit</hi> ſometimes ſignifies deep ſoul-trouble; in which the heart and fleſh both fail; and the poorſoul ſinks into heavineſs and deſpondency, while trouble upon trouble rolls over him, like wave upon wave over a drowning man, till all his ſtrength is exhauſted in ſtruggling; and down he muſt go, except Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence interfere. <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up alſo out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed my goings.</hi> Pſ. xl. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pit</hi> ſignifies any wicked device, intended againſt a religious perſon in order to enſnare him and draw him into ſin, that they may ſee his nakedneſs and reproach his profeſſion: ſuch as the Hottentots contrive to catch elephants in; who dig holes in the ground, in the tracks where thoſe animals come to drink, at the bottom of which ſtakes are driven, and the upper points of them made ſharp; while the top of the hole is ſlightly covered with boughs of trees, and then green turf laid over; upon which the unwieldly creature ſteps, and in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030610_0028_0FE830E1EF003230"/>he goes. So the wicked often enſnare the juſt. <hi>For without cauſe have they hid for me their not in a pit, which without cauſe they have digged for my ſoul.</hi> Pſ. xxxv. 7. But neither of theſe are intended by the word <hi>pit</hi> in my text; but <hi>hell itſelf,</hi> the place prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lowth calls it <hi>perdition;</hi> his words are theſe—</p>
            <q>
               <l>"For this cauſe ſhall it be declared, O JEHOVAH, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Thee,</l>
               <l>That thou haſt revived my ſpirit;</l>
               <l>That thou haſt reſtored my health, and prolonged my life.</l>
               <l>Behold, my anguiſh is changed into eaſe!</l>
               <l>Thou haſt reſcued my ſoul from <hi>perdition.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Verily, the grave ſhall not give thanks unto thee;</l>
               <l>Death ſhall not praiſe thee;</l>
               <l>They that go down into the pit ſhall not await thy truth."</l>
               <bibl>Iſa. xxxviii. 16, 17, 18.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>That is, they that go down into the pit ſhall never expect thy truth; for they never were reſerved or deſigned for it, and therefore cannot hope for it, await it, or expect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perdition</hi> ſignifies no leſs than utter ruin and deſtruction.— Judas is called the ſon or heir of perdition, and is ſaid to go to his OWN PLACE, from which he will never remove, being moſt worthy of it for his dreadful tranſgreſſion, and pre or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to it for his ſins, in which the bounds of his habitation are eternally fixed. Antichriſt is likeweſe called the ſon of perdition, being his fellow heir of the ſame place; becauſe he drives the ſame wicked trade with Chriſt and his blood as Judas did; and who will at laſt go into perdition as well as he, and be drowned in it, for, as for grace or the Holy Spirit, neither he nor Simon Magus have either part or lot in that matter.</p>
            <p>Various are the names by which this awful place of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called in ſcripture. It is called <hi>Tophet:</hi> which place
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030610_0029_0FE830E5391670E0"/>was in the valley of the ſon of Hinnom, where the children of Iſrael ſacrificed their children to Molech. <hi>They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the ſon of Hinnom, to cauſe their ſons and their daughters to paſs through the fire into Molech.</hi> Jer. xxxii. 35. <hi>Yea, they ſacrificed their children to devils, and defiled the land with blood.</hi> Pſ. cvi 37. This image had arms, (as ſome ſay) to hold the infants in, and to which arms they were bound. The image was made hollow within, and a kiln hole was made at the bottom of the image, where the fire was kindled, and kept burning till the child was conſumed. Some children they drove through the fire to this idol, and ſome were fixed, as above, in the arms of it. The prieſts who offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated at this infernal altar were called <hi>chemarims,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>I will alſo ſtretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jeruſalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place; and the names of the chemarims with the prieſts.</hi>—Zeph. i. 4. At the times of ſacrificing theſe poor children they uſed to beat <hi>drums,</hi> &amp;c. in order to drown the cries of them when in the fire: on which account, as ſome think, this valley is called <hi>Tophet;</hi> which according to the learned, ſignifies a <hi>drum:</hi> and God himſelf gives it this name to repreſent hell.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Molech, horrid king, beſmear'd with blood</l>
               <l>Of human ſacrifices, and parents' tears,</l>
               <l>Though for the noiſe of DRUMS and TIMBRELS loud</l>
               <l>Their children's cries unheard, that paſs'd through fire</l>
               <l>To his grim idol; and made his grove</l>
               <l>The pleaſant valley of Hinnom: Tophet thence</l>
               <l>And black Gehenna call'd, the type of hell.</l>
               <bibl>MILTON.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>And God compares the wicked to the <hi>fuel</hi> with which they burnt their children. And God will kindle a worſe fire than they did; and be as deaf to the cries of them as they were to thoſe of their poor infants. <hi>For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large; the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a ſtream of brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> Iſa. xxx. 33.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this place of puniſhment is called a <hi>lair;</hi> an alluſion to the plain where anciently ſtood the four cities of Sodom. Gomorrha, Adma, and Zeboim, which the Lord deſtroyed by fire.

               </hi> chooſing it when he ſeparated from <hi>Abraham.</hi> It was anciently a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich fertile valley, of ſeventy miles long, and twenty over: under its turf was a kind of a rich bitumen, and beneath
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030610_0030_0FE830EAAD1759A8"/>that a pitchy ſlime, (Gen. xiv. 10.) which they uſed in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Compare with Gen. xi. 3. But, when God ramed fire and brimſtone from heaven upon thoſe cities, the bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſlime took fire alſo. The land of the plain, and the whole country, were all on a flame and ſmoke. Gen. xix. 28. <hi>And God overthrew thoſe cities:</hi> Gen. xix. 25; that is, with an earthquake, by which a prodigious mountain was caſt up at the weſt end of the plain; and the whole plain is now a <hi>dead ſeo,</hi> called the lake <hi>Aſpholtites.</hi> The rivers <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Jabbok,</hi> and <hi>Arnon,</hi> all run into it at the eaſt end: but there is no way out of it, unleſs by a ſubterraneous paſſage. But what is the moſt ſurpriſing of all is, that, though this lake is fed by freſh water rivers, yet the ſea is remarkably ſalt; and, according to <hi>Maundrell,</hi> prodigious nauſeous. The ſtorm of vengeance which fell upon thoſe cities is the pledge and earneſt of the general conflagration. <hi>As it was in the days of Lot, ſo ſhall it be in the days of the Son of Man.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the inhabitants of theſe cities is an emblem of the deſtruction of all the wicked in the great day; who, as well as the Sodomites, <hi>will ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire;</hi> of which place this ſulphureous lake (when all on a flame) was an awful figure or repreſentation. <hi>The beaſt, and the falſe prophet,</hi> (Rev. xix. 20) <hi>and the Devil that deceived them;</hi> (Rev. xv. 10.) <hi>yea, all whoſoever were not found written in the book of life;</hi> (Rev. xx. 15.) <hi>the fearful and unbelieving, and the abomin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and murderers, and whoremongers, and ſorcerers, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and all liars, ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Rev. xxi. 8.</p>
            <p>Sometimes this place of torment is called a <hi>priſon,</hi> in which all the King of heaven's priſoners are or ſhall be bound, ſhut up, and confined. It is prepared for devils, rebels, traitors, reprobates, infidels, hypocrites, heretics, falſe proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and perſecutors; and all who deſcend into it will lie in it until the end of the ſaint's thouſand years reign with Chriſt in <hi>the new earth, herein dwelleth righteouſneſs;</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The throne of iniquity ſhall have no fellowſhip with God, who frame miſchief by a law. Light and darkneſs ſhall have no agreement; Chriſt and Belial ſhall have no concord: what part hath be that believes with an infidel! The believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath <hi>no part</hi> with him: and ſhall the infidel ever have any part with the believer; one being the child of God, and the other the child of the devil? the one being ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and the other ordained to this condemnation? No. <hi>God has hid their heart from underſtanding, and therefore he ſhall not exalt them.</hi> Job. xvii. 4.</p>
            <p>I come now to my fourth head; which is to ſhew.</p>
            <p>That they that godown to the pit are without truth. Chriſt is eminently and emphatically the truth; but they that go
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030610_0033_0FE830F415C549B8"/>down into the pit are without Chriſt in every covenant char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and in every ſenſe of the word. They have no Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: and without a Mediator, there can be no acceſs to God. Chriſt took not on him the ſeed of Cain, nor of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, nor of Iſhmael, nor of Eſau: but he took on him the ſeed of Abraham, and that after he was appointed, made, and declared, the father of many nations, and in a goſpel ſenſe of all the choſen ſeed. Chriſt <hi>took part of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's fleſh and blood:</hi> not that of the reprobate, nor of the rejected ſeed of old Adam, nor that of the children of the fleſh; for theſe are not the children of God: <hi>but the chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed;</hi> and it was part of the fleſh of theſe heirs of promiſe that Chriſt took; for ſuch, and only ſuch, are the children of Abraham in the ſpiritual ſenſe of ſcripture. <q>They are not all Iſrael who are of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham are theyl all the children of God.</q> Chriſt himſelf will not allow this. The reprobate Jews told him that <hi>God was their father:</hi> but he tells them that, if God was their father they would love him; and palms them upon their father the devil. And when they claimed Abraham as their father, Chriſt allows it in one ſenſe; <hi>I know that ye are Abraham's ſeed,</hi> (John viii. 37) that is, according to the fleſh; but not according to God's purpoſe and promiſe: therefore <q>Jeſus ſaith unto them if ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</q> John viii. 39. Chriſt never calls theſe his brethren, nor does he claim any kindred to them; but tells them to depart, he knows not whence they are, becauſe they are not of the election. Chriſt is not their advocate nor their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor: he never pleaded their cauſe in eternity, nor yet in time; nor does he now do it in heaven; nor will he do it in the day of judgment, nor yet in hell: but paſſes the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſentence of the law upon them, and ſends them away from him as utter ſtrangers to him: which cannot be called pleading their cauſe againſt the devil, when he calls them the devil's own children, and ſends them away from him, in company both with the devil and all his angels. Nor did Chriſt ever pray for theſe as an interceſſor: for, although he ſaid upon the croſs, <q>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do;</q> yet it was for ſome of the elect in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that he then prayed; who were very buſy at his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion; upon whom Peter charged his blood, and who were cut to the heart at the awful appeal, repented, and believed, and were added to his church. But for the non-elected world he never prayed: <q>I pray for them; I pray not for the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030610_0034_0FE830FA6DED08C8"/>world, but for them which thou haſt given me.</q> John xvii. 9.</p>
            <p>Nor did Chriſt die for them: he died not for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſerpents, nor vipers, nor for the reprobate, but for the elect; not for the dogs, but for the doves; not for the goats, but for the ſheep. <q>The good Shepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</q> John x. 11. <q>But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you.</q> John x. 26. And them that are not his ſheep he never died for: and without redemption by blood there can be no ſalvation from hell. <hi>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did he ever teach theſe as a prophet. No; he came to them for judgment, that they which ſee might be made blind: yea, he cloſed their eyes, ſtopped their ears, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened their hearts; that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, hear with their ears, nor underſtand with their hearts. He never turned them to him, nor took the veil from them; but thanked his Father for hiding theſe things from them: and declares that <hi>the wicked ſhall do wickedly,</hi> and that <hi>none of the wicked ſhall underſtand.</hi> Dan. xii. 10. They may ever learn; but, like Mr. Wincheſter, they are <hi>never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe the great Prophet of the church never teaches them. <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> and none elſe. <hi>The natural man diſcerns not the things of the ſpirit; nor</hi> CAN <hi>he know them,</hi> either in time or eternity, <hi>becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>—And the Holy Spirit does not teach the world: <hi>The</hi> (repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) <hi>world</hi> CANNOT <hi>receive him,</hi> either in this world or the next, <hi>becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> John xiv. 17. Therefore <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as they that are of this world are not Chriſt's ſheep, ſo he never gathers them out of it; he never ſeeks them out, nor finds them. He ſeeks none but the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael; and the other ſheep, which are not of that fold (namely, the elect among the Gentiles,) theſe he muſt bring, and there ſhall be one fold and one ſhepherd.—For <hi>theſe</hi> he died; <hi>theſe</hi> he redeemed; <hi>theſe</hi> he gathers out of all places, whither ſcattered in the cloudy and dark days.—The diſeaſed of <hi>theſe</hi> he ſtrengthens; the lame he heals; the broken he binds up; the weak he lays on his ſhoulders; the lambs he carries in his boſom; and thoſe that are with young he gently leads. In the height of Iſrael he pitches their
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030610_0035_0FE830FBF3911490"/>fold, in the green paſtures of the life-giving goſpel he makes them to lie down, and by the ſtill waters of comfort he leads them. But, though this kind Shepherd deals thus with his ſheep, yet not ſo with the goats, as himſelf ſays: <q>I will feed the flock of ſlaughter; even you, O poor of the flock: and I took unto me two ſtaves; the one I called beauty, and the other I called bands, or binders; and I fed the flock.</q> Zech. xi. 7. Here is Chriſt the King of Iſrael with his beautiful <hi>ſtaff,</hi> or <hi>ſceptre,</hi> ruling and governing his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and with his other <hi>ſtaff,</hi> called <hi>binders</hi> or <hi>bands,</hi> which is his <hi>ſhepherd's crook,</hi> that catches, holds faſt, and detains ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſheep of his flock to himſelf, and to one another in his own fold; while he himſelf condeſcends to feed them. But then he has no charge of the <hi>goats,</hi> he is a <hi>ſhepherd,</hi> not an <hi>herdſman;</hi> nor does he feed them, as himſelf declares: <q>Then, ſaid I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the reſt eat every one the fleſh of another.</q> Zech. xi. 9. Hence it appears plain that the good Shepherd has no charge of theſe; nor does he put forth his crook among them. Nay, he aſked <hi>what they would give for his price</hi> in this twofold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of mediatorial king and good Shepherd; 'and they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him at the common price of a bond ſlave.' Exod. xxi. 32; compare with Zech. xi. 12. <q>Then he cut aſunder his ſtaff, even beauty? that he might break the legal, national, and conditional covenant, that he had made with the houſe of Iſrael;</q> (Zech. xi. 10) for their diſobedience to it, and for their rejection of him: <q>and the middle wall of partition was broken down on that day;</q> and ſalvation was proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Gentiles: and, after they had ſold his blood, and himſelf as their ſhepherd and king, <q>then he cut aſunder his other ſtaff, even bands, that he might break the brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood between the ſpiritual Jews and Iſrael after the fleſh.</q> Zech. xi. 14. 'And it was broken in that day.' Zech. xi. 11. So that <q>they are not Jews that are ſo <hi>outwardly,</hi> but are of the ſynagogue of ſatan; but they are Jews that are ſuch <hi>inwardly;</hi> and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, and not in the letter; whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God.</q> From hence it appears plain that the Lord Jeſus does not undertake for the reprobate, the goats, and the ſeed of the ſerpent; but for the ſheep, which the Father has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him; for whom he died, and whom he <q>redeemed from among men, out of every kindred, people, tongue, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> Rev. v. 9.</p>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:030610_0036_0FE8306EC864F4D0"/>
Nor does the grace of Chriſt rule over the reprobate.—His kingdom is not of this world; it is not of men, but of God; not ſupported by worldly means or worldly maxims; nor are the ſubjects of it of this world, but of God. It is ſet up in the hearts of God's elect, and in no other. Satan is a king ſtill, and has a kingdom; and his kingdom ſtill ſtands, and his ſubjects are led captive by him at his will. Nor is he divided againſt himſelf, nor ever will be: witneſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal lies of Mr. Wincheſter, who is manifeſtly, <hi>at preſent,</hi> a ſubject of ſatan's kingdom; as appears plain by his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance, carnality, hypocriſy, infernal craft, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deception. All which prove, plain enough, that ſatan (not Jeſus) is king oyer all the children of pride; and that he rules in the hearts of all the children of diſobedience.—But he (Chriſt) turns his own people from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan to God; and tranſlates them out of the kingdom of ſatan into his own kingdom, where they find the forgiveneſs of ſins, and a glorious inheritance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in him.—Hence we conclude that, as Chriſt did not aſſume the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the reprobates, ſo he is not the mediator, advocate, interceſſor, prieſt, ſhepherd, or king, of theſe. God has ſet his King upon his holy hill of Zion, not upon Sinai; for all that are of the works of the law are under the curſe. But the ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom are all righteous perſons; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his ſceptre, which is a ſceptre of righteouſneſs.—<hi>Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous: they ſhall inherit the land for ever; the branch of my planning, the work of my hands; that I may be glorified.</hi> Iſa. lx. 21. They that go down into the pit are without Chriſt in every ſenſe; and therefore have no hope in him, nor can they ever hope for his truth.</p>
            <p>Nor does the word of truth ever come with power to them; nor has it any place in them; nor is it ever promiſed to them: their taſte remaineth in them, their ſcent is not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; their palate is vitiated; they have no reliſh for it.—And the reaſon is, they are not of God; that is, they are not of God's chooſing; they are not of God's electing; they are not of God's loving, ordaining, or appointing to ſalvation.— <q>He that is of God, heareth God's word; ye therefore hear it not, becauſe ye are not of God.</q> John viii. 47. The word never comes with power to them; they are never quickened nor illuminated by it, nor ever ſhall be. Satan, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and old Adam after the fleſh, are their fathers; and to them they ſhall go; and from thence they ſhall never come.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030610_0037_0FE831032B330178"/>'He ſhall go to the generation of his fathers; they ſhall never ſee light.' Pſ. xlix. 19; and, if they never ſee light, then <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as the wicked die without Chriſt in every covenant character; who is the way, the truth, and the life; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the words of truth; ſo they die alſo without the true God, and without any hope in him. God is the God of Abraham, and of all his myſtic ſeed: the God of Iſaac, and of every heir of promiſe; and the God of Jacob, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Iſraelite. This is his name for ever, and this is his memorial to all generations. But as for them that die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe and condemnation of the law, with the ſting of death in their conſcience, and the ſentence of death in their hearts; twice dead, plucked up by the roots; is he the God of theſe? No. 'God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.' Mat. xxii. 31. And, as he is not their God, then <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall theſe dead ones; enemies to Chriſt and his cauſe; deſpiſing his word and his people; ſervants of ſin and ſatan; at whoſe calamity God will laugh, and at whom he will mock when their fear cometh; ſhall the covetous, whom God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth ſhall the wicked, whom he hath made for the day of evil; ſhall the veſſels of wrath, fitted by ſin for deſtruction; ſhall the ungodly, before of old ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhall they; upon whom God will have no mercy, and to whom God will ſhew no favour; they who never were born again, and who can never ſee the kingdom of God; who are to be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of God, and from the glory of his power; ſhall theſe ſhare in the great reward of inheritance? No.—They, that find not the path of life in this world, will never find it in the next; they, that are ſtrangers to the truth at death, ſhall never hope for it in the pit; and they who have known ſomething of the way of righteouſneſs in this life, and who have departed from it, leaving the paths of righteouſneſs to walk in the ways of darkneſs; who err from Chriſt the only way, and walk no more in him—ſhall never ſee nor enjoy God in the light and land of the living. <q>The man that wandereth out of the way of underſtanding ſhall REMAIN in the congregation of the dead.</q> Prov. xxi. 16.

They that go down into the pit are without the truth of grace.

The following paſſage from Pitt's tranſlation of the Aeneid contains the ſubſtance of Mr. Wincheſter's doctrine: but from which of the heathen philoſophers Virgil has taken it, or whether he has compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their different opinions, and reduced them into the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſyſtem, is a point, I believe, undetermined.</p>

However, Mr. Wincheſter differs from Virgil; for he makes no uſe of the ſtreams, or the wind, only of the flame. And in his purgation and reſtoration he includes all <hi>men</hi> and <hi>devils,</hi> but Virgil, a <hi>choſen few.</hi> And by this doctrine of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils he exhibits ſatan to be a mere fool, and not half ſo wiſe as the ſcriptures repreſent him; for it is clear that ſatan aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the deſtruction of Chriſt from the manger to the croſs: and muſt not ſatan in this be greatly divided againſt himſelf, to aim and plot to deſtroy his great reſtorer? But the truth of the matter is, that the devil knows better than Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, who never yet either believed or trembled, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils do.

               </gap>ems to be another immutable obſtacle in the way of the reſtoration of devils. The ſtate of the wicked bears the ſame date and duration as that of the juſt; and both are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the ſame word. Thus, in Mat. xxv. 46, <q>And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</q> Here the fame word that fixes the date of the ſinner's puniſhment, fixes alſo the life of the ſaints. The word <hi>aionios</hi> is uſed to deſcribe the <hi>everlaſting puniſhment;</hi> and the ſame word is affixed to the ſaints <hi>everlaſting life: kolaſin aio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, everlaſting puniſhment; zoen aionion, everlaſting life.</hi> See Mat. xxv. 46 and the ſame word is again uſed in Jude 7; 'ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,' <hi>poros aionion</hi> (gen.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030610_0042_0FE8311389E785C0"/>eaſe.) When the <hi>everlaſting</hi> puniſhment of the wicked, and the vengeance of <hi>eternal</hi> fire, are ended; the <hi>everlaſting</hi> life of the ſaints in glory muſt, of courſe, end at the ſame time; for both bear one and the ſame date. And, as for the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and glorification of devils, that is to commence when the Moſt High and immutable God ſhall ceaſe to exiſt, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal divinity be no more. The ſame word that aſſerts the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> exiſtence of the one, aſſerts the <hi>eternal</hi> chains of the other; as it is written, <q>For the inviſible things of him, from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, are clearly ſeen; being underſtood by the things that are made; even his <hi>eternal (aidios)</hi> power and Godhead.</q> Rom. i. 20. This is a divine aſſertion of the omnipotent, eternal and infinite divinity of our ever ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lord and Saviour: and by the ſame word is the <hi>eternal</hi> chains of the infernal criminals aſſerted. <q>And the angels (or principalities) which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in <hi>everlaſting (aidiois)</hi> chains under darkneſs, unto the judgment of the great day.</q> Jude 6. And this word <hi>(aidios)</hi> is only uſed in theſe two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the New Teſtament. Hence it appears plain that the <hi>eternal</hi> power and Godhead of Chriſt, and the <hi>eternal</hi> chains of devils, are aſſerted and ſupported by one and the ſame word, and both bear one and the ſame date; ſo, of courſe, the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence of Chriſt and the reſtoration of devils muſt be at one and the ſame time; which is but a poor ground of hope at the beſt; for at the time Mr. Wincheſter ſends the devils out of purgatory, at the ſame time Chriſt muſt ceaſe to exiſt, and there will be no RESTORER to enjoy: and, without Chriſt, heaven itſelf would add but little felicity, either to devils or to Mr. Wincheſter. The above date of the ſufferings of the damned is an undeniable proof of the aſſertion in my text, that <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. All the race of Adam are not included in the covenant of grace, much leſs <hi>fallea angels.</hi> The covenant that God made with Noah differs much from that which he made with Chriſt; the former reaches to <hi>all,</hi> the latter but to <hi>few.</hi>— <q>And God ſpake unto Noah, and to his ſons with him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, And I, behold I eſtabliſh my covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you; and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beaſt of the earth, with you; from all that go out of the ark to every beaſt of the earth. And I will eſtabliſh my covenant with you; neither ſhall all fleſh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither ſhall there any
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030610_0043_0FE8306D3B696960"/>more be a flood to deſtroy the earth. And God ſaid, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual generations; I do ſet my bow in the cloud, and it ſhall be for a token of the covenant between me and the earth, and every living creature of all fleſh; and the waters ſhall no more become a flood to deſtroy all fleſh.</q> Gen. ix.— This covenant reaches to <hi>all,</hi> both men and beaſts; it ſecures the world from a flood, but not from being drowned in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction and perdition: it did not ſecure Canaan from the curſe, nor Sodom from the vengeance of eternal fire. But the covenant of grace with Chriſt ſecures from both: it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a righteouſneſs which juſtifies from the curſe, and it ſecures from wrath to come, confirmed by the oath of God: <q>For, as I have ſworn that the waters of Noah ſhall no more go over the earth, ſo I have ſworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</q> The covenant made with Chriſt does not extend to all mankind, nor to the beaſts of the field; but only to the elect of God, called a ſeed. <q>A ſeed ſhall ſerve him, and it ſhall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</q> Pſ. xxii. 30. But then the children of the fleſh are not the children of God; <q>but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</q> Rom. ix. 8. To <hi>theſe,</hi> ſays the Almighty, <hi>I</hi> WILL <hi>be their God, and they</hi> SHALL <hi>be my people;</hi> which words are not mentioned in the covenant made with all fleſh. The covenant of grace, made with Chriſt, includes none but the heirs of promiſe; a <hi>ſeed</hi> given to Jeſus, to be redeemed and ſaved by him: which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called <hi>the holy ſeed,</hi> (Iſa. vi. 13) and ſometimes <hi>the ſeed of Iſrael,</hi> which are all to be juſtified in Chriſt Jeſus. Iſa. xlv. 25.—This ſeed muſt be all gathered to Chriſt. <hi>I will bring thy ſeed from the eaſt, and gather them from the weſt.</hi> Iſa. xliii. 5. <q>I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine offspring.</q> Iſa. xliv. 3. <hi>Theſe</hi> are the objects of God's choice, the purchaſe of a Redeemer's blood, and the travail of his ſoul; which he views with delight. <q>He ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</q> In behalf of <hi>theſe</hi> the cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant was made with him, and in their behalf it ſtands faſt. <q>As for me, this is my covenant with them, ſaith the Lord; my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed's ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and ſorever.</q> Iſa. lix. 21. Here is the everlaſting covenant, and here are
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030610_0044_0FE831191A57B2B8"/>the glorious promiſes of it; in which the Spirit of truth and word of truth are made ſure to all the ſeed.—<hi>For theſe,</hi> and <hi>to theſe,</hi> grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt; nor ſhall grace and truth ever depart either from him or them. But then what have devils and reprobates to do with <hi>theſe,</hi> when <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the fleſh are not the children of God;</hi> but a ſinful nation; a ſeed of falſehood—a ſeed of the adulterer and the whore— <hi>a ſeed of evil doers, that ſhall never be renowned?</hi> Iſa. xiv. 20.— Aud, if they are never to be renowned, then <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for the truth.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. The fifth obſtacle in the way of Mr. Wincheſter's <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſtoration</hi> is, God's declaration of never forgetting any of the works of the wicked. The favour that God bears to the objects of his choice is often expreſſed by a remembrance of them. <q>God remembered Abraham, and ſent Lot out of the midſt of the overthrow, when he overthrew thoſe cities in which Lot dwelt.</q> Gen. xix. 29. And thus <hi>God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered Rachel;</hi> Gen. xxx. 22; and <hi>God remembered Hannah.</hi> 1 Sam. i. 19. And indeed the elect can never be forgotten; for Chriſt was made of God unto them wiſdom, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption, from all eternity; and as ſuch, 'the righteous are had in everlaſting remembrance,' (Pſ. cxii. 6) when the very 'name of the wicked ſhall rot.' The pardon of ſin is often mentioned by a non-remembrance of it: <q>I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſſes, and their ſins and iniquities I will remember no more.</q> Jer. xxxi. 34. That is, I will blot them out of the book of my remembrance, for my dear Son's ſake; and they ſhall come into my mind no more, nor ever appear before me as an aggravation; nor before my people to their condemnation; and, if they are ſought for, they ſhall not be found, for there ſhall be none. But though the righteous are <q>to be had in everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; </q> (Pſalm cxii. 6) yet there are ſome that he never will remember; that is, he never will remember them 'with the favour that he bears to his own people,' (Pſ. cvi. 4) but forget them. <q>Therefore, behold I, even I, will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forget you, and I will forſake you, and the city that I gave to your fathers, and caſt you out of my preſence: and I will bring an everlaſting reproach upon you, and a perpetual ſhame, which ſhall not be forgotten.</q> Jer. xxiii. 39, 40. Utterly to forget a man is to ſhew him no favour: <q>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no favour.</q> Iſa. xxvii. 11. The ſins of ſuch men were never blotted out by the blood of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030610_0045_0FE8311AA10FCE60"/>Chriſt, and therefore muſt ſtand upon the book of God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance againſt them forever. <q>The ſin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; it is graven upon the table of their heart, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the horns of your altar. The Lord hath ſworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</q> Amos viii. 7. If the name of the wicked ſhall rot, and God will utterly forget them with reſpect to either fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or mercy; and if the ſins of ſuch are to ſtand upon the book of his remembrance forever, unpardoned and unblotted out by the blood of Chriſt; and this confirmed by the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn oath of God, by the excellency of Jacob, which is God himſelf; then it muſt follow that <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſixth impediment that lies in the way of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſtoration is, that 'the great atonement of Chriſt <hi>does not, ſhall not,</hi> yea, <hi>cannot</hi> reach them;' and <q>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion;</q> and Chriſt did not die for every individual of mankind. <q>He gave his life a ranſom for many;</q> yea, for <hi>all the elect,</hi> to be teſtified in due time. But it is not, it never was and it never will be teſtified to <hi>all mankind.</hi> Chriſt ranſoms <hi>bis elect</hi> from the curſe of the law, from ſpiritual and eternal death, from temporal death as a penal evil, and from the power of the grave; yea, and from this dreadful pit mentioned in my text. <q>Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a ranſom.</q> Job xxxiii. 24. But, although this ranſom is the procuring cauſe of God's elect being delivered from going down into the pit, yet it never did, nor ever will, deliver one ſinner from the pit that goes into it, when once <q>judgment and juſtice take hold on him Becauſe there is wrath, beware leſt he take thee away with his ſtroke, then a great ranſom cannot deliver thee.</q> Job xxxvi. 17, 18. And, if this great ranſom cannot deliver them, then there can be no other gaol delivery for the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than that which lies in the whims of Mr. Wincheſter, who knows <hi>neither the ſcriptures nor the power of God. They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The ſeventh particular that militates againſt this jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee of devils is, that Chriſt himſelf keeps the keys both of hell and of death, as well as the keys of the houſe of David: and as they become no hand but his, ſo he will never truſt either the pope or Mr. Wincheſter with them. It is he that admits all his elect into his own houſehold; he ſhut N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="8">8. The eighth impediment in the way of this univerſal gaol delivery is, the inviolable oath and veracity of God. <q>There are two immutable things in which it is impoſſible for God to lie.</q> In the behalf of God's elect they are brought in to uncourage the ſtrongeſt aſſurance, and, to eſtabliſh an ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlaſting conſolation. To theſe God ſhews the immutabilty of his counſel, confirmed by an oath. Heb. vi. 17. And there is an awful denunciation, confirmed by oath againſt the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which divine reracity muſt make good; for <q>God is not man that he ſhould lie, nor the ſon of man that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? hath he ſpoken, and ſhall he not make it good?</q> Num. xxiii. 19. <q>In that day will I perform againſt Eli all things which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning his houſe; when I begin I will alſo make an end: for I have told him that I will judge his houſe forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for the iniquity which he knoweth, becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not; and therefore I have ſworn <hi>(juravi)</hi> unto the houſe of Eli, that the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Eli's houſe ſhall not be purged by ſacrifice nor offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forever.</q> 1 Sam. iii, 14. Such deſperate and willful ſinners as theſe find no ſacrifice for ſin; a great ranſom can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver them; they ſhall not be purged either with ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or offering forever; and God has ſworn to it; therefore <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>

He is an utter ſtranger to the fall of man, to his own depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the ſpirituality of the law, to the terrible majeſty of the Moſt high, and to all ſcripture and the power of God: what he knows he knows naturally, and in theſe things he corrupts himſelf. But God is in honor bound to ſtop the mouth of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery gainſayer, to vindicate his own truth, and expoſe every liar, and to deſtroy every falſe prophet. <q>And if the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et be deceived when he hath ſpoken a thing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will ſtretch out my hand upon him, and I will deſtroy him from the midſt of my people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and they ſhall bear the puniſhment of their iniquity; the puniſhment of the prophet ſhall even be as the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p n="21">21. <q>The law is made for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for ungodly, and for ſinners;</q> it is their law and their rule; and there is nothing in that law under which the ſinner lives and under which he dies, that has the leaſt tendency to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, nor affords the leaſt encouragement to expect it; but all the reverſe: it reveals ſin, and ſtirs it up; it makes the offence abound, and ſin become exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it is the ſtrength of ſin; and the motions of ſin, which are by the law (that is, which are by the law diſcovered, and by the law forbidden,) work in the ſinner's members to bring forth fruit unto death; and this fruit will ever be brought forth in hell; the heart will ever conceive malice againſt God, and the mouth will bring forth its blaſphemy: for the law worketh wrath in this world, and how much more in hell! If the apprehenſion of its curſe works diſtraction and madneſs, what will the execution of its ſentence do? Wrath, hatred, enmity, deſperation, and rebellion, are ſadly ſtirred up in the awakened ſinner, who is ordained to life, by the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings it gives, the bondage it communicates, and the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance it reveals. The wages of ſin, which the law gives, is eternal death. This raiſes the mind of the ſinner to hate God, and all that is good. <q>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God; it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor can be.</q> And by the law this enmity never was, nor ever ſhall be, ſlain; nor is there any reconciliation offered in it; nor ſhall any ever be effected by it; and therefore the wrath that the law reveals, and works ſhall never be removed from the wicked; nor ſhall the vail, that is upon the heart of the ſinner that dies under the law, ever be removed either. The rich man in hell is as ignorant of ſalvation by Chriſt, which was propheſied by Moſes and the prophets, as ever he was. <q>Nay, father Abraham, but, if one went unto them from the dead, they would repent.</q> No, ſays Abraham; <q>if they believe not Moſes and the prophets, neither will they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead.</q> Luke xvi. 30, 31. So ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant are they, that in the dreadful day of God they will
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030610_0056_0FE8312C2A2882D0"/>pray to the rocks and mountains to fall on them; and at the very bar of God they will plead their own merit, though ſome of their ſouls will then have been in hell five or ſix thouſand years. <q>When ſaw we thee an hungred, and fed thee not? thirſty, and gave thee no drink? naked and clothed thee not? ſick, or in priſon, and viſited thee not?</q> And others will knock, and expect to enter the gueſt chamber, without either grace in their hearts or any righteouſneſs on their ſouls; and when they are condemned they will fret themſelves, and curſe both their King and their God, and ſo continue for ever and ever: for the law ſhall never be repealed, nor its ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ever be recalled; nor can the law ever work any thing in them but indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh. And, as to the covenant of grace, it never was made with any but Chriſt, and his ſeed, and his ſeed's feed. By <hi>Chriſt's ſeed</hi> is meant his children, who are called; and by his <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's ſeed</hi> is meant their converts, not hypocrites: for miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters do not beget goats thro' the goſpel, but they beget their own likeneſs. Their ſeed or converts, partake of their grace, which Chriſt communicates by their inſtrumentality. Grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt; theſe two always go together; but <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>

Nor is there any thing in the fiery torments of hell of a humbling, ſoftning nature, any more than there is in the fight of a gallows to a criminal who is going for execution; nor is there any thing in hell torments of a purging or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nature, any more than there is in lying on the ſtones in the cells of Newgate, to the keeping of a man clean, comely, and healthy. It is not intended to purge, but to puniſh.— The devils, who have been a hell to themſelves, and have been filled with dreadful torments for ſome thouſand years, are as foul, filthy, and unclean as ever. They are full of all miſchief, malice, cunning, deceit, guile, hypocriſy, and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; as unhumbled, unſanctified, unrelenting, and as rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and impenitent, as ever; and ſo deſperate againſt God as to to tempt awakened ſinners to curſe him: witneſs Job, Paul, Solomon, and others. And in the great day the devil will make ſinners do it; and in this malice they will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. And ſo ungrateful is the devil, that he torments them the moſt who are the greateſt friends to his intereſt; witneſs Judas, Saul, and Haman. Nor will he ever give Wincheſter one tribute of praiſe for all the pains he has taken about his reſtoration. It was Satan who ſet the ſons of Sceva to abuſe

And Mr. Wincheſter will get little more for all the favour and friendſhip that he has ſhewn to ſatan. Theſe ſpirits will never be humbled, nor reconciled; nor will the flames of hell ever purge them. Nothing can cleanſe them from ſin but the blood of Chriſt; and that is wholly confined to the elect, to the houſe of David, to Jeruſalem, to mount Zion, and to the remnant whom the Lord ſhall call.— Nothing can reconcile a rebel but the love of God; but the wicked are children of wrath.

Whatſoever God promiſes to do for a people, he has appointed prayer to be the mean of bringing it to paſs.— <q>Thus ſaith the Lord, I will yet be inquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</q> Ezek. xxxvi. 37. Let the things be whatever they may, they are all to be fetched in by prayer and ſupplication. Now, if Mr. Wincheſter does not make prayers, ſupplications, interceſſions, and giving of thanks, for reprobates, devils, and damned ſinners, and all his dear friends in hell, that his doctrine may reach them, and be fulfilled in them—he either does not in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his own doctrine, or elſe his conſcience ſo laſhes him for his lies, that he dare not pray to God for the fulfilment of his miniſtry. When God was about to bring Iſrael out of Egypt the Spirit of prayer was poured forth. What I am warranted to preach I have a warrant to pray for. But, if we have no warrant to pray for them, we have none to preach to them. And ſure I am that ſuch interceſſors muſt pray againſt the decree of God, the truth of God, the exiſtence of God, the law of God, the holineſs of God, and the immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of God: and who againſt theſe can be heard? Now we have no warrant to intercede with God for devils, no grant to pray for the damned, nor for the murderers of ſaints— only <q>that God would avenge the blood of his ſervants on
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030610_0059_0FE831398C66AAD8"/>them who ſhed it.</q> We are to pray for all men in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we may live a peaceable life; but not for the ſalvation of all men. Chriſt prayed not for the world: not are we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſo much as to pray for ſuch as bear <hi>the evident tokens of perdition,</hi> or of the <hi>unpardonable ſin.</hi> 
               <q>There is a ſin unto death, I do not ſay that ye ſhall pray for it,</q> 1 John v. 16. And the reaſon is, becauſe the pardon is never to be granted.—Nor does the Spirit ever help the infirmities of a child of God, at a throne of grace, for any perſon that is dead, though the neareſt and deareſt friend he ever had: for he believes in his heart that the die is immediately caſt upon the death of the perſon, and the doom forever fixed, and that prayer will then avail nothing. And in this I can appeal to the experience of all good men who are taught of God. David wept, faſted, and prayed for the child, as long as life laſted; but when it was dead he left off. 2 Sam. xii. 22. His prayer would not bring the child back to life; much leſs will prayer bring a ſoul from hell to heaven. Now, if we are not even in this world to pray for an unpardonable ſinner, are we to pray for him when in the bottomleſs pit? Purgatory, and ſalvation from it, and prayers for the dead and damned, are not from Chriſt, but from antichriſt. The notion was invented by Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Pythagoras, &amp;c. it was adopted by the pope for gain, and is ſupported and defended by Mr. Wincheſter as his laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge from the ſtorm. But for my part, I ſhall never have any opinion of Mr. Wincheſter's ſincerity, in his doctrine of univerſal reſtoration, unleſs he adopts the maſs, abſolution, extreme anction, prayers and paternoſters for the dead; for all theſe things are inſeparably connected with purgatory, and reſtoration from thence. <hi>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>

            <p n="26">26. The doubtfulneſs of Mr Wincheſter's miſſion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Chriſt to preach this doctrine is another entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement upon his ſyſtem. When Chriſt ſent his apoſtles out he endued them with power from on high; filled them with the Holy Ghoſt; armed them with grace and truth; and bid them preach the goſpel to every creature; and that he that believed ſhould be ſaved, and he that believed not ſhould be damned. All whom by their miniſtry they bound on earth, in heaven were bound; and all whom they looſed on earth, in heaven were looſed. They were to ſeek the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the elected ſubjects of it; to ſeek the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and the ſons ordained to peace among the Gentiles; and to <q>endure all things for the elect's
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030610_0060_0FE8313B131479C8"/>ſake, that they might obtain the ſalvation that is in Chriſt Jeſus, with eternal glory.' And Paul was ſent 'to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan to God, that they might receive the forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itance among them that are ſanctified by faith that is in Chriſt.</q> But there is not a word about the ſalvation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and reprobates in all their commiſſions. They were not to convert men from natural darkneſs to utter darkneſs; nor from truth into the law of nature to the lies of ſatan; nor from hell to heaven; nor were they ſent to turn ſin from ſatan, nor ſatan to God; much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>ſcriptural mark</hi> of a miniſter of ſatan, and this <hi>awful wo</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, militate hard againſt Mr. Wincheſter as an ambaſſador.

But how are we to try Mr. Wincheſter? His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is to reprobates, devils, and damned ſinners; and their reſtoration from everlaſting burnings is the ſubject of it. But then how are we to get a ſight of the ſeals of his apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? All that ever deſcended into hell are there ſtill: there is not one of all theſe that has ever appeared as a living wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the truth of this doctrine—not one of theſe that has been made a partaker of his grace—not one has ever appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear witneſs of his univerſal charity before the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es—not one <hi>living epiſtle</hi> for Mr. Wincheſter's reſtoration is to be found is heaven or earth, nor indeed are they to appear until time is no more.

The pious profeſſors who embrace this <hi>lie</hi> for want of ſhelter, are perſons made ſenſible that they have no part in Chriſt, and who are driven from every claim upon God by the force of truth and conſcience; whilſt, by hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under ſuch falſehood, they tacitly acknowledge that all their former pretenſins to faith in Chriſt Jeſus, to a ſpiritual birth, converſion to God, and adoption into his family, were nothing but falſehood, and their whole profeſſion nothing but deceit and hypocriſy. None but ſuch profeſſors as theſe have any call to 'make their bed in hell,' (Pſ. cxxxix. 8) or to ſcrape any acquaintance with devils.

            <p n="34">34. There are three characters in this world that cannot embrace Mr. Wincheſter's lie. And they are theſe: the ſoul that is born from above, made free by the truth and who ſtands complete in Chriſt; the next is a ſinner alarmed, awakened, convinced, and convicted by the word and Spirit of God; and the third is ſuch an one as Spira, a man ſhut up in deſpair, or given up to a fearful looking for of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

It is arguing againſt the Saviour's oath, <q>who ſwears by him that liveth for ever and ever, that time ſhall be no more.</q> Rev. x. 6. Mr. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter cannot fix the period when this reſtoration is to take place. It cannot be at the end of the millennium, for then the ſouls and bodies of all the wicked deſcend into hell.—To fix the time is impoſſible.

            </p>
            <p n="36">36. The unwarrantable liberty that Mr. Wincheſter has taken with God, and his word, proves him to be a blind, hardened, arrogant, preſumptions man. God will not have hardened reprobates thruſt into his covenant, nor baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards and children of the devil palmed upon him. Chriſt has delivered theſe into other hands. <q>Ye are of your father the devil.</q> And who, but Mr. Wincheſter, would thruſt Cain, Eſau, Judas, and devils, into the <hi>brotherly covenant,</hi> (Amos i. 9) and mix them among the fraternity of Chriſt? The bond woman and her children, Jezebel the propheteſs, the witch of Endor, and the whore of Babylon, are all brought into the Saviour's <hi>green bed,</hi> (Song i. 16) and put together with his bride, <q>his undefiled, who is but one, the choſen daughter of God, the only one of her mother, and the choice one of her that bare her.</q> Song vi. 9. This daring inſolence will never go unreſented, nor unpuniſhed. God will avenge himſelf of his enemies, and eaſe himſelf of ſuch a company of adverſaries as theſe; for <q>without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</q> nor ſhall the Spirit of truth ever be communicated to ſanctify the damned; for <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. Man Mr. Wincheſter aſſign any reaſon that is peculiar to faith, or any natural reaſon that is common to man, why Chriſt ſhould be ſet forth for a ſign that ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt; Why he ſhould be deſpiſed and rejected of men,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030610_0067_0FE831582BDEF118"/>the ſcorn of the world, and the ſtumbling block of the wicked? and why they ſhould be eternally bleſſed, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould not be offended in him?—Why he ſhould be called a deceiver, a fellow, yea, Beelzebub the devil; and his followers be hated of all men for his name's ſake? and why they who reſiſted theſe enemies unto blood ſhould be owned and honoured before the angels of God; while ſuch as were awed by them, and became fearful of their rage, ſhould be the <hi>firſt rank</hi> that ſhould <hi>march</hi> to hell?—Why the wicked ſhould curſe both their King and their God in the day of judgment, when their reſtoration is drawing ſo nigh; and at the ſame time this Saviour, who is their ſtumbling block and rock of offence, againſt whom all their indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is leveiled, ſhould be their only ſavious, and their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſtorer? Some impreſſions of the future puniſhments and promiſed rewards of God have ever been deeply ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the minds of the children of men, however leſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft, rude, or uncultivated, they may have been. Hence we read, among the heathen writers, of the gulph of Tartarus, or hell, Orcus, or Hades; of Pluto's cave; of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rivers, Cocytus, Acheron, Styx, and Phlogethon; of harpies, gorgons, hydras, and furies (intimating perhaps the horrors of a guilty mind); and the puniſhments of Ix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, Tantalus, Syſiphus, and others. We read alſo of the Elyſian plains, the happy abodes of the juſt after death; and of a particular number ordained by fate for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. So Virgil writes of "a choice ſelected few," and of the "choſen few who gain Elyſium." But there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that even the heathens believed in the reſtoration of all the condemned criminals in hell; ſuch as Cacus, Syſiphus, Tantalus, Ixion, the Titans, the Belides, &amp;c. We do not read of any purifications by fire, wind, or water, paſſing, or to paſs, upon theſe; that ſeems entirely confined to "the choſen few," to qualify them for Elyſium. The idea of univerſal reſtoration was never by God implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in nature, nor was it ever revealed by grace.</p>
            <p>Plato, the heathen philoſopher, circulated this purgation by fire, and reſtoration from hell, three hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt; and Origen, according to the account of the learned, was the firſt that brought it into the chriſtian church. But then the heathens worſhipped devils, not God; and theſe our Gentile <hi>fathers inherited lies,</hi> (Jer. xvi. 19) and this is one; for <hi>they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>

Nor can any reaſon be aſſigned why the devils ſhould have ſuch an inveterate hatred to Chriſt, if he is the great reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of them; nor why Satan ſhould from age to age tempt the Children of Chriſt, as he did Job to blaſpheme; Peter, and numbers more, to deny him; nor why he ſhould ſtir up princes to oppoſe him and murder his children, and the Pope and Mahomet to revile him; Simon Magus, and the judaizing teachers, atheiſts, deiſts, Socinians, Arians, and Arminians, to oppoſe and traduce him; to ſeduce and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead his followers; to attempt to weaken his intereſt and deſtroy his kingdom. No reaſon can be aſſigned for all this malice of devils, if Chriſt is their great benefactor; nor can any reaſon be aſſigned why the devil ſhould ſeek the death and deſtruction of Chriſt, from the manger to the croſs; nor why he ſhould tempt the Lord to ſelf murder, and to worſhip him; nor why he ſhould ſtir up the Jews to crucify him, and bring him under the curſe of God. Had all their ſchemes ſucceeded, their reſtoration muſt have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried. In all theſe things Satan muſt be divided againſt himſelf; unleſs it can be ſuppoſed that Mr. Wincheſter, and none elſe, is in this ſecret. But the truth of the matter is, the devil's faith is firmly fixed in the everlaſting curſe and wrath of God; and therefore he aſked Chriſt if he was come to torment him before the time. In theſe things the devils believe, and tremble; and in this the devil is right, and Mr. Wincheſter wrong; for <hi>they that go down to the pit cannot hope for thy truth,</hi>

In all other pits <hi>there is hope,</hi> but in this mentioned in my text <hi>there is none.</hi> There is hope in the horrible pit, for many have been brought out of <hi>that;</hi> and there is hope in the grave; the duſt of the ſaints ſhall reſt in hope; but in <hi>the bottomleſs pit</hi> there is none.</p>
            <p>The eternal exiſtence of Chriſt, and the eternal chains of the devils, bear one and the ſame date. The everlaſting ſtate of the juſt, and that of the wicked in hell, bear one and the ſame date. And both are fixed by the word of God and by his inviolable oath; which are 'two immutable 'things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lie.' <hi>They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</hi>
