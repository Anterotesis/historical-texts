            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO commemorate the <hi>Nineteenth of April,</hi> 1775, when this diſtreſſing war began—To ſympathize with the friends of thoſe who fell the firſt victims to <hi>Britiſh tyranny</hi> in this place —To acknowledge the <hi>help of the Lord,</hi> which we have experienced in the courſe of the diſpute— And, to encourage our truſt in God to perfect what is lacking, are, no doubt, among the deſigns of this <hi>Anniverſary</hi>: Which are juſtified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by antient uſages, and the expreſs command of God to paſt ages upon ſimilar occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. For, if we look back upon the annals of time, and critically obſerve the conduct of divine providence in the various ages of the world, we ſhall find God has not leſt himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016685_0004_0F9D77D5627AB4B8"/>
but has been doing good, filling the hearts of men with gladneſs. And both before and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> diſpenſation, as well as in goſpel times, when God deſigned to perpetuate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any peculiar <hi>period</hi> of time—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>event</hi> in providence, or extraordinary <hi>ſalvation</hi> wrought for his people,—He erected, or ordered monuments to be erected, as ſtanding witneſſes or monitors to mankind of their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefor.—Thus, the <hi>ſeventh day ſabbath,</hi> was inſtituted by God as a day of <hi>reſt</hi> in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al remembrance of the creation of the world, as the <hi>chriſtian-ſabbath,</hi> was ſince in remembrance of Chriſt's <hi>glorious reſurrection</hi> from the dead.</p>
            <p>THUS it is the declared deſign of the holy <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> to keep alive the <hi>deſign</hi> and <hi>agonies</hi> of his death, who was ſacrificed for us—as a witneſs and monument of that great ſalvation which the whole world have reaſon to rejoice in. The <hi>paſſover</hi> was inſtituted and obſerved, as a <hi>ſtanding memorial</hi> of the departure of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt. Pentecoſt,</hi> to admoniſh of the reality and time of the law's being given on <hi>Sinai.</hi> The <hi>feaſt of Tabernacles,</hi> as a memorial that the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites dwelt in tents in the wilderneſs. Thus, the <hi>Stone</hi> at <hi>Bethel</hi> was ſet up, as a <hi>continual memorial</hi> of that extraordinary revelation to <hi>Jacob</hi> in his way to <hi>Padan-Aram.</hi> Thus again, the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or heap of ſtones called <hi>Gilead</hi> was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the covenant between <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> And thus you remember, that the <hi>heap of ſtones</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and the <hi>pile</hi> erected in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016685_0005_0F9D77D62403A290"/>
               <hi>Gilgal,</hi> were ſtanding memorials, to the preſent and ſucceeding generations, of the wonderful <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> wrought for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in carrying them thro' thoſe waters, <hi>dry ſhod.</hi> And, of the like nature and deſign was the <hi>ſtone</hi> which <hi>Samuel</hi> ſet up by the name of <hi>Ebenezer</hi> to keep alive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a <hi>great ſalvation,</hi> wrought for them in their ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> And this ſalvation will appear more worthy of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, if we conſider ſome peculiar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by which it was preceeded. The <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who came early into <hi>Paleſtine</hi> were a powerful people, even in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time: And, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the conqueſts of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> they greatly oppreſſed Iſrael ſince, under the <hi>Judges,</hi> under <hi>Saul,</hi> and in the beginning of <hi>David</hi>'s reign. In particular we have mention made (in 4<hi>th Chap.</hi> of this Book) of two battles fought between <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines</hi>; in the firſt of which, <hi>Iſrael</hi> loſt the battle and had four thouſand men ſlain; upon which they conclude, and that juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the preſence of the Lord was not with them: They, therefore, ſend for the <hi>Ark</hi> of God, truſting in the token of his preſence, rather than in the power of his arm; hence they loſe a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond battle when <hi>thirty thouſand fell,</hi> and the <hi>Ark</hi> of God, in which they truſted, was taken from them: Which ſhews that the external tokens of God's preſence afford no ſecurity.</p>
            <p>AFTER this, we find by our context, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> were bro't to an humble dependance on the ſtrength of the Lord; and therefore, intreat that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016685_0006_0F9D77D6E1C29400"/>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> would not ceaſe to pray for them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Samuel</hi> cried unto the Lord, and he heard him, and the Lord thundered with a great thunder that day upon the Philiſtines, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfitted them: And the men of Iſrael went out of Miſpeh and purſued them and ſmote them until they came to Bethear.</p>
            <p>Now this was ſo affecting to Samuel, and was ſo deſerving remembrance, that he erected a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſtone of Remembrance, and called it <hi>Ebenezer</hi> ſaying <hi>hitherto hath the Lord helped us. Samuel</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had prayed for the mercy, now upon the receipt of it, ſets up his <hi>Ebenezer</hi> as a memorial, that the ſalvation might be kept in everlaſting remembrance.——We have only then to conſider</p>
            <p>THE valuable purpoſes ſuch monuments ſerve — and</p>
            <p>THE frequent occaſion a merciful God has given his people to ſet them up — before we proceed to thoſe addreſſes which may finiſh the diſcourſe:</p>
            <p>FIRST then, as to the valuable purpoſes ſuch monuments and ſuch acknowledgments may ſerve—I would obſerve with reference to that of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT it was a perpetual remembrance of the <hi>diſtreſs</hi> Iſrael was in on that day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016685_0007_0F9D77D81A982AA0"/>SALVATION is a relative term, and it is almoſt impoſſible to ſeperate the idea of a people's or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's deliverance, from that of the miſery or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they were delivered from. "As the means of ſafety ſometimes awaken the idea of danger," ſo a memorial of a ſalvation is, at the ſame time, a memorial of the diſtreſs. Hence the monument that <hi>Samuel</hi> erected, pointed to that day of diſtreſs when the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were coming againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> again: Diſtreſs and confuſion greatly heighten'd by their former diſtreſſes when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and were ſlain by hundreds and thouſands; which had left ſuch an horror upon their minds, as was eaſily rouſed upon ſuch an appearance. Now then, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> heard at <hi>Miſpeh,</hi> that the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were coming again upon them, they were afraid—they were ſurprized and plunged in the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity with their ſudden and unexpected onſet; as this people have been upon a like occaſion — The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> attacked them in an inglorious and cowardly manner; when unarmed and in no poſture of defence; yea, when met together for repentance and prayer; as though they would mock their religion and their God both. And altho' the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> ſoon pay dear for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, yet the remembrance of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s diſtreſs on that day was never to be blotted out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS monument and confeſſion might teach humility and ſubmiſſion under diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. No words can be faller of humility and reſignation than thoſe that <hi>Samuel</hi> uttered upon
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016685_0008_0F9D77D8624E8820"/>
the occaſion—"hitherto hath the Lord helped us;" aſcribing all to God—not murmuring that he did not help before, when they were diſtreſſed and overcome; for he knew that God had not puniſhed them according to their deſerts, nor rewarded them according to their ſins: No, but notwithſtanding our former rebukes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments which we ſuffered for our ſin and idolatry; yet let us aſcribe the ſalvation of this day to God who has remembered mercy for us in the midſt of judgment. As tho' he had ſaid, "it is of the Lord's mercy we are not conſumed"— the Lord has not poured out the full vials of his indignation, but has made the wrath of man that is gone forth to praiſe him, and the remainder thereof he has reſtrained. Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy name be the glory of this ſalvation. For, we acknowledge in all that is bro't upon us, thou haſt puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities have deſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS monument was a mark and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's owning and bleſſing a particular truſt in him.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Iſrael</hi> had loſt the laſt battle mentioned before this, in which God ſo remarkably appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them; they were diſpoſed univerſally to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

that their help was not in falſe gods or in an arm of fleſh but only in the Lord of Hoſts; and perſuaded that <hi>Samuel</hi> was a powerful and prevalent interceſſor, like Jacob who had power with God and prevailed: They ſay to him, "ceaſe not to cry unto the Lord our God for us that he will ſave us out of the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines."</hi> They were very ſolicitous that <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould not ceaſe to pray for them.</p>
            <p>WHAT military preparations were needful to be made, they would undertake themſelves, but let <hi>Samuel</hi> continue, inſtant in prayer: Perhaps remembring that when <hi>Moſes</hi> did but let down his hand, ever ſo little, <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed.</p>
            <p>THIS particular prayerful truſt in the Lord, God accepted and bleſſed.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL could never be threatned more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, ſaith one, than at this time, when they were repenting and praying.

            <p>BUT God permitted them to do it, that he might have opportunity, immediately, of crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people's reformation with tokens of his favour. And of confirming the words of his <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> who had aſſured them that if they repented, God would deliver them out of the hand of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:016685_0010_0F9D77D9E20B7828"/>4. THIS monument was a conſtant memorial to them and their poſterity, of the <hi>obligations</hi> they were under to God for the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of that Day.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the imperfection of our memories; the ingratitude of our hearts; and the diverſions of a vain world; we are apt to have theſe deep impreſſions worn off, which are ſometimes made upon our minds, by the extraordinary providences of God, and remarkable deliverances of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from earthquakes or from enemies; either when he has made us to ſtand ſtill and ſee his ſalvation, or, when he has ſtrengthened us, and remarkably led us on to conqueſt.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſenſible of this, altho' he had no reaſon to doubt but <hi>Iſrael</hi> were properly affected for the preſent, yet tho't proper to erect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument that ſhould be a conſtant and perpetual monitor to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and their poſterity, that upon ſuch a day the Lord wrought great deliverance for them, which inferred an obligation of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and obedience on them and their poſterity; like what <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the twelve <hi>tribes,</hi>—"paſs over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midſt of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a ſtone upon his ſhoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Iſrael: That this may be a ſign among you that when your children aſk their fathers in time to come, ſaying, What mean ye by theſe ſtones? Then ye ſhall anſwer them, that the waters of Jordan were cut off be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016685_0011_0F9D77DAA2879980"/>
the ark of the covenant of the Lord, when it paſſed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off; and theſe ſtones ſhall be a memorial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of Iſrael forever." But a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of what? Not ſimply that ſuch a thing was done, but that they were bound to acknowledge the marvellous <hi>loving kindneſs</hi> and aſtoniſhing <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition</hi> of God therein. As often as they ſaw this monument they were reminded of God's goodneſs in their ſalvation; and it was a conſtant demand of their dutiful and thankful obedience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. SUCH a monument ſerved to admoniſh them of the neceſſity of relying on the Lord in every exigence for the future.</p>
            <p>THEY had been taught, by ſorrowful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the "race was not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong," yea that ſucceſs did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend the name and profeſſion of religion, or the external tokens of God's preſence, but a real, penitent truſt in him. And Samuel, at leaſt was ſenſible that one ſalvation did not enſure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor was even an earneſt of it, without the like truſt in God. The ſin that procured their defeat formerly being pardoned upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, the pardon was ſealed upon this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous victory, in the very ſame place, where they had before ſuffered loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, "hitherto hath the Lord helped us," which, at the ſame time that it expreſſes his thankfulneſs for what they had now received,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016685_0012_0F9D77DB6419E5C8"/>
expreſſes a doubt for the future. Hitherto, things have done well, but what God may yet do with us, we know not. This doubt, however, muſt ariſe from the fickleneſs, or inconſtancy of the people, and from a fear that they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their obedience and dependence on provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For, none could be more confident than <hi>Samuel</hi> was that this would aſſure them ſucceſs;— when he ſaid, before this ſalvation, "if ye do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord with all your hearts—and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and ſerve him only, he will deliver you out of the hands of the Philiſtines." So that this monument and inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taught the neceſſity of a truſt in God, in all future time, in every day of need.</p>
            <p>IF, theſe now, and ſuch like are the valuable ends ſuch monuments and ſuch inſcriptions ſerve:—how ſuitable muſt it be, in the next place, to conſider,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. How frequently God in his kind providence gives his people occaſion to erect them.</p>
            <p>AND indeed while we are looking on the various <hi>help of the Lord</hi> in time paſt; what ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it with reference to? And to what period of time ſhall we look back? Shall we conſider it with reference only to the preſent day of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſtreſs? Or, from the firſt ſettlement of the country? Or, from the earlieſt accounts of time? And more eſpecially with reference to the church of God? For, verily God has wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016685_0013_0F9D77DC21FF6E20"/>
for his people,—for their deliverance and help ever ſince he had a church in the world.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH, he has ſuffered enemies to riſe up and diſtreſs, yet not to deſtroy it. The burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſh has not been conſumed!</p>
            <p>AND with regard to the chriſtian church, he has founded it upon a rock, and promiſed that the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. And that promiſe ſhall ſtand in ſpite of all the powers of earth and the inviſible world. Every generation ſince, has had reaſon to praiſe God for his goodneſs herein, and every generation ſhall have reaſon to do it, as long as the ſun and moon ſhall endure.</p>
            <p>BUT then, how conſpicuous and wonderful has been <hi>the help of the Lord,</hi> in and ſince the firſt ſettlement of this country.</p>
            <p>LET us look back and conſider what a dreary wilderneſs this was, little more than a century and half ago; and realize what could induce our forefathers to exchange a rich, fruitful and long cultivated ſoil in their native land; for this, then, barren and howling wilderneſs; but the hope of exchanging, at the ſame time, tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for liberty and religion—the rights of men and liberty of conſcience.</p>
            <p>AND how viſible was the help of the Lord, in perfecting their plan and bringing it to effect —
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016685_0014_0F9D77DCE26A0730"/>
that when they had eſcaped the dangers of the ſea, being few in number and ſtrangers in the land, that the native <hi>Savages</hi> did not ſwallow them up quick.</p>
            <p>BUT that God, who could preſerve <hi>Daniel</hi> from the mercileſs jaws of hungry lions, preſerved theſe exiles from the power of this blood-thirſty people!</p>
            <p>WE got not the land by our own ſword, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did our own arm ſave us, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour unto us.</p>
            <p>GOD has driven out the heathen by little and little, and made room for this vine which is of his own right-hand's planting.</p>
            <p>AND, how often have we experienced the help of the Lord in the wars we have been engaged in with the <hi>natives</hi> and their <hi>French neighbours</hi>? What ſalvations have been wrought for us when in danger?</p>
            <p>WHAT deliverances in time of fear? How has God preſerved <hi>Americans</hi> from the ſword, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and peſtilence; and cauſed them greatly to increaſe; ſo that they are become comparatively a great people.</p>
            <p>AND in the courſe of the laſt war, the ſeat of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

heavy loſſes and ſpecial diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when it was manifeſt we greatly needed the help of the Lord: How did God, as it were, turn again our captivity; or, rather turn our mourning into joy? And by what a ſeries of ſucceſſes did the Lord deliver his people? And by what conqueſts over our enemies? When he gave them as duſt to our ſword and us driven ſtubble to our bow; cauſed them to lick the duſt—and us to ſet our feet upon their necks. Yea we were led from one ſucceſs and victory to another, by the powerful hand of the Lord of Hoſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til our conqueſt was finally ſo compleat; that, as it was tho't <hi>Engliſh America</hi> would be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, delivered from troubles of that ſort, which ſhe had been harraſſed with, from her firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That the bitterneſs of war was over in this land; that the ſnare was broken, and that we had, finally eſcaped.</p>
            <p>BUT, "the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth." What was in the womb of providence, and what deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in the right hand of the moſt high God, reſpecting us, we know not.</p>
            <p>HOW miſtaken have we been!—As David when he got rid of <hi>Saul</hi> and his family, had thoſe of his own houſe riſe up againſt him, who bro't him into new, and greater troubles, than he had before: So it has been with us, thoſe of our own houſe, as it were, have riſen up againſt us.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016685_0016_0F9D77DE61DC9FF8"/>OUR troubles now come from what we were <hi>once</hi> fond to call our parent ſtate; who have aſſumed and exerciſed an unconſtitutional, illegal, and unreaſonable authority over us: <note n="*" place="bottom">vid.

            </p>
            <p>BUT however in the midſt of all the deſigns of our enemies to diſtreſs and enſlave us, the help of the Lord has been very conſpicuous; and that in innumerable inſtances.</p>
            <p>A FEW of thoſe that are moſt obvious I ſhall mention. And it is obſervable, that, however ſecret and ſkulking the attack of our enemies was at laſt; yet it was happy that the fears of people had got previouſly alarmed; and the galling yoke of tyranny began to be ſo ſeverely felt, that, every denomination tho't it would ſoon be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and hence, were forced into a reſolution, to ſpend time and money, with their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, for the ſervice and in defence of the rights and privileges of their country.</p>
            <p>AND indeed what had become of us on the 19<hi>th of April,</hi> 1775. When men were called,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016685_0017_0F9D77DF9A8D87F8"/>
ſo ſuddenly, to buckle on their armour; if they had not proved it before; and if their had not been ſome previous care taken by the colonies to get equipt, and into an acquaintance with the uſe of arms and military exerciſes.—But as God prepared the way for <hi>Iſrael</hi> into Canaan— and for our forefathers into this land;—So did he for that critical day, by inſpiring people with a military ſpirit—diffuſing it thro' the province and land, in a greater degree than was ever known before; diſpoſing people of all ages and deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations (except ſuch as have been in oppoſition to all our meaſures) to prepare themſelves for the time, when the cloud (of war) ſhould break upon them.</p>
            <p>AND the <hi>help of the Lord</hi> was ſeen, afterward, in that, altho' our enemies meant it for evil (as it was an evil indeed to individuals) yet the Lord meant it for good; and made the horrid murders of that day, an occaſion of uniting the Colonies, beyond the expectation of the moſt confident whig. From that day, a determination was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to ſtand by each other in oppoſing tyranny and ſlavery then breaking in upon us like a ſtood.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, <hi>the help of the Lord</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, in the pity and benevolence of our ſiſter States to this Province, when bro't under unheard of oppreſſions; when they were diſpoſed to ſend in to us, all the aid they could, in that time of diſtreſs, not only by information and counſel,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016685_0018_0F9D77DFE202D920"/>
but in moſt liberal donations of money and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, for thoſe <hi>thouſands</hi> that by the cruelty of the <hi>Port Bill</hi> were cut off, from the uſual means of ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>help of the Lord</hi> was conſpicuous like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in that, when the exigency of our affairs, as was tho't, called for a ſuſpenſion of courts of juſtice, and ſo of the operation and execution of laws, when every man's life and property became expoſed to the lawleſs and violent; that there were ſuch remarkable reſtraints on the luſts and paſſions of men; as that it was tho't, by the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and obſerving, there were, at that time, fewer overt-acts and outrages puniſhable by law, than uſual.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER inſtance of <hi>the help of the Lord,</hi> worthy of notice is, that ſo many of that ſmall part of the community that were differently mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in political things from the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and who from principle, intereſt or prejudice, acted in oppoſition to the common cauſe, fled from the midſt of us in the beginning of our troubles.</p>
            <p>WHETHER the particular deſign of their flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the metropolis, was perſonal ſafety, as they pretended; or, for diſtinction and applauſe on the other ſide the water as others ſuppoſed: Yet we are convinced, from the conduct of thoſe that were left behind, that the removal of them
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016685_0019_0F9D77E0A2202138"/>
that went, has contributed much to our ſafety. And we never have had ſo much reaſon to wiſh them back again, as to wiſh others, of the ſame dangerous principles, with them. Deſigning men, among ourſelves, muſt be more dangerous to the community, than when joined with an open enemy.</p>
            <p>MORROVER, How plain was <hi>the help of the Lord,</hi> that the diſſolution of our General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly—the legiſlator of the Province, was, in ſo great a meaſure, remedied by a voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Congreſs, who tranſacted matters, with as much prudence, and to as good purpoſe, as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, under, our then, broken circumſtances.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, How evident has been <hi>the help of the Lord,</hi> in forming and aſſembling the <hi>Continental Congreſs,</hi>—the Grand Council of theſe United States, in oppoſition to the united wiſhes and joint endeavours of our enemies on the other ſide the Atlantic, and of their emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries here.</p>
            <p>AND indeed, <hi>the help of the Lord</hi> is not more to be taken notice of, in bringing that very <hi>reſpectable Aſſembly</hi> into being at firſt, than his bleſſing and preſence with them, ſince.</p>
            <p>HOW evidently, did God bleſs and direct them in the appointment of able Generals for our army, and eſpecially of his EXCELLENCY GE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERAL
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016685_0020_0F9D77E1640E6860"/>
WASHINGTON, the commander in chief, whoſe prudence, wiſdom, ſkill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage have all along been the envy of his enemies, and admiration of his friends.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, How plainly has <hi>the help of the Lord</hi> appeared in the many deliverances wro't for our army in one time of danger and another? What ſalvations, has God granted? What ſucceſſes, has he given them—in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances very remarkable indeed! Which have been mentioned before upon this anniverſary.</p>
            <p>LET us go on then, to mention <hi>the help of the Lord,</hi> in the ſuccours we received from foreign powers in warlike ſtores, &amp;c.— but eſpecially in that open, generous alliance formed between his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty,</hi> and the <hi>United States of America.</hi> Alſo the bleſſing and <hi>help of the Lord</hi> is great, in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the union of theſe States, when every method has been uſed both from within, and without our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to diſunite and weaken us. And we may reckon among the bleſſings of God, the remarkable health which has been generally enjoyed in the courſe of the war,—altho' ſome particular places have been viſited with ſickneſs. And alſo, that God has hitherto granted us proviſions for the ſupport of our armies. But the time would fail me, to mention the one half of the inſtances in which the help of the Lord has been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably experienced.—Surely if we add to what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016685_0021_0F9D77E222A86FC0"/>
has been mentioned, the goodneſs of God in continuing to us the privileges of the goſpel, it muſt be granted that we have reaſon to <hi>ſet up our Ebenezer and ſay, hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now, my friends, ſuch helps of the Lord, it becomes us to recognize upon this occaſion, even when met together to deprecate the horrors of war in general—the bloody ſcenes of this in particular—more eſpecially the inhuman murders that were committed in this place, when the <hi>Flames</hi> of <hi>War</hi> firſt broke out among us.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>day</hi> and this <hi>aſſembly</hi> are the memorial of the <hi>nineteenth of April,</hi> 1775.</p>
            <p>AND this is the place, where the bloody tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy begun.</p>
            <p>THIS very houſe is a monument of the violence and rage of our enemies! —and here, is the (<hi>Aceldama</hi> or) Field of Blood, where ſo many of our friends wallowed in their gore.— O dreadful day! O ſhocking event!</p>
            <p>INDEED ſuch as regard not a providence herein, may raſhly ſay, with Job, in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of his ſouls.—"Let that day be darkneſs, let not God regard it from above, neither let the light ſhine upon it. Let dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the ſhadow of death ſtain it, let a cloud
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016685_0022_0F9D77E2E40B9D88"/>
dwell upon it, let the blackneſs of the day terrify it."</p>
            <p>BUT we, rather, acknowledge the righteous hand of God,—and wiſh our bereaved friends, may hear the rod and who hath appointed it,— and acknowledge with us, the help of the Lord in that day, when God remembered mercy in the midſt of judgment.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the make of man—and ſuch the feelings of the human heart, eſpecially when under the aids of religion, as rendered impoſſible that we ſhould not ſympathize with you, my friends, in that day of uncommon diſtreſs.—But who could adopt the feelings of thoſe who ſaw their houſes in flames, and dwelling-places, by the malice of an enemy, ſinking into ruins?</p>
            <p>HOW much leſs, the piercing anguiſh of ſoul, which they endured, whoſe friends—Fathers— Huſbands or Children, were left breathleſs corpſes on the ground?</p>
            <p>SUCH a ſight, or ſuch tidings, in conſequence of the helliſh machinations of an enemy, muſt afflict the ſoul with the moſt ſtinging remorſe.</p>
            <p>FOR your ſupport, we have in our reſpective ſtations and capacities, moſt ardently prayed to God,—and with you we ſtill ſympathize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:016685_0023_0F9D77E3A20A62D0"/>BUT have you not even in the days of your mourning, experienced much <hi>of the help of the Lord?</hi>—the goodneſs of God in ſupporting you under your trials? In ſanctifying your bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? In wiping away your tears? So that you have reaſon to acknowledge "hitherto hath the Lord helped us." O then ſtill commit your way to God—caſt your burden upon him, "a father of the fatherleſs and a judge of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, is God in his holy habitation."</p>
            <p>BUT altho' my friends, your calamities made the firſt, and therefore the deepeſt impreſſions on our ſympathetic hearts: Yet how many hundred families? and how many thouſand ſouls, have ſince become your brethren in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs? diſtreſs attended with more aggravating circumſtances ſtill. For, as has been obſerved to you upon this occaſion, before; "your friends, altho' murdered by the enemy—ſleep quietly here, while others are lamenting the loſs of their friends, equally dear to them, whoſe bones are ſcattered at the grave's mouth, or have been inhumanly buried with the burial of an aſs, drawn and caſt forth."</p>
            <p>BUT beſide, how many have the deſolations of war, and wantonneſs of the enemy, ſtript of habitations, who have, now, no certain dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-places to hide their weeping eyes, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole their aching hearts.</p>
            <p>O, HOW are the miſeries of war to be deprecated!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:016685_0024_0F9D77E471B68830"/>FATHERS ſtooping for age, are bowed down more heavily, under the loſſes of ſons that were the ſupport of their years, and confidence of their grey heads. And widows, at this day, in tears, with their fatherleſs children around them cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for bread—a ſituation that muſt move the compaſſions of a ſtone! We muſt, then, mingle our tears with their's alſo, and divide our pity and prayers betwixt them and you— and muſt even requeſt you to join with us, in our moſt ardent cries to God—the father of mercies, that he would compaſſionate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of ſuch—ſanctify their ſorrows to them, and feed, cover and defend them, until theſe calamities are overpaſſed.</p>
            <p>I WOULD now turn a particular addreſs to the military companies, who appear in arms to aid and honor this ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>MY friends, it is owing to <hi>the help of the Lord.</hi>—to his ſparing diſtinguiſhing mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that you eſcaped, that day when your neighbours and fellow-ſoldiers ſlept in death! And while God has made their deaths an admonition to you to be ready—even for a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death yourſelves;—ſo to hear that the "voice of your brother's blood crieth to God from the ground."—It was here, by the permiſſion of providence, that an ideal war, was firſt converted into reality.— here the ſword was firſt drawn, and here the flames of war firſt broke out, which have ſince ſpread through the land.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:016685_0025_0F9D77E5A6FDA8B0"/>THE bravery and prudence, ſo conſpicuous in the militia of <hi>Lexington,</hi> on that alarming day, which we commemorate; have, I believe, met with univerſal approbation. And a deſire to avenge the blood of your ſlaughtered bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and defend your country, has led you to cultivate the art of war, and inſpired you with the ſpirit and reſolution of ſoldiers,—a character which the preſent times have taught us, is moſt reſpectable indeed. Soldiers are an order of men of as high importance as any at all: Yea, they are the very <hi>guardians</hi> of other orders, and one of the <hi>main pillars</hi> of the ſtate:—Soldiers when under the reſtraints of conſcience, and religious principles, ſhine, with as brilliant a character, and are as juſtly eſteemed as any ſet of men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>AND as God, in his providence, called you into the fore-front of danger, ſtrive to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in cultivating the neceſſary art of war. And as the war has ſpread from this place—from this place may military ſkill be diffuſed likewiſe. But, be concerned, eſpecially, to liſt under the Banner of Jeſus Chriſt, and purſue, with unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting diligence and care, your ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare—that ſo he, who is the Captain of your Salvation, may lead you to the compleat conqueſt of all your ſpiritual enemies—and into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>And NOW. I ſhall conclude, with a word to this whole aſſembly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:016685_0026_0F9D77E5E22E6D60"/>ALTHOUGH he that girdeth on the harneſs may not boaſt himſelf as he that putteth it off, —yet ſince God has thus far ſupported our cauſe, and granted us ſo many and ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful deliverances; ſo many ſalvations,—given us reaſon to ſay, <hi>hitherto hath the Lord helped us</hi>; can we diſhonor him, and ſo much debaſe our chriſtian character, as to diſtruſt the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his providence for the future? or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our ſins which have before incurred his anger? let us realize, that as it was our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that drawed down theſe judgments upon us, ſo it is ſin only that can ſeperate between us and our God for the future. "But, they that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed."—Truſt in him, then, at all times ye people, pour out your hearts before him, God is a refuge for us. He is able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat our Salvation from all our enemies.</p>
            <p>Truly it is yet a day of darkneſs—but, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart. Don't let us deſtroy ourſelves by our diſobedience and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God: But, may every order of men, conſider their ways, repent and turn from all their tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not prove our ruin.</p>
            <p>THE means of help, then, are ſo far in our own hands. When, therefore, individuals ſhall humble themſelves, and mourn for their Sins—
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016685_0027_0F9E1CB7F59170A0"/>
when the public ſhall become reformed—when the ſpirit of Chriſt ſhall reign in men's hearts— when ſinful practices ſhall be laid aſide, and the duties we owe to God and man ſhall be faithfully performed;—O then ſhall we have aſſurance of the removal of God's judgments— that wars will ceaſe to the ends of the earth— this world ſhall then become a paradiſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—then ſhall our light break forth as the morning, and our health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—our righteouſneſs ſhall go before us, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be our reer-ward.</p>
