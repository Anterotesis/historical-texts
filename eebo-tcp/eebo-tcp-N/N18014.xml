            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE <hi>been a reader of the uſeful publications for children with which the world abounds, till I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf inſpired with emulation, to devote my own leiſure hours to the ſame benevolent purpoſe, that ſo properly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the pens of many of my ſex. The ladies who are already engaged in furniſhing a ſucceſſion of books, fit for children in their</hi> early <hi>years, ſeem to ſtand in no need of an auxiliary; being poſſeſſed, both of talents, and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, equal to their laudable undertaking; nor do I wiſh to invade their province; but, as I obſerve, that theſe reſpectable writers content themſelves with conducting their pupils to a cerain period; I think I may with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> follow <hi>them, and offer ſome hints to young ladies preparatory to (what they are too apt to regard as the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of liberty) the time of their leaving ſchool; when numbers of unexperienced young perſons ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves capable of forming juſt opinions of people and things, and of regulating their own conduct.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With a view of preventing, in ſome degree, this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> SELF-CONFIDENCE, <hi>which naturally produces pride, impatient of controul, and various other intellectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities, I have projected a deſign of preſenting to the public, a few domeſtic ſcenes; calculated to ſhew, the happy effects of</hi> filial affection, ſweetneſs of temper, <hi>and</hi> ſteadineſs of mind, <hi>when exerciſed in the</hi> ſeaſon of YOUTH, <hi>towards either</hi> good <hi>or</hi> bad <hi>parents.</hi>

                     <hi>Were all perſons to diſcharge their duty to their offs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring, it would be</hi> unjuſt <hi>to exhibit, even fictitious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of parents in an unamiable light; and it certainly is commendable, in every one concerned in the education of children, to throw a veil over the imperfections of thoſe, whom nature and religion require to be honored and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But it muſt be acknowledged and lamended, that many parents indulge themſelves in faults, which are
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023336_0003_0FBEFF1474C458B8"/>
productive of much unhappineſs to their families <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> faults, which they an nor ſtrive to</hi> hide, <hi>and are therefore</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably <hi>diſcovered to their children; as ſoon as they are permitted to</hi> dwell <hi>under the paternal roof, from whence they are almoſt totally excluded, till they are old enough to diſtinguiſh characters: the effect of this is, that many an</hi> amiable <hi>girl, when ſhe returns from ſchool, where ſhe has been accuſtomed to practiſe regularity, and receive good inſtruction, is continually at a loſs how to act at home, where ſhe ſees nothing but</hi> idleneſs, diſſipation, paſſion <hi>and</hi> fretfulneſs; <hi>and conſequently through the inſinuations of ſervants, or the inconſiderate a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of</hi> young <hi>friends, may be induced to think that ſhe is</hi> excuſable <hi>for omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to pay attention and obedience to theſe, who neglect to act a parent's part. Would it not, therefore, be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent office, in thoſe who ſuperintend the education of</hi> female <hi>youth in particular,</hi> prudently <hi>to prepare them for the conflicts they may be engaged in, by ſtrongly inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the duty of a daughter in its almoſt extent; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing a per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ſion that their felicity principally depends on rectitude of their</hi> own <hi>conduct; that they may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified to bear, with dutiful ſubmiſſion, the many evils which the improper behavior of</hi> bad <hi>parents may expoſe them to; or learn to feel the comforts of their ſituation, of they are bleſſed with</hi> good <hi>ones?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>SECOND MARRIAGES, <hi>though in many caſes highly expedient, are frequently productive of family diſcord; for children are uſually, by ſome means or other, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt a mother-in-law; and diſinclined to obey or reſpect her. I have therefore fixed on this as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the preſent Volume; and have adapted the</hi> drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtyle, <hi>as moſt likely to engage attention.</hi>

apprehenſions, that the faults she perceived ariſing in their tempers would encreaſe for want of proper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. Whilſt I beheld her languiſhing with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I could not myſelf attend to their inſtruction; and the fatal ſtroke which deprived me of her for ever, totally diſqualified me for domeſtic duties; all I could do, was, to weep over my children. But I now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to baniſh unavailing ſorrow, and be again a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I will immediately introduce them to you, and may they improve the happy advantage I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them! but I fear your reception will not be very agreeable, as I underſtand, ſince my return, that my elder daughters are greatly diſpleaſed at my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. I thought to give them an agreeable ſurprize, by bringing you home as their mother, as they were once ſo affectionately attached to you.</p>

I am quite certain that Mrs. <hi>Sutton</hi> has ſet my maſter againſt poor little <hi>Charles</hi> already; for do you know, ladies, that for all the dear child cried as if he would break his heart to come to me, and I begged, as if I was begging for my life, that I might take him, my maſter would not let him? O! I hear him upon the ſtairs!</p>

I left them below, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought we could have no chat if they were by, for they are old enough to tell tales. For my part, I never will live nurſery maid again where there are children who can talk.

for my own intentions, to promote innocent cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs as much as poſſible. But, as I am very fond of regularity, ladies, I muſt beg leave to propoſe a little plan for the uſual diviſion of our time: early riſing is of the utmoſt conſequence, for nothing can be done ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually without that; I have always been accuſtomed to family prayers, after which, I hope, you will find an hour before breakfaſt for walking, if the weather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; it is my wiſh that all aſſemble at eight o'clock, and after breakfaſt is over I ſhall attend to domeſtic arrangements; in the mean time I hope you will apply to your various ſtudies, and by ten o'clock I ſhall be at your ſervice.</p>

Through her goodneſs I became a ſchool-fellow with Miſs H<hi>arris,</hi> who though her condition was rather an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating one, had a ſpirit ſo haughty, that ſhe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered over the whole ſchool, nor would Mrs. <hi>Bladon</hi> have ſuffered her to remain there, but out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to her Father, who was a ſubaltern officer, and had very little more than his pay, therefore almoſt ſtarved himſelf to place her in the ſituation he did.</p>

She was an only child, and had a very large fortune; but being bleſſed with a numerous family, and her huſband's circumſtances much reduced during the American war, he has at her deſire laid down his coach, given up his houſe in town, and they now reſide throughout the year in the country. All the day Mrs. <hi>Gower</hi> employs in her domeſtic duties, and in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning relaxes, by joining in, or promoting innocent amuſements with her children. I have heard her ſay, that when leading a dance with them, ſhe thinks her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happier, and more to be envied, than when ſhe

                           <p>My heart will break with joy; but for my late dear miſtreſs, ſorrow would long ago have ended my life. Sure the moſt wretched ſhould never deſpair, when good ſo conſtantly comes out of evil.</p>

Go into the little parlour, I will follow you; where I ſhall permit you to ſup with me, as all the young ladies have been in bed this hour; we will there talk over the accurrences of the day, and I ſhall relate to you ſeveral other little hiſtories that recur to my memory, which I flatter myſelf will confirm your hopes of gaining the affection of Mrs: <hi>Loveleſs</hi> and the Miſs <hi>Blombergs.</hi> For my own part, I am fully convinced, that <hi>when there are diſſenſions in mixed families, there are uſually faults on both ſides; and that if one party has but good ſence enough to yield, they may in time overcome both ill-nature and prejudice.</hi>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IN <hi>purſuance of the plan laid down in the former part of this little work, I now preſent my Readers with two additional</hi> Dramatic Pieces; <hi>in which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew, that a</hi> life of diſſipation is <hi>dreadful in its conſequences, as it puts a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is impoſſible, in the compaſs of ſo ſhort a work as the preſent, to place this important matter in its</hi> ſtrongest ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; <hi>neither can advice given in this, or any other mode, be expected to have due weight, unleſs enforced by parental</hi> authority <hi>and</hi> example; <hi>a proper exertion of the one, and circumſpection in regard to the other, would ſpare many mothers the ſorrow of ſeeing their blooming offspring ſink into untimely graves; and the bitter re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>rſe that moſt ſucceed</hi> [<hi>if any ſenſe of</hi> religion <hi>remains in the mind</hi>] <hi>for neglecting to prepare them for ſo awful a change.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Full of health and gaiety, young perſons, are apt to imagine their ſtrength equal to every exertion which their love of inſatiable pleaſure may require. They expoſe themſelves alternately to the exceſſes of</hi> heat <hi>and</hi> cold; <hi>they</hi> defy fatigue; <hi>they</hi> abridge <hi>themſelves of their</hi> reſt, <hi>or they take</hi> repoſe <hi>in thoſe hours, when the air, cleared from</hi> noxious vapours <hi>by the</hi> morning ſun, <hi>is full of</hi> invigorating freſhneſs; <hi>which would give ſtrength to their bodies, and improve the natural cheerfulneſs of their minds; not conſidering, that till their</hi> growth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, <hi>the utmoſt care is requiſite to</hi> eſtabliſh a good conſtitution. <hi>For ſuch imprudent irregularities, the</hi> inexperience <hi>and</hi> impetuoſity <hi>of</hi> youth <hi>may be admitted as an apology; but what can excuſe the</hi> mother <hi>who, frequently for</hi> her own gratification, <hi>leads on her</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>in ſo dangerous a career? Many inſtances does the preſent day afford, of perſons, who like Mrs.</hi> Loveleſs

encourage, <hi>nay</hi> cheriſh <hi>thoſe very faults, which it is their duty to</hi> eradicate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sorry I am to ſay, that ſuch</hi> reformations <hi>as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in theſe</hi> Dramatic Pieces, <hi>are not ſo much</hi> pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of what really happens in the world, <hi>as</hi> ideal repreſentations <hi>of ſuch as</hi> ought to take place; <hi>yet, I flatter myſelf, they will prove acceptable to mothers of another deſcription, and uſeful to thoſe for whom they are particularly deſigned; young ladies, whoſe</hi> ſchool-education is completed, <hi>and who are arrived at that period of their lives, when the inſtruction given them, ſhould have for its immediate object the cultivation of the</hi> Domeſtic Virtues, <hi>with a view to their filling, with propriety, the important offices of</hi> WIVES <hi>and</hi> MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERS.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Could the</hi> elder daughters of families <hi>be prevailed on to imitate, as far as opportunity admits, the example of the</hi> MATERNAL SISTER. <hi>they would certainly find the benefit of it in their own improvement, the increaſe of their parents affections, the attachment and reſpectfulneſs of their younger brothers and ſiſters, the eſteem of the world, and the bleſſing of Heaven.</hi>

                           <p>If I really poſſeſs the fortitude you kindly attribute to me, my dear friend, I am chiefly indebted for it to my honoured mother, who from the dawn of reaſon, ſtudied to ſtrengthen my mind to bear diſappointments; her kind endeavours were ſeconded by the arguments of my worthy governeſs; and at length, ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the conduct and precepts of my good aunt, during the two years I lived with her as her adopted daughter.

The one was, of a lady who had, amongſt ſeveral other <hi>fine</hi> children a ſon that was afflicted with fits from his birth, which had ſo impaired his faculties, that he was become an ideot. The poor miſerable object was ſuddenly taken off in one of his fits, whilſt we were viſiting at her houſe. His mother, inſtead of being thankful for ſo great a merry, threw herſelf into agonies of ſorrow, refuſed to be comforted, and uttered ſuch ſhocking expreſſions, as I cannot recollect without horror.</p>

when her only ſon, a promiſing youth of ſixteen, was ſeized with a frenzy fever, which put an end to his life in three days. My mother, who was her neareſt friend, prevailed on her to come to our houſe, in hope of giving her comfort; by which means, I had an opportunity of ſeeing the power of patient reſignation, in its full force. This excellent woman ſtruggled with her grief; ſhe opened her m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Parhaps, with the aſſiſtance of my good Mrs. <hi>Sutton,</hi> I may be a mean of concil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iating matters between you and your parents, if you will allow me to act as a mediatrix.</p>

Miſs <hi>Rawlins'</hi>s behaviour is a melancholy inſtance, among a thouſand others that might be produced, of the ill effects of indulging headſtrong paſſions. In vain does parental authority exert its influence over a mind reſolved to reſiſt it; the ear of the ſelf-willed is deaf to the kindeſt admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

What a rock have we eſcaped, my dear mamma, left, as we were, for a time, to our own guidance, or rather to the fatal influence of ſervants. How thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ought we to be, that our minds were not ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depraved, as to make us inſenſible of your kindneſs, and to prevent our ſeeing the advantages of obeying you, otherwiſe, we might have involved ourſelves in ſimilar diſtreſſes with this unfortunate young lady.</p>

                           <p>It is very true, my dear. But though I can by no mean acquit Miſs <hi>Rawlins,</hi> yet I muſt ſay, that ſhe has an excuſe which you could not have pleaded. Her mamma was the very reverſe of yours, and lived juſt long enough to ſtrengthen the weeds ſpringing in her child's mind, which was the proper buſineſs of mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal care to eradicate. The unfortunate prejudice, which in common with many other young people, Miſs <hi>Rawlins</hi> took up againſt a mother-in-law, prevented her liſtening to the admonitions of hers, which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſtubborneſs to ſuch pitch, that nothing but the miſeries ſhe has endured, could have evercome them.</p>

There it ſhould be my daily endeavour to reſtore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts you once enjoyed in it. My own deſiciencies will prevent my ſucceeding in my deſire of imitating the excellencies of <hi>Maria'</hi>s mother: but you ſhall find me dutiful to you, and affectionate to your child.</p>

                           <p>Mrs. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> madam, has ſo liberal a mind, that I am ſure ſhe retains no reſentment for behaviour, which proceeded from your not knowing her worth. I will engage to ſay, ſhe will be very ready to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your family in a houſe which ſhe left with regret; but I ſhall have a great loſs; you really commit cruel depredations upon me—What! rob me of <hi>two</hi> of my houſehold at once? I muſt have my revenge—and thus I will take it. Mrs. <hi>Benfield</hi> ſhall poſſitively ſupply the place of Mrs. <hi>Cartwright</hi> to me and Miſs <hi>Juliana,</hi> when ſhe is diſmiſſed by Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> ſhall be my gueſt.</p>

                           <p>I cannot comprehend your meaning, <hi>Jemima:</hi> the nurſe was well recommended, as I underſtood; and the child appeared to be in a very thriving ſtate when I laſt ſaw her.</p>

                           <p>She was greatly altered then indeed, ſir, when I found her; and I have reaſon to think would have periſhed through neglect and bad management, if I had not been fortunate enough to call on her as I did. You know, that nurſe's houſe is in the road from my aunt's hither, ſo affection led me to ſtop as I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, in order to ſee my little ſiſter: but what

was the ſurpriſe, both of my aunt and me, at finding the cottage door wide open, though expoſed to the cold eaſterly wind; the floor of the room wet; ſeveral panes in the caſements broken; and the dear little ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by lying in a cradle, as dirty as a beggar, crying in the moſt pitious manner imaginable? I approached the cradle with an agitation of mind not to be deſcribed, and took the dear little creature up; at the ſame time deſiring my aunt's maid, who accompanied us, to ſearch the houſe for the nurſe; but her ſearch was fruitleſs; at laſt, in the garden, ſhe found a boy of ſix years old, who, it ſeems had been left by his mother to rock the cradle; but who, tired of his employment, had eſcaped to play, and left her by herſelf.</p>

                           <p>On enquiring in the neighbourhood, we learnt, that this inhuman woman, who had undertaken to perform a mother's part made it a daily cuſtom to neglect her infant charge, that ſhe might range from houſe to houſe, hearing and relating idle tales, thoughtleſs of the dear babe's wants, unmindful of her own obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſo with my aunt's advice, I reſolved to take her home with me.</p>

                           <p>Say no more, <hi>Jemima,</hi> or I ſhall be ready to caſt reflections on your mother, who, if ſhe was not able to nurſe <hi>herſelf,</hi> ſhould at leaſt have been more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in the choice of a ſubſtitute. If ſhe would have done as I at firſt deſired her, and acted a mother's part by <hi>you</hi> her <hi>eldeſt,</hi> I have reaſon to think we ſhould have been a <hi>united happy family,</hi> for I once loved <hi>little children;</hi> and had <hi>mine</hi> been managed properly, ſhould have placed my delight in them: but alas! I have known no comfort with them. Whilſt at nurſe, they were ſo ſhy, there was no inviting them to come near one; and when they returned home, they were ſo

unmanageable I was glad to have them kept in the nurſery, and from thence ſent to ſchool as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But let me ſee the little ſufferer.

Can you bear the thoughts of leaving both your parents to ſet out on an adventure which may turn out contrary to your expectation? would it not be better to leave jewels, and other rich ornaments, to people whoſe rank in life require them to diſtinguiſh themſelves from their inferiors, by the ſplendour of their attire, and to enjoy with thankfulneſs the bleſſings you already poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs?</p>

My father's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences already exceed his income: his heart is weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down with care on this account. If we add to this oppreſſion, we ſhall perhaps ſee him ſink into the grave.

Whenever it was poſſible for mamma to bear the fatigue of dreſſing ſhe went out, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom took us with her, becauſe my papa objected to the expence attending our being introduced into the world; and not only to that, but really ſeemed to grudge mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for houſekeeping. This produced dreadful alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations between them.

Thanks to my dear aunt's care, thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are, I hope, ſo firmly rooted in my own mind, that I would on no conſideration, violate them.</p>

Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how you form <hi>confidential</hi> friendſhips with perſons of your own ſex and age; but be ſtill more circumſpect in regard to young gentleman; encourage no freedom under the idea of <hi>romping;</hi> neither lend a willing eat to <hi>compliment,</hi> which is in general, but another name for <hi>flattery</hi> Reſolve to carry on no <hi>clandeſline cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence:</hi> and in order to defend your heart againſt forming an improper attachment, fill up thoſe hours which you devote to reading, not with <hi>novels,</hi> but in the peruſal of ſuch books as will improve your mind.</p>

We took a little house in town: and had we underſtood domeſtic oeconomy, might have lived very comfortably; but inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling my aſſiduities at the law, I entirely neglected my ſtudies; and your mother having no judgment in reſpect to the expenditure of money, was liable to numberleſs impositions; this, added to a taſte for public diverſions, which we fooliſhly ſubſtituted for domeſtic pleaſures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved us in a variety of difficulties, [<hi>Miſs</hi> Clariſſa <hi>burſts into tears.</hi> My dear <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> why are you ſo greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected?</p>

                           <p>Well, my dear girls, I will haſten to a concluſion of my ſtory. To add to our embarraſſment a young family came on. I wiſhed your mother to nurſe you herſelf, <hi>Jemima;</hi> but ſome of her faſhionable acquaintance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded

her, that it would ruin her health, and confine her conſtantly at home, ſo ſhe was prevailed on to put you to nurſe. And thus was one of the greateſt delights in life, that of <hi>enjoying our children in their infancy,</hi> turned out of doors; for every ſucceeding child was, like you, conſigned to the care of a ſtranger; two we buried.</p>

                           <p>I doubt not, ſir, but that, notwithſtanding we were put to nurſe, both you and my dear mother had a great deal of care and trouble, as well as expence on our account.</p>

                           <p>We had indeed, my dear. After we had been married ſeven years, my elder brother died of a fever, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came my father's heir; he lived but ſix months after his ſon, and, with his dying breath, urged me to leave the idle courſe of life I was in, and paſs my time like a <hi>chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> I fully intended to obey him; but both your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and I found it difficult to ſhake off our old compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, who enticed us on from day to day, till having mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at command, we became more diſſipated than ever; fortunately, neither of us had any taſte for gaming, or we might have totally ruined our family. The events of this day have recalled to my mind my father's dying injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I am reſolved, though late to fultil.—O! my dear, my honored parent! how does my heart reproach me for ingratitude to your memory!</p>

                           <p>No, <hi>Clariſſa,</hi> my remorſe, though great, is not equal to my offences. <hi>Obedience to parents</hi> is one of the firſt of moral duties; no one can violate it without offending their <hi>heavenly Father,</hi> whoſe repreſentatives our <hi>earthly parents</hi> are to us. Nay, diſobedience naturally leads to the breach of other duties. Had I been a good ſon, and followed my father's early advice, which was to <hi>ſettle my principles, eſtabliſh a good character,</hi> and <hi>have a proſpect of providing for a family before I thought of marrying,</hi> I

                  <head>PREFACE</head>
                  <p>IN the firſt of thoſe <hi>Dramatic Pieces,</hi> which conſtitute the preſent volume, I have endeavoured to point out the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of <hi>pride,</hi> the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>humility,</hi> and the advantages which may be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the different acquirements of a liberal education, in <hi>a ſtate of adverſity.</hi> In the ſecond, an attempt is made to exhibit a ſtriking <hi>contraſt</hi> between the manners of a daughter, brought up under the tuition of a ſenſible and tender mother, and thoſe of a poor young creature, who is ſuppoſed to have been vaniſhed by a miſtaken parent to a foreign land, where ſhe waſted ſome of her moſt valuable years in the acquiſition of <hi>vanity, conceit</hi> and <hi>pertneſs,</hi> under the idea of <hi>politeneſs</hi> and <hi>refinement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is really wonderful to think, how parents can thus bring themſelves to ſend their children from under the eye of tenderneſs, and watchful ſolicitude? At <hi>nine</hi> or <hi>ten</hi> years of age, many girls are ſeparated from every relation or friend, who would kindly correct their growing errors, and are placed as boarders in <hi>convents.</hi> It is the intereſt of the Superiors to ſend the moſt flattering accounts of the diſpoſitions and improvements of thoſe committed to their care. The mother is naturally precluded from any knowledge of the real <hi>truth,</hi> neither can ſhe aſcertain the treatment which her child meets with, who is ſubimitted to the <hi>chance</hi> of becoming the object of <hi>ill-natured ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> without an affectionate friend to ſoothe her affliction, or redreſs her grievances. But theſe are trifling conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, in compariſon with a ſtill greater danger to which children, ſent for education to a <hi>catholic country,</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. That of imbibing the principles of an <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious religion;</hi> one great <hi>tenet</hi> of which is <hi>the merit of making converts.</hi> How then can it be expected, that the zealous profeſſors of it, with forbear employing their endeavours to bias thoſe tender minds which are
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:023336_0199_0FBEFB08B05F8F68"/>
thus expoſed to their deluſions? but allowing that the perſons entruſted with the children of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are <hi>true to their truſt:</hi> what better can be expected, than that their <hi>pupils</hi> return home without <hi>any religion at all?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having in this volume brought my work to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I muſt entreat my Readers to conſider it, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly intended for <hi>young ladies juſt entering into the world,</hi> who are ſuppoſed to be preparing themſelves for thoſe relations in life, which it is natural for them to look forward to. For <hi>their</hi> benefit only, have I been induced to bring forth to view, the <hi>faults of parents.</hi> I hope it will appear, from the execution of my plan, that nothing is farther from my deſign than the exciting in young fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male minds, <hi>premature thoughts</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>marriage;</hi> though I do not agree in opinion with many parents, who would on no account converſe on thoſe ſubjects with their daughters, till they are juſt entering the marriage ſtate. Under proper regulations they ought frequently to be referred to, ſo far, I mean, as is neceſſary to point out the errors which prove fatal to the happineſs of numbers, that young ladies may know, before they engage in the moſt important connections of life, the danger of <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per conduct;</hi> and be qualified when they have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of marrying with a good proſpect, and the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of their friends, to make a "well ordered home, their huſbands beſt delight."To inſtruct their children, govern their ſervants, and regulate their expences; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of fancying, as is too frequently the caſe with the <hi>modern fair,</hi> that when they leave ſchool they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to <hi>diſplay</hi> their <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>accompliſhments,</hi> to <hi>adorn their perſons,</hi> in order to gain admiration, and <hi>to run the giddy round of inceſſant amuſement.</hi> Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt be the man who calls ſuch an one his <hi>wiſe!</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable the lot of her <hi>neglected children<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

to return home, for I ſhall never be ſo happy again as I was with her. Mamma confines me and will not let me have a variety of fine cloaths.

young children. All her acquaintance of high rank for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook her; ſome few friends remained, but they were ſuch as you would call <hi>mean,</hi> becauſe they were not <hi>rich.</hi> Theſe ſolicited relief for her, from her huſband's former inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. They all turned a deaf ear, except one great lady, who offered to give her the run of her houſe, that is to <hi>feed her;</hi> in return for which, ſhe was to <hi>flatter</hi> her <hi>abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,</hi> and even her <hi>vices.</hi> Her children were to be put out to ſervice as they grew up. Mrs. <hi>Gates</hi> deſpiſed the <hi>offer</hi> and the <hi>offerer;</hi> and with the advice and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of her more humble friends, ſhe undertook her preſent employment, in which ſhe has happily ſucceeded, and is regarded, and reſpected by the <hi>good,</hi> whether of <hi>high</hi> or <hi>low</hi> degree. Mrs. <hi>Combs,</hi> who you know lives with Lady <hi>Harris,</hi> was reduced alſo by the extravagance of others; yet rather than undertake any thing like <hi>work,</hi> ſhe ſubmitted to become her ladyſhip's <hi>humble friend.</hi> You have often remarked the cruel treatment ſhe receives even before us, who viſit Lady <hi>Harris,</hi> merely on a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of formality. Now tell me, <hi>Matilda,</hi> which of theſe two perſons is the moſt <hi>reſpectable</hi> character and poſſeſſes the <hi>propereſt pride?</hi>
