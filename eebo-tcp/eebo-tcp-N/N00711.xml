            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>GOOD News from Heaven, the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited this undone world, after a Deluge of ſin and miſery, behold the bow in the Cloud; the Lord God hath made and eſtabliſhed a new Covenant, and this is it that hath caſt the firſt beam on the dark ſtate of loſt and fallen man; and hath brought life and immortality to light. This Covenant is <hi>the hope of Sinners, The Riches of Saints, the</hi> Magna Charta <hi>of the City of God.</hi> The forfeited Leaſe of eternity renewed; Gods Deed of Gift, wherein he hath on fair conditions, granted <hi>Sinners</hi> their lives, &amp; ſetled upon his <hi>Saints</hi> an everlaſting Inheritance.</p>
               <p>Hear, O ye forlorn Captives; who have ſold your ſelves to eternal bondage, ſpoiled your ſelves of all your glory, ſealed your ſelves up under everlaſting miſery; you are dead in your ſins, guilty before God, under wrath, under a curſe, bound over to eternal vengeance. But behold, there is yet hope in <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning this thing; the Lord God hath taken

compaſſion upon you, hath opened a way for you to eſcape out of all this miſery &amp; bondage; Lift up the hands that hang down, comfort the trembling knees; An Ark, an Ark hath God prepared, in which is ſalvation from the Flood; A Covenant, a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant hath he made and eſtabliſhed, which (if you lay hold on it) will recover all you have loſt, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome you from death, redeem you from Hell, and advance you to a more ſure and bleſſed condition, than your original ſtate from which you have fallen. This is the hope of ſinners; This is the Heritage of the ſervants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Glorious tydings, good news indeed! but what is this Covenant? or what is there that is given &amp; granted therein? Why, in ſum, there's all that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven &amp; earth can afford; all that can be needed or deſired: and this by a firm and irrevokable Deed, made over, and made ſure to all that will ſincerely embrace it.</p>

That's the great &amp; comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>I will be their God.</hi> I am God, and what I am, 'tis all theirs: my ſelf, my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incomprehenſible Eſſence, all my glorious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, my omnipotence, my omniſcience, my wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, my righteouſneſs, my holineſs, mine all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, my faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will make over my ſelf to them to be henceforth and for ever theirs:</p>

Sinners, what is there to be feared? what is there dreadful, but an angry provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God? Thence is ſorrow and anguiſh, thence is famine, and peſtilence, and ſword; thence is death and hell: he doth not know what the wrath of God means, that doth not ſee in the bowels of it, all the

plagues above ground, and all the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire. Whatever terrors, or torments have ſeized upon thee; upon thy body, upon thy ſoul; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſſes, croſſes, vexations, afflictions, plague thee on this earth; whatever honour, and anguiſh, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever amazing, confounding torments are like to meet thee, and feed upon thee in the lake beneath, thou mayeſt ſay of all this, <hi>This is the wrath of God.</hi> That day the Lord ſays to thee, <hi>Fury it not in me</hi>; he ſaith alſo, <hi>Fear ſhall be no more to thee.</hi> That hour the Lord ſaith, I am thy friend, Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Man was never intended to be a ſelf ſufficient; he was created under a neceſſity of dependance of ſomething without him; not only for the continuation of his being, but of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his being: he cannot live upon the air, though he hath ſcaped the fire: the ſoul of man is too big for all the world; like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, it can find no reſt below, and where ſhall it find it, or on what ſhall it ſubſiſt? Why God will not ſtarve his friends; he that hath ſaved their lives, will find them a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood; becauſe there is no other to be found, he himſelf will be a livelyhood to them; their portion, their maintenance, and their heritage for ever. As their deliverance is from him, ſo their dependance ſhall be on him; he is their ſubſtance, and on him

is their ſubſiſtence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16. he writes himſelf <hi>the porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jacob</hi>; and as ſuch his Saints accept him, Pſa. 16 5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine Inheritance</hi>; he is their bread, and their water, their ſtock and their ſtore. The Lord [Gives] portions to his enemies; not only the young Ravens, but the old Lions, and Tigers, the worſt of men do ſeek their meat from God, Pſal. 17.14. they have their <hi>portion in this life, whoſe bellies thou fillest with thy hid treaſure</hi>: they have their portion: ſome of them have their portion in the <hi>City,</hi> others a portion in the <hi>Field</hi>: to ſome he gives a portion of <hi>gold,</hi> to others a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>worldly glory,</hi> to others a portion of pleaſures; by all theſe he deals, as the father of the prodigal, he gives them their portion, and ſends them away. But whilſt he [gives] portions to theſe, he [is] the portion of his Saints, he makes over and ſettles himſelf upon them, as their inheritance for ever: they ſhall never be in want whilſt there is in him to ſupply them; they ſhall never be in ſtraits whilſt there is in him to relieve them: all their wants be upon me.</p>
               <p>The Lord is their Portion, and he is a ſufficient porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>With thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſa. 36. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſs,</hi> Pſal 16.

What a poor wretch wert thou once, when thou hadſt nothing but ſin, &amp; ſhame, and miſery, that thou couldſt call thine own? theſe thou mighteſt call thine, ſin was thine, woe was thine, death, and the grave, and the curſe, and the pit were thine own; but that was all thou hadſt; thy good things thou livaedſt upon had they been of never ſo great value, were none of thine; thine houſe, and thy lands are none of thine: thy gold, and thy ſilver, and thy ſubſtance are none of thine; they are all but borrowed, or committed to thee as a Steward, and all to be given up upon demand; and what thou haſt ſpent of them, thou muſt be brought to a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for; a poor wretch thou wert, and hadſt juſt nothing, all that thou hadſt was none of thine.</p>
               <p>But now God is thine own, all that he is, all that he has is thine; never couldſt thou lay ſuch a claim to any thing thou poſſeſſedſt; to houſe, or wife, or child, or body, or ſoul, as now thou mayeſt to thy God.

               <p>The comforts of the Croſs are often the ſweeteſt, and the fulleſt, that the Saints ever taſte on this ſide the crown. The firſt draught is often bitter; the <hi>green Croſs</hi> is heavy, and it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo. As it is with ſome Medicinal Waters, it works by its <hi>weight</hi>; it muſt be an heavy yoke that will tame an unruly neck; if it gall not, it will not heal; 'tis the ſmart of the rod that ſtills the Child. Think not your burthens will lie eaſie, when
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000857_0062_0FABB2D15BA295C0"/>
firſt laid on, and think not much if they do not The firſt conflict with Temptations, may put you to an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der brunt than you are aware. It muſt be ſo, that it may be for your good afterward. So my Phyſick will work, I am content it make me ſick. Tribulation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Patience; that it cannot do, unleſs it pains. It a obſervable that it is not ſaid, the Croſs worketh patience but the tribulation, the pinching of the Croſs, or the pain, the Croſs puts us to; this is patience, a quiet bearing that pain, which the fleſh when touched puts us to. When we [feel] the Thorns and the Nails, when the Iron enters into our <hi>ſouls,</hi> when it pricks and ſmarts, then it will work. The <hi>green croſs</hi> is heavy; a priſon, of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, will look uncouth at the firſt; but when your Lord comes in, and viſits you, then the ſweet the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure comes: and the more frowns at the threſhold, the more kiſſes you may expect afterwards; Chriſt doth not always meet his Saints in the Porch; the Devils Parlour, the inner Priſon, is his banquetting houſe; the Dungeon his Wine-cellar: there they drink and are ſatisfied. The Stocks, and the Rack, are the Organs that make them the ſweeteſt Muſick. Many a Saint hath been ſadly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at the firſt, hoping to meet with Chriſt at the door; but behold! a dreadful ſight; behold! ſin lieth at the door; all his ſins, all that ever he did againſt Chriſt, all his unthankfulneſs, unfaithfulneſs, unkindneſs, rebellion againſt his Lord, ſtand forth and ſtare him in the face. Chriſtians, beware of ſin now: it will meet you in the day of adverſity, the Croſs will tell you all that ever you did. <hi>I remember my faults this day</hi>; now I remember all my pleaſant things; my Sabbaths, my Ordinances, my Liberty, the dear ſociety I once enjoyed; but trifled and waſted away; O my pride and my wantonneſs, my I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs, my Earthlineſs, my Hypocriſie, wherefore are you come thus to affright and torment me? Lord, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000857_0063_0FABB2D2201EDAC8"/>
am I come? O how dreadful is this place? Is this my Priſon-entertainment? Are theſe my Priſon-conſorts? O what an hard lodging am I like to have with ſuch companions? O the Wormwood and the Gall! a dark habitation, a bitter cup indeed is now given unto me. Is this the comfort of the Croſs? Are theſe the ſweets ſo much talked of? Yet be not diſmayed, as roughly as thou art handled at the door, it is better within, the Devil is going out in this ſtorm; thy ſins meet thee now, but it is only to ſhake hands and part; after this Agony, expect the Angels to come and miniſter to thee. Complain not if thou yet find no ſweet, thou haſt not drank deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; the next draught the Sugar may come; in the next Room thou mayſt meet thy Lord; and then tell me if it be ſhort of all that hath been told thee.</p>
               <p>But ſhall I give you a more particular view of ſome of the ſpecial comforts of the Croſs, or our ſufferings for Chriſt? I ſhall only firſt premiſe a word, to let you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what I mean by the ſufferings of Chriſt. We then ſuffer <hi>for Chriſt, when we ſuffer for Chriſts Cauſe</hi>; when we ſuffer becauſe we will be Chriſtians, we will be holy and righteous; when we ſuffer becauſe we will not ſin; and when we ſuffer upon <hi>Chriſts call,</hi> when he cuts out a croſs for us, and lays it on. Then Chriſt calls us to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, when he puts us to this choice, <hi>Either to ſuffer or to ſin</hi>; when our backs or our conſciences muſt ſuffer; when we muſt ſuffer, or he muſt ſuffer by us. <hi>If any man will be my Diſciple, let him take up [his] croſs.</hi> Chriſt is not, &amp; Chriſtians muſt not be prodigal of their blood; their blood is his; their eſtates, their names, their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, are all his, and to him they muſt be accountable how they part with them. It is not every croſs that thou canſt call [thy] croſs; we muſt not leave our way to ſeek a croſs; when Chriſt hath laid a Croſs athwart a Chriſtians way that he ſhould go, and he muſt either
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:000857_0064_0FABB2D2E1B33668"/>
make a ſtand, or turn aſide, or ſubmit his neck to it; then he ſays, <hi>There is [thy] croſs, take it up, and get thee on</hi> Whatever croſs be before thee, if thou haſt a way open to avoid it without ſin; that is none of thy croſs, thou mayſt not take it up; or if thou doſt, thou wilt have no thanks for thy pains.</p>

                  </gap>y here Though it be an argument of a gracious ſpirit, to be always of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and forward mind to ſuffer for Chriſt; &amp; when he demands, <hi>Who will go with me? who will bear my croſs</hi>? chearfully to anſwer, <hi>I will go, Lord, let me bear it</hi>; yet ſhould we take heed, that as we hang not back, when he ſays, <hi>Go,</hi> ſo that we run not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſend us. Though it be an high honour to ſuffer for the Goſpel <hi>yet no man taketh this honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, but he that is called of God.</hi> I would not go to a Priſon without a <hi>Mittimus</hi> from Heaven, leſt if my ſuffering be of my ſelf, I be there left to ſhift for my ſelf. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould meet me in priſon or in baniſhment, and demand of me, <hi>What dost thou here</hi> Elijah? <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou in hither?</hi> What ſhould I ſay, if I could not ſay this, <hi>Thou, Lord, haſt brought me hither? my conſcience, my duty hath brought me in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But underſtand me here with this caution, That when the <hi>cauſe</hi> for the main is <hi>Chriſts,</hi> but the <hi>call</hi> ſeems doubtful; yet when the ſufferer hath care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enquired the mind of God, truly follows the dictates of conſcience, ſincerely deſigns the honour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel, although he ſhould erre in ſome circumſtances of his caſe, and for fear of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity

ſhould chuſe affliction, when poſſibly he might have avoided both; God will ſurely wink at his miſtakes, own his ſufferings, and greatly accept &amp; reward his readineſs of mind.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill take heed of careleſs or wilful errours: take heed of preparing nails for thy own croſs; thorns, ſcourges, ſpears for thine own head or heart. Take heed both how thou ſhunneſt, and how thou eſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſeſt a ſuffering ſtate.</p>
               <p>Go not in upon heedleſs miſtakes; go not in for good company, much leſs upon any carnal deſigns; let not thy pride, or oſtentation, or the byaſs of any fleſhly reſpects lead thee into the houſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, leſt thou find them the rods to laſh thee when thou are there.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians conſider, if there be not ſometimes ſome uncomfortable miſcarriages in this matter; and whether it hath not been the lot of ſome of Chriſts (with how much juſtice or charity, let the Lord be Judge) to be cenſured and reproached for unfaithful, or for fearful upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but for walking by this rule, <hi>not to go to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without a warrant,</hi> that is, not to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſuffering ſtate, whilſt God hath left a way open to eſcape, without ſin. I confeſs the more dangerous, and the more ordinary errour is on the other hand; we are more apt (eſpecially when afflictions are more ſharp and bite in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and then will be the great trial) rather ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſhift our ſelves of them, than unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to run our ſelves upon them; but yet let it be

conſidered, whether there be not an errour on this hand alſo.</p>
               <p>It is true, where the cauſe is the ſame as to the main different circumſtances may make that to be one mans ſin, which is another mans duty; yea, that may be a duty to the ſame man at one time, which (ſuppoſing him in differing circumſtances) might have been his ſin at another. And it is not ſeldome (through the unavoidable difference of our apprehenſions, and the difficulty of diſcerning our caſes) that Chriſtians equally careful to know and do the will of God, when the caſe, and the circumſtances alſo are moſtly the ſame, do judge differently about their call to ſuffering.

The Law written in the heart, ſignifies, not onely the Law made known in the heart, but the heart made ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law; and adapted to the obedience of it. There is a kind of connaturalneſs betwixt the new heart, and all that the Law requires.</p>

[A ſound mind] there's the new light; [a ſpirit of Love] there's the new Law, or frame and with theſe, [a ſpirit of Power.]</p>
               <p>In ſumm this new heart is the divine nature; the image of God renewed; the life of God begotten, Chriſt formed in them.

How can ye being good, but bring forth good things? Or how can you ſay, or think, there is a treaſure of Grace, a Fountain of light within, when no ſtreams ſpring forth? Penury in the life, ſpeaks no great plenty in the heart; the Truths of God within you are the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> the good ſeed that he ſows in his fields; where there is good ſeed ſown in good ground, you will expect a fruitful Harveſt; a barren crop, ſpeaks a barren ſoil, or no good ſeed ſown there.</p>

No, we are not miſtaken, we know that we know him: But how do you know it? Why, how are Trees known? <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> How do ye know that this is indeed the Tree of Knowledge? Why, ſee what fruits are hanging upon it, we keep the Commandments; here is Obedience growing, here is Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs, and Mercy: Doubtleſs this is the right Tree, for behold all the Commandments, the two Tables, hanging upon the boughs of it, &amp; not broken, but kept and obſerved: We may as well ſay, Obedience is no Obedience, Duty is no Duty, Faith, and Love, and Humility, and Patience are not what they are, as that the Tree that brings forth this fruit is not the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: <hi>We know that we know him, becauſe we keep his Commandments.</hi> Yea, and the Tree of Life too, both in one: <hi>A tree of life to them that lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her,</hi> Prov. 3.18.

Chriſtian, boaſt not of what thou haſt, but conſider what thou doeſt, try thy head by thine heart, and thy heart by thine hand: Judge of thy light by thy love, &amp; thy love by thy life; ſay not that God hath ſhined into thine heart, unleſs thy light ſhine, thy works ſhine before men: <hi>The path of the juſt ſhineth,</hi> Prov. 4. It is but a <hi>form of Knowledge</hi> that brings forth but a <hi>form of Godlineſs</hi>: he that holdeth the Truth in unrighteouſneſs, hath not the Truth, in truth in him: Thou ſayſt thou knoweſt the Lord, but what ſay thy ways? do theſe ſpeak the ſame things?

gods it may be, in one man; becauſe ſo many hearts. Their pleaſures are their gods, their profits their gods, their belly their god; their wives, or their children, their gods; &amp; ſo many gods, ſo many ends. And every end is a loadſtone to draw them after them. Every heart will after its god A Chriſtian, that hath but one heart, hath but one God, and this is he that draws it on its way. Thou ſayſt, <hi>The Lord is thy God, thou acknowledgeſt, thou owneſt, thou haſt choſen him for thine</hi>; but what doth thy God whom thou haſt choſen do upon thine heart? what will the ſight of God, or thy love to God, or thy hope in God, do upon thee? how far will it carry thee? which way runs thy heart? which way doſt bend thy courſe? doſt feel thy God drawing thee? &amp; is thy heart running after him? Running, notes motion, and a ſwift or violent motion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay before you theſe ſix or ſeven expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Scripture uſes, to note the running of thoſe hearts after God, whom he hath drawn.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The deſiring of the Soul after God. Iſai. 26.8, 9. <hi>The deſire of our Soul is to thy Name.—With my ſoul have I deſired thee in the night, yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> Deſire is the ſoul in motion God wards. Towards him are their deſires, and they come deep, <hi>ab intimis, ab imo pectore,</hi> from their inwards, from the bottom of the heart. <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee.</hi> Pſal. 38.9. <hi>Lord, all my deſire is before thee</hi>: 'tis not all my deſires, but my deſire; thou ſeeſt all, and 'tis all but one
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:000857_0115_0FABB1E69FAECF30"/>
deſire. He deſires pardon, he deſires peace, he deſires help, and the healing of his wounds; but all this is but one deſire. God is all. <hi>One thing have I deſired,</hi> Pſal. 19 4</p>
               <p n="2">2. The thirſting of the ſoul. Pſal. 42.2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi> Thirſting is the extremity of deſire; hunger and thirſt are the appetite of deſire heightened; violent and painful appetites; <hi>My ſoul thirſteth, and is in pain till it be ſatisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The longing of the ſoul. Pſal. 63 1. <hi>O God, thou art my God early will I ſeek thee: my fleſh longeth for thee in a dry and thirſty land, where no water is.</hi> Longing cauſeth languiſhing, and abortions, if it be not ſatisfied. Pſal 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing deſire it hath to thy judgments. My heart panteth, my fleſh faileth, the light of mine eyes is gone from me</hi> Pſal. 38.10.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Calling after God, Pſal. 4.1. <hi>Hear me [when I call] O God of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Calling upon God, is the voice of deſires. The deſiring ſoul will not keep ſilence; the tongue, the eye, the ears the hands, the knees, muſt all be Oratours, when the flame is once kindled within.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Crying after the Lord. This is an expreſſion anſwering the thirſting of the ſoul. Crying is a paſſionate, and importunate praying. <hi>I cryed unto the Lord with my whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.145.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Crying out after God. This is the manner of the longing ſoul. Crying out, notes more than bare crying; loud cries, ſtrong cries, forced out by
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000857_0116_0FABB1E761932F30"/>
a proxiſm of love, or an agony the ſoul is in. Pſal. 84.2 <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my fleſh [cryeth out] for the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Following hard after the Lord, Pſal. 63.8 <hi>My ſoul followeth hard after thee.</hi> This expreſſion is more comprehenſive, it notes, both all the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and breakings, and breathings of the ſoul within, and its diligent purſuing in the uſe of all outward means, and preſſing on after the Lord. All thoſe labourings, and watchings, and runnings, all that holy violence, wherewith a Saint preſſes <hi>into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Put all this together, and you will ſee the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and influence the Lord hath on holy Souls, to the drawing of them after him; they are in moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaven-ward; deſiring, thirſting, longing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, crying, crying out, following hard after him. What aileth theſe ſouls? what is the matter with them? what would they have? Judg. 19.23. <hi>What aileth thee,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Danites</hi> once to <hi>Micah, that thou comeſt thus after us? What aileth thee? Why, you have taken away my gods, and what have I more. What aileth theſe crying, longing, running Souls?</hi> Why, it is after their God they cry, it is after their God they run. 1 King. 19.20. <hi>Go back Eliſha,</hi> ſaid once the Prophet to him, when he had caſt his Mantle on him: <hi>Go back, for what have I done unto thee? What haſt thou done? enough to hold me from going back</hi>: there went vertue with the Mantle; the Mantle fell on his heart, as well as his back, and drew it
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:000857_0117_0FABB1E81D309860"/>
after the Prophet. Should you ſay thus to theſe, <hi>Go back Soul, go back from following thy God, for what hath he done unto thee? Oh he hath gotten mine heart; No, no, I cannot go back, he is my God, and what have I more?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The end guides &amp; directs to means: <hi>Whither ſhall I go from thee? thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi>

Love will find out our way, will tell all our wandrings, will check us for our ſins, ſweeten our labours, quicken us on our courſe, cut out our way through dangers and difficulties, and keep us in our way, till we come to the fruition of our end. Therefore it is ſaid by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law is not for a righteous man.</hi> Love will ſave the Law a labour; <hi>the Law is not for a righteous man,</hi> not ſo much at leaſt as for ſinners; not as to the Coertion of it, though ſtill as to its Obligation: the conſtraint of Love will much ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede the Coertion of Laws.</p>

               </p>
               <p>God is the reward of his Saints, Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15.1. <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward,</hi> Iſai. 46 4. <hi>My judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God.</hi> God is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they [<hi>ſhall</hi>] receive, and the reward they look to receive, Heb 11.29. <hi>Moſes had [reſpect] to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Argument is weighty, which Chriſt uſed to diſſwade his Diſciples from being in their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their Alms-deeds, as the Phariſees and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are, who <hi>diſfigured their countenances in their faſts, who ſounded a Trumpet to proclaim their Alms; Be ye not like them, for they have their reward.</hi> The Argument was ſtrong to the Diſciples, who being men of another ſpirit, could not be ſatisfied with ſuch a reward.</p>

               <p>Oh how little plainneſs and ſingleneſs of heart is there, in our ordinary courſe, in our dealings, and converſings in the World? How little Faith, or truth is there in us?

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Its Act. <hi>Love is a natural Affection. The love of God is the Souls claſping or cloſing with the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the expanſion, or going out of the heart, in its strength, after God, the uniting or knitting of the Soul with God, with a complacency and acquieſcence in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are three things included in this love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſtrength of the heart making out after God.</hi> This is that which is commonly called our <hi>amor deſiderii,</hi> or our love of deſire, the breathing or thirſting, or panting of the heart, after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1. The hearts working God wards <hi>with its might</hi>; loving him above all things, deſiring him above all things; and that both <hi>intenſive</hi> with the greateſt vigour and intention: and <hi>adaequate</hi> as its compleat and adequate Object. God is its All. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The uniting of the Soul with God.</hi> Our clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to him. By love heart cleaves to heart, Soul cleaves to Soul. Its ſaid of <hi>Shechem,</hi> Gen. 34.3. that his heart clave unto <hi>Dinah.</hi> He loved her with his heart, ſhe was gotten into his heart, and there his heart holds her. Acts 11.23. <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorts the Church, that <hi>with purposſe of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</hi> It is the <hi>knitting of the</hi> Soul with God. Its ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>That the
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:000857_0167_0FABB23FE176AA68"/>
Soul of</hi> Jonathan <hi>was knit with the Soul of</hi> David, <hi>and</hi> Jonathan <hi>loved him as his own Soul.</hi> And of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 44.30. to expreſs his tender love to <hi>Benjamin,</hi> 'tis ſaid, his life was bound up in the lads life. Of the multitude of believers we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. that they were all <hi>of one heart and of one Soul.</hi> Their love had knit them up all into one. By love we are one with God and he with us. It is the ſouls <hi>willing of God,</hi> as I may ſo ſpeak. Willing of God to it ſelf, and willing it ſelf, and all to God. All praiſes, all honour, all bleſſedneſs to him. Be thou mine, Lord; no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing leſs, nothing elſe. Be thou mine, I need no leſs, I deſire no more. Let me be thine, be to thee, be for thee, thy ſervant, thy ſacrifice, or what thou wilt; and <hi>let all mine</hi> be thine; mine heart, and my hand, and my tongue, and my time, and mine intereſt. Let all <hi>thine</hi> be to thee; thy Heavens &amp; thy Earth, with every perſon, with every creature in them. Let every heart, every mouth, every limb, every creature be a praiſe to the Lord. <hi>Let the Lord live, and bleſſed be my rock; let the God of my ſalvation be exalted.</hi> Let every knee bow, let every tongue confeſs unto God. This is the <hi>amor unionis,</hi> our love of union, as 'tis called. And 'tis the heart, the very eſſence of ſaving love, wherein are included both our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, and our ſurrender or reſignation of our ſelves unto God. <hi>Amor non eſt niſi donum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis in amatum.</hi> And our wiſhing and willing all glory, dominion and bleſſedneſs to him. And ſo here alſo is our <hi>amor benevolentiae,</hi> our love of
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:000857_0168_0FABB2409DCF3DA8"/>
benevolence. All theſe may be included in that <hi>opening</hi> of the heart, mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. It's there ſaid, that the Lord opened <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart. The heart is then ſavingly opened, when it freely ſets out its ſelf upon God, all its ſtreams run in to the Lord; and when it takes in, and takes down God into the depth of the ſoul. The heart thus opened to the Lord, when God is come in, will cloſe upon him. Abide with me; thou haſt entred upon thine habitation, Oh let this be thy dwelling for ever. Only this muſt be farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that with God it takes in all things of God; his Word, his Ordinances, his Wayes, and all his Diſpenſations: With his Love, his Laws; with his comforts, his Counſels; with his Counſels, his Corrections; with thee, I accept of all that's thine; both thy yoke and thy croſs, thy ſelf, Lord, thy love Lord, and what thou wilt with thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſouls taking pleaſure, and taking up its reſt in him.</hi> This is call'd our <hi>Amor. complacentiae.</hi> Where we love, there will be a delightful <hi>ſtay</hi> or <hi>immoration</hi> of the mind upon God. <hi>Ubi amor, ibi oculus.</hi> The object dwells in the eye; we are ſtill looking where we love. <hi>Anima eſt ubi amat.</hi> When I awake, I am ſtill with thee; there his thoughts are, of him is his meditation all the day long.</p>
               <p>My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet. He that loves, <hi>dwelleth in God. I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi> And why there? why there his God dwell, &amp; therefore there his ſoul takes up its
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:000857_0169_0FABB241ADF16DC8"/>
dwelling. There is alſo <hi>an acquieſcence</hi> of the heart in him. <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my ſoul.</hi> But this is not felt, till love hath obtained: Till the ſoul feels it ſelf to love, and to have what it loves; to love, and to be beloved; to accept, and to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God. When it comes to this, then I have enough. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi> And here is the ſweetneſs of Religion, the marrow and fatneſs of godlineſs, <hi>the pleaſure of love:</hi> When I love, I can reſt; when I can reſt, I can rejoyce; when I feel my ſelf to love, I know I am beloved; and then what is there wanting? Where love is a ſtranger, joy is not known; we can never take comfort in any thing, but in that which we love. When take we pleaſure in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but when we have meat that we love? What is a friend, or a wife, or a child, when we love them not? What is ſociety or communion, where love hath not firſt made an union? <hi>can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> with little comfort ſure; they would be better pleaſed, were they parted aſunder. 'Tis love that is the pleaſure of our lives.

Love will make any thing down. When it puts ſuch a ſweetneſs into ſin, that even death and hell will down with carnal hearts for its ſake, Oh what a feaſt will love make of holineſs and glory! get love to Chriſt, love to Religion, and you will never demand, <hi>Where is the bleſſedneſs?</hi> where is the ſweetneſs?</p>
               <p>Love will ſweeten both the comforts and the exerciſes of Religion; 'twill make duties ſweet; yea, and ſufferings ſweet: there are two things that are naturally ſweet to love,</p>

Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> I ſhall proceed to the opening of this by theſe ſteps; I ſhall ſhew, 1. That the Lord God is a dreadful God. 2. That the Lord hath put the dread of himſelf upon the hearts of all the

earth. 3. That yet by ſin the heart of man is much hardned from the fear of the Lord. 4. That God will recover his honour, and again put his fear into the hearts of his people. 5. What this fear of the Lord is that he will put into them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord God is a dreadful God; he is dreadful in the Excellency and Glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, Job 13.11. <hi>Shall not his Excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</hi> His Power is dreadful. <hi>Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? Will ye not tremble at my preſence, which have placed the Sand for the bound of the Sea, by a perpetual Decree, that it cannot paſs it; and though the Waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet they cannot prevail; though they roar, yet can they not paſs over it.</hi> Fear ye not me, ſaith the Lord? He that did this, what can he not do? His wrath is a dread, Jer. 10.10. <hi>At his wrath the earth ſhall tremble, and the Nations ſhall not be able to abide his Indignation.</hi> Yea, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Truth, his Righteouſneſs, &amp; all his Name, Deut. 28.58. <hi>That thou mayſt fear this glorious and fearful Name [the Lord thy God.</hi>] The Lord God is a dreadful God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord God hath put the dread of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the hearts of all the earth. Not the beſt only, but the worſt of the ſons of men. <hi>I am a great King, ſaith the Lord, and my Name is dreadful among the Heathen.</hi> This dread of the Lord breaks forth upon them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>impreſs of God</hi> upon the natures of all men. As the Law, ſo the Being of God is
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:000857_0186_0FABB25B92C66D50"/>
written in their hearts, he hath his Witneſs in their Conſciences. If the Atheiſts of the Earth could anſwer all the Arguments from without, proving that there is a God; yet they can never confute their own Conſciences. If the works of God do not, their Reins ſhall inſtruct them; if they will not ſee, whether they will or no, they ſhall feel that there is a God; and where-ever God is felt, he is feared; even when their mouth ſpeaketh proud things, their heart ſhall meditate terror; and when nothing elſe is, they ſhall be a terror to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is encreaſed by the <hi>great works of God,</hi> his wonders that he doth in the World; his Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and his Hail, his Wind and his Waves; his Earth-quakes, make an Earth-quake in hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's further heightned, by <hi>his Judgments</hi> which he executeth on the Earth. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, are God revealing himſelf from Heaven, againſt the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, and do then ſtrike moſt terror, 1. When he ſmites <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and makes quick work with ſinners: as when <hi>Herod</hi> was ſmote by an Angel of God, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes <hi>strange</hi> Judgments, makes a new thing, as in the caſe of <hi>Korah</hi> and his company, he made the Earth to open her mouth upon them, and ſwallow them up; ſo he made the flies and the frogs, and the lice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be the Executioners
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:000857_0187_0FABB25E4129ED88"/>
of his wrath on <hi>Pharoah.</hi> 3. When he executes <hi>great wrath for little ſins,</hi> as men account them; as in the caſe of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> whom he ſtruck dead for but touching the Ark when it ſhook 4 When he exerciſes <hi>great ſeverity on his own,</hi> on thoſe that are near him. If he ſpareth not his Sons, what will he do with his Enemies? <hi>If theſe things be done on the green Tree, what ſhall be done on the dry?</hi>

               <p n="1">1. A reverence of God To fear God, is to have the awe of God abiding upon the heart, to be under a ſenſe of the Majeſty and Glory of the Lord, ſhining forth in all his Attributes, eſpecially in his Holineſs and Omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience; the glory of his Holineſs; and the ſenſe of ſuch an holy eye upon the ſoul, ſtrikes it with dread and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. This is expreſt in Scripture, by <hi>Sanctifying the Lord</hi> in the heart, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that draw nigh me.</hi> Iſa 8.13. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hosts himſelf, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</hi> There is mention in Scripture of a <hi>Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God,</hi> and a <hi>juſtifying of God.</hi> As God doth juſtifie and ſanctifie his people, ſo they are to juſtifie and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God. Theſe two, the juſtifying and ſanctifying of God, though they be much the ſame; yet there is ſome difference betwixt them: To ſanctifie God, is to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him in our hearts, and to repreſent him in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Holineſs before men. To juſtifie God, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſinful judging, and fooliſh charging of God in the hearts of men, and is our vindicating of him from ſuch charges. Is God righteous? How is it then that he is ſo partial in his dealings with the righteous and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous? that he deals worſe with thoſe that fear him, than with thoſe that fear him not? Is God good? How is it then that he is ſo hard, not only in impoſing, but inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch hard things upon his own? Is God true? How is it then that he fails his people ſo often, when he hath ſaid, I will never fail them nor forſake them? Our fleſh hath failed, and our heart hath failed, yea, and our God
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:000857_0192_0FABB261EC485590"/>
hath often failed us too; we have often called, and have had no anſwer; we have often truſted, and have had no deliverer. Yet God is righteous, yet God is good, yet God is true; he hath not been unrighteous, he hath not been an hard Maſter, he hath not failed nor forſaken; this is to juſtifie God.</p>
               <p>Our juſtifying of God, hath ſome kinds of reſemblance with Gods juſtifying of us. Gods juſtification of us, ſtands in his not imputing ſin to us, and accepting us as righteous; and our juſtifying of God, ſtands in our not imputing evil to him, and our acknowledging him to be true, juſt and good.

I have found that the Lord is gracious, I have found that God is faithful; he hath ſaid he will not, and I muſt ſay he hath not forſaken: He hath not failed, when he hath moſt failed me; when he hath been fartheſt off from my help, he hath even then been a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help in trouble: He hath anſwered, when he hath been moſt ſilent; he hath been moſt good, when he hath been moſt hard.

               <p>Chriſtians know, that though God be tender of his Saints, yet he is jealous for his Name; he tenders them as the apple of his Eye, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the leaſt tittle of his Honour. As God will have us love our Neighbour, ſo he will love his child, but <hi>as himſelf</hi>; Firſt himſelf, and then his child. He will not bate an <hi>Iota</hi> of his glory, to ſave a world. As little offences <hi>done to</hi> his little ones, ſo little ſins <hi>allowed by them,</hi> are as <hi>Mill ſtones about the neck.</hi> If they allow it in themſelves, yet Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, and fall to nothing, ere he allow it in them.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Their own ingenuity.</hi> This fear is from Love and good Nature, and is moſt properly the fear of children.

fear? We fear evil and not good. The meaning is, they ſhall fear to wrong or abuſe goodneſs: They ſhall fear to wrong the Lord, becauſe he is good. [In the latter dayes.] Theſe latter dayes that this Promiſe refers to, ſhall be days of more grace; wherein there ſhall be, not only a more <hi>clear revelation</hi> of the goodneſs of God; they ſhall know the Lord and his goodneſs; but a more <hi>plentiful communication</hi> and diffuſion of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; they ſhall love the Lord and his goodneſs: They ſhall ſee themſelves both more <hi>obliged</hi> by goodneſs, and ſhall feel themſelves more <hi>ſeaſoned</hi> with goodneſs. By grace they ſhall be better natured. Religion doth not make <hi>moroſe,</hi> but more <hi>generous,</hi> free and ingenuous. There's nothing more abhorrent to an ingenuous ſpirit, than to be baſe and unworthy. Abuſe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is an unworthineſs, which an ingenuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors as death to be guilty of; 'tis its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, 'tis diſingenuity.

They muſt not diſpute, but do his will; only it muſt be conſidered, that there is a double diſputing the will of God. There is a diſputing whether that which is pretended to be the will of God, be ſo or no; this ought to be done: And there is a diſputing or queſtioning that which is granted to be the will of God, whether it be fit to be done, or ſafe to be done? Is it not better to let it alone? What advantage is there in it? What reaſon is there for it? No, they muſt not thus diſpute; this is Reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, God will have it ſo. Gods will is ever reaſon, and it muſt be our Reaſon. It's enough for thee to ſay, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath commanded,</hi> and muſt I be ſubject?

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Activity and Induſtry.</hi> The ſervants of the Lord muſt be Active and Induſtrious. Whom he ſends into the Vineyard, he ſends to work, &amp; not to ſleep.

An active
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:000857_0221_0FABB171F62845E8"/>
ſpirit, is an excellent ſpirit, and 'tis neceſſary in a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Active ſpirit, is an Excellent ſpirit: ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards are the refuſe of the Earth.</p>
               <p>But here it muſt be conſidered, that there is a double Activity, Gracious and Natural.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural,</hi> which ariſes from an innate vigour and vivacity of ſome mens ſpirits: There needs not induſtry in ſuch, to bring forth action; 'tis but leaving nature to its courſe, and that will flye high enough of it ſelf. It requires more induſtry to regulate, and ſometimes to reſtrain, than to put forth into Action. Its more labour for them to reſt, than to be doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Gracious:</hi> Which is either Natural Activity, managed and improved for God, turn'd into a right courſe, running into a right Channel; or a naturally unactive ſpirit, raiſed and quickned by Grace and Religious Induſtry. This gracious, this holy Activity, this is the Excellency; it is the extract of the ſpirits and life of all our parts and graces, and will go further, and do more high honour, and more abundant ſervice to God &amp; his Goſpel, than is done by a thouſand others.</p>
               <p>An Active ſinner, is by accident the worſt of men: How much ſervice for the Devil will he diſpatch in a little time?</p>
               <p>An Active Sinner is <hi>life and death met together.</hi> He is all life, and yet dead; and the more he hath of death, becauſe ſo much of life; like poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Wine, he deſtroys the more effectually:
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:000857_0222_0FADAB87223B9490"/>
Yet the evil is not in his Activity, but in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein he is employed; the good mettal, as keens of a Weapon, is its Excellency: but in a mad mans hand, better a wooden than an iron ſword. An Active Spirit is ſo excellent, that it's pity that ever ſin ſhould have the uſing of it; 'twas well for Religion, if the Devil were a Drone, and had no other Servants, but the Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards of the Earth. But Activity when ſet right, is of great price in the ſight of God, becauſe it ſets a great price upon God. Slothfulneſs puts a ſlight upon God; when the Scriptures have ſet forth a <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> the great things, and the deep things of God: when the Lord Jeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Tuſh, all this is not worth the breaking my ſleep for; 'tis not all worth my labour to ſeek after; my eaſe and my quiet is better to me, than God and all his glory.</p>

(with) Chriſt alwayes, ſo neither will Saints al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtay from him. And there's a like reaſon of both: Sinners ſometimes will ſtep aſide, and ſalute Religion, and take ſome turns with Chriſt; but after a while, away they muſt again: And there is a double reaſon of it.</p>

                  <item>1. There's that within them that will fetch them back.</item>
                  <item>2. There's one without them that will fetch them back.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. There's that <hi>within them</hi> that will fetch them back. Corrupt nature, the power of unmortified Luſt, this is it that bears the ſway in their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and however for the time, the ſtream may be ſomewhat turn'd out of its courſe, or bay'd up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however by the <hi>impetus</hi> of ſome external Motives or Arguments, or the <hi>impulſes</hi> of an awakened Conſcience, or ſome ſudden heat of affection, they are carried on after, and in ſome fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Lord Jeſus; yet when the Bay is removed, when the external force is ſpent, Conſcience laid to ſleep, the heat affection allaid, which is often almoſt as ſoon out as in, their very natures will reduce, and bring them back to their old courſe. What is it that pulls a Stone, or a lump of Clay down again, that that is thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Air? Why when the <hi>vis imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſſa</hi> by which they were forc'd up, is ſpent, their natures, their innate gravities will bring them down to their place. Sinners need no other weights to pull them down to this Earth, than their earthly hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There's <hi>one without them</hi> that will fetch them off: Satan the god of this world, whoſe they are,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:000857_0244_0FABB18BEBC0A730"/>
and whom they ſerve; who though he indulge them ſo much liberty for their Religion, as is conſiſtent with their captive ſtate, and may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſecure them the more under his Dominion. (Hypocrites are often the faſter to Satan, for being ſo near to Chriſt) the very Religion they have, is but the Devils ſnare, by which he holds them back from Religion; yet leſt by venturing them too far, they ſhould be loſt to him at laſt, he that firſt tempted them ſo near to Chriſt, (Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are often beholding to the Devil for the Religion they have) will quickly tempt them back again.</p>
               <p>And ſo on the other ſide, there are the like Reaſons why Saints cannot always wander, or ſtay away from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Sinners whileſt walking with Chriſt, and Saints whileſt wandring from Chriſt, are both under a force, they are carried againſt the ſtream; when the winds are down that carried them on, they will return to their courſe. The grace of God is the ſeed of God, <hi>He that is born of God, ſinneth not</hi>; (that is, not unto death) <hi>the ſeed of God remaineth in him.</hi> The ſeed of God is immortal ſeed; it may languiſh, and be ready to dye, but it ſhall not dye, it ſhall recover.</p>

us, what <hi>de facto</hi> we (ſhall) be, is included a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, wherein we may underſtand what <hi>de jure</hi> we (ought) to be.</p>
               <p>In undertaking to give us a new heart, a tender and obedient, a perſevering heart, the Lord doth promiſe, both to make us what we ſhould be, and to help us in what we are bound to do; and gives us at once a clear hint, both of our mercy and duty. This is the ſence &amp; ſum of that promiſe, The Lord will work all that in us, and will help and cauſe us to perform all that which (is required) unto ſalvation; and ſo the <hi>Promiſsum</hi> on Gods part, doth not make void, but eſtabliſh the <hi>Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> on ours, <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? Nay, we establiſh the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though it be certain as to the event, that all that's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, ſhall be accompliſhed in us; God hath undertaken that, yet it is altogether as certain, that God hath made our loving him, fearing him, obeying his whole will, and our ſincerity and perſeverance herein ſo neceſſary, that we cannot otherwiſe be ſaved:</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, miſtake not, nor abuſe the grace of the Goſpel. The Lord never meant your mercy ſhould make void your obligation to duty. Redemption from ſin, was never intended as a toleration of ſin. He gives not his Spirit in favour of the fleſh. What he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to work for you, was never with a mind to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you in idleneſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. The Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us, that denying ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>Though you are ſaved by grace, yet you are ſtill (in a ſenſe) debtors to the whole Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perfect obedience to the whole Law, even to the utmoſt <hi>Iota,</hi> is ſtill due from you; and if it be not in your hearts to pay all that you owe, that is, if there be any duty commanded in the
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:000857_0250_0FABB191D73C5958"/>
whole Book of God, that you muſt be diſpenſed with, that you will not ſet your hearts to obſerve and obey; if there be any one ſin that you maſt be excuſed in, and will not part with; if there be any, the higheſt pitch of holy Care, Activity, Induſtry, Zeal for God and Holineſs, that you will not be perſwaded to preſs hard after; this is an evidence of ſuch an unſound heart as hath no part in the Goſpel, or the ſalvation thereof. Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is ſtill due, though ſincerity will be accepted. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity ſhall be accepted, but what is ſincerity leſs than an hearty willingneſs to be perfect, atteſted by a ſtriving &amp; preſſing on to that mark which is ſet before us.</p>
               <p>O admire and bleſs the Lord, the Lord for Grace; but do not turn the Grace of God into licentiouſneſs Shall we continue in ſin, becauſe Grace that abounded? Will ye thus requite the Lord? Will ye thus deceive your ſelves, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? Will you ſlight him, becauſe he hath loved you? Kick at him, becauſe he hath cared for you? ſhake of his yoke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſecured you the Crown! Will you ſerve his enemies, becauſe he hath ſaved you from them? Will you nouriſh your diſeaſes, becauſe he hath ſaid he will cure you? Will you live and not eat? Reap and not plough? Will you not eat, becauſe he hath given you meat? Will you not run, becauſe he hath given you legs? Nor work becauſe he hath given you hands? Nor watch, becauſe he hath given you eyes? Or will you tempt the Lord, and call that your truſt in him? Awake from ſuch madneſs.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, ſay not (if God will, I ſhall) whether I take care or no, believe or no, repent or no, be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or rebellious, whether I wake or ſleep, work or be idle; my unbeleif, my diſobedience, my negligence ſhall not make the faith of God of none effect. But rather, ſince God hath ſaid, (you ſhall) let thine heart anſwer

(I will) walk in his ſtatutes. Ariſe O my ſoul, up and be doing; work out thy ſalvation, becauſe it's God that worketh in thee, to will and to do: ſhake off thy ſloth, ſet to thy work, run out thy race, ſince God hath ſaid, thou ſhalt not run, nor labour in vain. And look to it, for however thy Idleneſs, or greateſt Unfaithfulneſs, will not make void the Covenant of God; yet will it make manifeſt, that thou haſt no part nor lot in it.</p>

Fear not, O my Soul, as if thou wert going to a ſtrange place. Why Heaven is thy Country, and thy home: wilt thou doubt of leave, or fear of welcome, when it is thine own home? Why, my Soul, thou waſt born from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and here is thy Kindred, and thy Fathers houſe, and therefore thou ſhalt ſurely be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>Doubtleſs it ſhall be thus. Theſe are not ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens dreams, or Childrens hopes. The living God cannot deceive me: and may not I certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promiſe my ſelf, what the Lord hath promiſed me?

               <p>I know it ſhall be thus. Why, what ſecurity, ſhould I ask of God? He hath given me all the aſſurance in the World. And though the Word of God be enough, yet he willing to ſhew, more abundantly to the Heirs of Promiſe, the Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath: that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, I might have ſtrong conſolation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17. O unreaſonable Unbelief! What ſhall not the Oath of a God put an end to thy ſtrife?</p>
               <p>O my God I am ſatisfied: it is enough. Now I may be without preſumption, and boaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pride. And will no more call my Duty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, nor my Faith a Fancy.</p>
               <p>O my Soul! There is but a ſhort life betwixt thee and Glory, where holy Angels, and glorified Saints, ſhall be mine Aſſociates, and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> mine only Employment. <hi>Job</hi> 38.7.

But it was ſaid unto me, I ſhould reſt yet for a little ſeaſon, but I ſhall ſtand in the lot at the end of the dayes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.13</p>
               <p>It is well Lord, thy Word is enough. Thy Bond is as good as ready payment. The Holy Ghoſt tells me, that life and glory abide me; <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.41. that look what day I looſe from the

               <p>But this is not all. When my body hath ſlept a ſhort Nap in the duſt, Chriſt will call to it, Come up hither. Ah true Yoke fellow, it will be hard parting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but welcome meeting. I could not leave thee, but to live with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he will raiſe thee a glorious Temple; and when he ſhall appear, will bring me with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in glory; and then I ſhall re-enter thee as a Royal Manſion, wherein <hi>I</hi> ſhall abide with the Lord for ever. For as we have ſerved our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer together, ſo we muſt be glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him.

And though after my skin, worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God. Whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my Reins are conſumed within me.

               <p>Ah my Soul, ſee that thou make not God a Lyar. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>O my God, I have believed thy report, and do look for all theſe things, according to thy Promiſe. I know thou intendeſt me but for a very little while in this lower Region. This world is but the houſe of my Pilgrimage, and my ſoul now is but like a Bird in the ſhell: but when the ſhell is crackt, then ſhall ſhe take wings like a Dove, and ſoar aloft to thee, and flee away, and be at reſt.</p>
               <p>Yet I doubt not thy care for my deſpicable duſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39. I know that nothing will be loſt; I know not where they will lay me: but thy wakeful eye obſerveth, and will not be to ſeek at what door to knock, not at what grave to call for me. I believe, and am ſure that I ſhall come a glorious piece out of thy hands, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, crowned with honour and glory. And when my Abſolution is read, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt upon the World, then muſt I be taken up to dwell with thee.</p>
               <p>Let not my Lord be angry, that thy duſt and aſhes ſpeaketh thus unto thee. Thou Lord haſt raiſed my expectations, and haſt made me to look for all theſe great things from thee. In vain haſt thou written all theſe things unto me, if I ſhould not believe them; and a diſtruſtful diffidence would put a high diſhonour upon thy Truth.</p>

               <p>So ſhall my knowledge be perfected, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 9, 10. and I ſhall ſee the inacceſſible light; and my tender eye ſhall not water, nor my ſight dazle; but I ſhall with open face look ſtedfaſtly on the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and behold his glory.

Make ſure, all lies upon this: Your life, and all the comforts and concernments of it, both your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſafety hereafter, and your ſucceſs in all the parts of your Chriſtian courſe here, depend on your intereſt in the Covenant. What have you if Chriſt be not yours? and what have you in Chriſt, if you be not in Covenant? whence are your hopes, either of mercy at laſt, or of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in any thing at preſent, but from the Covenant of Promiſe? And what have you thence, if your name be not in it? Oh give not reſt to your ſelves, till this be put out of doubt; whatever duties you

perform, whatever eaſe or hope you find hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatever tranſportation or affection you feel in your hearts, in the midſt of all enquiry.</p>

Is this the will of God, my ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? ſo 'tis mine. Is this the will of God, my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation? ſo 'tis mine. Is this the will of God, my tribulation? ſo 'tis mine. Is God for holineſs? through grace ſo am I. Is God for his own will? ſo am I. This is all the will I have, that the Lord may have his will of me; may be all to me, have all from me, rule all in me, and diſpoſe of all that concerns me.</p>
               <p>How is it with your carnal affections, and fleſhly luſt? are theſe ſlain? Is your covetouſneſs, your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, your pride and envy; are your carnal joyes, and fears, and worldly ſorrows, are theſe deſtroyed? thoſe wild-fires of paſſion, and fury, and rage, are theſe quenched? Come put the knife to the throat of all theſe, and then there's a ſacrifice for God. Goe and offer it up; and let it be.</p>
