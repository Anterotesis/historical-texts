            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>Concerning those admirable and amazing works of God, which are by us called <hi>Comets,</hi> as under a <hi>physical</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi> Consideration, there are many that have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished their Sentiments, and some to good purpose and edification. The Scope of the ensuing discourse, is only, (that being most proper for one under my circumstances) to make a <hi>Theological</hi> Improvement thereof. There are that doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound this enquiry, <hi>How many Comets hath the world taken notice of since the first Creation?</hi> which is indeed a Question that no mortal living is able to give a full and certain answer unto. It is true that sundry learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worthy Writers, (especially <hi>Lavater</hi> and <hi>Alsted</hi>) have attempted to give us the History of Comets, nor hath their labour been wholly in vain or unprofitable, though it be not possible to give an account of all of them. We doe not read of above eleven <hi>Blazing Stars,</hi> in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (for about four thousand years) that were before the Incarnation of the Son of God: doubtless there were more; but the Records of those times are very imperfect, so that we cannot say, when they appeared, or by whom observed. The number of <hi>Comets</hi> seen these last 1680. years, is judged to be about 158; yet may it justly be questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there have been so many, inasmuch as diverse appearances of the same <hi>Comet</hi> have been set down by Historians as if they had been so many distinct Comets. Such <hi>Stars</hi> (for so rather than <hi>Meteors</hi> have the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of later times evinced them to be) have ever been accounted <hi>Ominous Presages</hi> of great mutations and miseryes coming upon the world. So did the wise men amongst the Gentiles of old <note n="(a)" place="margin">

and <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformations, had Comets to precede them. But (to say nothing of the Warrs and fatal changes which in those dayes hapned in diverse parts of the world) two or three exceptions doe not invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the truth of a general Assertion. If such signs are <hi>commonly</hi> Presages of sore Calamityes, thats enough to awaken men out of their Lethargyes, though now and then, once in an hundred times it should happen to be otherwise, which yet remains to be demonstrated. As for their notion who think that Comets are signs that the light of the Gospel shall be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dispersed in the world, or that they portend mercy to the Church, and Judgement to others only; it is to be wished that there were a solid foundation for such a conceipt: But alas! Divisions amongst the Lords professing People themselves, and great Persecutions have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been the fatal consequents of such portentous signs. And if publick calamityes come upon the world, it is not to be expected but that the Lords People, whilst they are mixed amongst others, (and too much partaking with them in their sins) living in an evil world, will have their share therein. It hath ever been so, and is ever like to be so, until <hi>the sign of the Son of Man shall appear.</hi>

            <p>As for that <hi>Blazing Star,</hi> which hath occasioned this present Discourse, it was a terrible sight indeed, especially about the middle of December last, the stream of such a stupendous magnitude, as that no man now living ever beheld the like. That in the year 1618. was looked upon as very prodigious, <note n="(b)" place="margin">

            <p>THE Lord Jesus Christ, having told his Disciples that great Calamityes were hastning upon Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and upon the Jewish Nation; they enquire when those things should come to pass, and what <hi>Signs</hi> should precede and presage the Judgements predicted. This we see in the 7 <hi>th.</hi> verse of this Chapter, <hi>They asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what</hi> Sign <hi>will there be when these things shall come to pass?</hi> In answer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which enquiry, the Lord Christ doth in this context men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion several things, some of which were to be more remote, and others more immediate <hi>Signs</hi> of that miserable Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the sacred and unerring lips of Christ had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told. 1. Palse Christs would arise. <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Many shall come in my name. saying, I am Christ, &amp;c.</hi> The Jews had rejected the true Messiah, therefore God would punish them with false Christ, as an intimation that the dayes of vengeance were coming upon the Nation for that sin of theirs. The Apostle John (Christs beloved Disciple) doth imitate his Master in mentioning the same thing as a sign that the Jewish world was near unto its end, 1 Joh. 2. 18. <hi>There are many Antichrists</hi>

that pretended to be Christs, and that the river Jordan should give way to them as once it did to Joshuah, so that a multitude of silly Jews were perswaded and seduced to follow them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own destruction. 2. Another Sign mentioned, is, that of Wars and Commotions, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>When ye shall hear of Wars and commotions be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by.</hi> This may be understood of those <hi>intestine</hi> Wars and <hi>Commotions</hi> which hapned in the land of Judea.—The Galileans took up arms against the Samaritans. At <note n="(b)" place="margin">Joseph. <hi>Antiq.</hi> L.20.C.4, 5. <hi>de Bello</hi> Jud. l.2. c.11.</note> one time, in a mutiny there were twenty thousand slain. These were <hi>Commotions</hi> which caused a great noise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation amongst men (especially amongst those of the Jewish Nation) in those dayes. Hence that which is by <hi>Luke</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Wars and Commotions,</hi> is by <hi>Mark</hi> called <hi>Troubles,</hi> and by <hi>Matthew, Wars and runners of Wars.</hi> And these things hapned about twenty years before the final destruction of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem and fatal overthrow of the Jewish Nation, therefore was it said, <hi>the end is not by and by.</hi> 3. Another Sign is that mentioned in the 10<hi>th. v. Nation shall rise up against nation, &amp; Kingdome against Kingdome.</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">v. Joseph. <hi>de Bello</hi> Jud. l.2.c.19,20,21.</note> So indeed it came to pass when the Jewish Nation rose up against the Romane Nation, &amp; their neighbouring Nations, Syrians, Samaritans &amp;c. rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.

               <abbr>viz.</abbr> Prodigious Signs. These things are mentioned as the more immediate Presages of those miseryes that were coming upon Jerusalem, with the whole Jewish Nation.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That Prodigious awfull Sights and Signs in Heaven, are oftentimes, the Presages of great Calamity coming upon the World.</hi> For the further clearing of this Doctrine, three things may be enquired into. 1. What sights and signs are the Presages of Calamity? 2. How it doth appear that they are so? 3. What Calamityes such Signs doe commonly presage?</p>
            <p>Q 1. <hi>What Sights &amp; Signs in heaven are Presages of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? A.</hi> 1. There are signs in the <hi>starry heaven.</hi> The great God, when he made the World, placed the Stars in heaven, to be for signs as to events that in the ordinary course of nature should come to pass. Gen. 1. 14. <hi>God said, Let there be lights in the Firmament of heaven, and let them be for Signs.</hi> They are for Signs of heat and cold, wet and dry seasons, and the like. Hence the Lord spake to Job as in Ch.38.31. <hi>Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</hi> The <hi>Pleiades</hi> are the same with those which men call
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000306_0008_0FA4A9A71EBE0A78"/>
the seven stars. When the Sun is in that Constellation with the Pleiades, it hath a great power and influence upon the the earth. It is Spring time then. As for <hi>Orion</hi> 
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">See <hi>Mr. Caryl</hi> on <hi>Iob.</hi> 38.31.</note> it is a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Constellation, causing cold, whereby the pores of the earth are bound. It binds the earth from bearing fruit, and as it were binds the hands of men from labour in their particular callings. When that Constellation appears in the evening (as it doth in the ninth moneth) tis a sign that the earth shall be bound as hath been expressed. Yea, and tis a sign that storms and tempestuous seasons are to be expected. Therefore was it by the Poet called <hi>Nimbosus Orion.</hi> And hence the stars are called by the name of <hi>The Signs of heaven,</hi> Jer. 10.2. <hi>Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Which words may well be understood concerning the stars and Constellations in the heavens. <note n="(g)" place="margin">

The stars of heaven are for natural signs.

There are also <hi>extraordinary Stars,</hi> sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the heavens. God in his Providence doth so order as that so metimes <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> are seen in heaven. Such <hi>stars</hi> are called <hi>Comets,</hi> from the stream like long hair which useth to attend them. Such a star is prodigious, and a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sight. And of this may the words of the Text be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. The Jewish <note n="(h)" place="margin">Warrs of Jews, l.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 12</note> Historian reports, that not long before the destruction of Jerusalem, there was a <hi>Blazing star</hi> in form of a Sword, which seemed to impend over the City, for a year together: this now was <hi>a fearful sight, and a great sign from heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are fearful sights &amp; signs appearing in the <hi>Air,</hi> sometimes in the lower heaven. which we move and breathe in. Prodigious Meteors are sometimes seen there. And
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000306_0009_0FA4A9A7BA8487A0"/>
strange Appearances, which are either seen or heard speaking. Of these fearful sights and signs is the Text likewise to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted. <hi>Josephus</hi> relates, that before the Romane Army destroyed Jerusalem, there was seen in the air, <note place="margin">ibidem</note> iron Chariots and Souldiers in battle aray; and in the night time, a great light appeared in the temple, for half an hour together, with as much brightness as if it had been noon day, and a voice was heard saying, <hi>Let us be gone from hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Qu. 2. <hi>How doth it appear that such fearful Sights are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of Calamityes coming upon the World?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Scripture is clear for this. The Text before us doth expresly declare no less. And the Prophet Joel fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling the same Calamityes which this text hath reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, saith also, that prodigious signs in heaven should presage and portend them. Joel 2. 30,31. <hi>I will shew Wonders in the heaven.</hi> Truely, Blazing Stars are Wonders in the heaven. <hi>And in the earth bloud and fire and pillars of smoke—before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.</hi> When Jerusalem was destroyed &amp; the Jewish state dissolved, that was a great &amp; notable day of the Lord, a Type of the great day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Wonders,</hi> even prodigious and amazing signs should precede it. A very learned <note n="(i)" place="margin">Mede <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> 6.P. 37.</note> and judicious Interpreter, conceiveth, that the Hebrews of old did use to call Comets or blazing stars by that name of <hi>A Pillar of smeke,</hi> because some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they appear like pillars of smoke, and that therefore when it is said, there shall be Pillars of smoke before the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of the Lord, the true meaning and intendment of those expressions, is, that Comets should precede and presage the miseryes coming upon the Jewish Nation. Yea, the Scripture informs us, that <hi>fearful sights and signs in heaven</hi> shall precede the great and general day of Judgement as presages thereof, Luk.21.25. <hi>There shall be signs in the stars:</hi> meaning that such things should be observed among the stars in heaven, as would be a sign that Christs coming to judge the world did approach. Wherefore in <hi>ver.</hi> 28. it is said, <hi>When these things come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth nigh.</hi> The day of Judgement is a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000306_0010_0FA4A9A88DE4B3A0"/>
and is so called in other Scriptures, Ephes. 41. 30. Then shall the bodies of the Saints be redeemed from the power of the grave, and both bodies and souls redeemed from all evils of sin and of suffering. Rom.8.23. 1 Cor.1.30. At the Resurrection in the last day, will the great Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be to the Saints of God, and the greatest miseryes to the wicked that ever were thought of. And signs in heaven shall precede them. And hence it is, that <hi>fearfull Sights</hi> are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Signs</hi> in the Scripture, it is partly on this account, in that they are <hi>Signs</hi> that the Lord is coming forth out of his holy habitation, to punish the world for their iniquityes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The experience of many Ages doth bear witness unto the truth of this Doctrine. If the Scripture were silent about this matter, the experience both of former and of later Ages doth sufficiently and sadly confirm the truth in hand. Hence an <note n="(k)" place="margin">

               </note> have written large Volumes concerning the fearfull Sights which have at several times and places been observed in the world, and the Judgements and miseries which have followed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many times such fearful Sights are tokens of Gods anger; <note place="margin">Zanch. <hi>de natura Dei,</hi> P. 414.</note> which is another reason why they are called <hi>Signs,</hi> as being Signs of the Anger of God. <hi>Signs</hi> that flaming vengeance is kindled and burning in heaven against a sinful World. Now when God is angry then publick Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments come, and testimonyes of Divine Displeasure. <hi>Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> afflictions are not alwayes evidences of Gods anger, as we see in <hi>Job;</hi> but publick Judgements are ever wont to be so. Tis thought that the ninetieth Psalm was penned by Moses on occasion of a publick Judgement, the Plague which broke in upon the Children of Israel and swept away many thousands of them: and (faith he) <hi>we are consumed by thine anger, and by
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000306_0011_0FA4A9A92A281188"/>
thy wrath are we troubled,</hi> v.7. So that if publick Judgements come, God is angry, his wrath kindled; he doth by them testifie and pour down his righteous displeasure from Heaven. Inasmuch then as fearful Sights are Tokens of Gods anger, they are Presages of great and publick Calamities. As the Rainbow (though a natural Sign) is a token of divine Favour, so are prodigious Sights, tokens of Divine Anger.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These fearful Sights are many times Presages of those things which make way for great change, and Calamityes to come upon the world. They are oftentimes (Blazing Stars <note n="(m)" place="margin">

            <p>Quest. 3. <hi>what Calamityes doe such fearfull sights &amp; signs in heaven Presage?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We must not be particular &amp; positive in interpretations of things of this nature. When a fearfull sight appears in heaven which the whole world cannot but take notice of now to make a particular and absolute determination, <note n="(p)" place="margin">v. Voet. in Disp<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de Signis is P.919,930.</note> that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000306_0012_0FA4A9AA51334A30"/>
such a place, or such a person, such a Judgement is certainly intended thereby, is too much boldness. In general, we may safely say, that there is just cause to expect; that great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mityes are at hand, but what persons or places shall more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently fall under those Judgements, is not for us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but we must leave that with God, who best knows what himself intends to do.</p>
            <p>This being premised, we proceed in answering the enquiry before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes such signs are Presages of great Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions coming upon the Church of God. The Lord in mercy to his People giveth them such warnings, that so they may prepare for what's a coming or make hast to enter into the chambers of safety, as it were for a little moment, till the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation be overpast. <hi>Nero's</hi> bloudy Persecution had a <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star</hi> to precede it. The same is true concerning the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresy and Persecution; that flood spoken of in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which the Dragon cast out of his mouth, and whereby the woman, the Church, fled into the wilderness, was in eminent danger of being swallowed up and devoured. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes such Signs in heaven are presages of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Dearths and Scarcity. That blazing Star impending over Jerusalem, which the text hath reference unto, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a terrible Famine, whereby multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes perished. <note n="(q)" place="margin">In the years after Christ 876. 948. 964. there were blazing stars seen presaging Famines and other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <note n="(y)" place="margin">See <hi>Clarks Martyrology.</hi> P. 311.&amp;c.</note> were looked upon by the Protestants as signs of deliverance unto them, and of destruction to their enemies. But alas! the event was quite otherwise. And let us not make ourselves secure, by saying or thinking, that the Lord by such <hi>fearful sights</hi> speaks to <hi>others only,</hi> and not unto us. As <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> (the Emperor) when <note n="(z)" place="margin">Testante Suetonio.</note> there was a long hairy <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> seen, he did but deride at it, and make a Joke of it, saying, That it concerned the <hi>Parthians</hi> that wore long hair, and not him, who was bald, but within a year, <hi>Vespasian</hi> himself, (and not the <hi>Parthian</hi>) dyed. Such fearful sights are usually signs that those Judgements which are (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks) <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura humani generis,</hi> Gods sharp Razors on mankind, whereby he doth Poll; his Sythe, whereby he doth shear down multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of sinful creatures, doe draw near, in which respect there is no doubt to be made of it, but that God by this <hi>Blazing star,</hi> is speaking to other places, and not to <hi>New-England</hi> only.

A <hi>strange sight</hi> doth botoken <hi>strange punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> coming upon those that have bin <hi>prodigious</hi> workers of iniquity. Yet let not us promise to our selves nothing but prosperity, in the doleful and the bitter day, when there shall be Lamentation generally. I am perswaded, that the floods of great water are coming. I am perswaded, that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to open the windows of heaven, and to pour down the Cataracts of his wrath, ere this Generation (wherein Atheism and Profaneness are come to such a prodigious height) I say, ere this Generation is passed away. But what reason have we to think that no drops of the fatal storm shall come near to us? If we so conclude, we may provoke the Lord to say, <hi>The Sinners of my People shall dye by the sword, who say the evil shall not overtake us nor prevent us.</hi> To be awakened out of security, and tremblingly to wait for the good pleasure of God, whatever it may be, is the most likely way to find rest in

the day of Trouble. So did the Prophet find it, Hab.3.16. <hi>when I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered, I trembled in my self, that I might rest in the day of trouble.</hi> When the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring voice of Judgement was heard, his heart trembled at it, so did he find rest in the day of trouble.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This should put us upon preparing for another day of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And this should we doe the rather, since the changes portended by this <hi>Comet,</hi> are like to come speedily as well as certainly.

We have cause to expect, and it will be our wisdome to prepare for <hi>another day of Trouble</hi> seven times greater then the former. It grieveth me to speak thus, but I cannot forbear.

know for certain, that if destroying Judgements and Death overtake any in their sins, and sweep them away to Hell, their blood shall be upon their own heads. For the Lord hath fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Beacon in the heavens, among the stars of God there; the <hi>fearfull sight</hi> is not yet out of sight. The Warning piece in heaven is going off, now then if the Lord discharge his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering pieces from on high, and men be found in their, sins unfit for death, their blood shall be upon them. They had warning given them that the Sword was a coming: Lo, the Lord himself gave them the warning, but they would not take warning, their blood shall be upon them. Moreover, if troubles should not come, yet it will be wisdome to prepare for them. If the Lord, after he hath sent his Angel to stand with a drawn sword over Jerusalem, should be entreated to spare us, yet it will never doe us hurt to prepare for the most deadly arrows of affliction, that may light upon us, whilst in this Vale of tears.</p>

If Repentance intervene, the evils which otherwise must be looked for, may be diverted. See therefore Jer.36.3,7. <hi>It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to doe unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way.</hi> Ay, a general Repentance is that which will doe, if every man turn from his evil way, <hi>that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.

Let it put us upon crying to God that that Judgement may be diverted, and not return upon us again so speedily. Doe we see the arrows of Pestilence and Death <hi>blazing</hi> over us? Oh! pray that the destroying Angel may not be sent to walk in darkness, and to waste at noon day. Doth God threaten our very heavens?

How then shall we think to escape in the day of the Lords anger, if a <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> so much as in these externals, which it is so easy tó <hi>reform,</hi> will not be obtained? O Return Return unto the Lord.

And in that way, let us betake our selves unto the shading wings of the Lord Jesus! Doe we not hear him speaking to us, as sometimes unto Jerusalem? Mat.23.37. <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee, as an hen her chickens under her wings.</hi> Sayth the Lord, the Romane Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, those birds of prey, are hastning upon you: but if you would have come under my wings, you should have been safe enough. Even so, doth not the Lord say, <hi>O New-England, New-England!</hi> dost thou not know that the birds of prey are designing to devour thee? but my wings are broad enough to secure and shelter thee, when the black and stormy tempest shall break upon the world. If we be found a praying, an humble, a reforming People, we need not doubt but that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of his wings, we shall make our refuge, until the calamity be overpast.</hi>
