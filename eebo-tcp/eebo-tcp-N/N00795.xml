            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Object. <hi>BEcauſe it ſets up a new Officer in the</hi> Church, <hi>which is a meer humane Creature, having no authority from the Word of</hi> GOD, <hi>nor was ever heard of in the Church of Chriſt, till</hi> Calvin<hi>'s time, and that is the</hi> LAY-ELDER.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> WE do here freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that we were of opinion, as ſome are, that the Ruling-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath no foundation in the Word of God, but is a meer humane Ordinance brought into the Church only in a prudential way; we

ſhould heartily deſire the utter abolition of him: For we are not ignorant, that the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Prelate was brought into the Church upon the ſame account, for the avoiding of Schiſm and Diviſion, and afterwards proved the great Author and Fomenter of Schiſm and Diviſion. And if we would decline the Ruling Prelate, and take in the Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the ſame prudential grounds, it were juſt with God to make him as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the Church, as ever the Ruling Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was: And therefore let us conſider what may be ſaid out of the Word of God, for the Juſtification of this ſo much <hi>decryed Officer</hi>: Yet firſt we cannot but take notice that the name of <hi>Lay-Elder</hi> was affixed to this Officer by way of reproach and ſcorn, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of him, and that it ought not to be continued. For though it be evident by Scripture, [<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17, 24.] that there is a great difference betwixt the Miniſtry, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called the Clergy, and the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Laity: Yet its alſo as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that the Scripture diſtinguiſheth them not by the names of Clergy and Laity: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all Gods people are therein ſtiled the Lords Clergy or Inheritance, [1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.16.] and the Lord is called their Inheritance. And when perſons are duly choſen from amongſt the people to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000957_0004_0FAD97609124F250"/>
in the Church, as ſuch, they are no longer Lay-men, but Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And therefore we profeſs a diſlike of the name Lay-Elder, and conceive they ought to be called either Governours in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23. or Ruling-Elders: as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. not becauſe their Office is to rule alone (for the Teaching-Elder is a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler alſo,) <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Office is only to rule. Now concerning theſe Ruling-Elders, we confeſs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non quia ſoli, ſed quia ſolum praeſunt.</hi>
               </note> that they are Officers ſomewhat new &amp; ſtrange to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet not new nor ſtrange to the Word of God, nor to the Primitive Times, nor (as all know) to the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>They are not new nor ſtrange to the Word of God, neither in the Old-Teſtament, nor in the New.</hi> The Jews in the Old-Teſtament, had two ſorts of Elders, <hi>Elders of the Prieſts, and Elders of the People;</hi> ſuitable to our <hi>Teaching and Ruling Elders,</hi> as appears, <hi>Jer.</hi> 19.1. And theſe Elders of the people did ſit and vote with the Prieſts and Levites in all their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Conſiſtories, and that by divine appointment. That they were <hi>conſtituent</hi> members of the great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> appears, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. where we read, that <hi>ſome of the chief of the Fathers were joyned with the Prieſts,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000957_0005_0FAD976151378820"/>
to judge in the matters of the Lord.</hi> And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, many things among the Jews after the Captivity, did decline to diſorder and confuſion; yet we find even in the days of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, That the Elders of the people ſtill ſate and voiced in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel with the Prieſts, according to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.57, 59. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.1, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.43. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.66. and <hi>Saravia</hi> himſelf,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De diverſ. grad. Minist. Evang.</hi> cap. 11. p. 108.</note> who diſputeth ſo much againſt <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders,</hi> acknowledgeth thus much: <hi>I find indeed,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Elders in the Aſſembly of the Prieſts of the old Synagogue, which were not Prieſts; and their ſuffrages and authority in all judgments, were equal with the ſuffrages of the Prieſts.</hi> But he adds, <hi>That theſe Elders of the people, were Civil Magiſtrates;</hi> which is a poor ſhift, directly againſt many Scriptures, which contradiſtinguiſh theſe <hi>Elders</hi> from the Civil <hi>Magiſtrate;</hi> as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.5. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.33. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10.14. And though it were poſſible, that ſome of them might be Civil <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> as ſome Elders among us, are Juſtices of the Peace; Yet they did not ſit under that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, in the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> but as Eccleſiaſtical Elders.</p>
            <p>And that the Jews alſo had <hi>Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:000957_0006_0FAD976212664FD8"/>
ſitting and voting in their inferiour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories, appears (as we humbly conceive) from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. <hi>Acts</hi> 18.8, 17. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.22. In which places, we read of the Rulers of the Synagogue, who were neither Prieſts nor Levites, and yet were Rulers in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and had power, together with the Prieſts, of caſting men out of the Synagogue, and of ordering Synagogue-worſhip, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Aſſociation</hi> of the <hi>Elders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the Prieſt, in the Jewiſh Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was by Divine Appointment;</hi> for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> firſt inſtituted it, and afterwards <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> reſtored it, according as they were directed by God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8. And it did belong to the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> not as it was Jewiſh, but as it was a Church, and therefore belongeth to the Chriſtian Church, as well as Jewiſh. <hi>For whatſoever agreeth to a Church, as a Church; agreeth to every Church.</hi> There was nothing Judaical or typical in this inſtitution, but it was founded upon the light of nature, and right reaſon, which is alike in all ages.</p>
            <p>But leaving the Old Teſtament, let us conſider what may be ſaid for the Divine Right of the <hi>Ruling-Elder,</hi> out of the New-Teſtament. For this purpoſe, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready produced three places, which we ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000957_0007_0FAD9762D403EAA8"/>
now briefly open; and ſhew how the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Elder is proved out of them. The places are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p>The firſt place is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt, Apoſtles; ſecondarily, Prophets, thirdly, Teachers; After that, Miracles; then gifts of healing, helps, governments, diverſities of tongues;</hi> where we have an enumeration of ſundry Officers of the Church; and amongſt others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin in locum Chryſoſtom</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 Cor. 12.28. <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon 1 Cor. 12.28.</note> there are <hi>Helps, Governments.</hi> By <hi>Helps,</hi> are meant <hi>Deacons;</hi> (as not only our <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> but <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Eſtius,</hi> and others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) and by <hi>Governments,</hi> are meant the <hi>Ruling-Elder;</hi> which that it may the better appear, we will propound, and prove theſe ſix things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That by <hi>Governments,</hi> are meant <hi>men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing Government,</hi> the <hi>Abſtract</hi> put for the <hi>Concrete.</hi> The intent of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is not to ſpeak of <hi>Offices</hi> diſtinct from <hi>Perſons,</hi> but of <hi>Perſons exerciſing Offices.</hi> This appears firſt, by the beginning of the verſe, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in his Church;</hi> this relates to perſons, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Offices. Secondly, by the 29. and 30. verſes, where the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>concretively,</hi> of thoſe things which he had ſpoken before <hi>abſtractively. Are all workers of miracles? have
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000957_0008_0FAD976391336970"/>
all the gifts of healing? do all ſpeak with tongues,</hi> &amp;c? and ſo by conſequence, <hi>Are all helpers, are all Governours?</hi> And therefore it is, that the Syriack inſtead of <hi>helps, Governments,</hi> reads it <hi>helpers, Governours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Governour</hi> here meant, muſt needs be a <hi>Church-Governour</hi>; for it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that he is ſeated in the Church, and therefore the Civil Magiſtrate cannot be meant by this Governour, as ſome would have it; partly, becauſe this is quite beſides the whole intent and ſcope of the Chapter, treating meerly upon <hi>ſpiritual Church-matters,</hi> not at all of ſecular civil matters; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the Magiſtrate, as ſuch, is not placed by God in the <hi>Church,</hi> but in the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> and partly, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle writes of ſuch Governours, that had at that time actual exiſtence in the Church; and neither then, nor divers hundred years after, were there any <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That this <hi>Church-Governour</hi> is ſeated by God in his Church; It is a <hi>plant of Gods own planting,</hi> and therefore ſhall ſtand firm, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all oppoſition. For it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in his Church, firſt Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then helps, then Governments.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="6">6. That this Church-Governour thus ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in his Church, as a perpetual Officer, is an Officer <hi>contra-diſtinguiſhed in the Text from the</hi> Apoſtles, Prophets, Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, <hi>and all other</hi> Officers <hi>in the Church.</hi> This appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Apoſtles manner of expreſſing theſe Officers in an <hi>enumerative</hi> form; Firſt, <hi>Apoſtles; Secondarily, Prophets; Thirdly, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; After that, Miracles, then gifts of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the recapitulation, verſ. 29, 30. <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Are all workers of miracles?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the ſcope of the whole Chapter, which is to ſet down different gifts and offices in different ſubjects; It is ſaid, verſ. 8, 9. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another, the word of knowledge by the ſame Spirit; to another, faith,</hi> &amp;c. And for this purpoſe, the Apoſtle draweth a ſimile from the members of man's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: As there are different members in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000957_0011_0FAD976991BBFE48"/>
mans body, and every member hath its different office, and every member ſtands in need one of another; the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no need of thee; nor again, the head to the foot, I have no need of thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So it is in the Church Miniſterial, which is the Body of Chriſt. God hath ſet different Officers in his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome ordinary and perpetual; ſome extraordinary and temporary: And theſe different Officers, have different Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſome to teach, others to diſtribute to the poor Saints, others to govern. Are all Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers? are all Deacons? are all Church-Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? and theſe have all need one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Teacher cannot ſay to the Deacon, I have no need of thee; nor to the Church-Governour, I have no need of thee: But if all theſe Officers were in the Paſtor alone, and only, then might he truly ſay to the Deacon and Ruling-Elder, I have no need of thee. But now God hath ſo ſet the Members in his Body, which is his Church, that every member ſtands in need one of anothers help and ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If it be objected, that the Apoſtles had all theſe offices and gifts here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eminently ſeated in them; for they were Prophets, Teachers, Workers of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000957_0012_0FAD976A51496A40"/>
and therefore why may not all theſe be underſtood of one and the ſame perſon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though it be true, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had eminently all theſe; yet it is as true, that there are many here named, which had but one of theſe gifts formally ſeated in them: And it is alſo apparent, that ſome of the perſons here named were diſtinct Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church, as the Prophet, and the Teacher. Though the Apoſtles were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers, yet the Prophet and the Teacher were Officers diſtinct from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and by a parity of Reaſon, ſo were the Governours from the Apoſtle, Prophet, &amp; Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; the ſcope of the Apoſtle being (as hath been ſaid) to ſet out diſtinct Offices in diſtinct Officers: are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? The ſum of what we have ſaid from this Scripture, then is this, <hi>That God hath ſeated ſome men in his Church which have a gift and office to govern, which are neither Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and therefore they are Ruling-Elders,</hi> which is the Officer we are enquiring after.</p>
            <p>Now this interpretation which we have given, is not only the interpretation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Divines, both <hi>Lutherane</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> but of the ancient Fathers, and even

            <p>IT is requiſite that utmoſt endeavours ſhould be uſed, in order to a full ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Officers in the Churches, according to Chriſts Inſtitution. The defect of theſe Churches on this account is very lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, there being in moſt of the Churches only one Teaching Officer, for the burden of the whole Congregation to lye upon. The Lord Chriſt would not have inſtituted Paſtors, Teachers, Ruling Elders (nor the Apoſtles have ordained Elders in every Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.) if he had not ſeen there was need of them for the good of his People; and therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is both to break the ſecond Commandment, and to reflect upon the wiſdom of Chriſt, as if he did appoint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary

            <head>QUESTION.</head>
            <head type="sub">WHether are not the Brethren, and not the Elders of the Church only, to Judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Qualifications and Fitneſs, of thoſe who are Admitted into their Communion?</head>
            <head type="sub">ANSWER.</head>
            <p>There is ſome difference of Apprehenſion, and yet no breach of Amity or <hi>Union,</hi> as to this <hi>Queſtion</hi> between the Brethren of the Presbyterian, and the Congregational way, the former giving this power only to the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip,</hi> the latter joyning the <hi>Fraternity</hi> with them. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In Reſp. ad Apollon.</hi> p. 13.</note> Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and from him Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> has Judiciouſly ſtated and diſcuſſed this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. Let their and ſome other Arguments be duely weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that have power in Admiſſion have power to Judge whether the Perſons to be Admitted are duely qualified for Admiſſion. But this is true of the <hi>Fraternity</hi> as well as of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> No one can be Admitted into the Church by the Elders without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Brethren. The Community is concerned in who are Admitted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould concur therein. Its a received
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000957_0024_0FAD9777D17EAEF8"/>
maxim, <hi>Quod tangit omnes, debet ab omnibus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probari.</hi> And reaſon ſays, They that have power to Admit, have power to Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Perſons who deſire it, are fit for that Admittance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that have power to Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Perſon is fit to be caſt out of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have power to Judge whether he is fit to be received into Communion. <hi>The Key</hi> [the power] <hi>of Opening and Shutting</hi> belongs to the ſame Perſons. But it is clear from the Scripture, that the Brethren and not the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only have power to Judge whether an Offender is fit to be Excommunicated, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. All Orthodox Divines agree that Church Diſcipline ſhould be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, <hi>Conſentiente plebe.</hi> So amongſt the Ancients, <hi>Cyprian, Ambroſe, Auſtin, Jerom, Chryſoſtom, Nazianzene, Theodoret, Theophylact.</hi> And amongſt our Modren Divines, <hi>Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Melancton, Junius, Pareus, Rivet, Trelcatius.</hi> If their conſent is neceſſary, than they have power to Judge whether they ought to conſent or no.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They that have power to Judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Perſon Excommunicated, is fit to be reſtored to the Communion of the Church, have power to Judge whether Perſons never yet received into the Communion of the Church are duely qualified for that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000957_0025_0FAD9778933F5670"/>
But the Apoſtle writes to <hi>the Brethren,</hi> as well as to <hi>the Elders,</hi> of the Church in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> to reſtore a Penitent, whom they had according to the Diſcipline of Chriſt laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Church cenſure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. If the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren are competent Judges concerning the Repentance of a Lapſed Communicant, they are not incompetent Judges of the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of other Perſons that may offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Communion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When <hi>Saul</hi> deſired to joyn to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he was not admitted until the Brethren were by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> together with his own <hi>Declaration,</hi> ſatisfyed concerning the reality of his Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26, 27.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If only Elders have power to Judge who are fit to come to the Sacrament or to joyn to the Churches, then in caſe there is but one Elder in a Church (as there are very few Churches in <hi>New-Englnd</hi> that have more Elders than one) the Sole power will reſide in that one mans hands. Then by a parity of reaſon one alone would have power to ſuſpend from Communion, which Judicious Presbyterians do not allow of. For the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Miniſters in their Vindication of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Government, (<hi>p.</hi> 70, 71.) have theſe Words.
<q>It is (ſay they) as warrantable by the Word of God, for one Miniſter to aſſume
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000957_0026_0FAD9779518123E0"/>
unto himſelf alone the power of Suſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sacrament, as it is to aſſume the whole power of admitting to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for <hi>contrariorum eadem eſt ratio:</hi> For one Miniſter alone to aſſume this power to himſelf, is to make himſelf a Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pope. It is a bringing into the Church a power that would have ſome reſemblance to Auricular Confeſſion.</q>
Thus ſaid the Presbyterians Fifty years ago.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The way to keep Popery out of the World, is for the <hi>Fraternity</hi> in Churches to aſſert and maintain that power and priviledge, which does of right belong unto them. Certain it is, that in the firſt Ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity this power which we plead for, was not taken out of the hands of the Brother-hood. One of the Ancients, whoſe writings give us the greateſt in-ſight, into what was the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral practice of the Churches, in the <hi>Third Century,</hi> makes this paſt diſpute. In <note n="*" place="margin">Cyprian. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 40.</note> one of his Epiſtles, he has theſe words, <hi>Examinabuntur Singela Pruſentibus et judicantibus vobis.</hi> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Vix plebi perſuadeo et tales pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiantur admitti.</hi> That he had much adoe to perſwade the People to be ſatisfyed with the. Repentance and Qualifications of ſome that deſired a Reception or Reſtoration to their Communion. When in after times Church

Members thought with themſelves, our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters underſtand Church Affairs better than we do, therefore we will unconcern our ſelves, and leave all to their <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi>: this very thing (as ſome Learned men have obſerved) was that which made way for the riſe of Popery. It may be it will be for the Edification of ſome Readers, if we recite ſome paſſages out of our famous Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi> In his Judicious <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Part</hi> 1. <hi>Page</hi> 295, 296.</note> Treatiſe of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Churches. He has theſe Words.
<q>Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> denyes unto the People all Liberty or Ability to chuſe their own Paſtors, to judge what is meet for their own Edification, what is Hereſy, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Error, and what is not, or any thing of the like nature. This is almoſt the ſame with that of the Phariſees, concerning them who admired and followed the Doctrine of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.49. <hi>This People which know not the Low</hi>: yet was it <hi>this People,</hi> whom the Apoſtle directed to chooſe out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, Perſons meet for an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Office, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. <hi>The ſame People</hi> who joyned with the Apoſtles and Elders in the conſideration of the Grand Caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the continuation of the Legal Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and were Aſſociates with them in the determination of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>The

ſame</hi> to whom all the Apoſtolical Epiſtles, Excepting ſome to particular perſons, were written. And unto whom ſuch directions were given and duties Enjoyned in them, as ſuppoſe not only Liberty and Ability to judge for themſelves in all matters of Faith and Obedience, but alſo an eſpecial Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Order and Diſcipline of the Church, thoſe who were to ſay to <hi>Archip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> their Biſhop, <hi>take heed to the Miniſtry which thou haſt received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it, Col.</hi> 4.17. Unto whom of all ſorts it is Commanded that they ſhould Examine and <hi>Try Antichriſts, Spirits, and falſe Teachers,</hi> that is all ſorts of Hereticks, Heresies, and Errors, 1 <hi>Joh. chap.</hi> 2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>That people</hi> who even in following Ages adhered unto the Faith and the Orthodox profeſſion of it, when almoſt all the Biſhops were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Arian Hereticks. This principle of the Reformation in Vindication of the Rights, Liberties, &amp; Priviledges of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian People to judge and chooſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters of Religion, to joyn free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thoſe Church-Duties which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, without which the work of it had never been carryed on, we do abide by, and maintain. Yea, we meet with no Oppoſition more fierce, than upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our aſſerting the Liberties and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000957_0029_0FAD977E91922B40"/>
Rights of the People, in reference unto Church Order and Worſhip. But I ſhall not be afraid to ſay, that as the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was begun and carryed on, on this principle: So when <hi>this People</hi> ſhall thro' an apprehenſion of their Ignorance, Weakneſs, and <hi>Unmeetneſs to judge</hi> in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for themſelves, and their own duty, be kept and debarred from it; or when through their own ſloth, negligence and viciouſneſs they ſhall be really uncapable to manage their own Intereſt in Church Affairs, as being fit only to be Governed if not as <hi>Bruit</hi> Creatures, yet as <hi>Mute</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that theſe things are improved by the Ambition of the <hi>Clergy, ingroſſing all things in the Church to themſelves,</hi> as they did in former Ages, if the old <hi>Popedome</hi> do not return, a <hi>New One</hi> will be Erected as bad as the other.</q> Thus far Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
