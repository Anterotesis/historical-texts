            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THESE States are at preſent expoſed to very threatening dangers. Whether <hi>France</hi> has been juſtly provoked by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the late Preſident and his ſucceſſor, or by the temper that placed the laſt in his ſtation, will not now be enquired. The <hi>fact</hi> is, that <hi>France</hi> is provoked. What the conſequences of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment may be, demands our moſt ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p>She ſtill believes, that a great body of <hi>American</hi> citizens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards her and the cauſe in which ſhe is engaged, with the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt affection. She believes rightly: But it is poſſible, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable too—that a ſingle manoeuvre of our <hi>conſtituted authorities</hi> may convince her, that the nation is hoſtile to her and her cauſe; and this conviction may inſtantly ſnap the thread, by which a naked ſword is ſuſpended over our head.</p>
            <p>SOME MANOEUVRE OF THIS KIND IS MEDITATED: But, a hope is entertained, that even the obſtinacy attendant upon littleneſs of genius, ſo dull in diſtinguiſhing between wiſdom and paſſions, the raſhneſs of ſhort-ſighted policy, the mouth-filling ſelfiſhneſs of office-ſeeking orators, and the blinding vanity of youthful fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voliſts, that fiddles in declamations amidſt the flames of their country, will at length give way to dictates of PRUDENCE, if not of patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>"The film removed"—"the ſeat of mental ſight" may then perhaps diſtinctly diſcern the important objects that claim in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attention—</p>
            <p>"And, IT HAS MUCH TO SEE."</p>

The Executive Directory have proclaimed their reſolution to "CONQUER" <hi>Britain,</hi> and are preparing the means for carrying that reſolution into effect.</p>
            <p>To the accompliſhment of this deſign, the Republic is ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by three of the moſt exciting motives, that ever agitated the mind of a people. Firſt—to humble a rival, that for many centuries has been formidable and hurtful; and in the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been the principal inſtigator and ſupporter of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition, that aimed deſtruction at her territorial integrity and national liberty; and therefore, in her account is juſtly charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with all the <hi>French</hi> blood that has been ſhed, and all the <hi>French</hi> treaſure that has been expended.</p>
            <p>Secondly—to obtain compenſation for the injuries that have been ſuſtained. The vaſt debts incurred by the Republic, and due to their meritorious armies and other deſerving creditiors, muſt be paid, and EITHER BY FRANC OR BRITAIN.</p>
            <p>Thirdly—to extinguiſn the <hi>Britiſh</hi> domination over the oceans; thus to become the deliverers of mankind from an oppreſſive deſpotiſm on that element, and then by an enlightened and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policy, to promote permanent peace, and a friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe amongſt nations, and build their fame and happineſs, on the ſolid foundations of benefactions to the human race.—There is reaſon to believe, that their philanthropy means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend effectual relief, to thoſe outcaſts of modern mercies, the weeping—bleeding children of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>

            <p>Inſtead of imitating the <hi>Roman</hi> policy, of ſettling colonies among conquered nations, to enforce their ſubjection, <hi>France</hi> more generouſly and more wiſely, waves her enfranchiſing hand over their heads, and with the voice of power and humanity bids them riſe up FREE STATES.

            <p>How much farther the triumphs of benevolence may extend, it is not difficult to foreſee.

            <p>What power upon the Globe can prevent this exaltation? None, but the <hi>Britiſh</hi> maritime dominion. <hi>France</hi> then, to the utmoſt exertion of all her hitherto-irreſiſtable energies, will ſtrike at that dominion.</p>

            <p>Some perſons indeed among us, ſpeak of the naval power of <hi>Britain</hi> as invincible, and in a manner as everlaſting. But theſe ebulitions ſeem to be ſuggeſted by paſſion, peculiar intereſts, and particular predilections, that have latterly introduced a great deal of fanciful ſpeculations in polities, and concerning meaſures that involve our beſt welfare.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſpeculations, like ſome of other kinds, after amuſing the adventurers with golden proſpects for months or years, bring upon them heavy reſponſibilities, before the maturation of their alchymiſtical materials can be completed. We ſee enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to be convinced, that the whole projection is vaniſhing into air—"into thin air".</p>
            <p>In contemplating HOW <hi>France</hi> can invade <hi>Britain,</hi> it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that the true queſtion is not—Whether the former, with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> will be able ſend out ſuch Fleets, as by ſucceſſive engagements will acquire the dominion of the ocean—but, whether in exiſting circumſtances, <hi>France</hi> will be able to ſend into <hi>Britain,</hi> acroſs the narrow ſea that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates them, ſuch an army as will abſolutely preſcribe the terms of peace.</p>
            <p>However, let us make ſome reflections on the firſt queſtion.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> were contending for Empire, if not for ſafety, <hi>Rome</hi> had no ſhips of war, and did not know how to build them. <hi>Carthage</hi> had been for ages miſtreſs of the ſeas.<note n="*" place="bottom">After all her loſſes in the two preceding conteſts, <hi>Catha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> In the concluſion, after many battles by ſea, and a war of more than twenty years continuance, the <hi>Romans</hi> were conquerors at ſea, as well as at land. The reſources of the two parties were much nearer to an equality, than thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> now are.</p>
            <p>The predeceſſor of <hi>Alfred</hi> the great, "leſt his ſubjects and ſucceſſors in the moſt dangerous and diſtreſsful circumſtances". The afflicted nation ſeemed likely to periſh: and that truly great Prince was obliged for ſome time to conceal himſelf from his enemies in deep retirement. At length he left his retreat, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033647_0007_0FF7B826D75FB420"/>had many conflicts with the <hi>Danes,</hi> who covered as it were the neighbouring ſeas with their fleets, and were continually and cruelly harraſſing <hi>England</hi> with invaſions. The King was very ſenſible of the diſadvantages his ſubjects laboured under, for want of a ſufficient fleet to meet their enemies at ſea, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their landing, and was very deſirous of ſupplying that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p>"But (ſays a judicious hiſtorian) there is nothing in the world more difficult, than to reſtore a naval power when it is fallen into decay, in a country where there is little trade, to furniſh ſhips, and to be a nurſery for ſeamen; and in the face of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who are maſters of the ſea.

            </p>
            <p>In another place the hiſtorian takes notice, that "<hi>Alfred,</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Fleets, commanded ſhips to be built of <hi>a new conſtruction.</hi> They were of about twice the length of the former, and much more lofty; which made them much ſwifter ſailers, more ſteady in the water, and not ſo apt to roll.

            <p>If we compare the <hi>French</hi> with either of the before mentioned powers, it will be found, that they will have much leſs difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to contend with, for obtaining the dominion of the ſeas, than the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Anglo-Saxons</hi> had.</p>
            <p>Let us now turn our attention to the ſecond queſtion.</p>
            <p>The firſt reflection that offers itſelf to conſideration on this head, is the prodigious diſproportion of <hi>population</hi> and <hi>native ſtrength</hi> between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> not to inſiſt on the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous addition to that diſproportion by the <hi>allies</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> two of the greateſt maritime powers in <hi>Europe,</hi> excited as they muſt be to the moſt ardent co-operation with her, by the vaſt pledges they have dependant on the iſſue, and by the proofs ſhe has given in her late negociations, that ſhe contends for <hi>their</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts as pertinaciouſly as for her own—while <hi>Britain</hi> is left alone.</p>
            <p>The next reflection that preſents itſelf, is the relative ſituation of the two countries.</p>
            <p>

From <hi>Breſt</hi> directly oppoſite to <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the <hi>Texel</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk, France</hi> has theſe interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ports, well adapted for fitting out large armaments—<hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, Havre, Saint Vallori,</hi> with the river <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and <hi>Oſtend.</hi> Which of theſe places, and how many of them, or what others, will afford the beſt points for making their "dreadful notes of preparation", the ſkill and ingenuity of the <hi>French</hi> will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon principles as indiſputable as geometrical axioms or mathematical demonſtrations. Certain it is, that as to all of them, the winds that may be favourable to the enterprizes of <hi>France,</hi> will be adverſe to her enemy. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> hiſtory abounds with inſtances of this kind; and not winds only may conſpire to render plans of invaſion ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Allectus,</hi> the ſucceſſor of the famous <hi>Carauſcius</hi> reigned in <hi>Britain,</hi> he was maſter of the ſeas. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> reſolved to recover <hi>Britain,</hi> and accordingly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a very large fleet at <hi>Boulogne.</hi> Now in paſſing, to avoid an enemy too ſtrong for them, was the only difficulty. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Engliſh</hi> hiſtorian ſays—"The ROMANS, under the cover of a thick fog, eſcaped the fleet of <hi>Allectus;</hi> and <hi>convinced</hi> the BRITONS, that <hi>a ſuperiority of naval ſtrength</hi> will not <hi>always</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their country from a foreign invaſion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Gibb.

            <p>On the firſt of <hi>November</hi> 1688, <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and ſoon afterwards King of <hi>England,</hi> ſailed from <hi>Holland</hi> with a fleet of fifty men of war, twenty five frigates, and as many fire-ſhips, and near four hundred other veſſels. In leſs than two days he was between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fleet of <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, conſiſting of ſixty one men of war, of which thirty eight were of the line of battle, lay at the <hi>Gunfleet</hi> near the <hi>Thames,</hi> to intercept the <hi>Dutch:</hi> but, the <hi>Dutch</hi> paſſed the <hi>Gunfleet</hi> in a very hazy day, while the winds were extremely unfavourable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fleet. The <hi>Dutch</hi> very deliberately coaſted along all the ſouthern parts of <hi>England,</hi> from its eaſtern point the <hi>North Foreland</hi> at the mouth of the <hi>Channel,</hi> to within a few miles of its weſternmoſt County. Yet, after all the protraction of this voyage, the whole army of horſe and foot was on ſhore, at <hi>Torbay</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> before the end of the <hi>fourth</hi> day from its beginning. "The wind prevented Lord <hi>Dartmouth,</hi>" entirely devoted to <hi>James's</hi> cauſe, "who was <hi>come in ſight of the Dutch fleet,</hi> from attacking it, and obliged him to go into <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Rapin's Hiſt. of England, XII. 140-145.</note>

            <p>Several other inſtances of ſuch expeditions made with equal quickneſs, might be enumerated. In reality <hi>the Channel</hi> is only a large ferry.</p>
            <p>The motives, by which <hi>France</hi> is impelled to an invaſion of <hi>Britain,</hi> are of the moſt imperious nature. They will bring into requiſition not only all her ability and all her diligence, but—all her genius and all her knowledge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britiſh</hi> confeſs, that the <hi>French</hi> are perfect maſters of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val architecture. If they ſhall not be able to collect, as ſoon as they wiſh, a ſufficient number of men of war, to protect an army in its paſſage, probably they will ſupply that deficiency, by building ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting fortreſſes as the world has never yet ſeen: for, their actions in other reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cks, have tranſcended all former examples of human archievement.</p>
            <p>The prize at which they now aim, is in their eyes too ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to be abandoned. The greatneſs of obſtacles and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033647_0010_0FF7B839D8A9A8E0"/>will enhance its value. It is in their opinion, conſecrated by the blood of their fellow-citizens that has been poured out in the cauſe. They will not think <hi>any thing</hi> that <hi>has been</hi> gained, is commenſurate to their rights or intereſts. To leave <hi>Britain</hi> reigning on any element, will in their eſtimation be ingratitude to their brethren who are no more, and treaſon againſt their poſterity. The old <hi>Roman</hi> denunciation, "DELINDA EST CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAGO," rings from the <hi>Rhine</hi> to the <hi>Pyrennees,</hi> and from the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to the <hi>Ocean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, it is within the bounds of probability, that wooden fortreſſes may be conſtructed, mounting ſuch artillery as no firſt-rate can oppoſe with ſucceſs. Unincumbered with maſts ſails and other rigging, and therefore drawing leſs water, and capable of carrying more artillery, a ſufficient celerity may be given to their motion, if towed by gallies driven forward with the united force of ſails and oars, eſpecially if it be conſidered, that for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months in every year, the <hi>Channel</hi> is very ſmooth. It is likely, that <hi>Alfred</hi>'s ſhips of <hi>"a new conſtruction"</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, were as extraordinary in his age, as ſuch fortreſſes would be now.</p>
            <p>A knowledge of all nautical circumſtances, will enable the planners of invaſion, to calculate exactly the time that will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the arrival of the armament on the oppoſite ſhore. Proper perſons raiſed up in baloons, and furniſhed with the beſt glaſſes, may diſcern every veſſel within ſight to a vaſt diſtance. The poſſibility and quantity of any reſiſtance by them, can then be preciſely aſcertained. If intelligence from places more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote is wanted, telegraphs can dart it, with any requiſite ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity.</p>

               <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his life of <hi>Demetrius Poliorcetes,</hi> ſays—"His great divertiſement was in building gallies, and inventing engines of war; and having naturally a genius addicted to mechanics, he did not apply it to making uſeleſs toys, after the humour of ſome other princes, who ſpent their vacant hours in painting, muſic, or turning, &amp;c."—"But, the mechanic inventions of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> tho' deſigned for uſe and ſervice, had ſomething noble and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent withall; and the wonderful contrivance of them was ſo uncommon, that one might eaſily read the character of <hi>a great mind</hi> and <hi>extraordinary genius</hi> in the artifice.
