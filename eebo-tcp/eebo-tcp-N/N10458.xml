            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the laſt New-York mail I received a letter from CHARLES, informing me of your Lordſhip's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Italy,</hi> and your reſolution of ſpending a few months at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I well know your particular attachment to the agreeable ſociety of <hi>Magdalen-Hall,</hi> and

could almoſt wiſh myſelf for a few weeks upon the banks of <hi>Iſis,</hi> that I might be an humble partaker of that <hi>feaſt of reaſon and that flow of ſoul,</hi> in which you bear ſo illuſtrious a part. But I muſt ſtay out the time of my tranſportation. <note n="*" place="bottom">A merry alluſion to the caſe of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victs, who are ſentenced to be tranſported to America for a certain number of years.</note> Two years at leaſt was the period, which my good Lord H— allotted me to ſpend in this, and one or two neighbouring provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of North-America. Think not, however, that I repine at my ſituation. I am delighted with this country. <hi>The</hi> NEW WORLD <hi>is indeed launched forth,</hi> and has proceeded more than half-way <hi>to meet the</hi> OLD. But if the country itſelf was not ſo charming, as it really muſt appear to every impartial eye, yet I have been placed in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013258_0011_0F904C5E74486258"/>
as could not fail of making any ſpot upon earth agreeable. I have been happily introduced to a ſet of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whoſe hoſpitality, good ſenſe, and good humour, do honour to human nature. I am entertained at a merchant's houſe in this city, who is of the ſect of people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and is poſſeſſed of as much urbanity and true politeneſs as I have ever met with.</p>
               <p>I am now ſitting at a window, that overlooks the majeſtic <hi>Delaware,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with which our <hi>Iſis</hi> and <hi>Cherwell,</hi> though immortalized in ſong, would appear but little babbling brooks. The woods along the oppoſite ſhore of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> are clothed in their brighteſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and afford a pleaſing reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to the eye, after it hath glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced acroſs the watry mirror. Whilſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013258_0012_0F904C5F47008AA0"/>
I am writing this, three topſail veſſels, wafted along by a gentle ſouthern breeze, are paſſing by my window. The voice of induſtry perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds along the ſhore; and every wharf within my view is ſurrounded with groves of maſts, and heaped with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of every kind, from almoſt every quarter of the globe.</p>
               <p>I cannot behold this lively active ſcene, without lamenting, that the ſtreams of commerce ſhould ever be checked in their courſe, or directed to wander in other channels, than thoſe which they now poſſeſs. Was your Lordſhip to be but a few months on the ſpot, you would feel the force of this reflection; and I am ſure, your juſtly-acquired influence in a Britiſh Parliament would ſoon be exerted to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013258_0013_0F904C5FEDAB7F70"/>
the clamours of jealouſy, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the miſinformed zeal of true patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm. I know that you move in a much larger ſphere, than is generally circumſcribed by the hand of party; and if you have hitherto voted on the ſide of Adminiſtration, it was becauſe you have hitherto apprehended it to be the ſide of juſtice: For your honeſt heart is ever ready to embrace TRUTH, even when introduced to you in the form of a JUNIUS or a WILKLS.—But I am not going to enter upon the field of politicks—This I leave to CHARLES, who has often told us, that he would not give a farthing for a converſation that was not well ſeaſoned with <hi>religion</hi> or <hi>politics.</hi> I only mean to entertain your Lordſhip at preſent, with a ſhort account of what I have ſeen and heard ſince I have been in this city.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013258_0014_0F904C60C10D6CA8"/>Dean PRIDEAUX, in his connection of the Old and New Teſtament, ſpeaks of WILLIAM PENN'S having laid out his new city after the plan of BABYLON. Perhaps it might be difficult at this time of day to aſcertain, what this plan was. Be this as it may, I am not ſo well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in antiquity as to be able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, whether there is the leaſt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or not betwixt BABYLON and PHILADELPHIA. Of this, however, your Lordſhip may be certain, that no city could be laid out with more beauty and regularity than PHILADELPHIA. Its ſtreets croſs each other at right an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles: Thoſe which run from north to ſouth being parallel to each other, as well as thoſe from eaſt to weſt. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the vaſt progreſs that has been already made, a conſiderable time muſt elapſe before the whole plan is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013258_0015_0F904C63A83F7B68"/>
The buildings from north to ſouth, along the bank of the Delaware, including the ſuburbs, now extend near two miles, and thoſe from eaſt to weſt, about half a mile from the river. But, according to the original plan, they are to extend as far, nay farther, I believe, than the beautiful river <hi>Schuylkill,</hi> which runs about two miles weſt of <hi>Delaware.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal ſtreet, which is an hundred feet wide, would have a noble appearance, were it not for an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived court-houſe, and a long range of ſhambles, which they have ſtuck in the very middle of it. This may, indeed, be very convenient for the inhabitants, and on their market-days exhibits ſuch a ſcene of plenty, as is ſcarcely to be equalled by any ſingle market in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013258_0016_0F904C66490B8570"/>
—But I am apt to think, that moveable ſtalls, contrived ſo as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſhelter from the weather, would have anſwered the purpoſe full as well, and then the avenue might have been left entirely open.—The ſtreets are all well paved in the middle for carriages, and there is a foot-path of hard bricks on each ſide next the houſes.—The houſes in general are plain, but not elegant, for the moſt part built upon the ſame plan, a few excepted, which are finiſhed with ſome taſte, and neatly decorated within.—The ſtreets are well lighted by lamps, placed at proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; and watchmen and ſcavengers <note n="*" place="bottom">The author has been miſinformed in this article—There are no ſcavengers in Philadelphia yet, but it is hoped, that a regulation of this kind will ſoon take place.</note> are conſtantly employed for ſecurity and cleanlineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:013258_0017_0F904C6752BA4BD8"/>Almoſt every ſect in Chriſtendom have here found an happy aſylum; and ſuch is the Catholick ſpirit that prevails, that I am told, they have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and chearfully aſſiſted each other in erecting their ſeveral places of worſhip.—Theſe places too generally partake of the plainneſs and neatneſs of their dwelling houſes, being ſeldom enriched by any coſtly ornaments. Here are three churches that uſe the liturgy and ceremonies of our Church of England; but only two of them are under any epiſcopal juriſdiction. <note n="*" place="bottom">Since the firſt publication of theſe letters, the Biſhop of London, at the earneſt requeſt of the veſtry-men and congregation of <hi>St. Paul</hi>'s Church, has ordained and licenſed their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</note> CHRIST-CHURCH has by far the moſt venerable appearance of any building in this city; and the whole architecture,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013258_0018_0F904C68B0ECA0B0"/>
including an elegant ſteeple, (which is furniſhed with a complete ring of bells) would not diſgrace one of the fineſt ſtreets in Weſtminſter. The eaſtern front is particularly well deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and executed; but its beauty is in a great meaſure loſt, by its being ſet too near the ſtreet, inſtead of being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as it ought to have been, forty or fifty feet back.</p>
               <p>The STATE-HOUSE, as it is called, is a large plain building, two ſtories high—The lower ſtory is divided into two large rooms, in one of which the Provincial Aſſembly meet, and in the other the Supreme Court of Judicature is held—The upper ſtory conſiſts of a long gallery which is generally uſed for public entertainments, and two rooms adjoining it, one of which is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013258_0019_0F904C6906A94AB0"/>
for the Governor and his Council; the other, I believe, is yet unoccupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In one of the wings, which join the main building, by means of a brick arcade, is depoſited a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble collection of books, belonging to a number of the citizens, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated by the name of THE LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRARY COMPANY OF PHILADELPHIA. To this library I have free acceſs by favour of my friend the merchant, who is one of the company. You would be aſtoniſhed, my Lord, at the general taſte for books, which prevails among all orders and ranks of people in this city.—The librari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an aſſured me, that for one perſon of diſtinction and fortune, there were twenty tradeſmen that frequented this library.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:013258_0020_0F904C69D8B6CC28"/>Behind and adjoining to the State-houſe, was ſome time ſince erected a tower, of ſuch miſerable architecture, that the Legiſlature have wiſely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to let it go to decay (the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part being entirely of wood) that it may hereafter be built upon a new and more elegant conſtruction. Mr. F—, the late ſpeaker of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with whom I have ſeveral times converſed, informed me, that the plot of ground on which the State-houſe ſtands, and which is one of the ſquares of the city, is to be planted with trees, and divided into walks, for the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the citizens. I could not help obſerving to him, that it would be a conſiderable improvement of their plan, if the Legiſlature could purchaſe another ſquare, which lies to the ſouth of this, and apply it to the ſame ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013258_0021_0F904C6A7052ED08"/>
purpoſe; as otherwiſe, their walks muſt be very contracted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they make them of a circular or ſerpentine form.</p>
               <p>The internal police of this city is extremely well regulated. You ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hear of any ſuch mobs or riots, as I am told, are frequent among their northern neighbours. The poor are amply provided for, and lodged and boarded in a very large and commodious building, to which they have given the name of THE HOUSE OF EMPLOYMENT; becauſe all ſuch as are able to work are here em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the different trades or manufactures to which they were brought up. This building likewiſe ſtands upon one of the city ſquares,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013258_0022_0F904C6B3A1621E8"/>
and when compleated, will form a quadrangle, as large, and of much the ſame appearance, as ſome of our colleges. In paſſing through the apartments, I obſerved and pointed out to one of the managers, who was ſo obliging as to accompany me, an inconvenience, which he aſſured me, would be rectified, as ſoon as their funds would admit of it, <hi>viz.</hi> The want of a few little private rooms, for the better accommodation of ſuch poor, as have formerly lived in good circumſtances, and whoſe miſery muſt needs be conſiderably heightened by their being obliged to board and lodge in the ſame common and open apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the vileſt of their ſpecies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:013258_0023_0F904C6BEB577198"/>For the ſick and lunatick an HOSPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAL has been erected, by private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, under the particular coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and encouragement of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature.—The building is ſtill unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.—I walked round it—but did not chooſe to venture into this retreat of human woe, as I had formerly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much from a viſit to Bedlam.</p>
               <p>Whilſt I was at breakfaſt one day laſt week with Dr. M—, whom I had ſeen at Oxford ſome years ago, he received a card to attend a Public Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement at the College the next day.—As I expreſſed a deſire of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him there, if it ſhould not be inconvenient, he very politely called upon me in the morning, and took me into the apparatus-room, where the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013258_0024_0F904C6CB1F12BE8"/>
Truſtees or Governors of the College were met. There is no place or ſcene, that I have viſited, ſince my arrival in America, at which I more ardently wiſhed for your Lordſhip's preſence, than this. I accompanied the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Truſtees and Profeſſors into their public hall. The Provoſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Commencement with two or three Collects of our Liturgy, well choſen and adapted to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, together with an excellent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his own compoſition. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes were ſome in Engliſh, and ſome in Latin, conſiſting of Foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and Syllogiſtic Diſputations, and ſeveral little eſſays in the declamato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, which the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for the moſt part, delivered with propriety of pronunciation and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013258_0025_0F904C6D859F1640"/>
action; though a Gentleman who ſat next to me, declared, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent candidates were by no means equal to many who had received the honours of this Seminary. Their pronunciation of the Latin, indeed, ſeemed to be a little defective; and yet they have an excellent pattern in the Gentleman who preſided during the acts, who ſpake with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctneſs, and paid due regard to the quantity and emphaſis.</p>
               <p>The peculiar attention that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this Seminary to the Engliſh language, is worthy of being imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Univerſities and Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at home.—They have a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor here, whoſe ſole buſineſs it is to teach boys their native tongue gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013258_0026_0F904C6E342B4920"/>
and inſtruct them in the method of reading and pronouncing it with propriety. For this purpoſe, he is frequently exerciſing them in little ſpeeches, extracted from plays, parliamentary debates, Roman hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, poems, ſermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I am told, that the Seminary owes much of its preſent reputation to this part of its plan.</p>
               <p>The Profeſſor of Languages has the Latin and Greek ſchool in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent order, both with reſpect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and diſcipline; and he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, that he had ſeldom leſs than eighty or ninety boys under his care.— The higher claſſics are read in the Philoſophical ſchools, under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Provoſt and Vice-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013258_0027_0F904C6FAF8F1838"/>
who give lectures in Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Mathematics, Logic, Rhetoric, Natural and Moral Philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Upon the College has lately been engrafted a medical ſchool, with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in all the branches neceſſary to complete a medical education.— So that they have now annually a courſe of Lectures in Anatomy, the Theory and Practice of Phyſic, Bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Materia Medica, and Chymiſtry. Pupils from all parts of the continent, I am told, have crouded to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia ſince this ſchool was opened, as the advantages here are thought to be almoſt equal to thoſe in Europe. Nothing now ſeems to be wanting to render this Seminary an <hi>Univerſity</hi> in the largeſt ſenſe of the word, but two
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013258_0028_0F904C706CB42B08"/>
more profeſſorſhips, one in Divinity, and the other in Civil and Municipal Law. The firſt of theſe, however, is ſupplied by the Provoſt himſelf, who reads a courſe of Divinity-Lectures, when any of his pupils declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves candidates for the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>One thing I muſt not omit, which cannot fail of giving pleaſure to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent heart; and that is, that to this College is annexed a <hi>Charitable School,</hi> in which youth of both ſexes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all the neceſſary parts of a common Engliſh education. A mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of my acquaintance aſſured me, that he knew ſeveral inſtances of the happy effects of this charity; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, that the young man, to whom he intruſted the chief part of his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013258_0029_0F904C71454BCA08"/>
buſineſs, had received his education wholly at this ſchool.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of Philadelphia, in the very center of the Britiſh colonies, the manners of its inhabitants, the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and catholic plan of this Seminary, which exceeds any thing I ever met with at home or abroad, together with the moderate expence of a learned edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation here, are circumſtances, which, I am perſwaded, muſt give this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the preference to any that are, or may be erected in North-America; and I doubt not, but that the inhabitants of the Weſt-India Iſlands, many of whom have been well educated, and have an high taſte for literature, did they once make the experiment, would ſoon be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſucceſs to prefer an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013258_0030_0F904C73F4B1C2E8"/>
can to an Engliſh education, at leaſt for the earlier ſeaſon of their children's lives. For my part, I muſt confeſs, in ſpite of all my prejudices in favour of our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Oxford,</hi> that, had I a ſon, I ſhould certainly chooſe to let him go through a courſe of education at Philadelphia College, before I ventured to ſend him to that Univerſity.—For your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip well knows, that what we princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally expect from ſpending a few years at Oxford or Cambridge, are, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities we have there of converſing with men of genius, and forming ſuch uſeful and agreeable connections, as may contribute not a little to our future happineſs in life.</p>
               <p>The very ingenious Dr. F—N, who, your Lordſhip may remember
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013258_0031_0F904C754D149648"/>
was introduced to you one evening at the D—of N —d's, and who has been celebrated all over Europe for his diſcoveries in electricity, was among the firſt projectors of this inſtitution: And I recollect, a few days ſince, to have heard a Gentleman of this city, who is a friend to literature, and no enemy to Dr. F—N, expreſs an ardent wiſh, that he would relinquiſh his political employments, and once more reſume the Philoſophical Chair; adding, that the calm regions of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> would, in his opinion, agree much better with the Doctor's genius and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, than the ſtormy element of <hi>Politics.</hi>—Certain it is, that his fellow-citizens acknowlege themſelves much indebted to him for many of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtitutions, that do honour to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013258_0032_0F904C75C73DA728"/>
their city and province. Nor are they without hopes, that he will yet return to his native Country, and employ the remainder of his days in aſſiſting them to compleat the ſeveral plans, for the ſucceſs of which he once appeared to be ſo much in earneſt.</p>
               <p>The College, however, is at preſent in good hands. Gentlemen of the firſt diſtinction for learning and fortune are among its Truſtees. The Provoſt is well known for his literary character and excellent compoſitions, both in Europe and America. He was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly patronized by the late good and learned Archbiſhop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whoſe memory your Lordſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres; and by his influence, obtained his Majeſty's brief for a collection
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013258_0033_0F904C767B7252A0"/>
throughout England for the joint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Seminary, and that of New-York. Your Lordſhip, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, was a contributor; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed your high approbation of the liberal and generous plan, on which it was founded. This plan is moſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly adhered to; and though among nine Profeſſors, there are but three of the church of England, yet this is not owing to any neglect or diſreſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the members of our communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe no more than theſe three have hitherto preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as candidates for any Profeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and the Truſtees never enquire into the religious profeſſion, (provided it be proteſtant) but ſolely into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary merit and moral character of thoſe that offer. The Vice-Provoſt is one of the eldeſt and moſt reſpectable
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013258_0034_0F904C77470B7398"/>
Miniſters of the Preſbyterian Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and has the honour of being among the firſt that introduced Science into this heretofore untutored wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>I could not help expreſſing my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, in a converſation I had ſome time ſince with Mr. G—y (an eminent and worthy Lawyer in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and now Speaker of the Houſe of Aſſembly) that the Legiſlature ſhould never have taken this Seminary under their protection. The Hoſpital and Houſe of Employment, I obſerved, had been favoured with their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And, as the cultivation of the human mind is an object of much higher importance, than the care of the body; and the advantages derived from this College to the city and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, muſt needs be very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013258_0035_0F904C77EC33EB00"/>
I could not but think it very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entitled to ſome ſhare of their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. I do not recollect this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's anſwer;—but I make no doubt, upon a proper application that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and intereſt would be chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerted in that Honourable Houſe, to obtain an handſome endowment for this inſtitution.</p>
               <p>I have been the more minute and circumſtantial in my account of the College, as I know your Lordſhip is particularly intereſted in the progreſs of literature; and I am happy in an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of affording you a little enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, that will be agreeable to your taſte.</p>

                  </hi> at <hi>NEW-YORK.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>LIBERTY, dear CHARLES, is the genius of Pennſylvania. Its inhabitants think, and ſpeak, and act from her immediate inſpiration. The pooreſt labourer upon the ſhore of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware</hi> thinks himſelf intitled to deliver his ſentiments in matters of religion or politics with as much freedom as the gentleman or the ſcholar. Indeed, there is leſs diſtinction among the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> than among thoſe of any civilized city in the world. Riches give none. For every man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects one day or another to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013258_0038_0F904C7A2BC189C0"/>
a footing with his wealthieſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;—and in this hope, ſhews him no cringing ſervility, but treats him with a plain, though reſpectful fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity. Offices or poſts of honour give none—but ſuch as every wiſe and virtuous man would allow to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the ſupport of government. Literary accompliſhments here meet with deſerved applauſe. But ſuch is the prevailing taſte for books of every kind, that almoſt every man is a reader; and by pronouncing ſentence, right or wrong, upon the various publications that come in his way, puts himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a level, in point of knowledge, with their ſeveral authors. This, you will ſay, is not peculiar to the <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians,</hi> but may ſerve as a general character for moſt readers in the world— Be it ſo—You may ſee in one portrait
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013258_0039_0F904C7B091A1018"/>
the reſemblance of many a face—But the ſtrength of the <hi>contour,</hi> the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arrangement of the features, the countenance, or ſome other ſtriking circumſtance, reminds you of the friend that it reſembles moſt.</p>
               <p>I mean not by this obſervation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate any thing to the diſadvantage of the <hi>Philadelphians.</hi>—I love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them too much to harbour even a thought of the kind. Their conduct uniformly flows from that ſpirit of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which they inherit from a Britiſh anceſtry, which has not been ſuffered to degenerate, but has rather acquired new vigour by being tranſplanted into an American ſoil.—Freedom of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will neceſſarily lead to freedom of ſpeech; and though an honeſt mind will ſometimes be miſtaken in its opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013258_0040_0F904C7BB3728458"/>
of men and things, yet its very miſtakes are pardonable, inaſmuch as they proceed not from a depraved heart, but a miſinformed judgment. I love to hear a plain man deliver his real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with that downright bluntneſs, which is generally characteriſtic of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; though it may ſometimes be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly aſſumed to hide a deceitful, or countenance an impertinent, temper.</p>
               <p>Sitting the other day in one of the coffee-houſe boxes, I heard a perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me giving his ſentiments upon the letters of JUNIUS, one of which he had juſt been reading: "I have no pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence," ſaid he, <q>with the admirers of this writer.—Fine-turned periods, brilliant ſimilitudes, and choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, may charm a ſuperficial reader.—They are very pretty—but
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013258_0041_0F904C7D12F491D0"/>
then their dazzling beauty ſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the inferior faculties, that the judgment is not at liberty to examine the ſentiments, if there be any, which they are intended to recommend and enforce.—Take from JUNIUS all his well-dreſſed perſonal invectives againſt his Sovereign and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and try to find out what is his real aim, or whether liberty is ſo much in danger, as he would have us apprehend, from the D— of G— and his puny aſſociates;— and I believe you will be tempted to think, that he is only playing a part in a <hi>Farce,</hi> whoſe title ſhould be <hi>Much ado about nothing.</hi>—For my part, I do really look upon all I have ſeen of his writings, to be no better than refined <hi>Billingſgate— Rogue</hi> and <hi>raſcal</hi> would not have
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013258_0042_0F904C7D32C3E538"/>
anſwered his purpoſe ſo well—or he would have uſed them without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>critique</hi> upon JUNIUS, whether it be juſt or not, ſeems to agree very well with the appellation you once gave him, of <hi>the Knight of the poliſhed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>—For, I ſuppoſe you meant, that his armour, though <hi>dazzling bright,</hi> was far from being <hi>proof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Parties, I am told, ſome time ago, ran pretty high in this place.—Some were for changing the <hi>Proprietary</hi> into a <hi>Regal</hi> government;—for what reaſon I have not been able to diſcover; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they could imagine, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration at home, would be more anxious to preſerve their privileges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate, than a <hi>family,</hi> whoſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013258_0043_0F904C7DF36BD568"/>
intereſt it muſt needs be ſo to do. All is calm and ſerene at preſent.— People of different opinions can now talk with coolneſs upon the ſubject, and all ſeem to be united in one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſire to promote the real intereſts of their province.</p>
               <p>So much, dear CHARLES, for one of your favourite topics. If you want to know more of the politics of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you muſt come here and obſerve for yourſelf; —for, I confeſs, I am not equal to the taſk.</p>
               <p>I have tranſmitted to my LORD P— as circumſtantial an account as I could get of the plan of this city, and its many improvements and inſtitutions, together with a little hiſtory of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of literature, which you know, is
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013258_0044_0F904C7EAA55D460"/>
quite in his way. I have met with no hiſtory of this province, that deſerves notice.—What have been publiſhed are merely partial narratives of their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal debates, which are far from being the leaſt entertaining or inſtructive.— I wiſh to ſee a regular, ſenſible, and well written hiſtory of Pennſylvania, from its firſt ſettlement to the preſent period, which might compriſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting account of the labours of its venerable founder, the progreſs of Commerce, of Arts and Sciences, the gradual improvement of taſte and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the riſe of the various ſects of religion.—I know but one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in this city, who is capable of executing ſuch a work; and, I fear his preſent engagements, if he ſhould have an inclination, would not afford him ſufficient leiſure for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:013258_0045_0F904C8138A4BB80"/>Many excellent productions in the literary way have been publiſhed here. —That ſpirit of freedom, which I have already mentioned, hath given birth even to Orators and Poets; many of whoſe performances I have heard and read with the higheſt ſatisfaction. —Some of theſe, perhaps, I may have an opportunity of communicating to my Lord P—, or yourſelf, in the courſe of our correſpondence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. G— is returned from Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.—I thank you heartily for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending me to ſo valuable an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I am happy in her agreeable and ſprightly converſation;—and ſhe has introduced me to a circle of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at whoſe tea-tables I am ſure of finding delicacy without prudery, and wit without ill-nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013258_0046_0F904C8249274300"/>This will be delivered to you by the very polite MAJOR S—, who tells me, that he is well acquainted with your Uncle COL. MARSEILLES, and was in the ſame corps with him, under the Duke, at the unhappy affair at <hi>Minden.</hi> He adds, likewiſe, that your Uncle was the intimate friend of COL. ROSS, and was very near that amiable officer, when he was killed at the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of FONTENOY.</p>

                  <hi>LETTER III.</hi> To the <hi>RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY CAROLINE S</hi>—, at <hi>BATH.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I AM truly concerned, my honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady, at the account which Lord H—gives me of your preſent indiſpoſition:—But I hope a proper regimen, with a cautious uſe of the Bath waters, which, I am told, have been very ſerviceable in ſuch caſes as your's, will afford you a ſpeedy reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.—Chronical complaints, indeed, are not eaſily overcome.—Few have reſolution enough to perſevere in ſuch a change of diet, and conſtant attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to what phyſicians call the <hi>non-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> as would bring the whole ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013258_0048_0F904C833B87CEA0"/>
into its former temperature. The ſcience of <hi>Medicine,</hi> however, ſeems to be approaching faſt to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſimplicity, as that of <hi>True Religion.</hi> Both of them have their foundation in the conſtitution of man. And the diſorders of the body, as well as thoſe of the ſoul, will ere long be better underſtood, and more ſkilfully treated than they have hitherto been.—I am no friend to <hi>noſtrums</hi> in either caſe; and I entertain as poor an opinion of your <hi>Empirics</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> as of thoſe in <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</hi> Inſtantaneous operations may be ſerviceable in many chirurgical ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and perhaps in ſome phyſical ones;—but the change from a confirmed bad habit of body to a good one, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, in the nature of the thing, be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly accompliſhed by any application in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:013258_0049_0F904C83EDFC1458"/>Dr. CHEYNE, whatever whimſical pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarities he may be charged with, will, upon the whole, be found to have laid a ſure baſis for future ſucceſs in the practice of medicine;—and I ſhall not at all be ſurprized, if, at ſome future day, an admirer of his ſyſtem ſhould venture to ſtep aſide, as he did, from the beaten track, and, without the pomp of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed preſcription, gently lead his afflicted patients into the narrow walk of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from thence conduct them to the fields of exerciſe, which are ever inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a moſt ſalubrious air; and, at laſt, to complete the cure, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh perfect health, both of mind and body, place them, tranquil and ſerene, in the delightful bowers of religious peace and heavenly conſolation.—For certain it is, that there is a moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connection, and ſenſible ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013258_0050_0F904C84AEF604B8"/>
betwixt the ſoul and the body;—and Dr. CHEYNE is well ſupported by the experience of all men in all ages, when he aſſerts, that the inward and irregular paſſions of the ſoul do more real injury to the organized material vehicle, which it inhabits, than all the outward aſſaults, which this vehicle ſuſtains from all the outward elements of nature.</p>
               <p>One grand defect a ſenſible reader cannot but diſcover in Dr. CHEYNE'S ſyſtem, and that is, that he preſcribes to every conſtitution almoſt invariably one and the ſame regimen, without making a ſufficient allowance for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent complections, or inveterate habits. —Nay, he ſuppoſes that <hi>that</hi> ſtate of the body muſt needs be very bad, in which his peculiar regimen is not kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and does not favourably operate.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013258_0051_0F904C8579ACB988"/>
—For my own part, I have enjoyed a good ſhare of health for many years paſt, though I have never been able to uſe one or two eſſential ingredients in his diet, without great inconvenience. A temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate glaſs, I think, may innocently exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſpirits, without enflaming the blood; and I ſee no reaſon why I may not get ſtrength from the juice of the vine, as well as from any other vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or animal ſubſtance. In truth, every creature of God is good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>"ſanctified,"</hi> that is, proves ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary to my ſoul as well as my body, when it is <hi>"received with prayer and thankſgiving."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, my dear Lady, what a train of reflections the account of your ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath raiſed in my mind:—As I am but a ſcioliſt in phyſical matters, ſo I
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013258_0052_0F904C8689B9EDE0"/>
am careful to ſpeak <hi>only what I know, and teſtify what I have felt.</hi>—Common ſenſe, and a little attention to what generally agrees or diſagrees with our conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſet us right whenever we are wrong; or what is better, keep us at all times from offending againſt our own bodies.</p>
               <p>Your own experience hath already told you, that in religious concerns you have an infallible monitor within;— and your own feelings are painful or delightful according as you reſiſt or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to its councils. This reduces all the fancied obſcurities of religion to plain, obvious and ſimple truths.—This makes us behold the ſame light, that irradiates the ſoul of the Chriſtian, breaking forth, though with feebler
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013258_0053_0F904C871AFEE380"/>
ray, in the untutored breaſt of the roaming ſavage.</p>
               <p>To this bleſſed monitor doth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Chriſtianity continually appeal, and to bring it forth into exerciſe and energy, was the grand deſign of his coming into this world.—Hence the invaluable bleſſing of an outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which alone could give us a true information of the latent powers that are lodged in our breaſts, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with an unerring ſtandard of their real and proper employment and effects.</p>
               <p>But this is a topic, which I need not enlarge upon to a Lady, who has not now her religious principles to ſeek. Under all the weakneſſes of a delicate conſtitution, I well know, you have an
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013258_0054_0F904C87C4F57860"/>
internal ſupport, that raiſes you above the feelings of mortality. You have too much good ſenſe, as well as forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, either to be reaſoned or laughed out of your religion;—and though you are a ſtranger to <hi>falſe</hi> ENTHUSIASM, yet you are not aſhamed to acknowledge yourſelf an humble admirer of the <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During my reſidence in AMERICA, I have not met with more than one or two of your ſex, who have made any pretenſions to infidelity—Pretenſions I may very properly call them, becauſe the ſentiments they would vainly be thought to have adopted, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually contradicted by an irreſiſtable teſtimony within them.—To call in queſtion the ſpirituality and future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the human ſoul, its divine
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013258_0055_0F904C8868C83368"/>
origin, and neceſſary dependance upon its PARENT GOD—to doubt of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintending care of a wiſe and good providence, and confound or aboliſh the neceſſary diſtinctions betwixt good and evil—theſe are ſuch glaring abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, ſuch flat contradictions to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and univerſal experience, as muſt needs degrade the perſon that eſpouſes them below the rank of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.—Even thoſe retailers of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern ſophiſtry, HUME and VOLTAIRE, who have poiſoned ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weak and tender intellects with their gilded pills of unbelief, cannot but ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in ſecret, at the dreadful ſucceſs of their preſcriptions; eſpecially, when they come to reflect, that they have not only ſhaken the very foundations of VIRTUE in thouſands of their own ſex, but have, likewiſe, in ſome few
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013258_0056_0F904C8934CEF778"/>
deplorable inſtances, robbed the faireſt part of our ſpecies, of that peculiar ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delicacy, which are character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic of <hi>their</hi> ſex, and which are not only effectually preſerved, but amazingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and heightened by the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charm, which true religion alone can impart.</p>
               <p>A female freethinker is as aukward and pitiable a character as can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. She loſes every attraction, that can win the <hi>lover,</hi> and ſacrifices every amiable ſenſibility, that ought to preſerve the heart of the <hi>huſband.</hi> I am not ſurprized to hear of ſo many late inſtances of conjugal infidelity in <hi>Britain.</hi>—The breaſt that finds no real delight in religion, and is taught to look upon virtue as a viſionary thing, is ſoon open to the allurements of falſe
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013258_0057_0F904C8AC151E7E8"/>
pleaſure: And Mr. HUME has furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a Lady G— with fine and ſpecious apologies, for engaging and perſevering in an unlawful amour.</p>
               <p>Thank heaven! this infernal ſyſtem has not found many admirers among the American fair. They ſtill retain their honeſt attachment to religion and common ſenſe. The arts of gallantry are little known, and leſs practiſed in theſe <hi>laſt retreats</hi> of perſecuted virtue. Conjugal infidelity on either ſide is ſure to be ſtamped with indelible ignominy; and the offender, tho' ſeemingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by opulence or power, or the moſt diſtinguiſhed abilities, is ſoon torn down from the higheſt poſt of truſt or honour, by the reſentment of a virtuous people, and condemned to paſs his future days in infamous obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:013258_0058_0F904C8B6AEA2CF0"/>I well know, my good Lady, that this little repreſentation, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſtrictly juſt and impartial, will prejudice your virtuous heart in favour of the people among whom I now hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reſide. Indeed, before I left <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> you began to think highly of this NEW WORLD, from the frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations you had with ſeveral of our military acquaintance, who had ſpent ſome years on this ſide the <hi>Atlantic,</hi> and whoſe obſervations I have ſince found to be ſenſible and true.</p>
               <p>Poor Captain B— left us a few weeks ago with an heavy heart. The gay, ſprightly, and magnanimous hero, you will find changed into a poor whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and diſconſolate lover.

comfort, that whilſt ſhe was ſecuring him with her ſilken chain, ſhe entangled herſelf at the ſame time, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that I believe, neither of them would now wiſh to be diſengaged. He will doubtleſs pay your Ladyſhip a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit at BATH; and you may aſſure him from me, that his little LEONORA, has retired into the country as <hi>love-ſick</hi> as himſelf, to try for a few months the potent charms of <hi>ſhady groves</hi> and <hi>purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtreams.</hi> I am, with moſt ſincere wiſhes for the preſervation of your valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life,</p>

Common juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice calls upon me to inform you, that ſome of the beſt inſtitutions, that regard its internal police, are under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and management of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe general diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all faſhionable amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diverſions, gives them lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013258_0061_0F91E58FE5BD7020"/>
and opportunity of embarking in and proſecuting ſuch ſchemes as are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well as ornamental to human ſociety. This ſober, virtuous people generally engage with caution, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute with the moſt perſevering firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and aſſiduity. The <hi>Hoſpital</hi> and <hi>Houſe of Employment</hi> are ſtanding mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of their labours—And the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod ſeems to be faſt approaching, when the cauſe of literature will receive no ſmall ſervices from their attention and zeal. A Philoſophical ſociety for the encouragement of ſcience, arts and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, hath been lately inſtituted in this city, which numbers many of the moſt ſenſible of this denomination among its Fellows. My friend the merchant aſſures me, that the thirſt of knowledge increaſes much among them; that they begin to diſcover the

ſubſerviency of human learning to many valuable purpoſes; and now think it no more a crime to ſend their children to ſchool to learn Greek and Latin, Mathematicks and Natural Philoſophy, than to put them to Merchants or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, to be inſtructed in the ſeveral arts and myſteries, that are become neceſſary for the ſupport of the preſent temporal life;—wiſely judging, with reſpect to the ſpiritual life, which comes from, and is to be ſupported by another world, that human learning has no more to do with it, and can no more awaken or promote it, than the art of making clocks and watches. If I remember right, BAKER, who has written ſo ingeniouſly upon the uſes of learning, ſeems to put it upon the ſame footing; and our Tutor at <hi>Magdalen-Hall</hi> has frequently told us, that all

               <p>I am no ſtranger to your Lordſhip's ſentiments upon this intereſting ſubject. —You well know when to pronounce the <hi>"hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</hi>—As a citizen of Heaven, and a traveller through this World, you know what is neceſſary not only to make your journey pleaſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and to furniſh you with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per accommodations on the road, but to ſecure to yourſelf an happy recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among your fellow-citizens, when your pilgrimage ſhall be at an end. A liberal education, under the direction of an heaven-taught mind, has ſtood
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013258_0064_0F904C9180AC2650"/>
your Lordſhip in good ſtead on many important occaſions. It gives the chriſtian ſcholar a free acceſs into cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of converſation, where the illiterate would never be admitted, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him, when he is there, with a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confidence and manly freedom of ſpeech. It enables him to fight the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel with his own weapons, and to avail himſelf of the whole magazine of ancient and modern learning in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion.—For the very ſame armour that is weak and ineffectual in the hands of the unbeliever, becomes ſtrong and of heavenly temper, when worn or wielded by the champion of goſpel truth.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe principles, my Lord, I cannot but look upon it to be the duty of the real chriſtian to patronize and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage

every well-formed ſcheme for the advancement of literature; and I was particularly pleaſed to hear from my friend, who is himſelf a Fellow of the Philoſophical Society, that the Quakers had ſtepped forth, and joined the votaries of Science; for their well-known induſtry and application cannot fail, in all human probability, of enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>What I have here ſaid of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, your Lordſhip muſt not conſider as the leaſt diſparagement or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other religious ſocieties. The members of our communion, as well as thoſe of the Preſbyterian and other diſſenting denominations, have engaged warmly in every ſcheme that has been propoſed for the general good; though they all candidly confeſs, that
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013258_0066_0F904C92EEA19770"/>
no inſtitutions have been carried on with ſo much ſpirit, and crowned with ſo much ſucceſs, as thoſe in which the Quakers have had the lead and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—PENN engrafted an excellent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy upon their religious principles— and BARCLAY has given theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples all the advantages, which can be derived from throwing them into the form of a ſyſtem. Theſe authors your Lordſhip has carefully read—and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member once to have heard you drop an intimation, that BARCLAY'S book had never been anſwered in ſuch a manner as to weaken the force of his arguments.</p>
               <p>I dined the other day with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Phyſician of this place, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf a Preſbyterian. There was a mixed company; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013258_0067_0F904C93BACCFE68"/>
turned upon religious ſubjects. A Clergyman of the eſtabliſhed church, who appeared to be very infirm and much advanced in years, undertook to reconcile the ſeeming differences that prevailed among the profeſſors of Chriſtianity. He very ingeniouſly diſtinguiſhed the things eſſential, from thoſe which are not eſſential to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, with a truly benevolent chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit, declared, that as religion was a life, manifeſted by good tempers and diſpoſitions within, and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent actions and offices without; as it did not depend upon any particular ſet of doctrines or opinions, much leſs upon any particular modes of worſhip or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward church diſcipline, ſo he found his own heart intimately drawn to, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, good men of every denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—You, Sir, ſaid he (turning to the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013258_0068_0F904C946E71C540"/>
Phyſician) are a Preſbyterian.—Thou art a Quaker, (addreſſing himſelf to another of the company)—and I am a Church-man.—Suppoſe now, whilſt we are diſputing about religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a ſervant ſhould ruſh into the room, and eagerly inform us, that a neighbours houſe was on fire, that the maſter of the family was abroad, that the poor wife with two or three little ones were ſcreaming out for help, and that all their goods muſt periſh, if they could not have immediate aſſiſtance. My Quaker friend there, and myſelf, unmoved at the melancholy tidings, keep our ſeats and gravely continue the debate. My Preſbyterian friend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets all his zeal about opinions and doctrines, ſtarts from the table in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and haſtens to the ſcene of diſtreſs. Pray now, gentlemen, continued the

venerable old man, which of us, in ſuch a caſe, would be the Chriſtian?— I—moſt aſſuredly, cried out the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; and though I really find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much attached to <hi>Calvin's</hi> ſyſtem, yet I am ſure, in the caſe you mention, or any other ſimilar one, neither <hi>Calvin's</hi> opinions, nor the opinions of any other man could rouſe my compaſſion and urge me to the benevolent act. Nothing but a power ſuperior to all opinion, which carries its own evidence and motive along with it, and which, I truſt, is "<hi>the</hi> DIVINITY <hi>that ſtirs within me</hi>"—could accompliſh this— and if I ſhould reſiſt its powerful call, merely to indulge my own humour in an idle and unprofitable debate, what would it be but throwing away my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural food, to live upon the wind; nay, loſing heaven for the ſake of a ſyllogiſm.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:013258_0070_0F904C95F4220608"/>I think your Lordſhip, had you been preſent, would have pronounced this to be good Divinity: and for the honour of the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that theſe ſentiments general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevail among them; and that there is leſs religious bigotry here, than in any place I have yet viſited. The only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in which the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> ſeem to be leſs catholic than others, is their violent oppoſition to the propoſed eſtabliſhment of a Biſhop or Biſhops in America: But, indeed I cannot think they are ſo much to blame in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as our Church friends would inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate; for, was I to ſettle in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I ſhould never ſay a word in favour of an eſtabliſhed epiſcopate, till the powers of the intended Biſhop were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately defined, and a ſatisfactory ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given by act of Parliament

               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> have three places of worſhip in this city, the <hi>Engliſh Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> three, the <hi>Scotch Preſbyterians</hi> two, the <hi>German Lutherans</hi> two, (one of which is very large and elegant) the <hi>German Calviniſts</hi> one, the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> one, the <hi>Roman Catholics</hi> two, and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts</hi> one. I have viſited moſt of theſe places, and have been introduced to many of the Clergy, and find them generally moderate, quiet and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They are all warmly attached to the Britiſh conſtitution, and whilſt their civil and religious liberties are ſecured to them, will remain as affectionate

But I had a hint from a gentleman, who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaw him there, that he had been ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken in by a ſet of people, under the maſk of religion.—You know his honeſt heart has ever been too ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of impreſſions from your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to extraordinary ſanctity.

               <p>AS I ſpend a good deal of my time in writing to my friends in ENGLAND, I ſhould be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, were I to neglect paying my reſpects to your Lordſhip, whom I am proud to rank among thoſe, whoſe eſteem I would cultivate by every means in my power. I have not yet fixed upon the time of my return; ſo that I can ſay nothing on that head. My ſtay here hath been longer than I expected; and indeed, ſo many new
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013258_0075_0F904C9C732907D8"/>
ſcenes have engaged my attention, and my ſituation hath been in every reſpect ſo very agreeable, that time has ſtolen imperceptibly away.</p>
               <p>I am juſt returned from an excurſion into the country, which afforded me much matter for reflection and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. As the ſubject muſt be new to your Lordſhip, I ſhall endeavour to amuſe you with a conciſe account of my journey, reſerving a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar deſcription for an afternoon's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the gardens of—.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, at whoſe houſe I am entertained, is one of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and a wealthy merchant in this city, to whom I had a letter from Mr. L—of <hi>Briſtol.</hi> In this good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily I am treated with the moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013258_0076_0F904C9D8897D440"/>
hoſpitality; and my friend, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any parade of ceremony, or the common diſplay of too officious civility, is a moſt ſenſible, polite and agreeable companion. The other day, while we were at breakfaſt, he propoſed a jaunt into the country for my amuſement; and without letting me know what rout he intended to take, we ſet off on Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday laſt, with his wife and daughter and an intimate acquaintance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The carriage in which we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled was neither coach nor waggon, but ſomething between both; a kind of machine much uſed of late in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and very commodious for thoſe who have large families, as it is conſtructed in ſuch a manner as to accommodate ſix or eight perſons with eaſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience—Indeed, uſe rather than ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance is conſidered in its conſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:013258_0077_0F904C9E2FBD38D0"/>We travelled through a thick-ſettled and highly-cultivated country, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully variegated with hills commanding extenſive proſpects, and vallies enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with meadows, mills, farm-houſes, and limpid ſtreams of water. At length we arrived at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> a large and flouriſhing town, about ſixty miles from hence. Its trade to this city is very conſiderable: But, as it is not ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on navigable water, this trade is carried on by means of large covered waggons, which travel in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Philadelphia, (ſometimes, as I have been informed, there being above one hundred in a company) carrying down the produce of the country, and returning with all kinds of ſtores and merchandize.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:013258_0078_0F904C9EEE5FB440"/>At <hi>Lancaſter</hi> we tarried but one night; and the next morning purſued our journey to <hi>Ephrata,</hi> or Dunker-Town, as ſome call it, a ſmall village ſituated on a beautiful little river or creek, in a moſt romantic and ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vale. This village and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining lands are poſſeſſed by a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſect called <hi>Dunkers,</hi> whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and manners are very ſingular. They are for the moſt part <hi>Germans.</hi> Their name, I am told, is taken from their mode of baptizing their new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, which is by dipping them in a river, as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do among us. Certain it is, that they took their riſe in this place about fifty years ago; and did not, as a ſect, emigrate from any other country. Their ſociety, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, at preſent, ſeems to be upon the decline, not exceeding one hundred
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013258_0079_0F904C9FDCAD81C8"/>
members, though they have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore more numerous. Both men and women are dreſſed in white linen for the ſummer, and woollen for the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon. Their habit is a kind of long coat or tunic reaching down to the heels, having a ſaſh or girdle round the waiſt, and a cap or hood hanging from the ſhoulders, not unlike the dreſs of the Dominican friars The men do not ſhave the head or beard. They are in general induſtrious, cheerful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſagacious.</p>
               <p>The men and women have ſeparate habitations and diſtinct governments. For theſe purpoſes, they have erected two large wooden buildings, one of which is occupied by the brethren, the other by the ſiſters of the ſociety; and in each of them there is a banqueting
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013258_0080_0F904CA0865C5B60"/>
room and an apartment for public worſhip: For the men and women do not meet together even at their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The reſt of the building is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a great number of ſmall clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, or rather cells: each affording juſt room enough to accommodate one perſon.</p>
               <p>They live chiefly upon roots and other vegetables: the rules of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety not allowing fleſh, except upon particular occaſions, when they hold what they call a <hi>Love-feaſt;</hi> at which time, the brethren and ſiſters dine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a large apartment, and eat <hi>mutton,</hi> but no other meat. No mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſociety is allowed a bed, but in caſe of ſickneſs. In each of their little cells they have a bench fixed, to ſerve the purpoſe of a bed, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013258_0081_0F904CA137646F68"/>
a ſmall block of wood for a pillow. The <hi>Dunkers</hi> allow of no intercourſe betwixt the brethren and ſiſters, not even by marriage. Nevertheleſs, ſome have broken through this reſtraint, and ventured upon the conjugal ſtate. The married perſons, however, are no longer conſidered in full communion, or ſuffered to live under the ſame roof, no, nor in the ſame village with the unmarried; but are obliged to remove to a place about a mile diſtant, called <hi>Mount-Sion.</hi> They continue indeed to wear the habit, and in other reſpects are deemed members of the ſociety.</p>
               <p>The principal tenet of the <hi>Dunkers,</hi> I underſtand, is this: <q>That future happineſs is only to be obtained by penance and outward mortifications in this life; and that as JESUS
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013258_0082_0F904CA2B4E76560"/>
CHRIST, by his meritorious ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings became the redeemer of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general; ſo each individual of the human race, by a life of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and reſtraint, may workout his own ſalvation.</q> Nay, they go ſo far, as to admit of works of ſupere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, and declare, that a man may do much more than he is in juſtice or equity obliged to do, and that his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant works may therefore be applied to the ſalvation of others.</p>
               <p>Thus do theſe poor people delude themſelves with vain imaginations, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that religions ſatisfaction in their external ſituation, which is only to be found in the internal ſtate of the mind. Devout and happy diſpoſitions of ſoul have indeed much leſs dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on outward circumſtances than people
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013258_0083_0F904CA375EC7180"/>
in general imagine. Men fooliſhly neglect to attend to religious ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or to cultivate a ſpiritual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the great <hi>Father of ſpirits:</hi> And then think to excuſe themſelves by lamenting their ſituation in life, as unfavourable to theſe purpoſes. Thoſe, who earn their daily bread by the ſweat of their brow, are apt to imagine, that, if they were in eaſy circumſtances, they ſhould have leiſure to attend to their eternal concerns; but no ſooner does wealth increaſe, than their care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to it increaſe in proportion, and they find themſelves more and more embarraſſed and leſs at leiſure than ever they had been. Others think, that by reſolutely breaking off from all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and connection with the reſt of mankind, retiring into gloomy woods, burying themſelves, as Anchorites in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013258_0084_0F904CA460268B88"/>
caves, and denying themſelves even the innocent gratifications of nature, they ſhall moſt aſſuredly recommend themſelves to the favour of Heaven, and ſtrictly conform to the idea they have entertained of <hi>ſaints</hi> upon earth. But they ſhould conſider, in the firſt place, that they attempt in vain to fly from their own evil diſpoſitions, which will purſue and torment them in their cloſeſt retreats; and in the ſecond place, that by retiring from the world, they loſe the only opportunities they can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have of calling forth a thouſand tender ſenſibilities, and exerciſing a thouſand tender offices of ſympathy, compaſſion, charity and benevolence.</p>
               <p>Excuſe, my Lord, this ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, into which my ſubject has almoſt involuntarily led me.—I will now purſue my narration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:013258_0085_0F904CA500109230"/>Beſide the two large buildings above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the <hi>Dunkers</hi> have ſeveral ſmaller ones, chiefly for the purpoſe of manufactures. They carry on ſeveral branches of buſineſs with great ſkill and induſtry. They have a convenient oil-mill, paper-mill, and printing-preſs. They make parchment, tan leather, and manufacture linen and woollen cloth, more than ſufficient to ſerve their own ſociety. The ſiſters are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious at making wax-tapers, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paper-lanthorns, and various kinds of paſteboard boxes, which they ſell to ſtrangers who come to viſit them. They likewiſe amuſe themſelves with writing favourite texts of ſcripture in large letters curiouſly ornamented with flowers and foliage. Theſe ſeem to be rather works of patience than of geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: ſeveral of them are framed and
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013258_0086_0F904CA66C7E07A8"/>
hung up to decorate their place of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Incloſed I ſend your Lordſhip a ſpecimen of this writing, which you may, perhaps, think worthy of a place in your collection of foreign curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>I ſhall at preſent remark but one thing more, with reſpect to the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and that is, the peculiarity of their <hi>muſic.</hi> Upon an hint given by my friend, the ſiſters invited us into their chapel, and, ſeating themſelves in order, began to ſing one of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout hymns. The muſic had little or no air or melody; but conſiſted of ſimple, long notes, combined in the richeſt harmony. The counter, treble, tenor and baſs were all ſung by women, with ſweet, ſhrill and ſmall voices; but with a truth and exactneſs in
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013258_0087_0F904CA6953156B8"/>
the time and intonation that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable. It is impoſſible to deſcribe to your Lordſhip my feelings upon this occaſion. The performers ſat with their heads reclined, their countenances ſolemn and dejected, their faces pale and emaciated from their manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, their clothing exceeding white and quite pictureſque, and their muſic ſuch as thrilled to the very ſoul.—I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt began to think myſelf in the world of ſpirits, and that the objects before me were ethereal. In ſhort, the impreſſion this ſcene made upon my mind continued ſtrong for many days, and I believe, will never be wholly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated.</p>
               <p>By way of concluding this little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, I beg leave to tranſcribe a copy of verſes, which P—R M—R,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:013258_0088_0F904CA7327AC290"/>
the preſent head of this ſociety, put into my hands, telling me, that they were compoſed by a young gentleman of Philadelphia ſome years ago, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a viſit he made him, and a converſation which then paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. The ſentiments are ſo catholic, that I think your Lordſhip cannot but have ſome pleaſure in the peruſal.</p>

               <p>One circumſtance I had like to have omitted in this account of <hi>Ephrata,</hi> which I would not wiſh to paſs by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed.
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013258_0091_0F904CAB595D8BA8"/>
—There is an houſe in this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage occupied by four or five brethren, who for ſome years paſt have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from the reſt, on account, as it is ſaid, of ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with reſpect to their forms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and worſhip. I had a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation upon this ſubject with a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old man, who is one of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal proprietors or truſtees of the eſtate. From him I found, that a further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the reality of religion, (as it takes its riſe and progreſs in the heart of man, and depends much leſs upon outward forms than inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from the fountain of truth) was the ſole cauſe of their ſeparation. It was not, ſaid the good man, that we were diſſatisfied with their particular form, but that we had diſcovered the weakneſs and inſufficiency of all forms;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013258_0092_0F904CACAD13AC40"/>
and were therefore willing to anticipate in our own practice, that bleſſed period of the church, when every true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper ſhall worſhip God, "in Spirit and in Truth." Though theſe few brethren are not in communion with the <hi>Dunkers,</hi> they have a right to their proportion of the produce of the eſtate; and this, together with ſome little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, which each of them follows, gives them a ſufficient ſupport. They wear not the habit of the ſociety—but are diſtinguiſhed from the reſt by ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er coats with leathern girdles, and large white hats inſtead of hoods. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, however, to wear their beards.</p>
               <p>I muſt not conclude without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting your Lordſhip, that your excellent <hi>Diſſertations</hi> have found their way here, and are much read and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013258_0093_0F904CAD39E3DAD0"/>
in this city. It cannot but give the higheſt ſatisfaction to a virtuous man, to find that his good works ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their influence much farther than he could poſſibly have foreſeen; and, like a friendly luminary hung out in a dark night, ſerve to direct the weary ſteps of the diſtant traveller.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE the pleaſure to inform you, that we are like to be made happy very ſoon with the company of our agreeable friend, Capt. L—. A copy of a letter which I have juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him, conceived and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his own ſweet and gentle turn of ſentiment and language, I cannot forbear communicating to you. The original I preſerve among many others, with which he has been ſo kind as to favour me, ſince we parted. 'Tis dated
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013258_0095_0F904CAEAD44F958"/>
from <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> as he calls it, a little elegant receſs, which his father has lately given him, on the banks of the <hi>Humber,</hi> a few miles above <hi>Hull.</hi> He writes as follows:
<floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <p>I am juſt returned from an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Oxford;</hi> where I ran over in imagination, every ſcene of pleaſure, which I once ſhared with our worthy fellow-ſtudents of <hi>Magdalen-Hall:</hi> Every field, every grove, every tree, that ſurrounds theſe ſweet retreats of ſcience, reminded me of ſome morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or evening walk, ſome pleaſing and improving converſation, in which I had borne my part. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wiſhed to occupy once more, for a ſeaſon, the chamber in which I have ſo often been bleſſed with the ſociety of ſuch agreeable friends.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013258_0096_0F904CAF8F9FA628"/>
But believe me, 'twas only for a ſeaſon, that I formed ſuch a wiſh. For my happineſs at preſent infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeds all that I have heretofore experienced, even when P— and M—, and you my much loved C—, conſpired to make me think my bliſs compleat. Twelve cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful moons have now rolled round this globe, ſince ASPASIA was my own. An uninterrupted ſucceſſion of calm domeſtic joys has crowned my ardent expectations. Every vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that the female mind can boaſt is happily centered in my fair com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Bleſt beyond my moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes at home, I roam not now for happineſs abroad.—The leiſure which peace beſtows upon the weary ſoldier, I have wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to her ſweet and ſoothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.—Happy,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013258_0097_0F904CB106749298"/>
indeed, if this lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure could have continued ſtill—But alas! the call of honour muſt ſilence for a while the voice of love.</p>
                        <p>A few days ſince, I received or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from General G—, to repair without delay to my regiment at <hi>Boſton.</hi>—No ſhip offering immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for that port, I have deſired a friend in <hi>London,</hi> to ſecure me a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in the firſt that ſails for <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia</hi> or <hi>New-York</hi>—ſo that in a few days all my preſent ſoftening proſpects muſt be changed for the rude horrors of the boiſterous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic. In expectation of ſuch a call, my ASPASIA had ſome time ago, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a deſire of accompanying me; and we ſeriouſly thought of facing the angry ſurge in each other's arms:
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013258_0098_0F904BA0B416CB08"/>
But theſe hopes are now diſſipated by the proſpect of a new connexion, with which the dear creature is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alarmed, and which, as ſoon as produced, will open a new ſcene of tenderneſs and love—"<hi>Caſta, fave,</hi> LUCINA! would have been an heathen's prayer. But, as a chriſtian, I moſt fervently beſeech the great God and Father of angels and men, that he would mercifully complete the work he hath begun, and that the beſt of women may not want a little ſoothing comforter to cheer the lone irkſome hours of her ſhepherd's abſence.—Enough, however, on this melancholy ſubject.—Nought can alleviate my painful anticipations, but the hope of meeting with you and CHARLES in <hi>America.</hi>

Lord H—'s political character induced many to conclude, that he was particularly intereſted in it, and expected much information with reſpect to American affairs, from your ſagacious and penetrating enquiries. But I knew you too well to think, that you were engaged in any miniſterial ſervices, or that aught but your own curioſity, and thirſt of knowledge, had carried you from home. The benevolence of Lord H—, hath indeed furniſhed you with the means of gratifying your laudable deſires; but I know, that it is not from you, he looks for a return in the political way. The only perſon that ſeems to be in the ſecret is my Lord P—, who has
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:013258_0100_0F904BA24741DD48"/>
been at <hi>Oxford</hi> for ſome time paſt; and very kindly communicated a long and entertaining letter, which he had received from you, to a little circle of <hi>Magdalen</hi>'s ſons. From this letter we all concluded, that your obſervations would chiefly be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed upon literary and religious ſubjects; and congratulated each other upon the agreeable intelligence of this kind, we ſhould from time to time be favoured with from you. —I write in haſte, and write only to you. Tell CHARLES, he may expect me very ſoon. My ASPASIA is under ſome little apprehenſions about a winter's paſſage—But I leave all to ſuperior direction. <hi>Chriſto duce, nil deſperandum.</hi>—You ſee, I write like a ſoldier.—For I profeſs myſelf a Chriſtian, as well as an

               <p>I always thought, my dear CHARLES, that our Captain's temper and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were more ſuited to the mild and gentle offices of private and domeſtic life, than the hurrying and turbulent employments of war. Courage he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanted. But it is not of the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, fiery kind. 'Tis like himſelf, ſteady, firm and compoſed. Lord GRANBY once told his father in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that though he was not formed for enterprize, there was not an officer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:013258_0102_0F904BA3D0065738"/>
his command, that maintained his poſt and executed what he had to do with more reſolution and firmneſs than young GEORGE. He has an high ſenſe of honour, but it is under the controul of religion. No man that knows him doubts his courage; though he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently declared, that he deſpiſes that paltry kind of honour, which is to be gained or loſt by accepting or refuſing a challenge.—He is not afraid to fight: —He is not afraid to die:—But he is afraid to offend his Maker, by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly ſporting with that life, which he received from him, and which he only has a right to diſpoſe of. Indeed, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain L—is truly religious, without the leaſt affectation or parade.—He is much beloved in the army; and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known to have any difference with his brother officers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:013258_0103_0F904BA477058688"/>LEONORA is come to town. I drank tea with her yeſterday; and could not forbear reading to her the tender part of our friend's letter which relates to ASPASIA.—I ſaw the involuntary tear ſteal down and mingle with the roſes on her cheek.—I ſaw her boſom ſwelling to give vent to the involuntary ſigh.— This tear—this ſigh—ſpake a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which my heart could readily interpret.—The image of her beloved B— preſſed upon her ſoul.—In feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ASPASIA, ſhe felt doubly for herſelf.—"Heaven preſerve the dear abſent youth, (methinks ſhe would have ſaid) and haſten the ſweet period, which ſhall realize to my heart the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing ſcenes, which have crowned the virtuous ASPASIA'S love! But O let me not, like her, ever experience the pangs even of a temporary ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!"</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:013258_0104_0F904BA5307092E0"/>After tea, LEONORA propoſed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting a Lady whom I ſhall hereafter characterize under the name of AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIRA. We found her at her harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord;—her huſband, whom I ſhall call AMYNTOR, leaning over her chair, and both accompanying the inſtrument with their voices. — They attempted to riſe as ſoon as we entered the room; but as we preſſed them to let us ſhare in the ſweet entertainment they were giving to each other they very oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conſented. — It was a plain, ſimple little ſong, compoſed by a Gentleman of this city, when he was about to leave England a few years ago, and addreſſed to a young Lady, a niece of my Lord —, at whoſe country ſeat in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> he was moſt hoſpitably entertained.— ALMIRA favoured me with a copy, which I herewith ſend you.</p>

               <p>There is a ſimplicity in the ſentiment and language here, that ſhould ever be the principal characteriſtic of a ſong. The meaſure too is ſuch as conſiderably aids this ſimplicity. GAY and SHEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STONE excel much in this way; and 'tis no deſpicable ſpecies of poetry. Our old ballads will ever affect a ſenſible heart; and there are few modern ſongs, that can come in competition with them. The tender-hearted LEONORA wept at every ſtanza. I could have wept with her—and ſo could you, if
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:013258_0107_0F904BA8CB6CBE60"/>
your heart has not loſt thoſe fine ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, which you once gloried in. O CHARLES! there is more of heaven in theſe feelings, than we are aware of. The moroſe religioniſt, and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilious phariſee may deſpiſe them; and 'tis true, that like many other gifts of heaven, they have been proſtituted to the ſervice of vice—But under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a virtuous heart, they are precious—they are angelical—they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire a joy, which the groſs ſenſualiſt will ever be a ſtranger to.—Let no pretended ſpiritualiſts talk you out of them. They can give you nothing in exchange but notions and opinions, whimſical and viſionary.—The ſureſt teſtimony we can have in ourſelves, or give to others, of being truly religious, ariſes from a meek and quiet ſpirit, a tender ſympathy in each other's joys
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:013258_0108_0F904BAA2BAF3A40"/>
and ſorrows, an humble opinion of ourſelves, an abhorrence of pride and ſelfiſhneſs in every ſhape, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual looking to an higher world than this, for the perfection of thoſe virtues and graces, which are here but in their embryo ſtate.—Excuſe this little preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—I give you full liberty to preach to me in your turn—And am with great truth,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>BEFORE this letter can poſſibly reach your Lordſhip, you will have exchanged the calm ſcenes of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and the pleaſing converſe of the muſes for the noiſe of party, the petulance of falſe patriotiſm, and the ſurer though gentler operations of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial intrigue. Your Lordſhip en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the political theatre, not with a view of ſtepping forth as an actor upon
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013258_0110_0F904BAB2BC00AF0"/>
the ſtage, but as a candid ſpectator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted indeed in the conduct of every particular ſcene, but more deeply inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the winding up of the <hi>drama.</hi> Your honeſt <hi>plaudit,</hi> therefore, is given or with-held, according as the meaſures adviſed and purſued on either ſide, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you to be agreeable or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the dictates of virtue, and the ſpirit of Britiſh liberty. If this letter ſhould meet your Lordſhip, preparing to go to Court or Parliament, lay it down, when you have read thus far.— Its contents ought not to interfere with matters of higher concern.—They are only intended for the innocent amuſement of your leiſure moments; the poor accompliſhment of a promiſe, which your Lordſhip condeſcended to exact from me at parting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:013258_0111_0F904BAC05A0A898"/>Indeed, my Lord, I know not how it is, but I begin to find myſelf ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached to this Weſtern World. I ſometimes think that I could content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly take up my abode here for life. I have no family connexions in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and if I could but make my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt coincide with my inclination, I know no country that I have hitherto viſited, which has promiſed me more ſatisfaction than this.—All depends, however, upon my Lord H—: I have written to him upon the ſubject; and I flatter myſelf, that my applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not fail of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>My attachment to America, I am apt to think, in a great meaſure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the proſpect of its growing greatneſs, to which every day ſeems more or leſs to contribute. In Europe,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:013258_0112_0F904BACC0D1B398"/>
the ſeveral arts and ſciences are almoſt arrived at their meridian of perfection; at leaſt, new diſcoveries are leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent now than heretofore.—Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, gardening, agriculture, mechanics, are at a ſtand. The eye is weary with a repetition of ſcenes, in which it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers a perpetual ſameneſs, though heightened by all the refinements of taſte. Excellency itſelf, in works of human art, cloys the faculties, if the mind is not now and then relieved by objects of inferior beauty. After rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the magnificence of churches and palaces, we are glad to fix a while upon a ſimple farm-houſe or ſtraw-built cottage. We feel a particular delight in tracing the windings of a beautiful river from its firſt ſprings 'till it empties itſelf into the vaſt ocean.—The mind purſues it through an immenſe tract of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013258_0113_0F904BAE28C90270"/>
variegated country, and ſeems to flow, and increaſe, and widen along with it, 'till it loſes itſelf in the abyſs of waters.</p>
               <p>The objects of art, as well as thoſe of nature, in this new world, are at preſent in ſuch a ſtate, as affords the higheſt entertainment to theſe faculties of the mind. The progreſſion is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: Here and there, in the midſt of venerable woods, which, ſcarce a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ago, were the uncultivated haunts of roaming ſavages, the power of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation preſents itſelf to the travellers view, in opening lawns, covered with the richeſt verdure, fields of corn, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, gardens, and meadows ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by well-directed ſtreams—Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, villages, and even populous cities, with their towering ſpires, excite our admiration.—We are ſtruck with the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013258_0114_0F904BAE555263A8"/>
charm of novelty, wherever we go— The compariſon is always at hand— For, within the compaſs of a ſhort mile, we may behold at once, <hi>nature</hi> in her original ruſticity, and <hi>art</hi> riſing by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid advances to perfection.</p>
               <p>The progreſs of the human mind may here likewiſe be obſerved to keep equal pace with the external improvements.— The gradual poliſh of manners, from aukwardneſs itſelf even to courtly civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, from ſuperſtitious notions, and bigotted religious attachments, to libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, enlarged ſentiments, and genuine ſpiritual devotion may very readily be traced by a thoughtful and inquiſitive mind. All the powers of nature ſeem to be upon the ſtretch, as if they were in purſuit of ſomething higher ſtill, in ſcience, in manners, in religion itſelf, than the mother country can afford.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:013258_0115_0F904BAEF4747F50"/>Indeed my Lord, I feel my heart expand at the immenſe proſpect that irreſiſtably opens upon me.—I ſee new kingdoms and empires ruſhing forth from their embryo ſtate, eager to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe their latent powers; whilſt the old ones on the other ſide of the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, "hide their diminiſhed heads," loſt in ſuperior luſtre.—I ſee learning ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all ſcholaſtic pedantry, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion reſtored to goſpel purity.—I ſee the laſt efforts of a powerful. Providence exerted, in order to reclaim our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering race from the paths of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and error.—I ſee the ſetting rays of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> ſhining forth with ſeven-fold luſtre to the utmoſt bourn of this Weſtern Continent.</p>
               <p>Wonder not, then, my Lord, at my attachment to this favoured ſpot.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013258_0116_0F904BAFAD5024B8"/>
I tread the hallowed ſoil with far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pleaſures from <hi>anticipation</hi> than your claſſic enthuſiaſts feel from <hi>reflection,</hi> whilſt they kiſs the floor of <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> or walk the <hi>"Eternal flint by Conſuls trod."</hi> There is one thought indeed that throws a damp upon that ardour of joy, which ſuch ſpeculations gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally produce in my breaſt. From the ſtrange propenſity of human nature to abuſe the richeſt gifts of providence, (of which hiſtory as well as experience afford us ſo many ſad examples) I fear, leſt the old leaven of wickedneſs ſhould inſinuate itſelf again by degrees, till it has corrupted the whole maſs; leſt the melancholy ſcenes we have beheld in the kingdoms and churches of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſhould be acted over again in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and the declenſion of ſound knowledge and virtuous practice, ſhould be more

rapid than their increaſe and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip has ſeen the works of the divine HERBERT. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how exceſſively fond Dr. R—Y was of his poems, and how earneſtly he would recommend his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent little treatiſe, called <hi>The Country Parſon,</hi> to all his pupils, who were to be candidates for holy orders. Leſt you ſhould not have the book by you, I muſt beg leave to tranſcribe a very remarkable paſſage from a poem, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, <hi>The Church Militant,</hi> which, as it relates wholly to <hi>America,</hi> and breathes a kind of prophetic ſpirit, has generally been called "<hi>Herbert</hi>'s Prophecy."

The apparatus for breakfaſt was upon the table; and, as my eye glanced over it, I obſerved a piece of paper careleſsly folded up, and thrown into one of the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013258_0126_0F904BB8B9D3BDD0"/>
bowls—A pen and ink ſtanding by, I immediately concluded, that the Lady, who was remarkable for being a good oeconomiſt, had been ſetting down ſome little expences in a hurry, intending, perhaps, to enter them at leiſure into her day book. My curioſity prompted me to unfold the paper, with a deſign of rallying her a little, when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, upon the exactneſs of her oeconomy. But judge of my ſurprize, when, inſtead of a family account, I met with the following ſenſible, eaſy and unaffected little eſſay, which ſeems to have been her morning meditation, juſt poured forth extempore from an heart, deeply touched with a ſenſibility of its own domeſtic bliſs.</p>
               <p>As ſhe did not come down immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, I had leiſure to peruſe the whole
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013258_0127_0F904BB9696503F0"/>
—I here tranſcribe it—and doubt not, but that your honeſt heart will thrill with pleaſure, whilſt you are reading it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If ever we may be allowed to ſay, that marriages are made in heaven, it muſt be, when the union is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a diſintereſted affection, a love that cannot be deſcribed even by thoſe who have felt it—My own heart tells me, that it is beyond all deſcription—Sure I am, that the flame is kindled, and cheriſhed too, by a ſuperior power. 'Tis not a pretty face, or an elegant perſon— 'tis not a brilliant wit, or a fine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that can excite or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve mutual affection—It ſprings from an higher ſource—It has been known to ſubſiſt in its utmoſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, where theſe accompliſhments
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013258_0128_0F904BBB08675248"/>
have been wanting.—There is a nameleſs ſympathy of congenial ſouls, even among thoſe of the <hi>ſame</hi> ſex— which is felt—which cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed—but which liſping mortals have denominated FRIENDSHIP. When this nameleſs ſympathy meets in congenial ſouls of <hi>different</hi> ſexes, 'tis amazingly heightened—Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot expreſs the ſenſation— and we have learned to call it by the name of LOVE. A name, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſadly profaned by the lips of the ſenſualiſt, the covetous and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious—but felt and underſtood in its true meaning and import by thoſe alone, who ſeek for happineſs in the ſweet tranquility of domeſtic endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments—who conſider the lover and huſband but as one and the ſame character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:013258_0129_0F904BBC8462B9F8"/>Such an union is indeed <hi>devoutly to be wiſhed for;</hi> and, when once accompliſhed, the pleaſures of life are enjoyed with a double reliſh, becauſe each, beſides his own, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of a beloved partner's ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons —Misfortunes too— (and who ever taſted the cup of life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding ſome bitterneſs in the draught?) Misfortunes too loſe half their weight, by being divided—and as each aſſiſts the other to bear the load, ſo each comforts the other, whilſt labouring under it. Time, the general deſtroyer of temporal objects and human joys, perpetuates and increaſes ſuch a felicity as this; which depends not ſo much upon external cireumſtances, as upon the internal feelings of their own breaſts. In the days of their marriage they
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013258_0130_0F904BBD514F6198"/>
may with more propriety be called <hi>Lovers,</hi> than in the days of their courtſhip.</p>
                  <p>Failings, no doubt, each muſt diſcover in the other—and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, as long as the angel is clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fetters of mortality.— But even in theſe, they ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble one another, that they ſoon learn, either to overlook them, or to bear them with a meekneſs, which true love never fails of inſpiring.</p>
                  <p>This ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance, and uninterrupted intercourſe of endearing ſenſibilities, muſt not only ſecure to them all the bliſs which this world has to give— but muſt be an excellent preparative for their future enjoyment of thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013258_0131_0F904BBE09AF8DA0"/>
eternal ſcenes, where LOVE reigns without the leaſt alloy of any ſordid paſſion, and to which they will carry with them the ſame affections dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly purified, and darting back from their beatified ſpirits to that lovely center from whence they originally came.</p>
                  <p>GREAT SOURCE of LOVE enable me—</p>
               </q>
               <p>Here ſtopped her hand—inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, probably, in her pious ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſome family call, to which ſhe always cheerfully ſacrificed her own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſatisfactions.</p>
               <p>Scarce had I read the paper and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed it in the bowl, before ALMIRA made her appearance, and welcomed
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013258_0132_0F904BBEACE871D8"/>
me to her houſe with that unaffected ſweetneſs of addreſs, which ever attends and indicates a meek and humble heart. —Indeed I have long been of opinion, that true politeneſs is not indebted ſolely to art, or what is generally called good company, but derives its peculiar charm from an higher original—<hi>and breathes and taſtes of</hi> HEAVEN.</p>
               <p>I immediately confeſſed, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged pardon of the good Lady for the liberty I had taken to peep into her manuſcript.—With a bluſh of genuine modeſty ſhe excuſed me, apologized delicately for the haſty ſcrawl, as ſhe called it, and hoped that her ſentiments met with my approbation.</p>
               <p>I was juſt going to expreſs the high ſatisfaction, which theſe ſentiments had
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:013258_0133_0F904BBF72239628"/>
given me, when AMYNTOR, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the lover of ALMIRA, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in from his morning walk—I ſaw the glance darted and catched from the eyes of both—It ſpoke a thouſand feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which all the ſoftneſs of language could never have expreſſed. AMYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR'S friendſhip for me dictated ſuch a welcome, as would have warmed the coldeſt heart. It failed not of kindling the flame in mine; and with theſe two married lovers, I was more highly and rationally entertained, than ever I had been at a breakfaſt before.</p>
               <p>Juſt at parting I communicated what had paſt to AMYNTOR, who at my earneſt requeſt furniſhed me with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of ALMYRA'S eſſay next morning.</p>

                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAD the honour of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's very obliging letter by Capt. L—, who after a moſt turbulent paſſage, arrived here on the 10th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. My friend the merchant intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to me the next morning, whilſt I was ſitting penſive in my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as a Gentleman juſt arrived from <hi>England,</hi> who had aſked very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly after me.—As he was dreſſed in a plain brown ſuit of cloaths. I did not immediately know him, having been
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:013258_0136_0F904BC31B494A60"/>
long accuſtomed to ſee him in regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals.—But the moment he ſpake, and ſmiled, I recognized my fellow ſtudent, and we embraced each other with all the affection of our juvenile friendſhip. He ſoon opened to me the myſtery of his new garb, by informing me, that he had been adviſed by his friends, and particularly by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to ſolicit one of the new appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>N. America,</hi> and as a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this, to diſpoſe of his commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without delay; that accordingly he had loſt no time,—Sir J—n H—t having been glad of the opportunity of purchaſing for his nephew, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately embarked for <hi>Boſton,</hi> to join the regiment;— that backed by your Lordſhip's intereſt, and the perſonal application of LADY CAROLINE, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from Lord N—H a patent for
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:013258_0137_0F904BC34260C7A8"/>
the office of— in —; that the death of his father, and of Mrs. L—'s aunt about the ſame time, had thrown a gloom over his little <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> damped the wonted chearfulneſs of their evening fire-ſide, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him to part with that agreeable receſs, and remove Mrs. L—, who had now bleſſed him with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pledge of their love, to a ſeat of his uncle's, near <hi>Beverley;</hi> that he would not venture to bring her with him to <hi>America,</hi> 'till he had fixed upon the place of his reſidence, and got eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing accommodated for her recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I could not but expreſs my approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this change in his circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; at the ſame time that I ſincerely ſympathized with him upon the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:013258_0138_0F904BC3EC95CD98"/>
events that produced it.—The emoluments of his office, together with the caſh into which he has converted his little eſtate, will enable him to live with elegance as well as comfort in —. He will be fixed in a very agreeable and polite neighbourhood; and enjoy all that domeſtic felicity, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which his heart has ſo long aſpired. For my part, I confeſs, that my fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſhes would be gratified, could I obtain ſo decent and honourable a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for life. Experience has taught me to feel the truth, which the poet ſweetly ſings,
<q>
                     <l>Then, pilgrim, turn, thy cares forego;</l>
                     <l>All earth-born cares are wrong;</l>
                     <l>Man wants but little here below,</l>
                     <l>Nor wants that little long.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:013258_0139_0F904BC4AA4AFEF0"/>
Pilgrims we certainly are in this world— and I know of no conſideration, that can alleviate the numberleſs evils, and diſappointments to which we are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whilſt we are here, but this;— that we belong to another world, which was our <hi>original,</hi> and muſt be our <hi>final</hi> home—that the preſent ſtate of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, is no other than a ſtate of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; and that according to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, reaſon and common ſenſe, our felicity here, as well as hereafter, muſt wholly depend upon an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe opened and continued betwixt our ſpirits, and the ETERNAL SOURCE of GOODNESS. This your Lordſhip knows is not <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> but true rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal <hi>ſcriptural</hi> religion.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince our friend's arrival, my time has been almoſt wholly taken up
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013258_0140_0F904BC56BEFD168"/>
in going round with him, and viſiting the ſeveral places in and about this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis,</hi> which are worthy the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſtranger. The other day, whilſt we were walking in the public hall of the college with the <hi>Provoſt,</hi> and a clergyman from the iſland of <hi>Barbados,</hi> who was formerly of <hi>Merton-College, Oxford,</hi> I took the liberty of aſking the latter, whether he thought a <hi>private</hi> or <hi>public</hi> education moſt advantageous. He did not heſitate to pronounce in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an education at a public ſchool; —and advanced ſeveral reaſons in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his opinion, that appeared to me clear and convincing; but added at the ſame time, that he could not help thinking, that the advantages of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic education would be much more conſiderable, were the perſons concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the management of ſeminaries,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:013258_0142_0F904BC6DD2A2408"/>
to allow themſelves more latitude in their modes of teaching, as well as in the choice of ſubjects for their lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>To be inſtructed, ſaid he, in the learned languages, in the ſeveral bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of ſcience, and the deeper parts of philoſophy, is not the whole intent of ſending youth to a public ſchool. Theſe may be acquired, perhaps, to an equal perfection under a private tutor at home. But every parent has a right to expect, when he is at the expence of giving his child a regular <hi>univerſity</hi> education, that he ſhould be turned out, not only a good ſcholar, but a well-bred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and that he ſhould be equally capable of ſhining in converſation and in writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:013258_0141_0F904BC84F006888"/>The <hi>Provoſt</hi> being obliged to leave us, as it was his lecture hour, and the morning being remarkably fine, we agreed to take a walk to the <hi>Proprietor</hi>'s garden, as 'tis called, a pleaſant little ſpot upon the bank of the ſweet river <hi>Schuylkill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During our walk, the converſation we had begun in the <hi>Publick Hall</hi> was reſumed. Our friend L—obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that there were many qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and accompliſhments, which, tho' not of primary conſideration, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs of infinite ſervice, nay, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to ſet off our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in knowledge.—Can any thing, for inſtance, ſaid he, be more agreeable and engaging, than a ready, polite, and unaffected method of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering one's ſentiments both in writing
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:013258_0143_0F904BC9CB387B78"/>
and converſation, without that ſtarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preciſe and pedantic turn of ſtile and manner, which generally charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terizes the mere ſcholar? Can any thing have an happier effect, either in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate company, or a publick audience, than an eaſy, free, and unconſtrained geſture, accompanying a diſtinct, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and harmonious manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Or what can afford more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ourſelves, or more entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our friends, than a well culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated <hi>taſte</hi> for the beauties of art and nature? Now all theſe powers are more or leſs in every human Being; and there is no time of life ſo proper and convenient for the calling them forth, as thoſe early years, which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent at ſchool. 'Tis by <hi>imitation</hi> and <hi>emulation</hi> alone, that theſe latent ſeeds of genius are to be awakened and
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:013258_0144_0F904BCADA61EBE8"/>
improved; and 'tis well known, that a fondneſs of theſe is one of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions of youth.</p>
               <p>Had man been intended for a ſolitary Being, then indeed theſe qualifications could have been of little uſe to him: But as his nature points him out for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, his duty, as well as intereſt, ought to lead him to ſuch an exertion of his talents, as will render him uſeful and agreeable to all around.—A mere ſcholar is ſcarcely tolerable; and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall forget the ridiculous appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which one of our moſt learned Doctors of <hi>Maudlin</hi> always made in a circle of polite company, and even among us his pupils in the lecture-room. I cannot but think it a misfortune to himſelf, to his friends and the public,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:013258_0145_0F904BCB73D4D068"/>
that a man of Dr. T—'s ſuperior knowledge and abilities, for want of a few neceſſary external graces, which he might have acquired twenty years ago with the greateſt eaſe and pleaſure, ſhould be doomed to ſpend his days in obſcurity, cloſetted up with a parcel of muſty authors, and incapable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that figure in ſocial life and polite converſation, which his diſtinguiſhed talents would otherwiſe have enabled him to do. At preſent he can neither do juſtice to his own abilities, nor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them of any great ſervice to others.</p>
               <p>Here the good clergyman replied, with a mildneſs peculiar to his character, that the fate of Dr. T— might not attend every one, who had miſſed the opportunity of obtaining theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments in his younger years at
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:013258_0146_0F904BCC344E9448"/>
a publick ſchool.—Some, he obſerved, were furniſhed with them by the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nature; and others very readily acquired them by falling into polite company, after they had finiſhed their ſtudies.</p>
               <p>True, Sir, anſwered our friend— I am acquainted with ſeveral ingenious gentlemen, who are ſolely indebted to nature or the beau-monde for many ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able external qualifications, which they poſſeſs. I grant that a youth of nice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, mature judgment and a ſprightly natural diſpoſition, may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his taſte, correct his manners, and fit himſelf to adorn the ſocial life, by frequently converſing with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as have added to an extenſive erudition the moſt refined taſte, and all the graces of carriage and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:013258_0147_0F904BCCEA8D1CB8"/>
But then, experience muſt have informed us, that there are few who do not think themſelves ſufficiently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, after they have gone through their courſe of ſtudies at a public ſchool; and conſequently look upon it as beneath them, when they come abroad into the world, to copy after the taſte, behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or converſation of other men: To which I might add, that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſome ſcholars will not allow them an opportunity of keeping ſuch company, as would contribute to their improvement in theſe things. And hence it becomes a matter of the utmoſt importance, that the maſters and tutors of our public ſeminaries ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be men of ſound learning, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, well bred, and of the moſt eaſy, gentle and engaging deportment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:013258_0148_0F904BCDB4F0F2B0"/>Beſides, continued Mr. L—, there are ſome of the qualifications that have been mentioned, which are neither to be obtained from converſation with the polite world, nor yet are given en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to any one by the indulgence of nature.</p>
               <p>To inſtance only one of theſe: Whence comes it, that we have ſo few eminent ſpeakers either in the pulpit or at the bar? Were the amiable gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſpeech ſolely in the gift of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or were they to be acquired by frequenting the genteeleſt company and converſing with the politeſt part of mankind, I can ſcarcely imagine that the number of orators would be ſo ſmall, or that thoſe whom nature hath bleſſed, perhaps, with many other graces and accompliſhments, and whoſe ſtations
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:013258_0149_0F904BCE6C7689B0"/>
in life always entitle them to aſſociate with the higheſt and beſt of men, ſhould be ſo generally deficient in the art of <hi>ſpeaking well.</hi> For my part, I can attribute this to no other cauſe than the too common neglect of this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch of education at moſt of our public ſchools. And hence it is, that a late ingenious and polite writer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, "that the moſt eſtabliſhed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of an univerſity education is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral neglect of all thoſe little qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and accompliſhments, which make up the character of a well-bred man, and the general attention to what is called deep learning."<note n="*" place="bottom">The Guardian.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After having expreſſed my approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ſentiments in general, I only begged leave to obſerve, that
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:013258_0150_0F904BCF2C7EEA38"/>
though the ſeeds or principles of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, taſte and every graceful accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment were undoubtedly implanted in every human breaſt, yet nature had ſtrongly pointed out ſome predominant powers in each individual, ſufficiently characteriſtic of that particular excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by which, if properly attended to and improved, each might become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and illuſtrious in his own proper ſphere.—To watch theſe dawning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to take the moſt proper method of ſtrengthening and improving them, and to direct the youthful mind to ſuch ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and employments in life, as appear beſt adapted to its peculiar genius, muſt ſurely be the principal objects of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's attention. The orator, the poet, the philoſopher, the patriot, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, generally appear at an earlier ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of life than is commonly imagined.

                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHY will you ſeek to draw me into a religious diſpute?—I have often told you, that I looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on polemics in divinity to be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and much more injurious to the chriſtian temper, than in any of the other ſciences. 'Tis not the cauſe of truth and goodneſs eſſentially and ſimply conſidered; but it is merely their own private opinion, or that of ſome great Doctor, or leader of a ſect, that men in
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:013258_0154_0F904BD38DEEE500"/>
general are zealous to maintain. The reformation of the heart and life is the great and only end of true religion: and I cannot think this end will ever be promoted by ſuch controverſies as have a tendency to kindle up wrath, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce bitterneſs of ſpirit; however the advocates on either ſide may flatter themſelves, that they are zealous for the honour of God, and ardently deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of reſcuing their friends or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from the dominion of error.</p>
               <p>When I was laſt at <hi>New-York,</hi> I was really forfeited with the converſation of one of your <hi>Methodiſt Saints.</hi> Such an air of arrogance and ſelf-ſufficiency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared even in his vehement declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the pride and ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human nature, that I was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to ſee a perſon of your uſual pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:013258_0155_0F904BD3B3B20DF8"/>
ſo duped by an enthuſiaſtical pretender, as not to diſcover the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an evil temper under the flimſy, flaunting veil of a falſe and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal zeal. My heart deceives me greatly, if I have not an high veneration, and ſincere love for all good men, however they differ from one another or myſelf. The marks of goodneſs, indeed, I have always looked for in the temper and conduct: and where theſe fail, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my religion hath taught me to pronounce all other pretences vain and deluſive.</p>
               <p>I was once acquainted with a foreign clergyman, who was perfectly maſter of all the canting peculiarities, which diſtinguiſh the brethren of the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle. I thought him at firſt much in earneſt, and eſteemed him as an honeſt
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:013258_0156_0F904BD46A55A580"/>
man, though his notions were very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from mine. But he ſoon forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my friendſhip by a conduct, which common honeſty muſt teach every man to deteſt—Talking upon indifferent ſubjects in a mixed company, he would appear as chearful and ſprightly as any in the circle; nay, I have frequently obſerved him, under an affectation of mirth and humor, ſtoop to puerilities. —In the midſt of ſuch a converſation, was any one in company to drop a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hint, or make a ſingle grave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, or did any of his very <hi>ſerious</hi> friends enter the room, every muſcle of his countenance would change its form, an awful gloom would cover his brow, his eyes and hands would be elevated, his tone of voice would become ſolemn and plaintive, his lips would utter ſome pious reflection or ejaculation, and he
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:013258_0157_0F91E58F1EA34EB8"/>
would attempt in a very aukward man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to give a ſerious turn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. I ſoon grew ſick of all this grimace, gradually withdrew from his acquaintance, and was afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſeveral who had been as much deceived as myſelf, that his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conduct was utterly inconſiſtent with his formal profeſſion.</p>
               <p>In this and two or three other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I bought my experience at no ſmall price. The uneaſineſs of mind which I always ſuffer on the detection of fraud or inſincerity in a pretended friend, is far heavier to me than any temporal loſs I might thereby ſuſtain.</p>
               <p>You ſeem to intimate in your laſt Letter, that I ſhould ſoon become as religious as you wiſh me to be, could
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:013258_0158_0F904BD5CE4FA688"/>
I diſengage myſelf from the polite cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle with which I am connected in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as well as in <hi>America;</hi> and that nothing but the apprehenſion of being cenſured for <hi>ſingularity</hi> keeps me from living in ſuch a manner, and converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch a ſet of people, as you think would highly contribute to my ſpiritual improvement.</p>
               <p>True politeneſs, CHARLES, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine offspring of true religion—A ſullen ſeverity of manners is no where inculcated in the goſpel. —Meekneſs, humility and condeſcenſion are there marked out as fundamental graces— And where theſe reign in the heart, they will ſurely dictate ſuch a ſweet and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conduct, as is only mimicked by the common forms of what is called <hi>good-breeding.</hi> I find as great want of
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:013258_0159_0F904BD5EF7A5F88"/>
this true politeneſs among the rich as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor. <hi>Wealth</hi> gives it not— neither does <hi>poverty</hi> withold it. Like its illuſtrious parent, it is confined to no religion, ſect or denomination— SIR J—N has it not—but I find it in LORD P—. My poor ſervant has no pretenſions to it—He is as rude as a ſavage—Your's has it fully according to his ſtation—He is as mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and affectionate as a lamb—We ſeek for it in vain in the meer bows and compliments of a church-man— We are ſurpriſed ſometimes to find it in the ſimplicity of a quaker.</p>
               <p>When you ſpeak of the <hi>polite</hi> circle of friends or acquaintance, with which I am connected, I am ſure you cannot affix the ſame meaning to the word <hi>politeneſs,</hi> that I have here given it, or
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:013258_0160_0F904BD6D07E4E28"/>
you would not wiſh to ſee me diſengag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them. Your expreſſions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt allude to thoſe among them, who are diſtinguiſhed either for their opulence or their titles and exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in life. But why, my dear friend, ſhould I break off all connections with theſe? my acquaintance with many of them began in my earlieſt years. Though of foreign extraction, you know I had my univerſity-education in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Connections formed during the earlier periods of life, both of us have experienced to be ſtrong and tender.— The friendſhip and kind offices of ſome of this polite circle we have both been favoured with. There are many truly amiable characters among them: and though ſome of them may appear to have ſhaken off the reſtraints of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:013258_0161_0F904BD9E9B6B9E8"/>
in their <hi>outward</hi> conduct; yet chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian charity leads me to hope, that they are not altogether deſtitute of good principles <hi>within.</hi> Of what ſervice would it be to me to keep at a diſtance from them, to ſhun their company, or ſlight their correſpondence?—It would ſurely hurt the fineſt feelings of my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life—It would hurt my gratitude, my affection, my charity—It would hurt my humility, my meekneſs, and love of peace—It would raiſe paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in me that I would fain have extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed—It would tempt me to think myſelf their ſuperior in virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—It would tempt me to indulge a cenſorious diſpoſition, and to treat them with a mortifying coldneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference—It would mingle bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the ſweets that heaven hath
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:013258_0162_0F904BDAB85ACDB8"/>
freely ſent me—and thus render me, ungrateful to my God as well as to them. Beſides, it would undoubtedly give them a very unfavourable opinion of my religious principles, when they diſcovered that they had ſuch an evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on my conduct—when they found me no longer as kind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, as willing to oblige, and as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to their perſons and their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, as I had heretofore been.</p>
               <p>My American friends are among the moſt ingenious and virtuous men I have ever met with. You were introduced to many of them during your late vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to this place. You admired them— and obſerved, that they only wanted one ingredient to make their character compleat. I knew your meaning at once: and I think I ſhall very eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate

your objection, when I come to give you my ſentiments upon what you call <hi>ſingularity,</hi> the charge of which you ſeem to think I am ſadly afraid of. This I ſhall not fail of doing in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture letter.</p>

               </head>

                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I PROMISED in my laſt to give you my ſentiments upon <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</hi> The expreſſion is ambiguous. It ſerves to denote a good as well as a bad character. The hypocrite glories in it—The humble man alone poſſeſſes it without offence to himſelf or his neighbour.</p>
               <p>Some people are ſo weak as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the religious character muſt
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:013258_0166_0F904BDE2B691538"/>
neceſſarily be accompanied with, and diſtinguiſhed from all others by, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, preciſe and reſerved deportment, an auſterity in the countenance and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a cautious avoiding of all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or civil communication with thoſe, who do not, in their whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, conform to a certain ſtandard, which anſwers to their idea of a religious man.</p>
               <p>Others again place this ſingularity in a perpetual talking upon religious ſubjects—Their whole converſation, be they where they will, conſiſts of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but common-place maxims, ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quotations, and ſeemingly pious remarks upon every occurrence that they meet with in the courſe of the day —or what is ſtill worſe, of vain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:013258_0167_0F904BDEEE753810"/>
diſputes about modes of faith, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or worſhip.</p>
               <p>Alas! my dear Charles! all this may very properly be called the pedantry of religion, and, like that of human learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a ſure proof, that their knowledge and experience are extremely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. Many of theſe <hi>ſolemn triflers</hi> do we daily meet with; who value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon this affected ſingularity, and think they ſhew a vaſt deal of religious heroiſm, by talking in a ſtrain, which they know to be exceedingly mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the generality of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.—But ſuch perſons as theſe would do well to take our Lord's advice, and ſeriouſly conſider, <hi>what manner of ſpirit they are of</hi>—They would do well to examine their own hearts, and try, whether they cannot diſcover a ſecret ſpring of ſpiritual pride, which ſets
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:013258_0168_0F904BDFABD442B8"/>
their tongues in motion; and whether a word or two dropt in ſeaſon, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without deſign, and in a ſpirit of meekneſs, humility and condeſcenſion to their brethren, would not have a much ſurer and better effect, than all their vain and empty bablings.</p>
               <p>Far be it from me, my friend, to diſcourage a truly religious converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But there is a meekneſs of wiſdom, as the Scripture beautifully expreſſes it, that will modeſtly avail itſelf of every favourable opportunity, and with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming zeal exert itſelf in the cauſe of truth.—They who beſt know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are certainly beſt acquainted with human nature. Such perſons will ever be careful, in their converſation and deportment, to be <hi>wiſe as ſerpents, and harmleſs as doves, to become all things to
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:013258_0169_0F904BE0F7511A30"/>
all men,</hi> that is, to ſtudy the various prejudices and infirmities of men, and form their diſcourſe and conduct in ſuch a manner, as will not have any tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to diſguſt or affront them, but on the other hand, by forbearance and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, will win their hearts, and thus command their attention.</p>
               <p>The only ſingularity, therefore, which is juſtifiable, is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, not in words, or even in particular actions, but in ſuch a general uniform tenor of heart and temper and conduct, as will not indeed, like the phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal formalities, be ſo eaſily diſcerned by every vulgar eye, but will never fail of making its way at laſt through every obſtacle and impediment, which the adverſaries of truth and virtue may throw up againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="unknown:013258_0170_0F904BE259DA83D8"/>Some characters are doubtleſs to be met with, whoſe ſingularity does not ſo much conſiſt, in <hi>not following the multitude</hi> at all, as in <hi>not following them to do evil,</hi> whoſe life is an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſcript of their Redeemer's—who, like him, <hi>go about doing good,—who ſhine forth as lights in the midſt of a dark and perverſe generation,</hi> and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is known and felt by a ſure, though ſilent and gentle operation.—</p>
               <p>Such characters are worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—They are ſtamped with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the deity—They bear the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of unfeigned truth and pure diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted goodneſs—They are known and only to be known by their bleſſed fruits. Whereever they go—whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do in public or in private— among their neighbours, friends and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:013258_0171_0F904BE2FB88F780"/>
acquaintance, or in their own little fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily circle—their ſingularity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in no other way, than in the ſweetneſs of their temper—the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their deportment—the unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected decency of their converſation— their readineſs to oblige—their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſacrifice of private eaſe or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to the comfort and convenience of their brethren; but above all, their chearful, eaſy and affectionate methods of communicating what they know to be uſeful and neceſſary in temporal as well as ſpiritual concerns, to all ſuch as are humble enough to apply for, and ingenuous enough to receive and profit by their inſtructions.</p>
               <p>No ſour and forbidding ſeverity ſits upon their brow—Their houſes, their hands and their hearts are open to all
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:013258_0172_0F904BE36AFACAD8"/>
that ſtand in need of their aſſiſtance. In a word, the lovelineſs of true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appears in their whole conduct,— and even thoſe, who will not imitate, dare not condemn them.</p>
               <p>If I underſtand any thing of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, this is the life which it recommends. Would but its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors act up to its dictates, live like their maſter, and dare to be ſingular in being and doing good—would they but apply to the exhauſtleſs ſource of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for thoſe bleſſed influences of his ſpirit, whereby alone their evil tempers and paſſions can be eradicated, and an heavenly life, with all its diſpoſitions and graces, opened in their hearts— Deiſts would be confounded—Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites would tremble—And bad men of all ſorts be more effectually alarmed,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:013258_0173_0F904BE428B98598"/>
than by all the thundering eloquence of the moſt zealous preachers in the world.</p>
               <p>I truſt, my good friend, that my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religious ſingularity will be found to correſpond with your own; and that we differ more about <hi>words</hi> than about <hi>things.</hi>

               <p>THE account you ſent me of the popular tumults, that have for ſome time ſubſiſted in your government, differs in no material circumſtances from that which I have read in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic papers. I am glad to hear that you have had fortitude enough to keep yourſelf diſengaged from either party.

heat of faction, watch the motions of their acquaintance or connections on both ſides, and ſeize upon ſome happy moment, ſome favourable circumſtance for the accompliſhment of their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent purpoſe.</p>
               <p>You ſeem, however, to lean a little to the ſide of prerogative, and give ſome hints, that ſound like the language of a <hi>Jure Divino</hi> politician; and after all, very gravely aſk me, what are my ideas of <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> and a <hi>Patriot King?</hi> You talk of ſcriptural notions of government, and wonder what ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections can be made to that kind of homage and obedience, which is thereby not only warranted, but enjoined to be paid to Kings and all thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſupreme authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:013258_0176_0F904BE92780E658"/>My anſwer to your queſtion need not be long.—We are to conſider, that the Jewiſh government was a Theocracy, that all its laws, inſtitutions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances were ſent down immediately from Heaven; and thoſe who were inveſted with the ſupreme executive power on earth, derived their authority from no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſource than the MOST HIGH GOD. They were delegates of Heaven, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Repreſentatives of the King of Kings, exerciſing his ſupreme authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon earth, ſupported by his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal protection, and accountable for their actions to none but him. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was not to be ſcrutinized by the people; and to lift up the hand againſt the Lord's anointed was Sacrilege of the blackeſt nature, and to be puniſhed with inſtant death. But ſurely all thoſe who are inveſted with Kingly authority
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:013258_0177_0F904BE9729DD320"/>
are not in the ſame circumſtances, nor do they derive their power <hi>immediately</hi> from the ſame ſource with the Jewiſh Monarchs: and conſequently the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under them are not bound by the particular political precepts of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocracy, but by the Laws of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular government under which they live; and the nature of their homage to their Prince can alone be determined by thoſe laws.</p>
               <p>Indeed, in every civilized nation, however differing in their forms or conſtitutions of government, nay even among thoſe where the royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is reſtricted and limited by national laws, and the people are preſumed and acknowledged to be the ſource of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet the Sovereign may ſtill be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in ſome reſpect, as the Miniſter
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:013258_0178_0F904BEA2DAC2380"/>
of Heaven, and the Vice-gerent of God, as being by his Providence advanced to that exalted ſtation. My idea of a Patriot King, therefore, founded on theſe ſentiments of Kingly power, will be expreſſed in a few words.</p>
               <p>The grand deſign of all human go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, in whatever form they are modelled and eſtabliſhed, is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people; and the end of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority, however and in whomſoever it is inveſted, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this happineſs, by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers, and the reward or protection of thoſe that do well. It is highly incumbent therefore, upon all thoſe, whom Providence hath advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this exalted ſtation, to be as bold in the puniſhment of vice, as in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſupport of virtue.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:013258_0179_0F904BEAEA822BF0"/>
Oppreſſion will appear in many ſhapes, and want will extend her naked arms for comfort and redreſs. The indigent and fatherleſs will be ſuitors for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and thoſe who have no other friends on earth, will reſort to them as the Proxies or Repreſentatives of Heaven.</p>
               <p>To deal out Juſtice with an unſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and impartial hand, to regard not the quality of the offender, but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the offence, to adminiſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and relief to the poor and helpleſs, and protect the hard earnings of honeſt induſtry from the hands of rapine and oppreſſion; to pull down corruption from the ſeat of honour, and to call forth modeſt merit and probity undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed to fill its place; but above all to be themſelves the bright examples
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:013258_0180_0F904BEBB582E210"/>
as well as patrons of every virtue, and to ſupport the true ſpirit and dignity of government without ſeeming to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; theſe are ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duties of the Kingly office; theſe will attract and command the eſteem, veneration, and obedience of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects more effectually than all the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did regalia that ſurround their throne. Nay 'tis by the application of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſuch purpoſes as theſe, that they reſemble the divinity, and co-operate with Providence in his grand ſcheme of univerſal benevolence.</p>
               <p>Happy that ſovereign, who by deeds of true patriotiſm, and the exerciſe of every public as well as private virtue, eſtabliſhes his throne in the hearts of his ſubjects, whoſe ſtrength is their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, whoſe will their united voice,
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:013258_0181_0F904BEC7926BCC0"/>
who ſtudies to ſatisfy the real, not the imaginary wants of his people, and who can readily diſtinguiſh betwixt the clamour of licentiouſneſs, and the ſtill and affectionate voice of loyal liberty.</p>
               <p>Happy that people whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath favoured with a Monarch poſſeſſed of ſuch amiable qualifications. And thrice happy, my good friend, ſhould we conſider ourſelves, who live under a mild and well tempered go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in which the limits of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er are ſo accurately adjuſted, that the ſovereign is inveſted with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary prerogative, and the juſt rights of the people well defined and well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. O may the glorious ſpirit which it breathes, never be perverted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to licentiouſneſs, but handed down to the lateſt poſterity uncorrupted and
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:013258_0182_0F904BED37F73D70"/>
unſhaken by the ignorance or craft of weak or wicked men.</p>
               <p>I heartily wiſh you the return of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic peace, unanimity in all your councils, and proſperity of every kind to the colony in which you reſide, and am, Sir,</p>

               <p>THAT I may not be thought unmindful of my promiſe, or inattentive to any thing that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to your entertainment, I here tranſcribe three pieces of American po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry from manuſcripts, which were very obligingly communicated to me by the authors, who are by no means anxious for poetical fame, but now and then, as they expreſs it, ſcribble a few lines for the amuſement of themſelves and
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:013258_0184_0F904BEEAA9F0E78"/>
their friends. The firſt is an epiſode extracted from a poem called <hi>The Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Treaty,</hi> which is not yet finiſhed. The epiſode is natural, tender, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as I think the ſubject requires, in common, though not vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. This is a diſtinction, which muſt ever be obſerved in compoſitions of the <hi>pathetic</hi> kind. The <hi>ſublime</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes itſelf to feelings of a different nature, which can only be rouſed by a ſuperior ſtrength of imagination, aided by a ſtile that ſoars far above that of the vulgar. The author of the epiſode has attended to this diſtinction. He has told his tale with tenderneſs and ſimplicity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpecimen of poetry is of the elegiac kind.— I have heard that Lord Cheſterfield ſhould have ſaid of
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:013258_0185_0F904BEF8BBFFAF8"/>
Mr. Hammond, the author of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, that "he always ſat down to write what he thought, not as moſt authors do, to think what he ſhould write"— I leave it to your Lordſhip to judge, whether the author of the elegy has any title to ſuch a compliment as this.</p>
               <p>The third ſpecimen is of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque kind; and as the ſubject is new, and handled in the true mock-heroic ſtrain, I am perſuaded, it will at leaſt divert your Lordſhip for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <p>LOOKING over ſome of my papers the other day, I met with the following character of King GEORGE II, drawn ſoon after his deceaſe, by a friend of mine in England, to whoſe ſentiments in general I am inclined to be ſomewhat partial. It anſwers ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to the idea I had conceived of an Engliſh patriot King, that I beg leave to tranſcribe it; and deſire you may conſider it as a ſupplement to what I ſaid in my former letter. Whether his late Majeſty was juſtly entituled to the

                  <p>To attempt, ſays my friend, a <hi>particular</hi> character of our deceaſed Sovereign, and to trace his virtues through every part and period of his glorious reign, is far from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign. It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the affections of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were the nobleſt teſtimony of his excellencies, while <hi>living,</hi> and the tears of a whole nation, the beſt <hi>eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> that could be given to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ;when <hi>dead.</hi>

the Britiſh arms, the good old KING was called to his long home.

This was, however, denied him. Thou haſt had enough of conqueſt, ſaid the Meſſenger of Death. Thou haſt beheld the pride of thine enemies humbled, though their power is not yet cruſhed. Thou haſt lived to a good old age, happy in the love and veneration of thy people.

                  <salute>DEAR CHARLES,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU ſeem to hint in your laſt, that a ſpirit of reſentment is in ſome caſes not only allowable, but even praiſe-worthy; and eſpecially, where the cauſe of true Religion is attacked, or a virtuous character vilified and inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I muſt differ from my friend in this, as I have ventured to do in ſome other of his opinions. And as an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for this difference, I muſt beg his patience, whilſt I draw the character of a truly <hi>meek</hi> man, which I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:013258_0206_0F904B45DA111C68"/>
to copy from the <hi>Goſpel Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> I will briefly conſider his temper and conduct with reſpect to himſelf, his family and his neighbours.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to <hi>himſelf,</hi> he well knows, that his ſpirit is united to an earthly nature of ſuch groſs and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable ſubſtance as is ready to kindle from the ſmalleſt ſpark, and, if not carefully watched, would ſoon involve the whole man in an unquenchable flame. He finds it his duty, therefore, to be perpetually upon his guard, that he may ſmother at once every riſing ſpark, and thus preſerve that coolneſs and compoſure, which are ſome of the moſt eſſential ingredients of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.— From whatever quarter theſe ſparks may fly, whether from ſickneſs or affliction, from worldly loſſes and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:013258_0207_0F904B4608CC1EF8"/>
diſappointments, or perſonal injuries and affronts, his peace is equally endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—All murmuring, peeviſhneſs and fretfulneſs under the former; and all wrath, bitterneſs and reſentment under the latter, if ſuffered to take poſſeſſion of his heart, will inevitably rob him of his internal quiet and ſatisfaction, and abſolutely put an end to all real enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf or the world in which he lives.—He knows, that by giving way to theſe evil paſſions, he ſubjects himſelf to all kinds of uneaſineſs and vexation: And inaſmuch as from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience of his own inability to reſiſt their ſudden and violent attacks he has learned to look up for ſuperior and ſupernatural aid; he, therefore, turns immediately to the redeeming power of the SON of GOD within him.
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:013258_0208_0F904B46CCE2FB10"/>
For he knows, that he is a GOD <hi>at hand</hi> and <hi>not afar off.</hi> Upon his Providence he ſafely relies; to his wiſe diſpoſals he chearfully ſubmits, and on his ſpirit he depends for that ſpiritual ſtrength, which alone can aſſiſt and deliver him in every conflict of nature.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleneſs, patience and ſubmiſſion manifeſt themſelves in his whole behaviour and deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the little <hi>family</hi> circle, with which he is happily ſurrounded. Some envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and intruding clouds, you well know, my dear CHARLES, will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently intervene, and obſcure the brighteſt ſunſhine of <hi>domeſtic</hi> bliſs. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe, his ſerenity will continue unruffled. <hi>Conjugal</hi> felicity, and all the endearments of <hi>father, ſon</hi> and <hi>brother,</hi> he deems the higheſt that earth can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:013258_0209_0F904B479AC7AAC8"/>
afford.—To preſeve theſe invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, he will bear, and forbear, and comply, and condeſcend, and uſe every winning and attractive art, that can ſooth and ſoften, that can baniſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, and introduce harmony, peace and love. God is a God of order and love. Where-ever theſe are violated even in the minuteſt inſtances, there is a breach of his eternal law; and at this breach the powers of darkneſs will ever be ready to enter, and obſcure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex and confound the minds of thoſe who have made it. He is not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Wiſe-Man expreſſes it, <hi>like a lion in his houſe, or frantic among his children or his ſervants;</hi> but he governs his little flock with prudence and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and endeavours to introduce Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into their hearts, and to make them an <hi>Houſhold</hi> of GOD, a family of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:013258_0210_0F904B4836B23280"/>With reſpect to his <hi>neighbours,</hi> he is particularly careful to keep his mind, under the influences of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> in ſuch a frame as neither to give nor take offence, neither to provoke <hi>them</hi> by any actions of <hi>his,</hi> nor ſuffer <hi>himſelf</hi> to be kindled into wrath or reſentment by any actions of <hi>theirs.</hi> He knows, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with all this meekneſs and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper, he may and ought to maintain and defend his juſt rights, and never give them up, but at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of peace or charity, or ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter claim than mere unkindneſs, envy or ill-nature can ſet up. As to perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al injuries and ill-treatment, he knows that the worſt of theſe cannot hurt him. So far from reſenting, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives them from the bottom of his heart. For he conſiders the exerciſe of
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:013258_0211_0F904B48F5661AE0"/>
                  <hi>meekneſs</hi> upon theſe occaſions, not as an unmanly cowardice, but (as every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, philoſophical and religious mind will ever conſider it) as the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of heroic virtue: Becauſe by this he not only defeats effectually the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of malice and envy, but (which is an infinitely more noble conqueſt) he triumphs over <hi>himſelf,</hi> and leads every furious frantic paſſion of his fallen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in chains. In a word, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a <hi>meek and quiet ſpirit</hi> as one of the greateſt <hi>ornaments</hi> of human nature, one of the grand characteriſtics, by which not only the well-bred gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is diſtinguiſhed from the untutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clown, but the <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian, from the <hi>nominal</hi> profeſſor. And above all, he ſets the higheſt value upon this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace, becauſe the cultivation of it opens and brings to perfection that

                  <hi>Birth</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that <hi>Image</hi> of his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> in his breaſt, by which he lives in Heaven whilſt he is here upon earth, changes earth into Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has the beſt and trueſt enjoyment of the preſent ſhort period of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR and REV. SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I WAS not a little ſurprized the other day when we dined together at the honourable and worthy Mr. H—'s, to hear you launch forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch high encomiums upon the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and writings of Mr STERNE. Unwilling to interrupt the chearfulneſs of the company by introducing any thing that might have the appearance of a ſerious diſpute, I only rallied you a little upon your attachment to this deſultory writer, and reminded you of ſome paſſages, the groſs indelicacy
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:013258_0216_0F904B4D6A948EF8"/>
of which is ſcarcely covered by the ſlimſy gauze of his fine expreſſion. You replied to me by quoting ſome of thoſe tender and pathetic ſtrokes, which we meet with here and there through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his volumes, which beſpeak, as you ſaid, a truly benevolent and ſympathetic heart, and more than atone for all the indelicate ſlips of his pen.</p>
               <p>I admire thoſe ſtrokes as much as you do: But ſtill I am not quite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that the feelings he deſcribes are any thing more than thoſe we have in common with the brute creation, at leaſt that there is any thing heavenly in them, 'till they come to be placed under the direction of an heavenly power, and act in ſubſerviency to its inward dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates; otherwiſe, paſſion may get the name of virtue, and a finely attempered
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:013258_0217_0F904B4E93C7E760"/>
frame become the only Heaven we would wiſh for.</p>
               <p>Suffer me, then, to <hi>preach</hi> a little to the <hi>preacher,</hi> and give you my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon true <hi>ſympathy</hi> or <hi>tenderneſs of heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We miſtake the matter exceedingly, my friend, if we imagine, that true <hi>tenderneſs of heart</hi> is no other than that <hi>animal ſympathy,</hi> if I may ſo call it, which is common to wicked as well as good men, nay, which even the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeem to be poſſeſſed of in a very conſiderable degree. That mixture of good and evil, which is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the preſent ſyſtem of things, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produces ſome very lovely and delightful appearances and effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="unknown:013258_0218_0F904B4FC9B37988"/>When we walk into our gardens, we find our ſenſes moſt agreeably refreſhed by the beauty, fragrance or taſte of the various kinds of herbage, fruits or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that ſpring forth from the common ſoil. We feel the meekneſs of Heaven itſelf in the calmneſs and ſerenity of a morning or evening ſky. We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the ſweet ſollicitude, which birds and beaſts teſtify for their mates as well as their offspring. And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admire the fond attachment, the ſeeming friendſhip and gratitude, which ſome of the more ſagacious among them frequently ſhew to man.</p>
               <p>But as all theſe pleaſing wonders of the animate as well as inanimate ſyſtem are no other than the productions or births of this temporary world, ſo they partake of all the changes and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:013258_0219_0F904B50955EB400"/>
to which it is continually expoſed. They are born, and grow, and bloom, and come to their perfection—and then fade, and wither, and die, and diſſolve into the original elements, out of which they ſprung.</p>
               <p>Man, conſidered merely with reſpect to his body, is no more than <hi>a joint te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the ſhade</hi> with the beaſts of the field. The ſame inſtincts, the ſame appetites and paſſions reign in his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part. Like them he is ſubject to the changes of the elements. Like them he is born, and grows, and comes to maturity —and then gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, and dies, and ſinks into one common grave with them.</p>
               <p>But then he has within him a ſpark of immorality, a birth of heaven, a ray
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:013258_0220_0F904B5157BF1230"/>
of the divinity, which, tho' impriſoned in a tenement of clay, can and will, if permitted, look beyond its narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference into that eternal world, out of which it came. By its ſpiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the great father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits it is enabled to compare temporal things with ſpiritual, and form ſuch a true and accurate eſtimate, founded upon its own experience and ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as will always point out that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, which the heavenly part with its heavenly deſires ſhould maintain over the earthly part with its earthly inſtincts and appetites. But perhaps it may be neceſſary to expreſs this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in clearer and more explicit terms.</p>
               <p>There is certainly, amongſt men, ſomething like what I have heard called <hi>conſtitutional</hi> virtue, that is to ſay, a
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:013258_0221_0F904B52BB04B420"/>
virtue, that takes its riſe from, and depends upon a man's particular make or conſtitution, the ſtate of his blood or nerves.</p>
               <p>Thus you will find amongſt a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of children of the ſame family <hi>one,</hi> that from his very cradle ſeems to be bold and intrepid, fearleſs of danger, eager and enterprizing; <hi>another,</hi> timid, irreſolute, eaſily caſt down or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—<hi>one,</hi> haughty, vain, forward and impertinent,—<hi>another,</hi> meek, humble, diffident and modeſt—<hi>one,</hi> that ſeems to be a ſtranger to pity, tenderneſs and love—<hi>another,</hi> melting into tears at the proſpect, or even recital of the leaſt diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>That this variety of tempers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions depends not upon education is
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:013258_0222_0F904B538CD7DB68"/>
ſufficiently obvious. For children of the ſame family are generally treated in the ſame manner, and ſimilar advice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are given to all. Now, 'tis very remarkable, that the ſame variety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions ſhews itſelf equally conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the brute creation. Hence we may reaſonably conclude, that in men as well as brutes they ſpring forth from that mixture of good and evil, which characterizes every object of temporal nature.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Aye, ſays the infidel: This is all very true—we are ſo born —we are ſo conſtituted—and therefore our vices and our virtues are alike ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unavoidable. Talk no more, then, of your diſtinctions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt right and wrong—our tempers depend upon the conſtitution of our
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:013258_0223_0F904B544D4166F0"/>
bodies—and vice and virtue are but empty names.</p>
                  <p>A perſon in diſtreſs ſolicits my charity—if I am a good-natured man, as 'tis called, or if the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made to me, when I am in a good humour, I moſt chearfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter relief—But if I am of a ſour temper, or am called upon at an unfavourable ſeaſon, I turn my back upon the object, and diſmiſs him with wrath.</p>
                  <p>I riſe in the morning in an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good humour, pleaſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with myſelf and every body about me—I am happy and chearful in my family—I walk abroad, and ſalute every friend that meets me with a ſmile. Within an hour or two,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:013258_0224_0F904B551555BF08"/>
all my feelings are changed. Some diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable piece of intelligence rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to myſelf—ſome ſlight ſhewn me by an acquaintance—ſome little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in my worldly intereſts —or perhaps, a little cold that I have caught—theſe, or any other trifling accidents are ſufficient to oppreſs my ſpirits, diſcompoſe my temper, and make me feel diſſatisfied with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and every body about me. All my affection, my tenderneſs and love are gone: And whilſt I remain in this ſituation, I am indifferent alike ;to virtue and vice.</p>
                  <p>Now then, continues the exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infidel, where is your religion? Where is your morality? Where is your goſpel illumination?—All is viſionary—'tis the ſtate of your blood,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:013258_0225_0F904B55B3108A50"/>
or the ſtate of your nerves, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes your virtue or your vice. On theſe alone they depend for their tranſitory exiſtence. With theſe they decay—with theſe they die.—</p>
               </q>
               <p>But tell me, thou poor purblind mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal! Amid all theſe changes and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes, that attend thy bodily frame, what is it <hi>within thee,</hi> that thinks, and reaſons, and reflects, and obſerves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every change that paſſes—and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to do ſo, let thy body be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as it may! What is it that renders thee ſecretly diſſatisfied, after thou haſt amuſed thyſelf with all theſe fine ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? What is it that tells thee, that ſuch and ſuch things are good and right and proper to be done, and that ſuch and ſuch are wrong, evil in their nature and leading to miſery—and tells thee ſo,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:013258_0226_0F904B56A3657278"/>
let thy bodily ſtate and temper be what it will, whether thy preſent humour diſpoſes thee to obey or neglect its dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates?</p>
               <p>Couldſt thou read aright the volume that is unfolded in thine heart, thou wouldſt find there the ſame language, which thy Saviour ſpeaks in his goſpel, viz: That THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN THEE; that virtue, goodneſs, holineſs, are not empty names, but that they are a real nature, of heavenly extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that they depend not merely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our animal ſenſations, but may be called forth, and brought into exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, independent of, and ſuperior to them;—that this heavenly nature will regulate, controul and direct the ſeveral paſſions or appetites of thine earthly part;—that, whether thy temper be
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:013258_0227_0F904B57426678B0"/>
gentle or violent, meek or wrathful, kind and tender, of ſour and moroſe, this bleſſed principle, if attended to and obeyed, will make both its good and its evil turn to thine advantage: It will overcome all that is harſh, peeviſh and diſcontented within thee; and will give an heavenly tincture, virtue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to thine earthly meekneſs, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love. It will teach thee to look above nature, above inſtinct, above reaſon, for that which is to ſet nature, inſtinct, reaſon, right. It will ſatisfy thee of the truth and authenticity of the BIBLE REVELATION; and teach thee to conſider thyſelf and all mankind, not only as children of ADAM, but as SONS OF GOD in CHRIST, only to be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their preſent bondage, by means of that communication which the Redeemer himſelf hath opened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:013258_0228_0F904B58A0992F30"/>
earth and heaven, betwixt our fallen ſpirits, and his own ſpirit of love.</p>
               <p>From theſe few obſervations, for which I beg your candid attention and indulgence, I think you cannot but conclude with me, that virtue, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or holineſs do not conſiſt in a mere external decency of behaviour; that they do not conſiſt in, nor are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated merely by our bodily feelings; but that they are the gifts of God in Chriſt, and to be received by the ſpirit of prayer in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Were we once, my good friend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this, we ſhould not wait for the mere ſympathy of animal nature to prompt us to benevolent deeds. We ſhould be kind and tender from a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior principle—we ſhould find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:013258_0229_0F904B58C35879D0"/>
willing to anſwer the calls of this principle, even againſt the ſtrongeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctances of our earthly part. Our tenderneſs of heart would be even and uniform in all its acts and operations: and though our eyes might even refuſe the tribute of a tear, yet our ſouls would be inwardly moved to do what compaſſion dictates ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>After all, do not think, Sir, I have been declaiming wholly againſt animal ſympathies—They have their uſes, great uſes too—but then let them not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to extend and operate beyond their native ſphere—They belong to earth—they dwell in the earthly part of our frame—If we place them indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guidance of Heaven, they will partake of the virtue of Angels—other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they will be no more in the ſight of
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:013258_0230_0F904B596B78BD08"/>
heaven, than the meekneſs of the lamb, or the tenderneſs of the turtle-dove.</p>
               <p>Receive it then, as a maxim, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed by the experience of all mankind, that outward emotion is by no means an infallible ſign of inward <hi>charity;</hi> but that <hi>tenderneſs</hi> may often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the eye, whilſt <hi>avarice,</hi> or ſome other infernal paſſion, keeps the door of the heart.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I WAS much pleaſed with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations you made the other even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the nature and exerciſe of true ſocial kindneſs, and the agreeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which you enumerated ſome of the principal cauſes of that narrow, ſelfiſh, and unkind conduct, which too generally prevails amongſt men. I am perfectly convinced with you, that we ſhould behold a very different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in human ſociety, were all its members attentive to the common offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of kindneſs towards each other— were all mean and illiberal attachments to ſelf-intereſt baniſhed from their
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:013258_0232_0F904B5BE4C7A258"/>
breaſts, and no other deſign purſued, but that of making others and themſelves as happy, as the preſent checquered ſtate of things will permit them to be.</p>
               <p>Whilſt envy rankles in our boſoms at another's riſing fame or fortune; whilſt we cannot bear to think, that our neighbour ſhould dreſs better, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain with more elegance and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, live in a better houſe, or keep up a more ſumptuous equipage than ourſelves; whilſt we ſuffer a thouſand little mean jealouſies to creep into our hearts, and adminiſter food to our wrathful paſſions, 'tis no wonder that chriſtian kindneſs ſhould have ſo little influence upon our tempers, and appear ſo ſeldom in our practice.</p>
               <p>Whilſt we ſuffer pride to take ſuch full poſſeſſion of our minds, as to make
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:013258_0233_0F904B5C87312BD8"/>
us depiſe and neglect thoſe who move in a ſphere of life inferior to our own; whilſt we ſuffer malice or reſentment to harden our hearts againſt thoſe who have ever done us an injury, or what we have thought an injury; whilſt we ſuffer ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice to ſhut the door againſt the cries of virtuous poverty, and our whole time to be ſo much ingroſſed by the calls of buſineſs, pleaſure and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we cannot find one leiſure moment to viſit the chambers of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſympathize with the afflicted or diſtreſſed; in a word, whilſt we are ſo wrapt up in our own importance, and are ſo wholly attentive to our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gratifications, that we can neither <hi>rejoice with them that do rejoice,</hi> nor <hi>weep with them that weep;</hi>—'tis no wonder that the thouſand little endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offices, which kindneſs would dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:013258_0234_0F904B5D2DB54758"/>
are overlooked at unworthy our attention, or neglected as inconſiſtent with our ſelfiſh purſuits.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, ſo ſenſible are men of the peculiar charm and gracefulneſs of a kind behaviour, that they endeavour to put on its external form, and appear to others, what they know in their own conſciences they are not in themſelves. Hence the many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, obliging, humble and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modes of ſpeech, which are in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion among thoſe at leaſt who have had a polite education. A ſtranger to theſe forms, and one who was actuated ſolely by the feelings of his own heart, would be very apt to form a favourable judgment of the hearts of thoſe, whoſe outward behaviour exhibits ſuch a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king appearance of humility and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:013258_0235_0F904B5E1BAD1D10"/>When we bow one to another as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we meet; when we declare to one that we are his very humble ſervant, to another, that we are extremely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to ſee him well; when we enquire with ſeemingly affectionate anxiety of a third, concerning the health of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and thus profeſs ourſelves deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſted in the welfare of every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that happens in our way; —what is all this, but a ſtanding proof, that men cannot but ſecretly admire, what they have not virtue enough to practiſe; and therefore have adopted the ſhadow of kindneſs in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves from the trouble of getting poſſeſſion of the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Our religion and our manners, I fear, my good madam, are in this reſpect much alike: And as we are too apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment our brethren with the forms of

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all you have ſaid, I muſt ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my firſt poſition, that every rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtate and employment of human life may be rendered ſubſervient to the purpoſes of piety and goodneſs.—'Tis not the outward circumſtances by which we are affected, but the inward ſpirit and temper of mind, by which we live and act under them.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit of chriſtianity, indeed, ſtands in direct oppoſition to the ſpirit
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:013258_0238_0F904B610991A560"/>
of this world. Its views and proſpects, its hopes and deſires all reſpect another world. Lodged within this tenement of clay lives an eternal ſpirit, to whoſe boundleſs deſires no earthly objects can poſſibly be commenſurate. Its preſent ſituation expoſes it to a variety of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the fallen nature to which it is in bondage, perplexes it with a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of contending wills, each ſeeking to obtain its favourite object. But when once this eternal ſpirit is brought to a conviction of the emptineſs and vanity of all creaturely enjoyments; when once it is brought to ſee and feel its own illuſtrious origin, and to know, that its real happineſs can only be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the great fountain-ſpirit out of which it had its Divine Birth— then the power of ſpiritual attraction immediately commences. Through a
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:013258_0239_0F904B61EC0224D0"/>
thouſand intervening obſtructions it ſeeks, and will ſeek its true center; and every outward earthly ſituation, which it may be in, is, by virtue of its hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly deſires, made to contribute to the haſtening and fulfilling of this bleſſed union.</p>
               <p>The ſeeming interruptions which a good man daily meets with from the calls of neceſſary buſineſs and temporal employment, are no real impediment to his ſpiritual progreſs. He is careful to engage no further in any intercouſe or connection with worldly men or worldly things, than he finds neceſſary for the fulfilling thoſe private or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties to which his ſituation in this world and the common calls of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and benevolence do continually
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:013258_0240_0F904B628D83A3F8"/>
ſubject him. Such a kind of ſocial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe, as calls forth theſe amiable virtues into conſtant exerciſe, he finds as neceſſary to his ſpiritual life, as medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and prayer.</p>
               <p>There are a thouſand little offices of civility, kindneſs and reſpect, to be performed every day in our intercourſe with each other, which, (if we would attend to them) would ſhew our true ſtate of mind, temper and diſpoſition, much more ſatisfactorily than thoſe more glaring and ſhewy performances, of which we are apt to form too favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a judgment. A thouſand name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſenſibilities are hereby opened in our breaſts, which ſerve to advance us in our virtuous progreſs, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing an humble ſenſe of our own weakneſs, or an affectionate exertion of our ſympathy and love.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="unknown:013258_0241_0F904B632B2F4470"/>Be not diſſatisfied, therefore, my va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable friend, with your preſent employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Do not throw it up in a fit of melancholy. In your cooler moments repentance may come—and come too late. The ſuperficial <hi>Methodiſt</hi> may encourage ſuch a ſpecious inſtance of reſignation.—But all your ſenſible, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Chriſtian friends will bear their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt it.</p>

                  <q>THE world is full of tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</q> replies my dear CHARLES— <q>the multitude are always in the wrong—always walking in the <hi>broad way that leadeth to deſtruction.</hi> Retirement is certainly the ſafeſt ſtate for me. I ſhall thus at leaſt be free from many ſpecies of temptation, to which an intercourſe with the world expoſes me. My ſoul muſt ſuffer, whilſt matters, merely temporal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:013258_0243_0F904B6512068080"/>
engroſs ſo much of my time and attention. If I could but get into the country, and have nothing to mind but a little farm, and ſome ſuch innocent employments as belong to a rural life, my ſoul and body both would be much better for the change.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thinkeſt thou ſo, my good friend? I remember to have heard or read, that one of the primitive fathers (I think it was ST. BASIL) was for a while of the ſame opinion. Attacked by many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptations from within and from without, whilſt he led a ſecular life, he was ſure that he ſhould get himſelf quite diſengaged from all, by burying himſelf in ſome obſcure place of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſilent cell of the gloomy anchorite exactly correſponded with
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:013258_0244_0F904B668390A4B8"/>
the idea he had formed. He flattered himſelf that all would be peace and ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity there, and that his thoughts would be wholly taken up with God and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. But experience ſoon taught him otherwiſe. Though he had turned his back as he thought upon the world and worldly objects and their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, he found he could not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily turn his back upon the Devil and his own evil heart, which ſtill followed him, took up their abode with him, and perſecuted him even in his lonely cell.</p>
               <p>The Emperor CHARLES THE FIFTH, after a moſt rapid ſucceſſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, ſuddenly abdicated the Crown in a fit of diſſatisfaction, and ſought relief from worldly cares and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etudes in the ſilence and obſcurity of
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:013258_0245_0F904B673A55A3B8"/>
worldly ſolitude. And yet if we may depend upon what is related by a very eminent writer, his worldly cares ſoon followed him into his rural receſs, and his thoughts were almoſt wholly taken up with the political and military con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a ſon, by whom he was ſo ſhamefully neglected, that the ſcanty pittance, which he had reſerved for his ſupport, was not paid him without grudging and irregularity.</p>
               <p>Now, if inſtead of abdicating his Crown, this mighty Monarch had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his worldly ſpirit, his proud, ambitious, covetous temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; if he had applied to the KING OF KINGS for that true ſpirit of wiſdom and government, which would have rendered him the happy father of his
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:013258_0246_0F904B67B8ECAD78"/>
happy ſubjects, and changed his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral into ſpiritual triumphs; he might ſtill have retained his royalty, and would certainly have found that peace and tranquillity upon a Throne which he fought for in vain in the ſolitude of ST. JUSTUS.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>The poor man thinks, that, if he was rich, or had but what he calls a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, he would devote all his time to the ſalvation of his ſoul. The rich man complains of being obliged to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his character and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and that in conſequence of this is ſo over-done with company, viſits and entertainments, that he has little or no time to himſelf. He thinks, that the poor man, as he is not capable of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:013258_0247_0F904B6A09DF34D8"/>
into the faſhionable modes of life, can have nothing to do but to mind his work and ſay his prayers.</p>
               <p>Phyſicians, Lawyers, Divines, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Mechanicks, young and old, all complain of ſomething or another in their peculiar calling, occupation or time of life, which they ſay hinders them from being as religious as they deſire to be. But they are certainly under a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. Nay, 'tis to be feared, they willingly deceive themſelves. They very well know, they have time enough and to ſpare, if they would employ it properly. There is not a man in the whole world, let his age, ſtation, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or religion be what it will, but may <hi>abide in his calling,</hi> and ſerve God and take care of his own ſoul as effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if he was in any other ſituation of
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:013258_0248_0F904B6BF28E2B50"/>
life. For 'tis a man's own fault, if he ſuffers himſelf to be too much entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in any worldly employment.</p>
               <p>Providence brings our duties to our very doors; and every day of our life furniſhes ſuch occurrences in our own particular way, as, if properly improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ſufficient to ſatisfy others as well as ourſelves, what manner of ſpirit we are of; whether we are ſtill acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of our fallen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted nature, or whether we ſuffer our heavenly nature to be called forth into life by the HOLY JESUS, and to do his bleſſed work.</p>
               <p>This will be the laſt letter I ſhall have it in my power to write to you for ſome time. I have engaged in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, that will probably call me to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:013258_0249_0F904B6D67566B58"/>
in a few days. My ſtay there, however, if my ſcheme be attended with ſucceſs will be very ſhort: And I hope to pay my reſpects to you at New-York early in the next Spring.</p>
