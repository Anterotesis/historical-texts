            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>Mr Deſign in writing this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is, to give as clear and faithful an Account as I am able, of the Riſe and Progreſs of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> among the <hi>Natives</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi>: particularly of Mr. <hi>SERGEANT's Miſſion</hi> to them; of the Meaſures be took to recover thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> from their Barbarity, Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Heatheniſm, and to inform them in the Doctrines of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; and of the <hi>Succeſs</hi> which, by the Bleſſing of God, attended his faithful Endeavours to perſuade them to embrace the true Religion.</p>
            <p>In proſecuting this Deſign, I hope, in ſome Meaſure, to do Juſtice to the Memory of that excellent Man, who, from generous and pious Principles, undertook, and with great Induſtry and Faithfulneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted that Self-denying Work; to let the generous and pious <hi>Donors</hi> to that good Deſign know, what the Succeſs of their liberal and charitable <hi>Contributions</hi> to it has been; and to excite others to follow their laudable and generous Example, by giving freely of their Substance to promote that good Work, the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith. If theſe Ends are anſwer'd, I ſhall not regret the Trouble and Pains I have been at.</p>
            <p>It may, perhaps, be thought ſtrange, that this Performance has been ſo long delay'd. To which I would ſay; It was almoſt a Year

               </gap> that Purpoſe, I therefore concluded, that he had not only kept a <hi>Journal</hi> of his own Doings among them, but that he had alſo care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully preſerv'd Copies of all his <hi>Letters</hi> to Gentlemen with whom he maintain'd a Correſpondence, and their <hi>Returns</hi> to him; and that little or nothing more would be needful, than to Tranſcribe, in their proper Places, what he had preſerv'd. But I found myſelf, more or leſs, diſappointed upon all theſe Heads. His <hi>Journal</hi> was indeed ſomething large &amp; particular for five or ſix Years, but after that Time it conſiſted only of a brief Hints, two or three Pages in Octave, upon common Paper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Space of a Year; and, for two or three Years, it was wholly warning. He was alſo ſo full of Buſineſs, that he had not Time to preſerve <hi>Copies</hi> of those <hi>Letters</hi> he wrote to Gentlemen with whom he corresponded, either in this <hi>Country,</hi> or in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> except a very few. Yea, when he wrote <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Account of the <hi>Succeſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>STOCKBRIDGE.</hi>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:007023_0004_102AEA4708D00AE0"/>
under his Miniſtry, in Compliance with the Deſire of the <hi>Committee of Directors</hi> for the <hi>Society</hi> for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge, in <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> ſignified to him by their Preſident <hi>GEORGE DRUM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOND,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and ſent it to them, he had no Leiſure to preſerve a Copy of it. Some few Letters likewiſe, written to him, were not to be found.</p>
            <p>When I became acquainted with theſe Things, I was much diſcouraged; and had not I recover'd the <hi>Originals</hi> which Mr. <hi>SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT</hi> wrote to the Rev. Dr. <hi>COLMAN,</hi> to whom he wrote more frequently, and more freely, than to any other Man, I ſhould not have attempted any Thing of this Nature. And, when I entred upon the Buſineſs, I little thought of compoſing any Thing that would be fit for publick Flex. My Deſign was (ſeeing I had by me what <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> I could come at) to preſerve what might be moſt likely to be of Uſe hereafter, which, in all Probability, would ſoon have been le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, by continuing in looſe Papers.</p>
            <p>And now it is propos'd to <hi>publiſh</hi> what I have written, I hope the foregoing Account will excuſe me; tho' the Performance be not to <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> as it might have been, by the Help of thoſe Things which I could not obtain. Every Reader will be ſenſible, that Mr. <hi>SERGEANT,</hi> and the good Cauſe in which he was engaged, might have been placed in a more advantagious Light, bad thoſe Things which are wanting, been preſerv'd. He will alſo, I truſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>I cannot think any judicious Perſon, upon mature Conſideration, will judge, that which has been brought to paſs by Mr. <hi>SERGEANT's Miniſtry,</hi> among the <hi>Indians,</hi> is ſmall and inconſiderable. In the Year 1734. when he went firſt to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> their Number, great and ſmall, was ſhort of Fifty, and they in the Depths of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm and Barbarity.

the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the <hi>Lord's-Table.</hi> Mr. <hi>WOODBRIDGE's</hi> school (ſeperate from the boarding School) had belonging to it 55 Scholars, who were taught to Read and Write, and were inſtructed in the Principles of Religion. This indeed is not like a <hi>Nation bring born at once</hi>; but, by the Uſe of ordinary Means, greater Things have ſeldom been brought to paſs in ſo ſhort a Time. And we, in this Part of the Country, have ſeen Nothing like it, reſpecting the poor <hi>Natives</hi> who live upon our Borders. And if Mr. <hi>SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT's</hi> Life had been ſpar'd to have proſecuted the Affair of the Boarding-School, according to his Intention, and with his wonted Wiſdom, Prudence &amp; Skill, is it not highly probable, that we ſhould, by this Time, have ſeen a conſiderable Number of the <hi>Indian</hi> Youth educated there, in Labour, Induſtry and good Huſbandry, as well as in Learning; who probably might have prov'd not only uſeful Members of Society, but alſo of the Church of Chriſt?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Tribe commonly known by the Name of <hi>River-Indians</hi> is large, moſt of them live within, the Limits of <hi>New-York</hi> Government, interſpers'd among the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and never had Endeavours us'd with them, either to civilize or chriſtianize them; but ſtill continue in their native Ignorance and Barbarity. A ſmall Number or them live in the N. W. Corner of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Government, and a few Families of them on <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatunnuk</hi> River, or at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> which now goes by the Name of <hi>Sheffield</hi> in the County of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> in the S.

And 'tis the Deſign of this Treatiſe, to give an Hiſtorical Account of the Meaſures which have been taken with them for this End; the Succeſs that has attended them; and what their preſent State is.</p>
            <p>In Proſecuting this Deſign, I ſhall have Occaſion to give an Account of a conſiderable Part of the <hi>Life, Death</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> of that pious and excellent Man, the Rev. Mr. JOHN SERGEANT, who preach'd the Goſpel to them, and died in that Service.</p>

            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made Settlements there, they became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe <hi>Indians</hi>; and <hi>Kunkapot,</hi> the principal Perſon among them, was ſoon taken Notice of by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſpoken of as a Man of Worth. It was by a meer Accident I became acquainted with his general Character. Mr. <hi>Ebenezer Miller,</hi> one of my Neighbours, who had his Account from <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> inform'd me, that he was ſtrictly temperate, a very juſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Man in his Dealings, a Man of Prudence, and induſtrious in his Buſineſs; and inclin'd to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: But that there were ſome Difficulties lying in his Mind, two of which I remember. One was, that if he became a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> his own People would diſcard him. The other was, the ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of Chriſtians; it being as bad, as he tho't, if not worſe than that of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> (An Objection too just, and it is not to be wonder'd at, that it ſhould prove a ſtumbling Block to an obſerving <hi>Heathen.</hi>)</p>
            <p>I was much affected with the Story of this <hi>Indian,</hi> and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to endeavour that he, and the Reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> there, might be inſtructed in the Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; for this I was prepar'd, by Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s giving me an Account, the <hi>May</hi> preceding, of the Money depoſited in the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> Hand for ſuch Purpoſes; and knowing that the honourable <hi>John Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> was more than any Man, in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> acquainted with the State of the <hi>Indians</hi> in general, having often been employ'd by the <hi>Government</hi> in Affairs relating to them, I determin'd to diſcourſe with him upon it, and to take his Advice in the Caſe. Accordingly, <hi>March</hi> 11th 1734, I waited upon him at his own Houſe, and confer'd with him upon the Subject. He informed me, "That the <hi>River-Indians</hi> were the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007023_0008_102AEA4F61A73818"/>
largeſt <hi>Tribe</hi> of any near the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements; that he judg'd a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> among them would be much more likely to do Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to anſwer the End of his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> Meſſieurs <hi>Parker, Hinſdel,</hi> and <hi>Secomb,</hi> who had been ſome Time before ordain'd, and ſent to the ſeveral <hi>Forts</hi> and <hi>Truck-Houſe</hi>: in our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> &amp; <hi>Weſtern</hi> Borders. For the <hi>Tribes,</hi> thoſe Gentlemen were ſent to, were very much under the Influence of the <hi>French.</hi> And further, what Opportunity thoſe <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> had to inſtruct them, was only at thoſe <hi>Forts,</hi> when they came in upon a trading Deſign; and that, as ſoon as they had done their Buſineſs, they went off, and while they ſtay'd, were not perhaps in the beſt Temper to receive Inſtruction: But as to the <hi>River-Indians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had no Influence upon them; a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> might live among them, and take all Opportunities to inſtruct, not only the Men, but alſo their Families: Their Children might be taught to read, and write, and be led into a Knowledge of the Principles of <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Event prov'd theſe Reaſonings to be very juſt; for, not long after, thoſe Miſſionaries, Meſſi, <hi>Parker, Hinſdel,</hi> and <hi>Secomb,</hi> were diſcourag'd, and threw up their <hi>Miſſions,</hi> as not being able to anſwer the Ends of them; but a <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>River-Indians</hi> prov'd more ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Some Time after, I inform'd the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi> of theſe Suggeſtions, and what I had heard. And upon our Motion the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> wrote to the Honourable and Rev. <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi>; who deſir'd us that we would take a Journey to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> and confer with the <hi>Indians</hi> there, reſpecting their receiving a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> to inſtruct them.—About this Time His Excellency Governour <hi>Belcher</hi> was pleas'd to honour the two principal <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> with <hi>Commiſſions.</hi> To <hi>Kunkapot</hi> he gave a <hi>Captain</hi>'s, and to <hi>Umpachenee</hi> a <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s. Their <hi>Commiſſions</hi> being ſent to <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> we heard that they were coming for them, &amp; therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded we would confer with them here, before we proceeded to <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> Accordingly, on the 22d Day of <hi>May,</hi> we went to their Lodgings, and diſcours'd with them by their Interpreter <hi>Jeboikim Van Valkenburgh,</hi> who came with them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> ſhew'd himſelf very deſirous of having a <hi>Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> ſent among them, that their Children might be taught to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007023_0009_102AEA51E3732648"/>
read, &amp;c. The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> did not ſeem ſo very deſirous of it; but yet expreſs'd his Willingneſs that it ſhould be ſo. But, at the ſame Time, they let us know, that they ſpake only for <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and that it would be needful their <hi>Brethren</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in the Affair. We therefore inform'd them, that ſome Time in <hi>July</hi> they might expect to ſee us at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> where we would confer with them, and their Brethren, further upon thoſe Things. But when the Time came, I was ſick. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Weſtfield</hi> therefore took my Place, and, on the 8th of <hi>July</hi> 1734, accompany'd Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> thither. The <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> were very glad to ſee them, and call'd their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, of whom thoſe Gentlemen inquir'd, whether they were willing a <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſhould be ſent to them to inſtruct them in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> to teach their Children to read, &amp;c. The <hi>Indians</hi> desir'd four Days to conſider of the Thing propos'd; and at the End of thoſe Days they all gave in their Names, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd their Deſires to thoſe Reverend Gentlemen, that a <hi>Miniſter</hi> mig't be ſent to them, for the Ends propos'd. Upon which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> deliver'd to them a ſmall Belt of <hi>Wompum,</hi> as a Confirmation of what had paſs'd between them, and as a Sort of <hi>Record</hi> thereof.</p>
            <note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Wompum</hi> is a ſmall Cylinder of about one third of an Inch long, and as big round as a ſmall Straw, with a Hole dril'd thro' the Middle of it Length-wiſe, and is made of the Shell of ſome <hi>Sea Fish,</hi> poliſh'd very ſmooth. A Number of theſe ſtrung upon ſmall Threads, and knit together in the Form of a Belt, are call'd a <hi>Belt of Wompum.</hi> Some of theſe <hi>Wompum</hi> are <hi>white,</hi> ſome <hi>black,</hi> the black bear the higheſt Price; they paſs among the <hi>Natives</hi> as <hi>Money,</hi> and were the only <hi>Coin</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> had, before they became acquainted with the <hi>Europeans.</hi> They alſo uſe them as Ornaments, wearing them about their <hi>Necks, Wriſts,</hi> &amp;c. It is a Cuſtom among the <hi>Indians</hi> neighbouring to us, and I ſuppoſe among all others, to give <hi>Belts of Wompum</hi> for the Confirmation of all Treaties, and as a Remembrance of what paſſes between Parties; ſo that if one <hi>Tribe</hi> ſends a Meſſage to another without ſuch a <hi>Beſt,</hi> the Meſſage is call'd, <hi>an empty Word,</hi> not to be regarded or remember'd: But if a <hi>Beſt</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company's the Meſſage, it is laid up as a Record of the Thing tranſacted; and by it, not only the preſent, but future Generations, keep in Remembrance what was then done. And theſe are all the <hi>Records</hi> they keep in ſuch Caſes.</note>
            <p>Not long after the Return of thoſe Gentlemen from <hi>Houſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunnuk,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where he waited upon the Honourable <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> (his Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher</hi> being then at their Head) and acquainted them with the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007023_0010_102AEA53A5FBFFC0"/>
good Diſpoſition of the <hi>Indians</hi> reſpecting the Buſineſs they went upon. And the <hi>Commiſſioner,</hi> were ſo encourag'd by the Account given them, that they desir'd thoſe Gentlemen, Meſſieurs <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> and <hi>Bull</hi> to ſeek after ſome ſuitable Perſon to be employ'd as a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> to thoſe <hi>Indians.</hi> As appears by the following Vote.</p>

            <p>Before this Time, Mr. SERGEANT's Inclination to ſerve the Souls of the <hi>Natives</hi> had reached our Ears; for he had freely ſaid in private Converſation, that he had rather be employ'd as a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> to the <hi>Natives,</hi> if a Door ſhould open for it, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Call any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pariſh might give him.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007023_0011_102AEA558CD431E8"/>
in his own Words, as I find them in the Beginning of the <hi>Journal,</hi> which he kept of his <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>River-Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> 1734. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nehemiah Bull,</hi> being appointed by the Gentlemen <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> to treat and agree with ſome Perſon to undertake a <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> came to me at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> with the Propoſals; bringing a very encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account of the good Inclination of thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> and of their Deſire to be inſtructed in the Principles of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was then engag'd in Buſineſs at <hi>Yale-College</hi>; but, upon the fair Probability there appear'd of Succeſs, I told the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, that I was ſo far from being unwilling to devote my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Service of God in ſo good a Cauſe, that I was rather deſirous, if none better qualify'd could be found, to improve what Abilities I had in ſuch an Undertaking; tho' I was ſenſible, I muſt not only loſe a great many agreable Amuſements of Life, eſpecially in leaving my Buſineſs at <hi>College,</hi> which was the moſt agreable to me that could be; but alſo expoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to many Fatigues and Hardſhips, and I know not to what Dangers, among a barbarous People. For indeed I ſhould be aſham'd to own myſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or even a <hi>Man,</hi> and yet utterly refuſe doing what lay in my Power, to cultivate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity among a People naturally ingenious enough, but for Want of Inſtruction, living ſo much below the Dignity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature; and to promote the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Souls periſhing in the Dark,</hi> when the <hi>Light of Life</hi> is ſo near them. Beſides, to ſee ſo much Pains taken by thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, not only in other Parts, but alſo in <hi>America,</hi> and in our Borders, whoſe Religion is ſo corrupted, that it may ſcarcely be call'd Chriſtianity, ſhould, methinks, excite us to Emulation, who, at leaſt, think we profeſs Chriſtianity in much greater Purity.</p>
               <p>Upon the earneſt Deſire of the two forementioned Gentlemen, I readily conſented to undertake the Miſſion, if I might be accepted upon the Terms I propos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Rev. <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Trustees</hi> of <hi>Yale-College,</hi> I would ſpend about half of the Year with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the Reſt of the Year live at <hi>College</hi>; (for I had a Mind to carry my

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> to inform him how far they had proceeded.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Terms propos'd by Mr. SERGEANT were agreable to the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> as appears from the following Letter from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Adam Winthrop,</hi>

                  <p>By a Letter juſt receiv'd from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams,</hi> I am inform'd he has treated with you about engaging in the <hi>Indian's</hi> Service at <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> And I am highly gratified with the encouraging Account he gives of your Ingenuity, Learning, and Piety, and alſo with your laudable Inclination to undertake the Service. The only Difficulty he mentions is, That the <hi>Rector, Truſtes,</hi> and alſo your <hi>Pupils,</hi> were unwilling you ſhould leave the <hi>College,</hi> till they had done reciting; but that, if the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> would be ſatisfied with your reſiding at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> one Quarter of a Year now, and then leave the <hi>Indians</hi> till the Spring, you would return and tarry. And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> deſir'd that it might be ſignify'd as ſoon as poſſible, whether the Commiſſioners would accept of this Projection.</p>
                  <p>Time would not allow of a full Meeting, but I have confer'd with His Excellency the <hi>Governor</hi> about it, and we do, in the Name of the Commiſioners accept of the Propoſal. So that you may proceed and go to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s, who informs me that he will accompany you to <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I heartily wiſh you, thro' the divine Bleſſing, good Succeſs, and much Comfort, in the Employment. And, deſiring to hear from you in Anſwer to this, I remain,</p>

            <p>Accordingly Mr. SERGEANT proceeded to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> and in his <hi>Journal</hi> gives the following brief Account of his Journey, and the Reception he met with there.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> 8th. I ſet out from <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and went to Mr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s, who it was propos'd ſhould bear me Company to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> and introduce me to the <hi>Indians,</hi> being ſomething ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, as he had been there before in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> to treat with them, with Reſpect to their receiving the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> From <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> on Thurſday <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 11th, we ſet out in the Afternoon, deſigning to lodge at a Houſe about 15 Miles onwards upon the Road, which was the only Houſe before we came to <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> But Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on too ſoon for us, we were forced to lodge in the Woods without Fire or Shelter. The next Day we got to <hi>Houſatun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuk,</hi> a little before Night, thro' a moſt doleful Wilderneſs and the worſt Road, perhaps, that ever was rid. We took Care to inform the <hi>Indians</hi> we were come, [they had expected us ſome Time] and deſir'd them to meet us the next Day, at a Place we appointed, near the Middle between the Places where the <hi>Indian</hi> liv'd; for one half of them liv'd near Miles above, up the <hi>River,</hi> and the other about ſo much below.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>October</hi> 13th. In the Afternoon I made a ſhort Diſcourſe to the <hi>Indians</hi> by an Interpreter, an <hi>Indian</hi> call'd <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> to which they (about 20 in Number<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> notes in his <hi>Journal</hi> ſome Time after this, that when he ſpeaks of his Hearers, he intends only <hi>adult</hi> Perſons, and is ſo to be underſtood here and elſewhere.</note>) gave very good Attention, eſpecially Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi> their <hi>Chief,</hi> and his <hi>Family.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I adapted my Diſcourſe, as well as I could, to their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities and Manner of Thinking. The next Day <hi>Ebenezer</hi> told me, that one who had been a little cold in the Deſign, was mov'd with what I ſaid, and ſeem'd now conſiderably engag'd. The Interpreter could ſpeak <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well, for he had liv'd with them, and had got conſiderable Knowledge in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, and was very deſirous Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> would <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> him. Accordingly we met at the <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s Houſe on Thurſday, where Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> examin'd <hi>Ebenezer</hi> with Reſpect to his Knowledge and Reſolution to live a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Life, and he gave a pretty good Account of the Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and ſaid, he would rather burn in the Fire than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Truth. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> made a Prayer, which <hi>Ebenezer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, and I deliver'd another ſhort Diſcourſe, after which

                  <hi>Ebenezer</hi> was <hi>baptized</hi> by Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> making the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> Profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a <hi>good Life.</hi>

And what makes this the more remarkable in the <hi>Boy,</hi> is, that he is exceeding fond of his Father, as his Father is alſo of him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Indians,</hi> as has been obſerv'd, living in <hi>two</hi> Places about 8 or 10 Miles aſunder, it was needful they should come together in one Place, that they, on the Sabbath might attend upon Mr. SERGEANT's Preaching, and have their Children taught on the Week Days. When therefore they were together at Lieutenant <hi>Umpachenee's</hi> Houſe, they diſcours'd the Matter, and concluded, that, during the Winter Seaſon, they would dwell together about half Way between thoſe Places, where each Party then liv'd; the Place being well accommodated with Wood and Water, and alſo near ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, in one of which Mr. SERGEANT
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007023_0015_102AEA5E1EFD8860"/>
might live, while he ſerv'd them; but this could continue no longer than the Spring, when they muſt return to their own Places to Plant, &amp;c.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Lord's-Day, October</hi> 20th. I made two Diſcourſes to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> (in Number the ſame as before) to which they gave great Attention, and ſeem'd to be well pleas'd. They were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by Mr. <hi>Van Valkenburgh,</hi> a <hi>Dutch Man.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>On Monday <hi>October</hi> 21ſt. They chearfully ſet about building a <hi>publick Houſe</hi> at the Place agreed upon, to ſerve them, both to meet in on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to keep the <hi>School</hi> in; round which they built ſmall Huts for their ſeveral Families to dwell in. The Chearfulneſs &amp; Engagedneſs they diſcover'd herein, was an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ardent Deſires they had to hear the Word preach'd, and to have their Children taught to read. And, in a ſhort Time, they all mov'd with their Families thither. While theſe Things were doing, Mr. SERGEANT went up to <hi>Wnabktukook,</hi> the Place where the <hi>Captain</hi> and ſome others lived, to teach their Children to read, and was greatly pleas'd with the Reſpect they ſhew'd him, and with the Children, they being exceedingly engag'd to learn. He went alſo to <hi>Skatekook,</hi> the Place where the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and four Families more liv'd, and taught their Children. The Number at each Place being about 9 or 10.</p>
            <p>The Number of Mr. SERGEANT's Auditors now began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. <hi>Lord's-Day, November</hi> 3. he writes, <q>My Auditory was greater than it had been; and now, beſides Preaching, I pray'd by an Interpreter.</q> And to move our Pity to the poor <hi>Heathen</hi> who are brought up in Ignorance, he proceeds thus; <q>After Service they invited me to go, the next Day, up to <hi>Wnabktukook,</hi> to ſee a <hi>religious Ceremony,</hi> they had learn'd of their Fathers. Accordingly I went. <hi>Ebenezer</hi> bore me Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, of whom I enquir'd, to ſatisfy my Curioſity, into the Notions, Cuſtoms &amp; Manners of their Nation. Among other Things, he told me of ſome he had known that were <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who ſuppos'd all Things began, continu'd, and ceas'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral Laws of their <hi>Natures,</hi> without any Cauſe or Direction from a ſuperiour Hand. Others believ'd the <hi>Sun</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Reſidence,</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi>; but that now they genernlly believ'd the Exiſtence of one ſupreme inviſible Being, the Maker of all Things. He told me alſo
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007023_0016_102AEA60D57C59D8"/>
ſundry childiſh and ridiculous Things, which they believ'd: As that the ſeven Stars were ſo many <hi>Indians</hi> tranſlated to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Dance; that the Stars in <hi>Charles's Wain,</hi> are ſo many Men hunting a <hi>Bear</hi>; that they begin the Chace in the Spring, and hold it all Summer; by the Fall they have wounded it, and that the Blood turns the Leaves red: by the Winter they have kill'd it, and the Snow is made of its Fat; which, being melted by the Heat of the Summer, makes the Sap of Trees.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">I leave the Reader to conjecture, whence theſe <hi>Americans</hi> happened to form their Notion ſo ſimilar to that of the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who call theſe Stars the <hi>Great Bear.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>There is a large Heap of Stones, I ſuppoſe ten Cart Loads, in the Way to <hi>Wanbktukook,</hi> which the <hi>Indians</hi> have thrown together, as they have paſs't by the Place; for it us'd to be their Cuſtom, every Time any one paſs'd by, to throw a Stone to it: But what was the End of it they cannot tell: Only they ſay, their Fathers us'd to do ſo, and they do it becauſe it was the Cuſtom of their Fathers. But <hi>Ebenezer</hi> ſays, he ſuppoſes it was deſign'd to be as an Expreſſion of their Gratitude to the ſupream Being, that he had preſerv'd them to ſee the Place again. Theſe, Things <hi>Ebenezer</hi> told me, by the Way, as we were riding to <hi>Wnabktukook,</hi> which are ſuch childiſh Fables that I had not taken Notice of them, had it not been that they believ'd them, as childiſh as they are; which ſhews us how eaſily Men brought up in Ignorance are impos'd upon, and ſhould, methinks, excite us the more to pity them.—When we were come to the <hi>Captains Houſe,</hi> there were several of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Indians</hi> there, as well from below, as thoſe that belong'd there. After we had been there for ſome Time, two Men, appointed for the Service, took a Deer down that hung up in the Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam,<note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>Wigwam</hi> is an <hi>Indian House,</hi> in building of which they take ſmall flexible Poles and ſtick them into the Ground, round ſuch a Space as they intend for the Bigneſs of their Houſe, whether greater or leſs; thoſe Poles they bend from each Side, and faſten them together, making an Arch over Head: Then they faſten ſmall Sticks to them, cutting the Poles at right Angles, which ſerve for Ribs. After which they cover the whole with the Bark of Trees, leaving a Hole in the Top for the Smoak to go out, and at one or both Ends to go in and out.</note> which was to be offer'd, and laid the four Quarters upon a <hi>Bark</hi> in the Middle of the Houſe, (the Reſt ſitting round very ſerious;) the Skin was taken off with the entire
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007023_0017_102AEA63279627C0"/>
Head and Neck to the Shoulders; the four Quarters were laid one upon another, and the Skin, doubled Length wiſe, was laid upon them, ſo as to make it look as much like a whole Deer as might be. When this was done, an elderly Man, appointed for that Purpoſe, ſtood up over it; and, with a pretty loud Voice, ſpake to the following Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O great God pity us, grant us Food to eat, afford us good and comfortable Sleep, preſerve us from being devoured by the Fowls that ſty in the Air. This Deer is given in Token that we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thee the Giver of all Things.</hi> Then he halloo'd pretty loud, that God might hear and take Notice of what they were doing. Then he that made the Offering gave the <hi>pro Tempore</hi> Prieſt (for they have no stated one) a String of <hi>Wompum</hi> which was to pay him for his Service; after which he halloo'd again. After theſe Ceremonies were ended, the two Men before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, cut the Deer in Pieces and boil'd it; and when it was made ready, a Piece was given to every one, of which they all eat, except he that offer'd it, (for he eats none of it) which is to ſignify it is a Gift, and therefore free, and he deſires none of it back again. While they were eating, one of the Waiters gave the Skin with the Feet, and ſome of the Inwards, to an old Widow Woman, which is a Deed of Charity they always practice upon ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>Upon Inquiry into the <hi>Original</hi> of this Piece of Religion, they gave me the following fabulous Account of the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it. They had receiv'd it by Tradition from their Fathers, that there once liv'd a Man among them, who was ſeen to come down from Heaven with <hi>Snow-Shoes</hi> on, (which was the Original of <hi>Snow-Shoes,</hi>) that he liv'd in great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation among them: was esteem'd a <hi>Hero,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet</hi>: He clear'd their Country of Monſters that infeſted theirRoads, and taught them that this was a religious Cuſtom in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try above, from whence he came; and of him they learnt this Piece of Religion. That he married a Wiſe. among them, and had two Children by her; and that when they offer'd a <hi>Deer,</hi> he us'd to be their Prieſt: but ſome Times he omitted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſuch Occaſions, which the <hi>Indians</hi> found Fault with, and this coming to the Ears of his Wife, ſhe inform'd him; he confeſſed it a faulty Neglect, and apologizing, as well as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007023_0018_102AEA64B33131B0"/>
he could, for himſelf, promis'd he would do it next Time. And accordingly, when the next Occaſion offer'd, he began to pray with his two Children upon his Knees, and was in a wonderful Manner rais'd from the Ground, riſing gradually as he continued praying: but when he had got juſt to the Top of the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> they call'd to him to leave one of his Children, at leaſt, behind him; and letting one down, he was carried up out of their Sight. This Child of his alſo prov'd an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Man; of whom they tell ſeveral very ridiculous Stories; which yet they believe with a firm Faith.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The above Hiſtorical Account I have not inſerted ſo much for its being curious, as to excite Compaſſion towards ſuch ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Creatures, and the charitable Endeavours of generous Minds to bring them out of ſuch a benighted State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 5th. Mr. SERGEANT began to keep School, in the School Houſe which the <hi>Indians</hi> had built; and on the next Week his Scholars were in Number 22 or 23, as he writes; and on the following Week two new Scholars were added to their Number. Theſe he inſtructed on the Week Days, and preach'd on the Sabbaths.</p>
            <p>The following Paſſages, in Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>Journal,</hi> well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Attention of thoſe who are concern'd for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>America,</hi> and for the ſpiritual Good of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Monday, <hi>November</hi> the 25th. I went to <hi>Albany,</hi> being deſir'd by the Miniſters of the Country, to inquire after the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and the Reſt of the <hi>Indians</hi> in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> towards the Chriſtian Religion; carrying a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> to the Hon. <hi>Philip Livingſton,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to deſire of him Information in that Matter. Mr. <hi>Livingſton</hi> told me there was great Probability that the Proteſtant Religion might, if proper Means were us'd, be introduc'd among moſt of thoſe Nations; and he look'd upon it abſolutely neceſſary in Order to preſerve the Trade with them, and keep them in Friendſhip with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada</hi> were very induſtrious to gain them over to their Intereſt; and that they have <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> among them, who came as near to their Government as they dare; that the <hi>Indians</hi> are drawn off, more or leſs, every Year to <hi>Canada.</hi> Much the ſame Account other Gentlemen gave me.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007023_0019_102AEA66AD39F508"/>
—Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> an ingenious and religious young Gentleman, has been about a Year and a half among the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and is learning their Language, and deſigns to get <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> among them, if the <hi>Society for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Goſpel</hi> in <hi>foreign Parts</hi> will ſupport him. He has allow'd him a ſmall Encouragement from the Government for two Years, <hi>thirty Pound</hi> per Annum. I ſaw him little more than half a Year ago, at this Place, when he told me he had all the Encouragement that could be expected from the <hi>Indians</hi>; had wrought ſome conſiderable Reformation in their Morals; and that they lov'd him entirely. The <hi>Mohawks</hi> are generally Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; but, for Want of Inſtruction, have but little of it in Reality. And, methinks, it is great Pity ſo ingenious and worthy a Gentleman as Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> ſhould want any Encouragement, in ſo great and noble an Undertaking. He now reads to them every Lord's Day the Prayers in the Liturgy, which are tranſlated into their Language, with ſome Leſſons out of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> beſides ſome Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Diſcourſes, made by a former <hi>Miſſionary,</hi> which he has got. But he has no ſtated Interpreter, and when he has Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for one, is oblig'd to pay him out of his own Pocket. In a Word, he is alone in that noble Deſign.</q>
            <p>Mr. SERGEANT left the <hi>College,</hi> deſigning to return to it again, as has been obſerv'd. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſome others, being very deſirous that the <hi>Indians</hi> might be inſtructed, while Mr. SERGEANT was abſent, prevail'd with Mr. <hi>Timothy Woodbridge</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> to go to them. And when Mr. SERGEANT return'd from his forementioned <hi>Journey,</hi> he writes thus. <q>Upon my Return from <hi>Albany,</hi> (<hi>which was on Saturday November</hi> 30th) I found Mr. <hi>Timothy Woodbridge,</hi> a young Gentleman very well qualify'd for the Buſineſs, ſent up here, to take Care of the <hi>School,</hi> and to inſtruct the <hi>Indians</hi> in a Catechetical Way, when I ſhould return to my Buſineſs at <hi>College.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' Things had ſucceeded hitherto according to Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT's Deſires, yet the Week before he return'd to <hi>College,</hi> he met with ſome Things very diſcouraging, of which he gives the following Account in his <hi>Journal.</hi>
            </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's Day, December</hi> 8th. I had but very few Hearers the Reaſon of which was, that ſome of the Traders had been down from <hi>Hudjon's</hi> River, and brought a large Quantity of <hi>Rum,</hi> and fold to the <hi>Indians,</hi> with which they got drunk, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo for ſeveral Days, and had not got over it by the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</hi> This was the moſt diſcouraging Week I had. For the <hi>Dutch</hi> Traders, I was told, had been very induſtrious to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the <hi>Indians</hi> from being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> thinking it would leſſen their Trade with them, or at leaſt they ſhould not be under ſo good Advantages to cheat and impoſe upon them. For they make vaſt Profit by ſelling them <hi>Rum,</hi> and making Bargains with them when they are drunk; and Drunkenneſs is a Vice the <hi>Indians</hi> are extremely addicted to. Theſe Traders tell them, that the <hi>Religion</hi> we are about to teach them, is not a good one; that we deſign in the End to ſerve ourſelves by them, to make Slaves of them and their Children, and the like. They alſo took Occaſion, from the law there is in this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> againſt private Perſons ſelling the <hi>Indians</hi> ſtrong Drink, to prejudice them againſt the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>People</hi>; as tho' we were not their <hi>Friends.</hi> Upon theſe Inſinuations, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> were very much diſguſted &amp; affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> was out of Humour; that his Brother eſpecially was in a great Paſſion, who is a conſiderable Man among them.</p>
               <p>Upon this Information I deſir'd the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to come to my Landlords on Lord's Day Evening, (deſigning the next Day to leave them) Accordingly they came, and I endeavour'd to remove thoſe Prejudices, and to perſuade them thoſe Inſinuations were utterly groundleſs and falſe; that the Traders doubtleſs were the Men that intended to make a Prey of them, and their Children; and labour'd to ſatisfy them, that the foremention'd Law was deſign'd in their Favour, to prevent their abuſing themſelves, and expoſing themſelves to the Abuſes of others; that the Government did not deſign to prevent their having ſtrong Drink; for in other Places ſome truſty Perſons have had Commiſſions to ſell them Liquor, and other Things they wanted, at the ſame Rate they go at in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and Orders to allow them the ſame Price for their Goods as they would fetch at <hi>Boſton.</hi> With what I ſaid they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007023_0021_102AEA6A640CCE38"/>
ſeem'd well ſatisfied; eſpecially <hi>Kunkapot</hi>; for he ſaw thro' the Deſign of the Traders. And as he is a temperate Man himſelf, ſo he is very much griev'd at the Intemperance of his People; and tho' he be calm and moderate in his Temper, yet he ſhew'd conſderable Warmth and Paſſion at the wicked and ungenerous Treatment of the Traders.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Neighbourhood of the <hi>Dutch</hi> to theſe <hi>Indians</hi> has often prov'd a Diſadvantage and Snare to them, and it is to be fear'd will prove ſo ſtill; for the <hi>Indians</hi> have often Occaſion to go among them upon Buſineſs, and to viſit their Brethren: Upon thoſe Occaſions the <hi>Dutch</hi> do not fail of tempting them to Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, it there is any Proſpect of their finding their Account in it; and 'tis to be fear'd ſome of them tempt them to Exceſs, on Purpoſe to diſappoint the Deſign of <hi>Chriſtianizing</hi> them. And, without Doubt, the many Relapſes into Intemperance that have appear'd among the <hi>Indians,</hi> after their Profeſſion of <hi>Christianity</hi> (of which have happen'd too many Inſtances) have been owing to the wicked Practice of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And as if other Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were not enough, they too often recommend Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them by their own Example.</p>
            <p>The Time was now come, when Mr. SERGEANT was oblig'd to return to his Buſineſs at <hi>College</hi>; and, as a proper Expedient to forward the Deſign he was now engaged in, he propos'd to take two <hi>Indian</hi> Children with him, intending thereby to lead them into ſome Acquaintance with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language and Manners. And the efore, at the Cloſe of the Conference he had with the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> mentioned above, he propos'd it to them. And in his <hi>Journal</hi> gives this Account of the Matter.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Then I aſk'd them if they would let two of their Children go, and live with me at <hi>New-Haven</hi> the Reſt of the Winter; and they agreed that the <hi>Captain</hi>'s only Son <hi>Nungkawwat,</hi> and the <hi>Lieutenant's</hi> oldeſt Son <hi>Etowaukaum,</hi> (who by the Way is Grandſon by his Mother to <hi>Etowaukaum,</hi> Chief of the <hi>River<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indians,</hi> who was in <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Ann</hi>'s Reign) should be the Children. They were both young; <hi>Nungkawwat</hi> about nine Years old; <hi>Etowaukaum</hi> about eight: Yet they were not only willing to go with me, they knew not whither, but had a Mind to it. And the next Morning, Monday <hi>December</hi> the 9th, we ſet out for <hi>New-Haven,</hi> leaving Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007023_0022_102AEA6CCE62B958"/>
School. The Boys went away with very good Courage, and held out a long and tedious Journey in a cold Seaſon, with wonderful Reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>December</hi> 14th. We got to <hi>New-Haven.</hi> I took the Boys into my own Chamber at <hi>College,</hi> and ſent them to the free School kept at <hi>New-Haven.</hi> They liv'd very contentedly, were much made off by every Body; for <hi>indeed</hi> they were a couple of very likely Boys, eſpecially the <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s Son.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The prudent Meaſures Mr. SERGEANT took with the <hi>Indians,</hi> the little Time he ſpent with them before his Return to <hi>College</hi>; the Succeſs had; the Hopes he conceiv'd of being further ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to them; together with the Oppoſition he met with in proſecuting his good Deſign; the Reader may beſt learn from the following Letter which he wrote to the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> ſoon after he got to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> (how ſoon I am not certain, for the Copy of it before me, has no Date) and directed it to the Honourable <hi>Adam Winthrop,</hi>

                     <hi>Your Honour's</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 13th I received at <hi>Westfield,</hi> in my Return from <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> 'Tis no ſmall Satisfaction to me, that <hi>your Honour,</hi> with the Reſt of the Honourable and Reverend <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> are pleas'd to entertain a good Opinion of me. I have had the Approbation of my Conſcience in the Buſineſs I have undertaken, nor have I been at all diſcontented. Thro' the Bleſſing of God, the Deſign has hitherto ſucceeded full to my Expectation, excepting that I have not had quite ſo many Auditors as I hop'd to have (there being generally about 30.) There has been about 25 Scholars in the School, beſides ſome older ones, who took ſome Pains to learn the Letters; but I ſuppoſe their Patience will hardly hold out to learn to read well. They have always treated me with Reſpect &amp; Kindneſs, in their Way. The Children in the School, I think, were fond of me, and they all ſeem'd to put great Confidence in me, and what I believe you will think a ſufficient Evidence of it, is, I have brought a Way with me too little Boys, One is Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi>'s only Son, nam'd <hi>Nungkawwat,</hi> about nine Years old; the other is Lieut. <hi>Umpachenee</hi>'s eldeſt Son <hi>Etowaukaum,</hi> about eight Years old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007023_0023_102AEA6F70DB1480"/>The Lads had a great Mind to come with me, and their Parents were very willing they ſhould. They bore the Fatigues of the Journey well, and have been very contented ſince they have been here. My Deſign in bringing them is to teach them <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to learn <hi>Indian</hi> of them, as well as I can, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to keep them, untill I return to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> in the Town School; for my Time is ſo taken up with College Buſineſs, that I cannot teach them myſelf.</p>
                  <p>I could not have the Opinion of the Gentlemen <hi>Commiſſioners</hi>: but I doubt not but what I have done will be grateful to them. However, I did not deſign they ſhould be burdenſome to the <hi>Society,</hi> and hope to find ſo much Charity amongſt Gentlemen in theſe Parts, as to bear the Charges of their Board and Schooling. They are two very likely Lads, and, if I do not judge amiſs, the <hi>Indian</hi> Children excell the generality of ours, in Pregnancy of Parts and good Humour, I am ſure I could not have found an <hi>Engliſh</hi> School, any where, that would have pleas'd me ſo much. Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi> is an excellent Man, and I do believe has the true Spirit of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in him. He knows a great Deal, and by the Character all his Acquaintance give of him, his Conduct is unexceptionable. I found them generally poſſeſt with the Belief of <hi>One Supreme Being,</hi> the Maker and Governor of all Things, and that they acknowledg'd the Difference between <hi>moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi>; that God regards the Actions of Mankind, in order to reward or puniſh them, in ſome future State of Exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>I have endeavour'd to give them right Notions of theſe Matters, and to eſtabliſh them in the Belief of them. And from theſe Principles, together with ſuch other Arguments as I thought moſt convincing to them, to perſuade them of the Neceſſity of a ſupernatural <hi>Revelation,</hi> and to ſatisfy them that this is contain'd in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> I deſir'd them from Time to Time to let me know, if they had any Doubts with Reſpect to any Thing I had taught them, or they had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe heard, of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion. But tho' they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive in ſome Points, yet they never ſeem'd diſpos'd to contradict what I ſaid.</p>
                  <p>I have (after I had in ſeveral Diſcourſes told them what I thought previously neceſſary given them a brief Account of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007023_0024_102AEA70FB2FD718"/>
the Original of Things; the State of Mankind at the firſt; the Fall and unhappy Conſequences of it; the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diſpenſations of divine Providence recorded in the old Testament; God's chuſing a peculiar People to himſelf; his moſt remarkable Dealings with them till his final Rejection of them; a ſhort Hiſtory of our Saviours Births Life, Actions, and Death; an Account of his Doctrines, and Precepts: In every Diſcourſe making ſuch practical Reflections, as I tho't convenient for them. They were generally all preſent that liv'd thereabout , and gave very good Attention.</p>
                  <p>After they had finiſh'd the School-Houſe (which was in the Beginning of <hi>November</hi>) they mov'd to that Place with their Families, where they now live. The Scholars in the School make very good Proficiency. I ſuppoſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> are before now inform'd of Mr. <hi>Woodbridge's</hi> Character, and the Reaſon of putting him into the School, &amp;c, The Children began to be fond of him before I came away. There is a fair Proſpect of considerable Things being done among them. I found Nothing on the Part of the <hi>Indians</hi> but what was encouraging, except their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſtrong Drink. But from other People there are many Diſcouragements. They are a looſe vicious People they live among, and there are ſome ſo prodigiouſsly wicked as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all they can to diſcourage them; eſpecially the <hi>Dutch</hi> Traders, whoſe <hi>Gain is</hi> all their <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; and this poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Ignorance and Vice is their Gain: They trade with them very much in <hi>Rum,</hi> which is the Deſtruction of every Thing that's good among them. To diſcourage them they tell them, that our Religion is not a good one, and that we deſign only to make Slaves of them. They take Advantage from the Law of your <hi>Province,</hi> againſt ſelling ſtrong Liquor to them, to prejudice them againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The Traders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves evade the Force of the Law, by leaving their Rum juſt without the Borders of the <hi>Province,</hi> from whence the <hi>Indians</hi> fetch it themſelves. The Week before I came away they had a drunken Frolick, which laſted three or four Days. <hi>Kunkapot</hi> always keeps clear of ſuch Frolicks, and <hi>Umpachenee</hi> had ſo much the Command of himſelf as to refrain at that Time.— God only knows what may and will be effected; but I am
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007023_0025_102AEA728BCF73E8"/>
much afraid that the <hi>Dutch</hi> will diſcourage many of them: for they have great Influence over the <hi>Indians.</hi> As for the old ones, who are much addicted to drinking, nothing but the extraordinary Power, that attended <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in its firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, will be ſufficient to reform them. The Young I have great Hopes of, if God is pleas'd to bleſs ſuitable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with them.</p>
                  <p>I hop'd they (the <hi>Indians</hi>) would have had a general Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Tribe,</hi> while I was with them; but their Buſineſs (Hunting) made them defer it till ſince I came away; and I ſuppoſe 'tis to be about this Time, What will be concluded in that Meeting will either add Life to our Deſign, or almost entirely quaſh it.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible I have drawn out this Letter to a very great Length, but if I am tedious, I will not be more ſo by apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing for it, but only beg Leave to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

            <p>This Letter was very acceptable to the <hi>Indians</hi>; and the more ſo, becauſe it came to them a little before a general Meeting of the <hi>River-Indians,</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> at which they were to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether it was beſt that the <hi>Indians</hi> there ſhould go on to receive Inſtruction or not?</p>
            <p>It is a Cuſtom among the <hi>Indians,</hi> not to proceed in any Affair of Importance, till they have the Conſent of the <hi>ſeveral Clans,</hi> belonging to their Nation; and the <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Houſatun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuk,</hi> having proceeded ſo far, without the general Conſent of their <hi>Brethren,</hi> were much concern'd leſt they ſhould be frown'd upon at the approaching Meeting, and the more ſo, becauſe they had heard, that the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their receiving a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>School-Master,</hi> before they had gain'd the Approbation of the Reſt of their <hi>Tribe</hi>; yea, there was a Report, that a Deſign was on Foot to poiſon the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> on that Account; as alſo, becauſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd <hi>Commiſſions</hi> from his Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was any juſt Ground for theſe Reports, or whether they were ſet on Foot by the <hi>Dutch Traders</hi> to diſcourage the <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> I am not able to ſay. But however that was, the <hi>Indians</hi> were ſo affected with theſe flying Stories, that they ſent, deſiring ſome of the Miniſters of the <hi>County</hi> would come to them, and be preſent at their <hi>general Meeting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, <hi>January</hi> 15th 1734-5, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> and I, accompany'd by <hi>John Aſhley,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> went to <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> The <hi>Indians,</hi> who were expected from <hi>Hudſon's River,</hi> came not till Saturday, which was the 19th of the Month.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007023_0027_102AEA76F0000660"/>On the Sabbath Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> being deſir'd by the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> preach'd to the <hi>Indians</hi> by an Interpreter, in Number about 150, or 200, great and ſmall. I was with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Sheffield,</hi> who were then deſtitute of a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>To give the Particulars of our Proceedings with thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> (a Journal of which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> kept, and is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me,) would be too prolix. I choſe therefore, for Brevity's Sake, to give the Reader a conciſe Account of them, from a Letter which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> wrote to a Gentleman in <hi>Boſton,</hi> which was printed in Mr. <hi>Appleton</hi>'s Preface to his <hi>Sermon</hi> preach'd at Mr. SERGEANT's Ordination, and is as follows. <q>We had diverſe Conferences with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and read to them a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the honourable JOHN STODDARD, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and endeavour'd to anſwer their Objections, &amp;c. and ſo far ſatisfy'd thoſe that came from other Places, that they thanked us for the Pains we had taken; and deſir'd Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> might continue among them (at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi>) and that Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT would return to them; and ſaid they would give an Account to their ſeveral <hi>Towns,</hi> of what we had offer'd to them: And gave us Encouragement that they would as a Nation ſubmit to Inſtruction.</q>—</p>
            <p>Mr. SERGEANT's Account of what follow'd upon this general Meeting of the <hi>Indians,</hi> I will give in his own Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It happen'd as ſoon as this Meeting [Drinking and Frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always conclude ſuch Meetings] was over, that ſeveral of our <hi>Indians</hi> were taken ſick; and two Men, ſeiz'd with a violent Fever, died ſuddenly. This, with the Apprehenſion they had before of Miſchief, deſign'd by ſome of the other <hi>Indians</hi> that came from the neighbouring Government, put them into a great Fright; and made them ſuſpect that thoſe Perſons were poiſon'd. Tho', I believe, the Suſpicion was groundleſs. For it is ſo far from being ſtrange to me, that ſome are ſick after ſuch a Frolick, that I rather wonder they don't half die. For their <hi>Dancing</hi> is a moſt laborious Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. They dance round a hot Fire, till they are almoſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faint, and are wet with Sweat; and then run out, and, ſtriping themlſelves naked, expoſe their Bodies to the cold Air, and, it there be Snow upon the Ground, roll in it till they are cold, and then return to their Dancing again, and when
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007023_0028_102AEA78DD1914D8"/>
they are hot, and tir'd, cool themsſelves in the ſame Manner, and, it may be, repeat this four or five Times in a Night: concluding the Frolick with exceſſive Drinking. And when they are drunk, often fall a Sleep in the open Air, perhaps buried in Snow.</p>
               <p>This general Meeting happen'd in a very cold Seaſon, and when there was a very deep Snow upon the Ground. And I could never learn, that there was any certain Symptom of Poiſon. However, the <hi>Indians</hi> were perſuaded they were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd, and concluded to apply to ſome <hi>inviſible Power</hi> for the Diſcovery of the Murderers. I ſhall give an Account of this Matter, as it was related by Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in the following Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 21ſt of <hi>February</hi> 1734, 5, in the Afternoon, Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi> inform'd me, that he was going down to the <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi>'s Wigwam, to find out who poiſon'd thoſe two Men that lately died there. I tho't of nothing further than that they were going to make a proper Search into the Matter; and therefore ſaid nothing to diſſuade him. About Eight of the Clock in the Evening, <hi>Ebenezer</hi> came to me, and told me, they were going to <hi>Pawwaw</hi> (as we call it) that they might diſcover the Murderers that Way; for they expected that thoſe who did the Fact would appear to their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately rode down to them, found upwards of 40 <hi>Indians</hi> at the <hi>Lieutenant's Wigwam,</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">This <hi>Wigwam</hi> of the <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s, if I miſtake not, is about 50 or 60 Feet in Length.</note> which was ſwept clean, good Fires made up, and the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeated on each Side of the Fires, from End to End of the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> except a Space of about five or ſix Feet, which was left at one End of the <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam,</hi> for the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Pawwaws.</hi> Every <hi>Indian</hi> had two Sticks about a Foot and a half long, one of them ſplit at the End, which they held under their Legs as they fat. When I went in they were all prepar'd for the Exerciſe; but had not begun. I aſked them, if they were willing I ſhould be preſent to fee their Devotion? And, before they gave me an Anſwer, the oldeſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> life up his Eyes towards Heaven, and ſpake very earneſtly; after which they told me I might be there.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007023_0029_102AEA7AA881F6F0"/>
They began with rapping their Sticks, and ſinging; their eldeſt <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſitting, and talking, and acting a different Part from the Reſt, <hi>This continu'd about an Hour.</hi> Then the <hi>Prieſt</hi> roſe up, and threw off all his Cloaths, except the Flap that cover'd his Nakedneſs: And then, naked, paſs'd from one End of the <hi>Wigwam</hi> to the other, with his Eyes faſt ſhut, ſeeming to be in the utmoſt Agony; uſed all the frightful Motions and diſtorted Geſtures imaginable. <hi>This continu'd about another Hour.</hi> Then the firſt <hi>Priest,</hi> being beat out, retir'd, and a ſecond roſe, and acted the ſame Part; ſo a third, and a fourth. <hi>This</hi> continu'd all Night, without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, except ſome ſhort Intervals, in which they ſmoak'd a Pipe; and ſome Times, for a ſhort Space, they all got up and danc'd.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>After I had ſeen theſe Things, (which it is impoſſible to deſcribe) I took an Opportunity to inform them, how improper ſuch a Method of Worſhip was; how ſinful &amp; diſpleaſing to the great God. Upon which they told me, they knew no Harm in it; they made their Application to the great God, and to no other. I informed them, that God was not to be worſhip'd in ſuch a Manner. And when I had inſtructed them as well as I could, they reſolv'd never to do ſo any more: And thoſe of them who had been beſt taught were much troubled, that they had taken ſo wrong a Step.</q> Thus far Mr. <hi>Woodbridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. SERGEANT goes on and obſerves, that the <hi>Indians</hi> us'd to to have an high Opinion of theſe <hi>Pawwaws,</hi> (whoſe Character anſwers pretty well to the vulgar Notions of <hi>Wizards</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers</hi>) and tell Stories of the great Feats which they can do. However, they confeſs they have no Power over <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And concludes with theſe Words. <q>There may be ſomething, for ought I know, in what they ſay: But I am apt to think, they are very much impos'd upon by ſuch kind of Pretenders, as the Reſt of the ignorant Part of the World is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Beginning of <hi>February, Ebenezer</hi> viſited Mr. SERGEANT at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> by whom he wrote another Letter to the <hi>Indians.</hi> Some Paſſages of which are as follows.</p>

                     <salute>To all my good Friends the <hi>River-Indians at Housatunnuk,</hi> Health, &amp;.</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I am very glad to hear that you are all well, and that all Things go well with you. My Heart is with you, tho' I am ſo far diſtant from you: But the greateſt Pleaſure of all is that you have it yet in your Hearts to become <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>—When I had heard, that you concluded in your late general Meeting to embrace <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> it was more pleaſing to me than cold Water to a thirſty Man in the Heat of Summer, or a plentiful Meal to one almoſt ſtarv'd with Hunger, or good Succeſs to one who has hunted a qreat While in vain.</p>
                  <p>I hope you will be a wiſe and knowing People, and that you will learn to know the <hi>true God,</hi> the Maker of all Things, and the Governor of them; and to know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Son of God, and Saviour of Men.—It cannot be long before both you and I muſt die, and give an Account of ourſelves to the great God, who is high above all.—Oh! how ſhall we blame ourſelves for ever, if we neglect our preſent Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of preparing ourſelves for Death! But on the contrary, how glad ſhall we be, even to die, that we may go to <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who died for us, if we are careful now to pleaſe God, and to prepare ourſelves for Heaven! O that I could make you ſenſible of the Importance of theſe Things! I hope to ſee you again, and to inſtruct you more fully in theſe Things: But in the mean Time, I pray you, for your Soul's Sake, to embrace the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and make uſe of the Advantages God gives you to learn the Truth, and to obey it. I pray the great God to bleſs you in this World, with all good Things; and, in the World to come, to beſtow on you eternal Life This is the hearty Prayer of your aſſur'd Friend.</p>

            <p>About the Middle of <hi>February</hi> is the Time, when the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Housatunnuk</hi> leave their Habitation, and go, with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies into the Woods, to make their Year's Stock of <hi>Sugar</hi>; and the Seaſon for this Buſineſs laſts till the End of <hi>March,</hi> and ſome Times to the Middle of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007023_0031_102AEA7F566DC688"/>Therefore, when the <hi>Indians</hi> went into the Woods, and took their Children with them, Mr. <hi>Wood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ridge</hi> their Shool-Maſter, made a Viſit to his Friends at <hi>Springfield.</hi> By him the <hi>Indians</hi> wrote a Letter to ſome of the Miniſters of the <hi>County</hi>; inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that tho' their Buſineſs now call'd them, with their Families, abroad; yet, in a little Time, they ſhould return again with their Families to their Habitations, and receive further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and deſir'd, that their Remove might not be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as tho' they were diſaffected to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; and expreſs'd their Reſolution to proceed in it, and to uſe their further Endeavours to increaſe in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Knowledge, when they ſhould return from their Buſineſs of making Sugar.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> make their <hi>Sugar</hi> of the Sap of <hi>Maple Trees.</hi> They extract the Sap by cutting the Tree on one Side, in ſuch a Form as that the Sap will naturally gather into a ſmall Channel at the Bottom of the Hole cut; where they fix into the Tree a ſmall Chip, of 6 or 8 Inches long, which carries the Sap off from the Tree, into a Veſſel ſet to receive it. Thus they tap a Number of Trees; and, when the Veſſels are full, they gather the Sap, and boil it to ſuch a Degree of Conſiſtence, as to make <hi>Sugar.</hi> After it is boil'd, they take it off the Fire, and ſtir it till it is cold, which is their Way of <hi>graining</hi> it. The <hi>Sugar</hi> is very good, of a very agreable Taſte, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt wholeſome of any. It might doubtleſs be made in great Plenty; and, I cannot but think, to the great Profit of the Undertakers. If ſome Man would build him a <hi>Sugar-Houſe</hi> and provide a ſet of <hi>Boilers,</hi> and other Utenſils as they have in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> I am perſuaded he would find his Account in it, beyond what thoſe in the <hi>West-Indies</hi> can do. For the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who hath a Plantation in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> is at great Expence in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his Ground; planting his <hi>Cane,</hi> and cultivating it for more than a Year, before it is fit for Uſe: in cutting, triming, and toping it; for Mills to grind it; and not till all this be done is the Sap of the <hi>Cane</hi> ready for boiling. All this Charge might be ſubſtracted from the Gentleman's Account, who uſes <hi>Maple Trees</hi> inſtead of <hi>Cane,</hi> except the Expence of taping the Trees, and gathering the Sap, which is as nothing compar'd with the other.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that the Sap of <hi>Maple Trees</hi> is not ſo rich as that of the Sugar <hi>Cane</hi>; but I ſuppoſe the Diſproportion is not <hi>by far</hi> ſo great as that of the Expence For, I have been inform'd that two Men, under the Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of boiling it in two Kettles, and in the open Air, have, in a good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, made a Barrel in a Week. What then would a Number of Hands do, with a Sett of <hi>Weſt-India Boilers, Coolers,</hi> and other Advantages of Diſpatch, which they are furniſh'd with? Trees ſit for this Buſineſs are very plenty, in the vaſt uncultivated Wilderneſs between <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Hudton's</hi> Rivers, as alſo in all the Northern Borders of this Province And, could the one Half of them be used, I ſuppoſe they would more than furniſh all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies upon the <hi>Continent</hi> with <hi>Sugar</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Molaſſes</hi> that is made of this Sap it exceeding good, and conſiderably reſembles <hi>Houry.</hi> Three, or, at moſt, four Barrels of this Sap reduc'd to one, by boiling, will ferment, and makes a very pleaſant Drink, which is ſufficiently <hi>ſpirituous</hi>; and, ſuppoſe, by being diſtill'd, would make excellent <hi>Rum</hi>; tho' the Experiment has not, that I know of, been yet made.</p>
                  <p>The Trees, after they have been us'd 3 or 4 Years ſucceſſively, muſt then reſt as many Years; and after they are recruited ſerve again, as well, or better than ever. The ſecond and third Years they are better than the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the Sap is richer than at firſt, tho' not quite ſo plenteous.</p>
                  <p>The Seaſon for this Buſineſs is from the Beginning of <hi>February</hi> to the End of <hi>March.</hi> A Time when People are as much at Leiſure as ever.</p>
                  <p>Would it not therefore be prudent, for thoſe who have a ſufficient Number of theſe Trees, on their new Farms, to ſpare them, and uſe them from Year to Year, to ſupply themſelves with thoſe Commodities?</p>

            <p>In the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> ſeveral of the <hi>Indians</hi> went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and waited upon Mr. SERGEANT to <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> The Account of which I chuſe to give in his own Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the 6th. Came Capt. <hi>Kunkapot,</hi> Lieut. <hi>Umpachenee,</hi> his Brother <hi>Johtohkuhkoonaunt,</hi> and <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> to wait upon me up, and to carry the Boys back, who had been with me all Winter. The Lads had learnt to read and write <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well, for the Time. <hi>Johtohkuhkoonaunt</hi> had been a very vicious Fellow, and a very bitter Enemy to the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; but a little before this he came ſtrangely about, and was much in Favour of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; undertook to learn to read, and made extraordinary Proficiency in it.—</p>
               <p>I entertain'd theſe Men with as much Reſpect, and Kindneſs, as I could; ſhew'd them our Library, and the Rarities of the <hi>College</hi>; with which they ſeem'd to be well pleas'd; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd themſelves, while they were there, well, and with much Decency.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 8th, Mr. SERGEANT left <hi>New-Haven</hi> (thoſe Men accompanying him) and got to <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> on the 10th, at Night.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, May</hi> the 11th. I preach'd to an Auditory of about 20 in Number, who gave great Attention, and ſome of them were very-much affected with what I ſaid. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's <hi>Wiſe</hi> wept almoſt all the Time. And others of them frequently ſhed Tears, eſpecially the <hi>Captain</hi> was often very much affected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>indians</hi> now ſeem'd to be in a very good Temper, and, as I was told, had the greateſt Opinion of, and Love for me.—Now the <hi>Indians</hi> were parted again from the School-Houſe; and liv'd ſome of them at <hi>Wuabktukook,</hi> and ſome at <hi>Skatekook</hi>; for at thoſe Places they planted their Corn and Beans, which is all the Huſbandry they carry on. For the Reſt of their Living they depend upon <hi>Hunting.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>During Mr. SERGEANT's ſhort Tarry with the <hi>Indians,</hi> (which was but 16 Days) he and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> both kept School; one at one Place, and the other at the other, each taking his Turn a Week at a place.

                  <p>Though I am not ſo happy as to have much perſonal Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with you, yet your known Character in general, and eſpecially your Relation to the Affair I have been engag'd in, has made me hope, I ſhall have your Pardon for the Trouble I now give you.</p>
                  <p>Tis but lately I return'd from <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> and I doubt not, but you will rejoice to be inform'd of the happy Succeſs, God has been pleaſs'd to bleſs the Endeavours with, that have been us'd to convert the <hi>Heathen</hi> there to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith. The Deſign has hitherto ſucceeded beyond Expectation. They are, I think, now reſolv'd to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are earneſtly deſirous to be taught. The Fondneſs they ſhew for me is ſurprizing; and conſidering how much a Stranger I am to them, their own barbarous Education, and how little I have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007023_0034_102AEA84F46EBAC0"/>
done to win them, there appears ſomething more than humane in it. And I think they are now in a better Diſpoſition than I left them in laſt Fall.</p>
                  <p>I am very willing (if the Gentlemen <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> pleaſe) to devote my Life to the Service of their Souls. And if God ſhall give Succeſs in it, it will be the greateſt Satisfaction to me.—There is now, and I hope will be, Work enough for two; I hope therefore Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> will be maintain'd there with me.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible, that <hi>one Hundred Pounds</hi> will but juſt pay the neceſſary Charges of living; for the Neceſſaries of Life are, and muſt be, dear in this remote Part of the Country. But I make myſelf eaſy in the Matter, aſſuring myſelf, that (if there be any Money) the Gentlemen betruſted with the Affair will do what is reaſonable. Money alone is no Temptation to me, at all, to devote myſelf to ſuch a Lite; yet I think it but reaſonable to expect to be ſupported, ſo as to have no other Care, than the Buſineſs I ſhall go upon.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> (I perceive) have a Mind to be <hi>baptiz'd. Kunkapot,</hi> eſpecially, who appears to me well qualify'd for it. I have therefore tho't it would be convenient, I ſhould be ordain'd ſpeedily; at leaſt, as ſoon as I tm diſmiſs'd from the Concerns of the <hi>College.</hi> I would gladly be inform'd whether it will be expected I ſhou'd come to <hi>Boſton</hi> for that Purpoſe. To be ordain'd here will be more convenient for me, and leſs Expenſive.</p>
                  <p>The Lads, I brought down, liv'd here with me laſt Winter, upon my Credit. The Charge has amounted to ſomething conſiderable, too much for me, under my preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to bear alone; tho', were I able, I ſhould gladly beſtow my Money that Way.—</p>

               <hi>July,</hi> the 1ſt 1735. Mr. SERGEANT (having diſmiſs'd his Claſs at <hi>College</hi>) left <hi>New-Haven,</hi> intending to ſpend the Reſt of the Summer, and indeed of his Life, with the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuk,</hi> where he arrived on the 5th, and the next Sabbath preach'd to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there being no Interpreter preſent. And he, with Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> went on to keep the School, as before; one above, the other below, changing Place every Week.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Lord's-Day, July</hi> 13th. Preach'd to the <hi>Indians,</hi> few in Number—No Man preſent except <hi>Kunkapot,</hi> who was very much affected, weeping almoſt all the Time. The Men were gone into <hi>New-York</hi> Government, to reap for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there.</q>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> reaping for the <hi>Dutch</hi> does not turn to their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, (tho' it might, if they had Prudcnce to ſave their Wages) but proves a Snare to them. For (as Mr. SERGEANT obſerves in his Journal) when the Harveſt is over, the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Hudſon's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>River</hi> drink up all their Wages. But he had the Pleaſure to hear that <hi>Winampee,</hi> one of his Hearers, on this Occaſion, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Temptation, and told the <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Hudſon's-River,</hi> plainly, that the deſign'd to go to Heaven, and therefore muſt leave off ſuch Wickedneſs. But ſome of them, to his great Grief, did not come off ſo well. Neither is it to be wondered at, that Men, who for a long Courſe of Years, have addicted themſelves to Exceſs, ſhould be overcome, when ſuch Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are laid before them by their Brethren, and urg'd on by others for the Sake of Gain.</p>
            <p>The Pains ſome of the <hi>Honſatunnuk Indians</hi> have taken to cure themſelves of this ill Habit, has been very great. And ſome Inſtances there have been of Perſons among them, who, when ſtrong Drink has been offer'd them, have refus'd to <hi>taſte</hi> of it, giving this as a Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that if they <hi>once taſte,</hi> they are in the utmoſt Danger of exceeding the Bounds of Temperance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:007023_0037_102AEA8B666521D0"/>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 13th. Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd a Letter from the honourable <hi>Adam Winthrop,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> informing him, chat at a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Comiſſioners</hi> it was propos'd, and agreed to, that he ſhould be <hi>ordain'd</hi> at <hi>Deerfield,</hi> when his Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher</hi> ſhould come thither, upon a Treaty with the <hi>Indians</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Tribes,</hi> who were to meet him at that Place. The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of <hi>Honſatunnuk,</hi> being ſent for by the Governor, ſet out for <hi>Deerfield,</hi> about the 18th of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> But Mr. SERGEANT was then in Doubt whether he ſhould be able to go; as he was taken a few Days before with the intermitting Fever, <hi>the common Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of all new Comers to</hi> Houſatunnuk. But on the 26th of the Month, he was ſo far recover'd of his Illneſs, that he ſet out for <hi>Deerfield,</hi> and was there <hi>ordained</hi> on the Sabbath following.</p>
            <p>The Account I find of Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>Ordination,</hi> in his own Journal, is only this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord's-Day, Auguſt</hi> 31ſt 1735. I was <hi>ordain'd</hi> at <hi>Deerfield.</hi> I ſhall therefore give the Reader an Account of that Solemnity, as I find it in the Preface of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Appleton</hi>'s Sermon, preach'd on that Occaſion, and in what is annex'd at the End of ſaid Sermon.—</p>
            <q>—And as it was thought highly proper, according to Mr. SERGEANT's Propoſal, that he ſhould be <hi>ordained,</hi> ſo his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency the <hi>Governor,</hi> who is at the Head of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> was pleas'd ſo to order the Matter, as to have a very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opportunity for it; for his Excellency, having propos'd a Treaty with ſome of the <hi>Indian Tribes,</hi> at <hi>Deerfield,</hi> gave Orders to the <hi>Indians,</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> to meet him there. Accordingly, the <hi>Governor,</hi> attended with a large <hi>Committee</hi> of His <hi>Majesty's Council,</hi> and <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> and many other Gentlemen, was at <hi>Deerfield</hi> on <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25th. And that Week being taken up in the Treaty with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Peace and Friendſhip between us and them, and in giving and receiving the uſual Pledges of it; and Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT not coming to Town, till Friday Evening, it was judg'd proper to have the <hi>Ordination</hi> on the <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> which was accordingly carried on, in the Forenoon of ſaid Day, by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and other Miniſters then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, at the Deſire, and in the Preſence of His <hi>Excellency</hi> and the <hi>honourable Gentlanen</hi> of the <hi>General Court,</hi> and thoſe that
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007023_0038_102AEA8D2A282128"/>
attended him thither, together with the Aſſembly of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſually meeting in that Place, and many of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were grave Spectators of the Solemnity, and the <hi>Houſatunnuk Indians,</hi> who ſat by themſelves, and attended throughout the whole Service with great Seriouſneſs; and were much pleas'd to ſee one they had ſuch a Love for, ſo ſolemnly ſeperated to the Service of their Souls.</q>
            <p>As an Introdudlion to the <hi>Ordination,</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>William Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi> made a Speech to His Excellency the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,</hi> in which he took Notice of God's inclining the Hearts or ſome generous Perſons in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by their charitable Donations, to ſeek the Salvation of the benighted <hi>Heathen</hi>; and of it's being ſubmited to the Direction of an honourable <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there</hi>; and that by them a Number of Honourable and Reverend <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> (of which His Excellency is at the Head) were here appointed for the ſame End; and of their having found a ſuitable Perſon for the Inſtruction of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of which thoſe at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> were deſirous: And humbly aſk'd, if it were His <hi>Excellency</hi>'s Pleaſure, that the Paſtors then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd ſhould proceed to ſet him a-part for that Work.</p>
            <p>To which His <hi>Excellency</hi> manifeſted his Approbation.</p>
            <p>Then he obſerv'd to Mr. SERGEANT, that he now underſtood His <hi>Excellency,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> deſir'd him to take upon him the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and Service of a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> to the <hi>Houſatunnuk-Indians</hi>; and aſk'd him, if he were willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote himſelf to that Work?</p>
            <p>To which Mr. SERGEANT gave his Conſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ordination</hi> then was proceeded in. And after the <hi>Fellowſſip of Elders</hi> was given, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> by an Interpreter, aſk'd the <hi>Indians,</hi> if they were willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mr. SERGEANT, thus ſolemnly ſet a-part to the Work, as their <hi>Teacher?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which they manifeſted their Willingneſs by riſing up.</p>
            <p>After the ſhort Account Mr. SERGEANT gave of his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as above, he in his Journal adds.</p>
            <q>The Affair of the <hi>Treaty</hi> being made publick. I need ſay nothing of it. Only I would take Notice, that His <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's</hi> Treatment of our <hi>Indians</hi> was exceeding grateful to them, and they have conceiv'd the higheſt Opinion of the <hi>Governor.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:007023_0039_102AEA8F35500E58"/>Here Mr. SERGEANT takes Occaſion (from a Quarrel that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe between an <hi>Indian</hi> &amp; his <hi>Wiſe,</hi> by which they were upon the very Point of parting, (tho' afterwards the Difference was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, and they liv'd very happily together) to give ſome Account of the ill Cuſtom among the <hi>Indians</hi> of parting after they are married.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The parting of Man and Wiſe (ſaith he) is a very common Thing among them. Indeed it us'd rarely to happen, that a married Couple live together till they are old. And as they uſe but little Ceremony in the Buſineſs of Marriage, ſo they make a leſs Thing of parting.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Caſe, 'tis their Law, that the Children and all the Houſhold Stuff belong to the <hi>Woman</hi>; and indeed every Thing elſe but the <hi>Gun,</hi> for that is the Man's Livelihood.—The Man, according to their Cuſtom, has no Right to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, any more than any other Perſon whatever.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Then he goes on,</p>
            <q>
               <p>After the <hi>Treaty</hi> was over, I went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and afcer I had paid a Viſit to my Friends, in <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> (his native Place) I return'd again to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> and brought back the <hi>Captain's</hi> Son from <hi>New-Haven</hi> (for he had been there all Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) who hid, by this Time learnt to ſpeak and read <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well.—When I return'd, Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> was not here, for being taken ſick about the Time I was, when he had a little recover'd, he went down to <hi>Springfield,</hi> for the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Health; but was detain'd there by Sickneſs, till ſome Time in <hi>November.</hi> In the mean Time, I kept the School.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, October</hi> 26th. I preach'd as uſual. The <hi>Indians</hi> ſhew'd great Satisfaction to ſee me, their Miniſter, again. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the <hi>Captain</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi>; who ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very deſirous of it. I went up to his Houſe, in the Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Time, to diſcourſe with him, and prepare him for it. He is a very modeſt, but intelligent Man, of great Integrity, and of a blameleſs Converſation; and, from the very firſt of my reaching there, ſeem'd to have a ſerious and religious Turn of Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:007023_0040_102AEA922A2B45D8"/>His <hi>Wiſe</hi> alſo is a very ſober good Sort of a Woman. He and his Wife gave great Attention to what I ſaid. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, <hi>Lord's-Day, November</hi> 2d. I <hi>baptiz'd Kunkapot</hi> by the Name of <hi>John,</hi> his Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> and eldeſt Daughter. The Reſt of the Children were not preſent, by Reaſon of the Badneſs, of the Weather. The Candidates ſhew'd a ſerious Senſe of what they were about. It was done in the Preſence of a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Number, both of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 7th. I married <hi>Ebenezer</hi> &amp; <hi>Sarah,</hi> lawful Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment having firſt been made; for he, ſaid he, being a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> choſe to be married after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manner, which he prefer'd to their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>November</hi> 9th. I <hi>baptiz'd</hi> the Reſt of the <hi>Captain</hi>'s Family, as alſo <hi>Ebenezer</hi>'s Son; in all, five. And now the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> propos'd themſelves to <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the next <hi>Lord's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Day.</hi> I deſir'd them to come in the Evening to my Lodgings; and they came, with <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> their Interpreter.</p>
               <p>I diſcours'd very largely, and as particularly as I tho't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, upon all the more important and fundamental Points of Belief and Practice, in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. To which they ſeriouſly attended, and were apparently much affected. This Converſation the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> has often ſpoken of ſince, as what afforded him more Knowledge, than he had ever gain'd by all his former Inſtruction: and from this Time he ſeems to have had a new Heart given him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, November</hi> 16th. I <hi>baptiz'd</hi> the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> by the Name of <hi>Aaron,</hi> his Wife <hi>Hannab,</hi> and the Reſt of his Family; as alſo the <hi>Lieutenant's Wife's Siſter,</hi> and <hi>Ebenezer's Wife</hi>; in all, eleven Perſons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> is a <hi>clear-headed ſmart Man,</hi> of a deep Reach, and pleaſant Humour; and is one of the beſt Speakers we hear; is free in Converſation, and talks excellently well. He has entirely left off Drinking to Exceſs, and declaims againſt it; ſhews great Compaſſion towards the Reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and ſeems heartily to lament their miſerable Condition; wiſhes they were come to the Knowledge of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; is himſelf thro'ly convinc'd of the Truth; and his Knowledge does not puff him up. And tho' he is reckon'd ſomewhat haughty, yet always ſhews himſelf modeſt and teachable enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:007023_0041_102AEA93FB335988"/>The <hi>Indians,</hi> in general, now ſeem'd more engaged in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than ever before. I was willing to improve their preſent Temper, and therefore tarried with them in the Evening, (for they had now again mov'd with their Families to the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houſe, where they liv'd all Winter) and diſcours'd with them ſeveral Hours, till indeed I was afraid I ſhould tire their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienee. However, when I told them, I was unwilling to be tedious to them, they anſwer'd, they were glad to hear, and ſhould never be tir'd with hearing thoſe Things. I endeavour'd to give them a ſhort View of the whole Scheme of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They gave good Attention, and appear'd well pleas'd. [And this I practis'd for ſeveral Lord's-Day Evenings following.] And when I had done, <hi>Whampee</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> propos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the next <hi>Lord's-Day.</hi>—23d. I <hi>baptiz'd Whampee,</hi> his <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>; the Lieutenant's Brother <hi>Tohtobkukboonaut</hi> with ſome others; in all, eleven Souls—Saturday of this Week came a <hi>Suſquabamaab</hi> Indian, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is a remarkable Fellow; he continu'd with us about a Month; attended conſtantly upon Preaching, gave great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and behav'd himſelf very well while he was here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, November</hi> 30th. In the Evening, I ſtay'd at the School Houſe to diſcourſe with the <hi>Indians. Unnaqaunut,</hi> the <hi>Soſuahannab Indian,</hi> was preſent. I therefore ſhap'd my Diſcourſe, in ſome Meaſure, for his Inſtruction; endeavouring to ſhew the Advantage, and Neceſſity of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the peculiar Excellencies of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. This. Stranger mightily approv'd of what I ſaid. He was formerly very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, tho' a Man of good Senſe and ſpake a little <hi>Dutch.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> generally own the Difference between moral Good, and Evil, as alſo a future State of Rewards, and Puniſhments. And I ſuppoſe that he, being a Man of ſome Curioſity, and underſtanding a little <hi>Dutch,</hi> might have ſome better Notions of theſe Things than the <hi>Indians</hi> commonly have. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had ſome Knowledge of the peculiar Doctrines of the Chriſtian Reiligion. He had certainly experienc'd ſomething more than ordinary, whereby he had been chang'd from a very vicious, drunken Fellow, to a ſober Man. He told me ſundry ſtrange Things, that had befallen him. He is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very different Man from what he us'd to be. He is now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007023_0042_102AEA95C20FB1D8"/>
a very temperate, rational, thinking Man, and has not oaty left off drinking to Exceſs, but drinks no ſtrong Drink Wall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, December</hi> 7th. I <hi>baptized</hi> nine mere Perſons. About this Time the <hi>Indians</hi> agreed to have no Trading in <hi>Rum</hi>; which they remained by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> 14th. I <hi>baptiz'd Nawnawnnekenuk</hi> a principal Man, of a very good Temper and Senſe, honeſt, faithful, and obligng.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's Day</hi> 21 ſt. There being no <hi>Interpreter,</hi> I preach'd to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> only.</p>
               <p>About this Time, ſome of our <hi>Indians</hi> came to me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired my Opinion about a certain Cuſtom they have and call <hi>Keutikaw,</hi> or a <hi>Dance.</hi> I aſk'd them, if there were any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in it? They anſwer'd No; but that it was only a civil Cuſtom of their Nation. However, if 1 diſapprov'd of it, they would omit it. I told them, it there was nothing more in the Matter, I ſaw no Harm in it, and I ſhould be glad of an Opportunity to ſee ſome of their People here: But was afraid they would fall to Drinking, and inſtead of doing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Religion</hi> they were now <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of (which was their Duty) they would ſcandaliſe it before Strangers, They promiſed me there ſhould be no Drinking; that they would carefully abſtain from it themſelves, and, when they ſent to invite ſome of their Friends to the <hi>Keutikaw,</hi> ſhould forbid their bringing any Rum. <hi>They us'd always upon ſuch Occaſions to have Plenty of ſtrong Drink, and always made a drunken Frolick of it, in the End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, January</hi> 18th. I preach'd at the <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s Houſe, to an Auditory of 80 or 90, about one Half bring Strangers. I preach'd a Diſcourſe ſuitable for the Occaſion, and afterwards fat and diſcourſed with them for a conſiderable Time. They heard with Attention, and I have Reaſon to think with Approbation; for I heard ſome of the elderly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons expreſs'd themſelves much in Favour of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; wiſh'd our <hi>Indians</hi> might go on and proſper: and ſome ſaid, they would come &amp; live here. And two Families did ſtay, and are here now. <hi>Unnagaunut</hi> alſo left two Sons here in the School, both likely young Fellows; one, eſpecially, is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007023_0043_102AEA97C3AD5C48"/>
extraordinary, and lerns at a prodigious Rate. So that we had now ten Souls added to our Number. The Number of Scholars is upwards of 40, beſides ſome elderly Perſons, who have made Attempts to learn to read.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Keutikaw</hi> is a Dance which finiſhes the <hi>Mourning for the Dead,</hi> and is celebrated about twelve Months after the Deceaſe, when the Gueſt invited make Preſents to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Deceaſed, to make up their Loſs, and to end their Mourning. The Manner of doing it is this. The Preſents prepar'd are deliver'd to a Speaker, appointed for the Purpoſe; who, laying them upon the Shoulders of ſome elderly Perſon, makes a Speech, ſhewing the Deſign of their preſent Meeting, and of the Preſents prepar'd. Then he takes them and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes them to the <hi>Meurners</hi> adding ſome Words of Conſolation, and deſiring them to forget their Sorrow, and accept of thoſe Preſents to make up their Loſs. After this, they eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and make Merry.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Indians</hi> kept to their Reſolution about <hi>Drinking,</hi> much beyond my Expectation; for they always us'd to get Drunk upon ſuch Occaſions; but we had now but very little Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing The Behaviour of our <hi>Indians</hi> was much taken Notice of by the Strangers; there being a very obſervable Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Manners. The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf, not only by abſtaining from Exceſs himſelf, not by exhorting others alſo to uſe with Moderation, what ſtrong Drink they were allow'd. <hi>Unnaqaunut</hi> was alſo here, and was very ſerviceable in keeping good Order.</p>
            </q>
            <p>By what I have here tranſcrib'd, from Mr. SERGEANT's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the Reader will be ſenſible, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for him, and were diſpoſed to aſk, and ſubmit to, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in every Thing, their own ancient Cuſtoms not excepted; that Mr. SERGEANT was very iuduſtrious and faithful in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their temporal and eternal Good; and that the Bleſſing of God abundantly ſucceeded his Endeavours.</p>
            <p>It was then but little more than a Year ſince thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> were in the Depth of <hi>Healtheſh</hi> Ignorance and Darkneſs, wholly unacquainted with the firſt Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>without God in the World.</hi> But, in that ſhort Space, many of them had gain'd ſuch Degrees of Knowledge, in the Principles of Religion,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007023_0044_102AEA9A16416B10"/>
that they were become in Mr. SERGEANT's Opinion, (who was a good Judge) fit Subjects of <hi>Baptism.</hi> And they, with their Children, to the Number of 40, were <hi>baptized</hi> by him, in little more than two Months after his <hi>Ordination.</hi> The Number of their Inhabitants, and of their Scholars in the School, was alſo increas'd.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things greatly refreſh'd Mr. SERGEANT's Spirits, and were no ſmall Encouragement to him, in his difficult Work. They were alſo Matter of Admiration to others, and the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of many Thankſgivings to God, whoſe Power and Grace were manifeſt, in turning thoſe poor People <hi>from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as many rejoic'd to ſee Mr. SERGEANT chearfully devote himſelf to the Service of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in this ſelf-denying Work, and to hear of the glorious Succeſs he was favour'd with in it; ſo they ſaid many kind and endearing Things to him by their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And the Reader will not, I truſt, be diſpleas'd, if I tranſcribe ſome Paſſages out of them.</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:007023_0047_102AEA9F923BF030"/>I wiſh I were worthy of the Love of ſo excellent a Man as Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> whom all above and admire. And if I may be tho't worthy, in any Meaſure, to deſerve the good Opinion of my Fellow-Men, it is not a little owing to the Doctor's inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Writings, which have the Force to charm the Mind to the Love of Virtue and Piety, and to infuſe his own Spirit into his Readers.—My firſt Diſcourſe to them (the <hi>Indians</hi>) I had no Thought of ever being read by any but myſelf, but had I attempted its Amendment, perhaps, I ſhould have made it worſe.</p>
                  <p>God has been pleas'd to crown our Labours with ſurprizing, and unexpected Succeſs. I have <hi>baptiz'd</hi> almoſt 40 Perſons,<note n="*" place="bottom">He might have ſaid quite, as appears by the following Account.</note> Infants and Adult. I hope the Adult have a pretty good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the main and fundamental Doctrines of the holy <hi>Religion,</hi> into which they have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd And I always endeavour'd to poſſeſs their Minds with the moſt ſerious Senſe of what they were about, when they enter'd themſelves the <hi>Diſciples of Chriſt.</hi> Their whole Hearts ſeem'd to be engag'd in the Matter: And I have Reaſon to think, that the Imperfection of their Knowledge is made up by their Zeal and Integrity. Thoſe who have been baptiz'd have behav'd very well, tho' they have, ſeveral Times, been tempred to exceed the Rules of Temperance, by Offers of ſtrong Drink, which us'd to be their beloved De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They ſeem'd to be ſurpriz'd with the Change, they find in themſelves; expreſſing the Difference between their former State, and the preſent, by Infancy and Manhood, dreaming and being awake, Darkneſs &amp; Light, and the like Metaphors. I pray God, <hi>the Day Star</hi> that ſeems to be <hi>ariſen in their Hearts, may ſhine more and more to the perfect Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thank you for your kind Offer of the Donation from that pious, and generous Gentleman you mention. I thank God, I do not want myſelf.

            <p>The Rev. Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> not only approv'd of the Method, in which Mr. SERGEANT propos'd to ſpend the Money offer'd him, but was ſo well pleas'd with it, that he doubled the Sum; as appears by a Paſſage in the Doctor's Anſwer of <hi>February</hi> 6th 1735, 6.</p>
            <q>Mr. <hi>Matthew Noble</hi> brings me to Day your welcome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of <hi>December</hi> 26th. And has receiv'd Ten Pounds for yourſelf, and Five for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge.</hi> I have doubled the Sum to you, upon reading your Letter, for the aſſiſting you the more in ſupporting the two <hi>Indian</hi> Boys.—</q>
            <p>By a Paſſage in Mr. SERGEANT's Journal, it ſeems as if even the <hi>River-Indians</hi> had not wholly eſcap'd being tamper'd with by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>January</hi> 26th.—The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> aſk'd me what I thought of the Celibacy of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, and of their ſevere Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuds of doing Penance? I was a little ſurpriz'd to hear him aſk ſuch a Queſtion; for I did not ſuppoſe our <hi>Indians</hi> knew any Thing of the Matter. However, I readily told him, that thoſe Things were vain Inventions of Men; and unprofitable Services; that I did not judge any Man; but I was ſure no Body was under Obligation to do them; that our Buſineſs was to mortify our Luſts and Paſſions, and to regulate our Lives by the reveal'd Will of God, and not to go beyond <hi>that.</hi>—</q>
            <p>In <hi>Indians</hi> living in two Places, remote from each other, put them to the Trouble of removing from their proper Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Winter Seaſon; and laid them under Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, as to attending upon the publick Worſhip, and theSchool, in the Summer. There was therefore, from the Beginning, a Deſign to accommodate them with Land, that they might all ſettle in one Place; and that there might be Accommodations alſo for others of the <hi>Tribe,</hi> who might be diſpos'd to come and ſettle with them. The honourable <hi>John Stoddard,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in a Letter, wrote to be communicated to the <hi>Indians,</hi> at their general
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007023_0049_102AEAA460137CA0"/>
Meeting at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> in <hi>January</hi> 1734.5. mention'd it as follows.</p>
            <q>—There is a Projection (ſays he) to get the moſt of the great Meadow, above the Mountain of <hi>Houſatunmuk</hi> for the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſo that they may live together, and be able, with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, to attend the publick Worſhip, and have a School at their Doors: Provided the <hi>Government</hi> can agree with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have Lands there, and can ſuit them with Lands elſewhere. Theſe Things are great Tokens of Kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Indians,</hi> and they ſhould be very careful how they put a Slight upon them.</q>
            <p>At the Treaty at <hi>Doorfield,</hi> the ſame Thing was propos'd to them, by Governor <hi>Beleber.</hi>
               <q>—I have been inform'd, (ſays His Excellency) that you will live remote from one another, and that you are not accommodated with Lands ſufficient to ſupport your Families. This Matter I ſhall lay before the great <hi>Council of this Government,</hi> and recommend to them the giving you Lands for your more convenient and compact Settlement, and what may be enough for your living comfortably upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, the <hi>Governor</hi> laid this Matter before the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> at their Fall Seſſion, and gives Mr. SERGEANT the following Account of it, in a Letter of <hi>January</hi> 20th 1735, 6. <q>—I laid before them (the <hi>General Court</hi>) what I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to your little Flock, at the Interview with them at <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>; and Col. <hi>Stoddand,</hi> Major <hi>Pumroy,</hi> and Mr. Juſtice <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerſole,</hi> are appointed, by the <hi>General Court,</hi> to weigh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all Things and Circumſtances, ſo as to accommodate my Children at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> with Land, in the beſt Manner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency adds, <q>I agree with you that ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families (if ſich can be found as you mention) be interſpers'd and ſettled among the <hi>Indians</hi>; for to <hi>civilize,</hi> will be the readreſt Way to <hi>chriſtianize</hi> them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> were inform'd of the Steps that were taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and of the <hi>Committee</hi> choſen for the above-mention'd End; but had a great Jealouſie upon their Minds, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had ſome ill Deſign upon them; and had ſeveral Conſultations among themſelves, what Anſwer they ſhould make to them they came up. Why they were ſo cautions, the Reader may beſt learn from Mr. SERGEANT's
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007023_0050_102AEAA5EA402D68"/>
Journal. <q>It may, (ſays he) perhaps, be wonder'd that there ſhould be any Difficult among the <hi>Indians</hi> in this Affair. But it is the Manner of the <hi>Nation</hi> to be ſlow in their Debates, cautions in their Determinations, and jealous of their Intereſt. And the Enemies of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (for we have a great many, not only among the <hi>Indians</hi> in other Places, but alſo among pretended <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; whoſe <hi>Godlineſs is their Gain</hi>) had been very induſtrious to throw <hi>ſtumbling Blocks</hi> in their Way, and to prevent their accepting the Propoſal of ſettling together. For there have not been wanting thoſe, and there are ſome yet, that tell them, our Deſign, in this Affair, is only to get the greater Advantage of them, and bring them more into our Power, that we may inſalve them and their Children.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But theſe Jealouſies were, in ſome good Meaſure, remov'd by the Pains Mr. SERGEANT took to ſatisfy them of the kind and good Intention of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> towards them; and by the Faithfulneſs both of the <hi>Committe &amp; Government</hi> in that Affair.</p>

            <p>It muſt be here obſerv'd, that the Lands at <hi>Wnabktukook</hi> (alias the Great Meadow) above the Mountain, were comprehended in the North Part of a Townſhip, which was ſome Time ago purchaſed of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and by the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> granted to a Number of Proprietors; except a ſmall Part, which Captain <hi>Kunkapot,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Indians</hi> there, reſerv'd for their own Uſe; and now live upon. What the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> deſign'd, was, to agree with thoſe Proprietors, who had Land above the Mountain, to give up their Right, and to take Land in other Places, as an Equivalent for it: and to grant to the <hi>Indians</hi> a Townſhip ſix Miles Square, comprizing the Great Meadow in it; that being the moſt ſuitable Spot for the <hi>Indians</hi> of any that could be had: for they make little or no Uſe of any but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Land.</p>
            <p>The Buſineſs therefore of the <hi>Committee,</hi> in the next Place, was with thoſe <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> People, who held the Land above the Mountain; with whom, when they came to diſcourſe, they found little or no Difficulty; for they were content with the Propoſals made to them of equivalent Lands in other Places. But there were two or three <hi>Dutch Men,</hi> who were ſettled above the Mountain, and had Lands in the Great-Meadow, who were more difficult. To thoſe the Committee made ſome very fair Propoſals, which they took into Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Committee</hi> therefore, upon meeting the <hi>Indians</hi> on the 18th, inform'd them, that they had conſer'd with the Proprietors of the Land above the Mountain, and that there was a Proſpect of obtaining thoſe Lands for the <hi>Indians,</hi> according to their Deſire; eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>Governor,</hi> and <hi>General Court,</hi> were ſo very

deſirous of promoting <hi>Religion</hi> among them; that it was not now in their Power to ſettle them together, but they muſt make Report of what they had done to the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi>; who, if they approv'd of it, would ſend another <hi>Committee</hi> to accompliſh the Affair. And then they deſir'd to know, Whether the <hi>Indians</hi> had any Thing further to ſay to them?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> return'd them their hearty Thanks for the Pains they had taken, and for the Trouble they had been at, in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting the Affair: and added, that they had nothing further to ſay, but only that they deſir'd to be ſettled together by planting Time.</p>
            <p>Upon the Report of this <hi>Committee,</hi> I ſuppoſe, it was, that the <hi>General Court</hi> granted to the <hi>Indians</hi> a Townſhip, ſix Miles ſquare, above the Mountain; comprising in it <hi>Wnebktukook,</hi> or the Great-Meadow. And the ſame Gentlemen were appointed a <hi>Committee</hi> to lay out the Land, and to treat further with thoſe, who were Proprietors of Land, within the Limits of the Townſhip, to give them an Equivalent, to Proportion the Meadow Lands to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to do all that was needful that the <hi>Indians</hi> might be put into the quiet Poſſeſſion of it. By the Grant of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT, their <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> their <hi>School-Maſter,</hi> were made Proprietors, each of a ſixtieth Part of the Townſhip; and four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides were to be accommodated with ſuch a Part as the <hi>Committee</hi> ſhould ſee fit. It was upon Mr. SERGEANT's Deſire, that thoſe Families were admitted. The Ends he had in View were, not only that <hi>He,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> might have the Comfort of their Neighbourhood, and Society; but eſpecially to <hi>civilize</hi> and <hi>anglicize</hi> the <hi>Indians,</hi> and to be a Help to them in their ſecular Affairs. Families, well adapted to anſwer thoſe Ends, were to be choſen, and by Col. <hi>Stoddord</hi>'s Approbation (who was a good Judge) they were to be admitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 20th. Theſe Gentlemen, the honourable <hi>John Stoddard, Ebeneze Pumrcy,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ingerſole,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſqrs</abbr> went to <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> upon the Buſineſs aſſign'd them by the <hi>Court.</hi> When they met the <hi>Indians,</hi> they found ſome Jealouſies yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining upon their Minds, which it was needful for them, in the firſt Place, to remove. Of this Matter Mr. SERGEANT, in his Journal, gives the following Account.</p>
            <q>

               <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> met the <hi>Committee</hi>; who diſcours'd with them, informing them of the Intention of the <hi>Government,</hi> and the Deſign of their coming up; reminding them of what was agreed upon in the Winter, telling them how far they had proceeded already: for they had, before they came up, agreed with all the Proprietors in thoſe Parts from whence they came; and had got 12 or 14 Rights to diſpoſe of to them. After this Lieutenant <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> ſpake to the following Purport. That he was very ſenſible of the unhappy Circumſtances of his former Life, and of the miſerable State of his <hi>Nation</hi>; who, being brought up in the greateſt Ignorance and Vice, were Objects of Pity: And that he was alſo ſenſible of their great Obligations to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the Notice that had been taken of them; and very thankful for their Care of them, in providing for their Inſtruction in the Knowledge of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and taking Care to have their Children taught to read, and for their being brought up in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion: And ſaid, that for his Part, he was ſo fully ſenſible of theſe Things, that the Conſideration of them had ſome Times almoſt drawn Tears from his Eyes: and that, as for himſelf, he thought his Eyes were now open'd, and was well ſatisfied of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, ſo far as he underſtood it; tho' poſſibly he might be miſtaken; and was only ſorry he'd had ſo little Opportunity to be inſtructed; wiſh'd it had been his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have been brought up in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, as he hop'd it would be of his Children; for he wiſh'd the ſame Care that had been taken, might be continu'd: Yea, 'twas his Deſire, that their whole Tribe might be brought into the ſame Way they were in. However, there were two or three Things, which appear'd dark in his Eyes. He wonder'd they had been neglected ſo long, and deſir'd to know the true Spring of the great Favour, ſo ſuddenly ſhown them. If it was from Love and good Will towards them, he, for his Part, accepted it with all Thankfulneſs: But, poſſibly, there might be ſome ſecret Spring, and moving Cauſe, he was not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, that might leſſen their Obligations to Gratitude. And what ſtill more ſtumbled him was that Major <hi>Pumroy,</hi> when he was here laſt Winter, aſk'd them ſeveral Queſtions, about the Proprietors of ſeveral Tracts of Land, and ſo inſiſted upon
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:007023_0054_102AEAAEE7CE3B38"/>
it to know who they were, and how they came by their Titles, that he was ready to conceive, the Major ſuſpected they had no Title at all to the Lands they challenged. If any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man queſtion'd them in this Point, they were not able, without much Trouble in ſending for Friends, and providing Witneſſes, to ſatisfy him: Or, if any one ſhould inſiſt upon any Thing more than the Teſtimony of living Witneſſes, he confeſs'd they could prove no Title at all. However, their Titles were good, according to their Law and Cuſtom in ſuch Caſes.</p>
               <p>And another Thing, he could not but wonder at, was, that if the Chriſtian Religion was ſo true and good, as he eſteem'd it to be, how there ſhould be ſo many Profeſſors of it, that liv'd ſuch vicious Lives, and ſo contrary to what he was told, were the Rules of it.</p>
               <p>This is the Subſtance of what he ſaid, which he ſpake with the greateſt Earneſtneſs.</p>
               <p>Col. <hi>Stoddard</hi> anſwer'd him; informing him, what was the Pretence of the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlers of <hi>America,</hi> with Reſpect to the <hi>Propagation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among the <hi>Natives</hi> of the Country; and what is contain'd in the <hi>Charter</hi> of this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> reſpecting that Matter: And told him what had been done formerly to <hi>chriſtianize</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi>; particularly by the famous Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi>; and what Succeſs had attended thoſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; and what is now doing in diverſe Parts of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>: That the <hi>Government</hi> had always been ready to promote the <hi>Goſpel's Propagation</hi> among them: That many Attempts had been made, with but too little Succeſs: but as ſoon as ever it was known, that the <hi>Indians at Houſatunnuk</hi> had a favourable Opinion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, Care was taken to have them inſtructed. It was their Good, and that only, that was ſought after. And, whatever their Enemies might inſinuate to the contrary, this was the Spring of what was now doing for them.—As for the Difficulty which aroſe from what Major <hi>Pumroy</hi> had ſaid, he anſwer'd for himſelf, that is was not beccuſe he, in the leaſt doubted of their Titles to their Lands, (which he look'd upon as good) that he enquir'd, who own'd this and that Tract, and how they came by their Titles, but that it was only to gratify his own Curioſity to know their Laws and Cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:007023_0055_102AEAB076AD0648"/>To the third Difficult the Colonel anſwer'd, that it was indeed a ſhameful Thing; but ſprung from the Corruption of Men's Hearts, and not from any Detect in the Rules of Living.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ſpake again, and ſaid; perhaps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Land was in great Meaſure given them, there might hereafter ſome Contention ariſe between their Children and ours; and that ours would look upon themſelves to have a Superiority over theirs, becauſe the Land was given them.</p>
               <p>He deſir'd therefore to know, how their Titles would be aſcertain'd; and what Security they could have, that their Children would be free.</p>
               <p>To this the Col. anſwer'd, that they would have their Titles in the ſame Manner that all the People in the <hi>Government</hi> had; that therefore they had no more Reaſon to fear, that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would be taken againſt them, than any Body elſe: that the ſame Laws which protected others, in their Properties, would protect them: That there were Laws made peculiarly in Favour of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which they would have the Benefit of: that what will be, none can certainly tell, but, from what has been, we may reaſonably hope, that the ſame Favour will be continu'd. But after all, they would be entirely at their Liberty, as much as they were then, either to go away, or to tarry there, if they had a Mind to.</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> expreſs'd his Satisfaction in what had been ſaid, and added that, for his own Part, he was ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſatisfy'd of the Truth and Excellency of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, that he would chearfully die for it. And after they had diſcours'd a While upon Religion in general, they were diſmiſ'd; very much to the Satisfaction of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Committee</hi> met with much Difficulty from the Men that were ſettled above the Mountain; but at Length ſound Means, whereby they were made pretty eaſy.—They therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in their Buſineſs, laid out the Townſhip, which now goes by the Name of <hi>Stockbridge</hi>; and, if I miſtake not proportion'd the Meadow-Land, which they had got for the <hi>Indians.</hi> But, ſome yet remain'd in the Hands of the Proprietors, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Indians</hi> were put into the Poſſeſſion of: tho' it coſt
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007023_0056_102AEAB268D4B2A0"/>
the <hi>Committee,</hi> and Mr. SERGEANT too, a great deal of Trouble, before they could ſatisfy and remove the Owners.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi> had formerly given to <hi>Jehoiakim Vanvalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enbeurgh,</hi> a <hi>Dutch Man,</hi> his ſpecial Friend, 40 Acres of Land in this Great-Meadow, and about 250 of Upland adjoining to it; which he now held. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a little after, being reduc'd, he was oblig'd to ſell. Some Gentlemen therefore bought him out, and gave the Land to the <hi>Indians,</hi> an Equivalent of the unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Lands being given them by the <hi>General Aſſembly.</hi> So that the whole Meadow was in a little Time poſſeſt by the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> the <hi>Committee</hi> confer'd again with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and inform'd them what they had done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting their Townſhip; ſhew'd them a Plan of it; deſir'd to know of them, if they would have any Thing alter'd. The <hi>Indians</hi> replied that they were very well ſatisfied with what was done, and very thankful for it.</p>
            <p>In the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> all ſettled in their new Town; were greatly pleas'd with it. Two new Families were added to their Number. <q>They gave very much into <hi>Huſbandry,</hi> (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) planted more this Year than ever they did before, by three Times at leaſt.—Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> lodges at Capt. <hi>Kunkapot</hi>'s, has a very numerous School, and a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Taſk of it; lives a very loneſome Life; is indeed inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in his Buſineſs; and no Body deſerves more of the Publick than he.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Committe,</hi> upon their firſt Viſitation of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> had finiſh'd their Buſineſs with them, the Time for geting Sugar was come.</p>
            <p>Therefore (<hi>March</hi> the firſt) they all went into the Woods, with their Familes, upon that Buſineſs; expecting to fellow it about ſix Weeks. They went in two Companies, about Half with the <hi>Captain</hi> above the Mountain, the Reſt with the <hi>Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> below. Mr. SERGEANT was loth they ſhould be ſo long without Inſtruction, and therefore concluded that he would go with one of the Companies, and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> with the other, and live with them during that Seaſon.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Indians</hi> had been out two Days, and prepar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs Houſes, they ſent in two young Men, one to Conduct
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007023_0057_102AEAB3FB4687B0"/>
Mr. SERGEANT to the <hi>Captain's</hi> Houſe, and the other to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> to the <hi>Lieutenant's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After they had been out about three Weeks, Mr. SERGEANT and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> chang'd their Quarters; Mr. SERGEANT went to the <hi>Lieutenant's</hi> Company, and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> to the <hi>Captain's,</hi> endeavouring that the <hi>Indians</hi> might have equal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from their Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>During theſe ſix Weeks, Mr. SERGEANT ſpent his Time very agreably among the <hi>Indians,</hi> being employ'd, in the Day Time, in teaching the Children to read; and in the Evening he taught the <hi>Indians</hi> to ſing, in which they took great Delight. He pray'd with them Morning and Evening, in their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſaid Grace before, and after Meat, in the ſame. He alſo preach'd to them on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> by an Interpreter, and pray'd in their own Language; which he began to do on <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 18th, and continu'd it ever after. For they being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that Prayers might be made in their own Language, Mr. SERGEANT (by the Aſſiſtance of Interpreters) had compos'd Prayers for ſuch Occaſions, in the <hi>Indian</hi> Language. The Snow now was about a Foot and Half deep in thoſe Woods, and the Weather cold. A Deer-ſkin with the Hair on, ſpread upon ſome Spruce Boughs, and a Blanket ſpread upon that, was his Bed; and three Blankets ſpread over him was his Covering; where he ſlept very well. And tho' their Diet was low, yet it was cleanly and well dreſs'd, by the <hi>Captain's</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant's</hi> Wives. Their Drink was Water. He had a good Appetite, eat heartily, and was in very good Health, all the Time he was in the Wilderneſs with them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I was (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) treated very well, while I was with them; and learn'd more of their Manners, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, than ever I had before.—They are altogether without Compliments, in their Treatment one of another. Children ſhew no Sort of Deference to their Parents, either in Word or Carriage, more than to any Body elſe. They are very modeſt, and the Women and Children baſhful. They are kind one to another, and make every Body welcome, in their Way, that comes to their Houſes. When a Stranger comes into one of their Houſes, he does it, as if it were his own, and, without any Compliments at all, ſits down with
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007023_0058_102AEAB6225AB550"/>
the Reſt; but ſays nothing. The Houſe-Keeper immediately offers him ſome Victuals, which he receives as tho' he were at Home; eats freely, and then begins to talk; to tell his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or to relate a Piece of News; but will enter, before he has eat, into no Diſcourſe. Some Times, when Friends meet, they ſay to one another. O! Brother or Couſin; or uſe ſome ſuch Word expreſſing ſome Relation. But they have Terms expreſſive of more particular, and quire different Relations from any we uſe. Their Children, born of the ſame Parents, ſtand in three Relations to one another; the eldeſt calling all the younger, whether Brothers or Siſters, <hi>Nheeſumuk.</hi> The elder Siſters are to the younger, whether Brothers, or Siſters, <hi>Nmeſuk.</hi> The younger Children call the elder Brothers, <hi>Netokbannut.</hi> And there are other like relative Terms, to which there are none in our Language Synonymous. And indeed their Language, ſo far as I perceive as yet, is extremely different from all the European Languages that I have any Acquaintance with, and ſeems, as far as I can judge, in the Genius, Phraſeology, and Pronunciation, of the Words (which abound with Gutturais) to be moſt like the Language of the Eaſt: tho' I confeſs, I am as yet a very incompetent Judge.</p>
               <p>Their Women have a Cuſtom (which is, for ought I know, peculiar to the aboriginal <hi>Americans,</hi> for they tell me it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all <hi>North-America</hi> at leaſt) <hi>viz.</hi> Their Girls, at the firſt flux of (their Menſes, ſeperate themſelves from all Society, live alone in the Woods; ſome fourteen, ſome twenty, and ſome forty Days; muſt do no Work at all, nor be ſeen by any Man for it is reckon'd <hi>ominous</hi> for a Man to ſee them in their Seperation. They cut off their Hair when they go out. And ſome of their Women go out afterwards, at the Return of their Terms, and ſtay three or four Days.—What they mean by this Cuſtom, or whence they deriv'd it, I cannot tell.</p>
            </q>
            <p>About the Time the <hi>Indians</hi> ſettled in their new Town, Mr. SERGEANT went to <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> and was there detain'd by Sickneſs; ſo that he was abſent from them two Sabbaths. He took Care to inform the <hi>Indians</hi> of his Sickneſs, who expreſs'd a great deal of Concern for him; enquir'd by all Opportunities after him, and ſaid if he ſhould die it would be a great Loſs to them: But
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007023_0059_102AEAB88D5C2698"/>
if it ſhould be ſo, they hop'd God would provide them another Miniſter. At his Return, they ſhew'd great Joy &amp; Satisfaction, that he was recover'd and reſtor'd to them Again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 23d. He preach'd to them in their new Settlement, but liv'd not among them as their School-Maſter did, but kept ſtill at his Lodgings about five Miles below.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>June</hi> 12. A Meſſenger came from <hi>Hudſon'-River,</hi> to call the <hi>Indians</hi> thither, to conſider of a <hi>Murder</hi> committed by one of their <hi>Tribe.</hi> The <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant</hi> went upon that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had Opportunity, while they were gone, to ſee and converſe with many of the principal <hi>Indians</hi>; ſpent almoſt all their Time in Diſcourſe with them upon the Subject of Religion; and told Mr. SERGEANT when they return'd, that all they talk'd with, had favourable Thoughts of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion; own'd that they themſelves were in a wrong Way, and ſaid they believ'd they were ſerving the <hi>Devil</hi>: And not one objected any Thing againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but ſeveral ſaid they would come with their Families, and be inſtructed.</p>
            <p>On the 27th of <hi>June</hi> Mr. SERGEANT baptiz'd a Child, which being mention'd in his Journal, he proceeds to ſay.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And now the whole Number that I have baptiz'd is 52. The Number of <hi>Indians</hi> now reſiding here is upwards of 90; and it is highly probable, if God affords us the Bleſſing he has done, we ſhall have here, in a few Years, ſome Hundreds of Indians.</p>
               <p>From the imperfect View of the Matter, one may have from this Journal, it will I believe appear, that the Hand of God has been remarkably in the Affair. But I am not able, in Writing, to communicate the ſame View of Things, that I have from obſerving the whole from Step to Step. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the groſs Darkneſs the <hi>Indians</hi> were brought up in, with the great Oppoſition the Goſpel has met with, not only from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> but from ſome alſo, who have the Name of Chriſtians, I am ſurpriz'd at the Progreſs it has ſo ſuddenly made among them. A very remarkable Reformation appears, more, and more, in their Manners; their Hearts ſeem really to be engag'd; and Vice, eſpecially Drunkenneſs (the Vice they are all addicted to) begins to be a great Diſgrace among them. I am not able to converſe much with them in their own
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:007023_0060_102AEABA77C28558"/>
own Language, tho' underſtand a great deal they ſay; and Religion is the Subject of frequent Converſation among them. Our <hi>Dutch</hi> Interpreter tells me he is ſurpriz'd to hear ſome of them talk, ſo ſenſibly as they do about Religion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>When Mr. SERGEANT was at <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> in the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> he receiv'd a Letter from Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 21. giving him an Account of a generous Offer Mr. <hi>Iſaac Hollis</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had made him, of dieting, cloathing, lodging, and inſtructing 20 <hi>Indian</hi> Boys at his own Coſt.</p>
            <p>This is the Gentleman to whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> wrote, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Miſſion at <hi>Honſatunnuk</hi> to his Generoſity; of which he inform'd Mr. SERGEANT in his Letter of <hi>June</hi> 18th 1735. inſerted, in Page 30 &amp; 31. And in Anſwer to the Letter of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, he makes this generous Offer.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> who was wiſe and prudent, thought it not beſt to draw upon Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> until he ſhould be well inform'd, what the Charge of maintaining 20 Scholars would amount to, in one Year; for he was apprehenſive that it would riſe higher, than the Donor expected. And therefore wrote to Mr. <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iams</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> and to Mr. SERGEANT, for their Thoughts upon the Matter; and alſo conſulted Governor <hi>Belcher</hi>; and, upon the beſt Computation they could make, concluded, that the Expence of one Child, in a Year, would ariſe to <hi>twenty five Pounds</hi> our Currency, and the whole to <hi>five Hundred Pounds</hi> per Annum. Of this Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> inform'd Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>; and it prov'd as the Doctor expected. It exceeded what Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> tho't of. He therefore reduc'd the Number of Scholars to 12; and propos'd to ſupport that Number from Year to Year.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Time, the honourable <hi>Samuel Holden,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; of <hi>London,</hi> directed the Rev. Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> to beſtow <hi>one Hundred Pounds</hi> of his Money for the Benefit of the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> which Mr. SERGEANT, with Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Approbation, thought beſt to expend for the Benefit of the <hi>Females</hi>; ſeeing Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Donation was confin'd to the <hi>Males.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe noble, and generous Inſtances of Liberality, Mr. SERGEANT inform'd the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were much affected with them, and very thankful to their pious Benefactors. And, as a grateful Acknowledgment of the Benefits they had receiv'd from the honourable <hi>Corporation</hi> at Home, they wrote the following Letter.</p>

                  <p>And, from the ſmall Meaſure of Knowledge we have, (being now as it were juſt wak'd out of Sleep) we are ſo ſenſible of the Benefit of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that we wiſh, and pray, that our <hi>whole Nation</hi> may be brought into the ſame Way.

                  <p>We are at a great Diſtance from you, and ſhall never ſee your Faces in this World; but hope it will be our Happineſs, thro' the Riches of divine Grace in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to rejoice with you in Heaven, our Father's Houſe.</p>

            <p>In a Letter of <hi>July</hi> 11th. His Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher</hi> ſays to Mr. SERGEANT <q>—I deſire you ta greet my Children at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> in the kindeſt Manner from me, and let them know, I ſhall be heartily glad to ſee them at <hi>Boſten,</hi> with <hi>Corſlar</hi> their chief Sachem,—1 hope to ſee you with your People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly Mr. SERGEANT, and a Number of the <hi>Stockbridge Indians,</hi> with about as many Strangers from <hi>Hudſon-River,</hi> went to <hi>Boſton.</hi> And <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5th they waited upon the <hi>Governor &amp; CounciL.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> (ſays Mr. SERGEANT,) made a Speech, in which he, in the Name of the Reft, expreſs'd great Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for the Kindneſs the <hi>Goverment</hi> had beſtow'd upon them already, particularly in granting them a Townſhip, for the Conveniency of their living together. And in Return gave up their Challenge to two Miles of Land, one Mile on each Side the Road from <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> to <hi>Weſtfield.</hi>—Pray'd for the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Government</hi> in building a <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> and <hi>School-Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the Governor anſwer'd very kindly, that the <hi>Government</hi> was well pleas'd with the Inclination they had ſhewn to receive the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus chriſt</hi>; and ſo long as that good Diſpoſition remain'd, would not repent the Care and Charge they had been at to accommodate them for their better Inſtruction in the Way of Life; hop'd they would go on and anſwer our Hopes &amp; Expectations from their good Beginning, and they ſhould never want the Favour of the <hi>Government</hi>; that they accepted very kindly the Land they gave up their Challenge to; that he would make known to the <hi>General Court,</hi> their Deſire reſpecting a <hi>Meeting</hi> and <hi>School-Houſe,</hi> at their next Seſſion.</p>
               <p>Then they made a Preſent of Skins; which the <hi>Governor</hi> was pleas'd to order to be ſold, and the Money to be laid out
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007023_0063_102AEAC0C3CC1778"/>
in Books for me: which, with other Inſtances of His <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leney</hi>'s Generoſity to me, I retain a moſt grateful Senſe of; and as it ſprings from the Relation I ſtand in to this People, it is a Proof of His <hi>Excellency</hi>'s great Piety, and Concern to promote the Knowledge, and Practice, of Religion &amp; Virtue, and ſo I ſhall ever eſteem myſelf ſo much the more bound to be faithful in my Buſineſs.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>From <hi>Weſtfield</hi> to <hi>Sheffield</hi> Bounds is about 26 Miles, the Land therefore which theſe <hi>Indians</hi> gave up their Challenge to is 52 ſquare Miles, and ſhould be eſteem'd no inconſiderable Return for the Favour beſtow'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6th. Mr. SERGEANT and the <hi>Indians</hi> din'd with the <hi>Governor</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> were curteouſly treated, and receiv'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ol Guns, Blankets, Shirts, &amp;c. Soon aſter which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd Home, well pleas'd with the Treatment they had met with. And tho' there were ſome Difficulties attending the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> particularly reſpecting their Lands, not yet got wholly out of the Proprietors Hands, yet, in the general, Things went well; the <hi>Indians</hi> increas'd in Knowledge and Number, new Families, and particular Perſorns, coming to them from Time to Time, to live there and be inſtructed. And the <hi>Indians</hi> in general behav'd well. But about the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſome of them went to a <hi>Kentikaw,</hi> or Dance, at <hi>Squampaumuk,</hi> (a Place about 25 Miles diſtant from <hi>Stockbridge</hi>; in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Country) where, being encompaſſed with Temptations, ſome of them drank to Exceſs, which was Cauſe of great Grief to Mr. SERGEANT, and they themſelves were fill'd with Shame and Confuſion of Face when they came Home.</p>
            <p>Mr. SERGEANT, who had hitherto liv'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, below the Mountain, in <hi>January</hi> 1736, 7. mov'd up into the <hi>Indian</hi> Town, and liv'd with Mr <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> who had built an Houſe, and brought Home a Wife, &amp;c. Mr. SERGEANT there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was no longer under a Neceſſicy of living at ſuch a Diſtance from his People.—</p>
            <p>When His Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher,</hi> according to his Promiſe of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 5th to the <hi>Indians,</hi> recommended it to the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> to build them a <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> and <hi>School-Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> granted it: as appears from a Paſſage in Colonel <hi>Staddard</hi>'s Letter to Mr. SERGEANT.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:007023_0064_102AEAC29ACFC500"/>
               <q>The <hi>General Court</hi> (ſays the <hi>Colonel</hi>) have ordered; That a <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> of thirty Feet broad, and forty long, together with a <hi>School-Houſe,</hi> be built for the <hi>Indians,</hi> at the Charge of the <hi>Province.</hi> And <hi>You</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> with <hi>Myſelf,</hi> are appointed to ſee theſe Things effected.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As Mr. SERGEANT had, by the Help of Interpreters, before this, tranſlated ſome Prayers into the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, for their daily uſe; ſo now he had tranſlated Dr. <hi>Watt</hi>'s firſt Catechiſm into the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue, that the Children might underſtanding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read and learn it. Some Things, about this Time, appear'd with a diſcouraging Aſpect, and gave Mr. SERGEANT much Trouble; the Principal of which was, that one of their <hi>Dutch</hi> Neighbours, not only refus'd to give up his Right for an Equivalent, which made the <hi>Indians</hi> uneaſy; but alſo kept a Store of <hi>Rum</hi> by him, of which he either gave or ſold to the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſo that ſome of them drank to Exceſs, and were very troubleſome. But this was Matter of Grief to moſt of them, eſpecially to the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> who exerted themſelves to correct ſuch Diſorders; and the <hi>Indians,</hi> in general, behav'd well. New Families were, from Time to Time, added to their Number. And there were frequent Inſtances of Mr. SERGEANT's baptizing Perſons, who, upon careful Examination, he found knowing in the Principles of Religion, and ſeriouſly reſolv'd to walk by the excellent Rules of it.</p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> went out this Seaſon, as uſual, to make Sugar, yet they return'd from their Work every Week, and attended the publick Worſhip on the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> They alſo diſcover'd an Inclination to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cuſtoms. For a couple, who were about marrying, enter'd their Intentions of it, or made them known to Mr. SERGEANT, who, upon the two ſollowing Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, publiſh'd the Bands of Matrimony between <hi>Naukuchewat,</hi> and <hi>Wauwoonemeen,</hi> and then married them by a Form tranſlated into the <hi>Indian</hi> Language.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Mr. SERGEANT began to preach to the <hi>Indians</hi> in their <hi>own Language,</hi> and in Proceſs of Time became ſo perfect in it, that the <hi>Indians</hi> were wont to ſay, <hi>Our Miniſter ſpeaks our Language better than we do our ſelves.</hi> And as it coſl him a great deal of Pains to make himſelf Maſter of it; ſo it was no ſmall Advantage to him, when he was able to uſe it
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007023_0065_102AEAC47AF8A630"/>
freely, in Coverſation with the <hi>Indians.</hi> For he was not only able, better to acquaint himſelf with the religious Sentiments of thoſe? who would make a Proſeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; but alſo to converſe with Strangers upon religious Subjects, when they came to viſit their Brethren at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> or when he had Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Mr. SARGEANT, about this Time, baptiz'd ſeveral Perſons. And that the Reader may know, what Pains he took to inform the Candidates in the Principles or Chriſtianity; and to ſatisfy himſelf that they underſtood them, and that it was their ſerious Purpoſe and Reſolution to live a religious Life; I ſhall here tranſcribe, from his Journal, the conciſe Account he gives of his Treatment of them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord-Day, Auguſt</hi> 14th. A large Auditory.—I preach'd in <hi>Indian. Yokun</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> propos'd themſelves to <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Both Perſons of good Behaviour, and apparently well diſpos'd to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> The Man had been a Drinker; but ſeem'd now to be reform'd: the Woman always appear'd innocent, and virtuouſly inclin'd. I took a great deal of Pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in the Principles of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and to impreſs upon their Minds a ſtrong Senſe of Religion, and to compoſe them to Seriouſneſs. And, having good Satisfaction of their Knowledge and good Inclimation, <hi>Lord's-Day, Auguſt</hi> 21. I baptiz'd <hi>Tokum,</hi> his Wiſe, and three Children.—This <hi>Week, Umpaumut's</hi> Son, <hi>Pmaupauſoo</hi> by Name, from the Iſland in <hi>Hudſon's River,</hi> where his Father was a Chief, who had been here a little While, deſir'd Baptiſm, as alſo <hi>Nomſboos,</hi> who about a Year before came from the <hi>Shouwoncos</hi> Country. I took Pains to inſtruct them particularly, in the Principles of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> They were both young, I was therefore the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for them that they ſhould be well inſtructed and have their Minds impreſt with a due Seriouſneſs and Concern, in what they were about: I therefore choſe to deſer their Baptiſm a little longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, August</hi> 28th, Auditory as uſual.—This Week took a ſecond, and third Opportunity, to inſtruct the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for Baptiſm, when another young Man alſo appear'd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firous of Baptiſm; <hi>Ukhibnauwequn</hi> by Name,—This Week
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007023_0066_102AEAC69CDE59B0"/>
I took a great deal of Pains to prepare the Candidates for Baptiſm. They appear'd very deſirous of it, and ſeem'd to underſtand the Doctrines of Religion well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, September</hi> 14th. I baptiz'd them.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>Mr. SERGEANT had been inform'd, that the <hi>Indians</hi> living at <hi>Kaunaumeek,</hi> a Place about 18 Miles from <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> to the N. W. were deſirous that he ſhould come and preach to them. He therefore ſent a Meſſenger, informing them, that <hi>Lord's-Day, September</hi> 11th he would be with them. And in his Journal of that Day ſays.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I preach'd at <hi>Kaunaumeek.</hi> I had about 30 Hearers. There were but few <hi>Indians</hi> that properly belong'd there but they gave Notice of my coming to all that liv'd near them; ſo that a conſiderable Number were got together. Some of the Chief of our <hi>Indians</hi> bore me Company. I had prepar'd a Sermon in <hi>Indian</hi> for the Occaſion. They heard me with great Attention, and ſaid they underſtood me.</p>
               <p>We were entertain'd very kindly: The chief Man there whoſe Name was <hi>Aunauwauneekbbeek,</hi> appear'd to be a rational judicious Man. He can ſpeak a little Engliſh, and carries on ſome farming Buſineſs, and lives well. I aſk'd him before I came away; what he thought of what he had heard? He ſaid he could not give any Judgment yet; for he had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inform'd himſelf. <hi>Christianity</hi> might be true; he could not pronounce againſt it, nor could he ſay it was right but added, that he ſhould come to hear me ſometimes at <hi>Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatunnuk,</hi> and inform himſelf further.</p>
               <p>I was well pleas'd with his Anſwer, and exhorted him to enquire further into the Matter; and not to forget to pray to God to inſtruct him.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Indians</hi> that were with me took Pains to perſuade them to embrace the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and endeavour'd to anſwer thoſe Objections they ſuppos'd might ariſe in their Minds againſt it; particularly the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> talk'd a great deal, and very well, upon the Subject.</p>
               <p>Another Man there, of ſome Character, and of good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, who had been baptiz'd in his Infancy, by ſome Priest, was well inclined to Religion; and purpos'd to come and live with us.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:007023_0067_102AEAC972FE2F18"/>A little more than a Month after this, <hi>viz. Lord's-Day, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober</hi> the 9th, the two principal <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Kaunaumeek</hi> were at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and heard Mr. SERGEANT preach. <q>—took Oppor unity (ſays he) to diſcourſe with them both, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly with the <hi>Chief,</hi> who now was free to own that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion was true, and that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to be a <hi>Christian.</hi> And added, that he had receiv'd ſuch an Impreſſion on his Mind, from what he had heard from me, and otherwiſe, of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, that he could not ſhake it off; that his Thoughts had been much fix'd upon the Matter; that, even in the Purſuit of his common Buſineſs, the could not but entertain himſelf with Reflections of this Nature. The other appear'd to be fully determin'd to come and live with us.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> 16th. Preach'd as uſual. This Week I went upon a Viſit to my Friends in <hi>New-Jerſey.</hi> In the mean Time the <hi>Chief</hi> of the <hi>Kaunaumeek Indians</hi> came hither, in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee me, and hear ſome further Inſtructions in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>Christianity</hi>; and tarried about a Week: ſeem'd much affected with what he heard of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, and very deſirous of further Inſtruction; purpos'd to come again when he could hear of my Return.</q>
            <p>That I may here finiſh the Story of theſe two principal <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Kaunaumeek viz. Aunauwauneekbbeek</hi> and <hi>Wautaunkumeet.</hi> I ſhall look forward to <hi>January</hi> 22. <hi>February</hi> 12, and <hi>April</hi> 16. 1738.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord's-Day, January</hi> 22d. I preach'd again at <hi>Kaunaumeek, Aunauwauneekbbeek</hi> the principal Man there appear'd to be mightily engag'd in Matters of Religion; was deſirous of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; ſent his Daughter, an only Child, to learn to read; came himſelf and tarried all the Week. And I, having good Satisfaction of his Knowledge and Faith, baptiz'd him and his Daughter.—</p>
               <p>

            </q>
            <p>The generous Propoſal of Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> to maintain 12 Boys, was not till now put in Execution. And what Mr SERGEANT ſays of it in his Journal is.</p>
            <q>
               <hi>January</hi> 11th 1737, 8. I began to keep the 12 <hi>Indian</hi> Boys on Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Foundation. I took them into my own Houſe, and under my Inſtruction.</q>
            <p>It was in the Spring of the Year 1736 when the Rev. Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> receiv'd from Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> the Offer of maintaining 20 Scholars at <hi>Houſatunnuk.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Caution in the Affair, mention'd before, delay'd the coming of the Money till the Spring of the Year 1737. Some Time alſo was taken up in getting their Cloaths from <hi>Boſton,</hi> making of them up, &amp;c. And even then there was no Houſe in <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi>'s, which was ſmall. Mr. SERGEANT therefore, who was building this Summer, and intending to take the Boys under his own Inſtruction, tho't beſt to put it off, till his own Houſe could be prepar'd to receive them. And accordingly, having prepar'd it, hir'd a Houſe Keeper; and, at the Time above mention'd, he tool them in.</p>
            <p>It is probable, his Houſe would have been ready for their Reception ſooner, if he had not been in Want of Money to forward the building of it.</p>
            <p>His Salary was no more than <hi>One Hundred and fifty Pounds</hi> our Money, <hi>twenty-ſeven Shillings and ſix Pence</hi> of which was then equal to one Ounce of Silver. And, by Reaſon of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scarcity, all Proviſions were very dear. Little or Nothing could therefore be ſpar'd from his Salary towards building.</p>
            <p>By a Letter of <hi>April</hi> 25. 1737. he inform'd the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of his being about to build; deſiring ſome Aſſiſtance from them to defrey the Charge of it. In Anſwer to which the honourable <hi>Adam Winthrop</hi> inform'd him, that he would ſay his Letter before the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at their next Meeting, which would not be very ſoon, for they lately met. And in one Letter of <hi>July</hi> 30. and in another of <hi>September</hi> 8. The Secretary Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> inform'd him that the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> had not yet met.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:007023_0069_102AEACC9B25E7C8"/>But <hi>April</hi> the 6. 1738. he writes thus to Mr. SERGEANT. <q>I laid before the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> your Letter for ſome Allowance toward your building, and they voted <hi>fifty Pounds</hi> to be paid you on that Account.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the Sum, granted by the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> did not anſwer his Expectations, not amounting to <hi>ten Pounds Sterling,</hi> ſo neither was it ſufficient to relieve his Neceſſities; for he, before this, was neceſſitated to run himſelf much into Debt: As he informs Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> in a Letter of <hi>June</hi> the 19th, in which he alſo ſays.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I was indeed extremely diſappointed in my Expectations, when I found by Mr. <hi>Secretary's</hi> late Letter to me, that the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> had voted me no more than <hi>fifty Pounds</hi> to aſſiſt me in my Settlement.—</p>
               <p>Upon the Reception of Col. <hi>Winthrop</hi>'s Letter, I Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately determin'd to apply myſelf to the <hi>General Court,</hi> not knowing where elſe to ſeek for Aſſiſtance. Whether or no they will think it their Buſineſs to help me, I cannot tell. However, I have put a Petition into Col. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s Hand, and by him wrote to the <hi>Governor</hi> with a great deal of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, praying for his Favour in the Matter. And I ſuppoſe the Colonel has put it forward. If I fail in that Point, I know not where I ſhall turn myſelf.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>General Assembly</hi> (which had all along encourag'd the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> and us'd their Endeavours to promote the Intereſt of Religion among them; not only by giving them a Townſhip of Land that they might ſettle together, and by being at great Charge, and Trouble, in removing the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, but alſo in building a Meeting and School-Houſe, which the Workmen began laſt <hi>August</hi>;) receiv'd, and granted Mr. SERGEANT's Petition; voted him <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> in Bills of the middle Tenor, which was equal to about <hi>ſix Hundred Pounds</hi> our preſent Money, at fifty Shillings per Ounce.</p>
            <p>His Excellency Governor <hi>Belcher,</hi> who upon all Occaſions diſcover'd a great Regard for Mr. SERGEANT, was very friendly to him upon this Occaſion; as appears from a Paſſage in his Letter of <hi>July</hi> 3d to Mr. SERGEANT.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have (ſays the <hi>Governor</hi>) read with much Satisfaction yours of 24th of <hi>May,</hi> which is full of the Gentleman, the Christian, and the Goſpel Miniſter; and therefore inclin'd me

            <p>Mr. SERGEANT, who had taken into his own Houſe, and under his own Inſtructions, Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

All whom he could perſuade to it he ſent abroad into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, where they were ſupported by Mr. <hi>Hollis's</hi> Bounty, and went to School, to perfect themſelves in Reading and Writing. And thoſe who refus'd going from Home, liv'd with their Parents, and went to Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi>'s School. To theſe Mr. SERGEANT allow'd no more of Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Bounty, than was ſufficient to cloath them. And it was found upon Tryal, that thoſe who liv'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, made much the beſt Progreſs in their Learning, beſide the Benefit of gaining the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language. The firſt Time that Mr. SERGEANT adminiſter'd the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to his People, was <hi>June</hi> 4th, of which he gave Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> the following ſhort Account, in a Letter of <hi>June</hi> 19th 1738.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The firſt <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> in this Month, we had the Communion of the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi> There were <hi>Eleven</hi> Communicants of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who attended the Ordinance with as much Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and apparent Devotion, as ever I obſerv'd in any People upon any Occaſion whatever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> had hitherto in general behav'd well, yet there had been divers Inſtances of <hi>baptiz'd</hi> Perſons exceeding the Bounds of Temperance. And the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> himſelf, who had appear'd ſo very much engag'd in the Chriſtian Religion, had Occaſion to humble himſelf for the Sin of <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> before he came to this Ordinance. <q>Which he did (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) with a due Appearance of Seriouſneſs, Gravity, and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of better Obedience for Time to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> upon Mr. SERGEANT's Deſire, ſupply'd the Communion Table with two Flagons, two Diſhes, and ſome Wine.</p>

            <p>
               <q>I had juſt row a Letter from Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Albany,</hi> lately arriv'd from <hi>London,</hi> with a Miſſion from the <hi>Society for propagating the Goſpel in foreign Parts,</hi> to the <hi>Mohawks</hi> Weſt of <hi>Albany</hi>; who tells me he has but a ſcanty Allowance (<hi>i. e. from the Society</hi>) and could obtain no Salary for an Interpreter, or School-Maſter: And that he has Thoughts of applying to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at <hi>Boſton</hi> for Aſſiſtance; but would have my Advice firſt. I cannot tell what Stock the <hi>Corporation</hi> has; but I ſuppoſe it is ſcanty, by the Allowances they afford their <hi>Miſſionaries.</hi> However, I could heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> to the Notice, and Favour of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners</hi>? He is a worthy Gentleman, and well deſerves En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in his Undertaking. And every Body, who has the leaſt Acquaintance with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and their Manners, muſt be very ſenſible, that tis a vain Thing to ſend Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries among them without ſupporting them well. There is no Part in the Biſhop's Character, more neceſſary in a Miſſionary among the <hi>Indians,</hi> than being <hi>given to Hoſpitality.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That the Reader may be ſenſible what a Proſpect there was of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s being eminently ſerviceable among the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> if he had been duly encouraged; I ſhall (aſking Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Pardon) ſhow by tranſcribing ſome Paſſages contain'd in his Letters to Mr. SERGEANT.

daily become more and more deſirous of Inſtruction; and would, in all Probability, make great Progreſs both in the Knowledge and Practice of Chriſtianity, were proper Methods taken to inſtruct them. But I labour under great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, for want of an Interpreter, ſo that I cannot tell what Progreſs they make in Knowledge, nor can I proceed regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my Inſtructions; and I almoſt deſpair of obtaining a perfect <hi>Knowledge</hi> of their Language, without the Aſſiſtance of an Interpreter, which could I but enjoy for the Space of two or three Years, I doubt not but that I ſhould be Maſter of it; and ſhould take greater Pleaſure and Satisfaction in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my Duty. Nevertheleſs, I have the Comfort of ſeeing a very great and daily Reformation of Manners among them, which indeed is the End of all our Endeavours.—I am almoſt amazed at the Progreſs the Youth make in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Writing, their own Language. All the young Men, from 20 to 30 Years, conſtantly attend School when at Home, and will leave a Frolick rather than miſs. Sundry of them write as good a Hand as myſelf <hi>(which was fair and good)</hi>—As to the Encouragement I have, for aught I ſee yet, I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my Reward in another World.

               <p>As for the <hi>Society,</hi> they have allowed me <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> for one Year: What further Encouragement they will give me, I know not. In the mean Time, I am at great Charges. My Board is <hi>six Shillings</hi> a Week, which is not above half my neceſſary Expence.</p>

            <p>In another Letter, a little more than two Years after he had taken Orders, dated <hi>Albany, Auguſt</hi> 21ſt 1740. he ſays,</p>
            <q>
               <p>I am ſatisfied, I ſhould have much greater Succeſs, if I had a <hi>School-Maſter</hi> and <hi>Interpreter.</hi> I had the Satisfaction, laſt <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> to preach to a Number of the <hi>Six-Nations,</hi> who came to this Town to treat with the <hi>Governor,</hi> who alſo was

preſent and has taken a great deal of Pains to countenance my Deſign. My <hi>Mohawk</hi> Congregation behav'd ſo well, that all the Auditory were exceedingly delighted.</p>
               <p>I aſſure you I have the Cauſe at Heart, and am well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of your Zeal; which, that it may increaſe, and meet with all imaginable Succeſs, and Encouragement, is the earneſt Prayer of, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Is it not manifeſt, from theſe Things, that Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a noble, generous, and Chriſtian Spirit, in giving himſelf to the Service of God among the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> that he might be an Inſtrument in the Hand of God, of reforming &amp; chriſtianizing them? And was not there a moſt encouraging Proſpect of his doing eminent Service, not only to the Souls of thoſe periſhing People, but alſo to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt?</p>
            <p>It is well known to us in this Part of the World, that the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> or <hi>Six-Nations,</hi> are a Terror to, and have in great Meaſure the Command of, all the <hi>Natives</hi> of <hi>North-America.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have therefore uſed their utmoſt Endeavours all along to engage them in their Intereſt; and by their Miſſionaries, who are conſtantly among them, they have drawn off many of them to ſettle at <hi>Canada,</hi> and more or leſs, every Year, go over to them; from whom, in Time of War with the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Provinces in <hi>North-America,</hi> eſpecially the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is alſo well known, that moſt of them remain in a State of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and that theſe of them, who pretend to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> know but very little of the Principles of Chriſtianity; for tho' Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> did what he could, while he was among them; ye it was but a few of them that a <hi>ſingle</hi> Perſon could inſtruct, and that very imperfectly, for want of an <hi>Interpreter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Circumſtances therefore loudly call for the compaſſionate Help of thoſe who are able to promote the <hi>Propagation of the Goſpel</hi> among them.— And here I would beg leave to ſay, the honourable <hi>Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts</hi> do, out of the Charity they are betruſted with, maintain <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> at <hi>Boſton, New-Port, Stratford,</hi> and are frequently ſending them to other Places, where their Pariſhioners are well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Fact: uncapable of Diſpute, that they wanted not Ability to help theſe poor Heathen.</p>
            <p>It is evident alſo from the foregoing Account, that Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> who ſhew'd a noble and excellent Spirit in his Diſpoſition to propagate the Goſpel among theſe <hi>Heathen,</hi> and to whom ſuch a wide Door open'd, and who was ſo well qualify'd for the Service, obtain'd from the <hi>Society</hi> but a ſcant Support for himſelf, and could obtain none for a <hi>School-Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Interpreter.</hi> Both <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> do certainly call for the moſt vigorous Endeavours to propagate the Goſpel among the <hi>Mohawks.</hi> And the Reader may eaſily judge, Whether the <hi>Society for propagating the Goſpel in foreign Parts</hi> (who have the Care and Diſpoſal of one of the nobleſt Charities that has ever been known) would not employ that <hi>Charity</hi> full as well, if not better, were thoſe Sums given to ſupport Miſſionaries among the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> where the Goſpel is not known, which are given to ſupport Miſſionaries in ſome of the <hi>principal Towns</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> where the Goſpel has been faithfully preach'd ever ſince they were firſt planted, and where thoſe of the Perſuaſion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are ſo numerous and wealthy, that they are well able to give their Miniſters an honourable Support, without the Help of the <hi>Society</hi> at Home? Whether the former would not be more agreable to the pious <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Donours,</hi> as well as to the <hi>proſeſs'd Ends</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> than the latter? Whether Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> who was ſo heartily engag'd in that excellent and ſelf denying Service of propagating the Goſpel among the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> ſhould not have been encourag'd by a plentiful Support from the <hi>Society,</hi> and alſo by the Support of a School-Maſter and Interpreter for his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, rather than a Miſſionary at <hi>Boſton, Newport,</hi> &amp;c? Who would it not grieve to think, that that good Gentleman has been oblig'd to leave that Service for want of Encouragement, when there was ſuch a Proſpect of his doing much Good among thoſe periſhing Nations? What other Reaſon Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> had for leaving them, I am not able to ſay; but if he had no other than the want of a ſufficient Support, and of an Interpreter, was not that Reaſon quite ſufficient? For how could he anſwer the Ends of his Miſſion under ſuch Diſadvantages?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:007023_0075_102AEAD978FFFEC8"/>I doubt not but the honourable <hi>Society</hi> act with Integrity, and Uprightneſs; and diſpoſe of the Charity in their Hands, in a Manner that appears right and beſt to them, according to the Information they have. Yet, at the ſame Time, I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that, if they were well acquainted with the true State of Things in this diſtant Part of the World, they would ſee juſt Cauſe to alter their Conduct. And I think the Rev.

            <p>If indeed the honourable <hi>Society</hi> judge it of greater Importance, more for the Honour of God, and the Good of Souls, more agreable to the Ends of their Charter, and the charitable Deſigns of the pious Donors, to convert thoſe of the <hi>Preſbyterian,</hi> or <hi>Congregational</hi> Perſuaſion, to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than thoſe poor periſhing <hi>Heathen</hi> to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, then it is not ſtrange that they ſhould employ the Money in their Hands as they at preſent do; but upon what Grounds they ſhould form ſuch a Judgment, is not eaſy to apprehend.</p>

ſome of the young Women abroad in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, as the beſt Way to acquaint them with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language and Manners.

But as I have been ſo great a Sharer in Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Bounty, I make no Account of it, nor deſire any Thing for it.</q>—</p>
            <p>The Deſign therefore of employing the Money for the Benefit of the young Women failing; and Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> being fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Mr. SERGEANT's Neceſſities, gave him the Money to aſſiſt him in his Settlement.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If you will take the ſaid <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> (<hi>ſays Dr. Colman in a Letter to Mr.</hi> SERGEANT) and uſe it for your preſent Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, you are welcome to it, as a Deodand to the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Goſpel, in your Settlement, Comfort, &amp; Strength, in the Work before you.—Mr. <hi>Holden</hi> has not only given me Leave, but even Wills it, that I aſſiſt you in the Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you. And if there open any Door for teaching ſome Girls in Womens Work, as was before propoſed, inform me of it, and draw upon me before the Year is out, for <hi>Fifty,</hi> or even an <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> more, and I will anſwer your Draught. However, Sir, aſk of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> as in Reaſon you ought, without Regard to this private Aſſiſtance.</q>—</p>
            <p>He alſo, by the honourable <hi>Jacob Wendell,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who viſited him at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> receiv'd a Preſent from the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration</hi> at Home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:007023_0077_102AD2B6D25632D8"/>
               <q>—By Col. <hi>Wendell</hi> (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) I receiv'd <hi>One Hundred Pound</hi> in Money; a kind and generous Preſent from the honourable <hi>Corporation</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; for which I thank God and them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About this Time, Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd from Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> a Legacy of <hi>Ten Pound,</hi> left him by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Clerk, late Miniſter of <hi>Kingſton</hi> in <hi>New-Hampshire</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>;) Miniſter of <hi>Exeter</hi> lately deceas'd (ſays Col. <hi>Winthrop</hi>)</p>
            <p>And from Time to Time Mr. SERGEANT was reliev'd, by conſiderable Preſents, from generous and well diſpos'd Perſons. And without the Helps I have mention'd, he could not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his Settlement at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> as every one will be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, who know that his Salary was but <hi>One Hundred &amp; fifty Pounds</hi> our Money, <hi>twenty ſeven Shillings and fix Pence</hi> of which was then equal to but one Ounce of Silver. Was it then poſſible that he ſhould ſpare one Shilling of this ſmall Sum towards the Charge of Building, &amp;c? Eſpecially conſidering he liv'd in a Place where all the Neceſſaries of Life muſt be purchaſed at a very dear Rate; and where his tender Heart could not but be mov'd to relieve the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> whoſe piteous Circumſtances daily pleaded for them, and were enough to move a Heart much harder than his.</p>
            <p>It was with a very grateful Spirit, both to God and his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, that Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd thoſe Donations. He eſteem'd every Kindneſs beſtow'd upon him on Account of his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> as a Favour from Heaven, a new Obligation upon him to be faithful in his Work, and a Talent for which he was <hi>accountable to the Lord of all</hi>; as in his Writings he frequently expreſs'd himſelf.</p>
            <p>He alſo uſed his beſt Endeavours to impreſs upon the Minds of the <hi>Indians</hi> a grateful Senſe of the Kindneſs of their Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; the Account of which ſeem'd very much to affect them. And at the cloſe of this Year they were laid under a new Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, by a generous Gift of <hi>three Hundred Pounds</hi> from the honourable <hi>Society</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Part of which was employ'd in purchaſing Ploughs, Axes, Hoes, &amp;c. to help them in carrying on their Huſbandry. How the Reſt of the Money was expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, does not appear from any of the Papers before me; but I find, by a Letter from Secretary <hi>Winthrop</hi> to Mr. SERGEANT,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007023_0078_102AEADD590BE168"/>
that he judg'd it not beſt that the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould have the whole Donation at once, but that it ſhou'd be gradually dealt out to them as their Circumſtances requir'd; which I therefore ſuppoſe was the Method taken, and that it was from Time to Time us'd to their beſt Advantage; and I am inclin'd to think, that it was principally, if not wholly, employ'd for their Encouragement in Huſbandry and Building, from a Paſſage in Governor <hi>Belcher</hi>'s Letter written to him on the Subject, <hi>December</hi> 5th 1738.<q>—I have talk'd with Mr. Secretary <hi>Winthrop</hi> (ſays His <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>) of the Diſpoſition of the Money come from the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Company</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> that it may be moſtly employ'd to promote Labour among your People, by giving them Huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Tools, as Axes, Carts, Ploughs, &amp;c. to aſſiſt in building <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſes: To <hi>civilize</hi> them will be a good Introduction to the <hi>Chriſtianizing</hi> of them. I ſhall again talk with Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Winthrop,</hi> and others of the <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> that this Method may be put in Practice without Delay.</q>—But after all it does not appear, that they ever receiv'd the whole; tho' it might be ſo, and Mr. SERGEANT make no mention of it.</p>
            <p>The former Part of <hi>June</hi> this Year, <hi>Ephraim Williams,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Mr. <hi>Josiah Jones,</hi> brought their Families to <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled there; being two of the four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, who, by Order of the <hi>General Court,</hi> were to ſettle there, for Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT's Comfort &amp; Benefit of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Brown,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Joseph Woodbridge,</hi> were the other, who came ſome Time after.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1739, ſeveral of the <hi>River-Indians,</hi> who liv'd at a Diſtance from <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> diſcover'd an Inclination to hear Mr. SERGEANT preach. Some came from diſtant Parts to <hi>Stockbridge</hi> for that End, others ſent for him to preach to them at the Place of their Abode. And Mr. SERGEANT fail'd not of improving all thoſe Opportunities to endeavour their ſpiritual Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 19th 1739. Mr. SERGEANT return'd from Abroad, and in his Journal ſays.</p>
            <q>
               <p>In the mean Time (that is, while he was abſent) there had been a Stranger here from near the <hi>Highlands,</hi> nam'd <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mauntiſſekun,</hi> on Purpoſe, as he ſaid, to hear me, who had been remarkably check'd in his former Courſe of <hi>Drinking.</hi>

                  <hi>Lord's-Day, April</hi> 22. Preach'd as uſual. Three Strangers preſent, who ſaid they came on Purpoſe to hear me preach. In the Evening they came to ſee me. I endeavour'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in ſeeking after God, and ſaid ſome Things to confirm them in Belief of the Being and Providence of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 27th. This Week came two young Men from <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> (a Town on the Weſt Border of <hi>Connecticut</hi>) to hear me preach: One ſaid he would come and live with us.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'June</hi> 3d. Theſe young Men were at Meeting.—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 10th. Preach'd as uſual. Preſent ſeven new Hearers from <hi>Kaunaumeek</hi> and the Neighbourhood, with <hi>Aunauwau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neekbbeek</hi> at the Head of them.—At the ſame Time they told me that the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Iſland were very deſirous that I would come and preach to them. I ſent Word by <hi>Aunauwauneekbbeek</hi> that I would, God willing, be at the <hi>Iſland</hi> the 23d of this Inſtant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 17th. Preach'd as uſual; preſent ſome Strangers, and among the Reſt <hi>Maumauntissekun</hi>—who came on Purpoſe to be inſtructed in the Affairs of Religion, and ſeem'd to be very deſirous of Inſtruction, and inclin'd to come &amp; live with us for that End. He is a Man of ſome Character among the <hi>Indians</hi>; and of a ſober and thoughtful Air. The next Day I had Opportunity to talk with him. I endeavour'd to ſhew him the Neceſſity and Importance of Religion, encourag'd him with Diligence and Prayer to enquire after the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 24th. According to their Deſire, lately ſent by <hi>Aunauwauneekbbeek,</hi> I preach'd to the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Iſland in <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River. I had an Auditory of about 30 intelligent Hearers, who gave good Attention, and ſeem'd well pleas'd, eſpecially ſome of them, with my Coming. The <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Kaunaumeek</hi> were there. Some of the <hi>Dutch</hi> People that liv'd by the River Side invited me to lodge with them while I ſhould ſtay, but the <hi>Indians</hi> would not conſent to it. <hi>Aunau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wauneekbbeek,</hi> in particular, ſaid he would have me lodge with them on the <hi>Iſland,</hi> that I might pray with them <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Morning.</hi>—I was entertain'd very kindly by the <hi>Indians,</hi>

With them I had a long Conference upon the Being, Perfections, and Providence of God; the Neceſſity of Revelation from him in order to inform us in his Will; the Truth and Excellency of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion as a <hi>Revelation</hi> from Heaven, and the like. Some approv'd of what I ſaid; but three or four ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves very averſe to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> A great many <hi>Dutch</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were preſent at the Service, to whom I preach'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi>: but their Behaviour was much more diſorderly than the <hi>Indians.</hi> And indeed by their Behaviour they ſeem'd to conſider the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi> rather as a Seaſon for <hi>Frolicing,</hi> than for <hi>religious</hi> Duties.</p>
               <p>26. I return'd. In the mean Time 10 <hi>Indians</hi> had been here from a Place below, called <hi>Wukbquautenauk,</hi> with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to hear me preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 1. Preſent at Meeting 17 Stranger, Men Women and Children, from <hi>Wukbquautenauk,</hi> including the to above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, who tarried all the Week paſt, that they might have Opportunity to hear me. They all came, as they ſaid, to inform themſelves in the Affair of Religion. I preach'd the ſame Diſcourſe I had prepar'd for, and deliver'd at the <hi>Iſland.</hi> After Service I diſcours'd with them privately, perſuading them in Favour of <hi>Christianity.</hi> They ſeem'd to think favourably of it; particularly one more than the Reſt. [N. B. <hi>Wuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quautenauk</hi> is in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> about 28 Miles below us.</p>
            </q>
            <p>By this Account it is evident, that there appear'd about this Time an uncommon Deſire in the neighbouring <hi>Indians</hi> to hear Mr. SERGEANT; but what Effect his Endeavours to ſerve them had, any further than is to be learn'd from the Account above, I am not able to ſay.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo here tranſcribe, from Mr. SERGEANT's Journal, ſome Account of the <hi>Indians</hi> ſending Belts of <hi>Wompum</hi> from one

And let us always teach our Children that which is good.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> had been inform'd that Mr. SERGEANT was about Marrying, and therefore ſays to him in a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tter of <hi>June</hi> 1ſt;</p>
               <p>As I know the Expence of ſettling yourſelf in a Dwelling, &amp;c. ſo it lies with you, Sir, now to command, as, and when you pleaſe. The Reſidue of the Money for the current Year is in Col. <hi>Winthrop</hi>'s Hands. At the ſame Time I do now ſend <hi>forty Pounds, twenty</hi> for yourſelf, and <hi>twenty</hi> for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Ephraim Williams,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> your worthy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, out of the Money of the honourable <hi>Samuel Holden,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>London,</hi> in my Hands. And it is his Pleaſure, I ſhould aſſiſt you in the Service you are labouring in. And it you have Need of further Aſſiſtance this Year, for <hi>yourself,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> be not backward, but timely in letting me know of it; and your Draught ſhall be anſwer'd to the Sum of an Hundred Pounds.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In anſwer to which, Mr. SERGEANT wrote <hi>July</hi> 17. as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>—Your Offer of Aſſiſtance to me, and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Money, is exceeding kind; the <hi>forty Pounds</hi> Capt. <hi>Williams</hi> brought us was very welcome. The Expence of ſettling ourſelves is indeed very great. You are ſenſible the Value of Bills is fallen conſiderable ſince our Salaries were granted. And tho' we are not in Circumſtances of diſtreſſing Want, yet ſuch Aſſiſtance as you offer would be very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. I covet not Wealth; but would gladly live as free as poſſible from the perplexing Cares of Life, that I may attend the proper Buſineſs of my Calling without Diſtraction, which truly requires the moſt prudent and diligent Application.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly, in a Letter to Mr. SERGEANT of <hi>November</hi> 10. the Doctor writes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I preſent to You and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge, eighty Pounds</hi> of Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Money, <hi>fifty Pounds</hi> for you, and <hi>thirty Pounds</hi> for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge.</hi>—If your Salary will not anſwer for the Support of your Family, you muſt tell the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> ſo by Mr. Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Winthrop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:007023_0084_102AEAE9469057F8"/>You need not let them know the Aſſiſtance added by me; that is but an occaſional Thing. You ought to have a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the <hi>Commiſſioner</hi>—What I've done for you and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> has hitherto pleas'd Mr. <hi>Holden</hi> well, and he adds his Prayers for you in every Letter, and has, I doubt not, your conſtant Thankſgiving to God for him, and Supplications on his Behalf, as he earneſtly deſires.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>It was with a humble and grateful Spirit that Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd theſe Donations. In his Letter to the <hi>Dotter,</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 17th he ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>In every Letter you write, I ſee more of your native Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Power of divine Grace, which has made you ſo great a Bleſſing; and may it long continue you ſuch. I bluſh to think how little I deſerve the good Opinion you are pleas'd to entertain of me; and how unworthy I am of the divine Bounty, and repeated Benefactions of Men of Charity, Partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the divine Nature. Pray for me that I may have Grace faithfully to uſe the Talents committed to my Truſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In another Letter of <hi>December</hi> 26th. <q>I receiv'd—the <hi>fifty Pounds</hi> you was pleas'd to preſent me with, out of Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Bounty, for which I am moſt thankful to God, to you, and to that worthy Gentleman, whoſe Praiſe is in all the Churches. Your Letter is ſo full of Kindneſs it almoſt confounds me. I bluſh to conſider how little I deſerve the leaſt of all that Goodneſs God is pleas'd to beſtow upon me, thro' the Hands of his Servants. May ten Thouſand Bleſſing from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life and Joy, crown the Heads of my Benefactors! And may I have Grace given me to improve every Talent to the Glory of my Lord and Maſter!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Meeting-Houſe,</hi> built for the <hi>Indians,</hi> at the Charge of the <hi>Province,</hi> was now ſo far compleated, that on <hi>November</hi> 29th (which was a Day of publick <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> through the <hi>Province</hi>) the Inhabitants met, and attended the publick Worſhip in it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians</hi> being much addicted to <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> render'd it neceſſary that Mr. SERGEANT, and others concern'd for their Good, ſhould uſe all prudent and proper Meaſures to prevent their running into Exceſs. Accordingly they mov'd to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> to reſtrain thoſe among themſelves who were wont to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:007023_0086_102AEAEDC8AB73B0"/>
make Gain by bringing Rum into the Place, and ſelling it to others; which the well diſpoſed <hi>Indians</hi> freely came into; and agreed upon a Penalty of Forty Pounds <hi>York</hi> Money to be laid upon thoſe who ſhould do it. Thoſe alſo who kept Taverns in neighbouring Places, and had ſold Drink to ſuch <hi>Indians</hi> as were given to Exceſs, they reprov'd, and endeavour'd to diſſuade them from a Practice which prov'd ſo hurtful to the <hi>Indians.</hi> But ſome evil-minded Perſons, among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> made a Handle of thoſe Things to diſguſt the <hi>Indians</hi>; telling them, that this was an unreaſonable Incroachment upon their Liberty; that thoſe who abridg'd them of the Liberty of uſing Drink, would by and by incroach upon their other Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; that they were us'd worſe than <hi>Slaves</hi>; that they were treated as if they were <hi>Dogs,</hi> and the like. By theſe Inſinuations the <hi>Indians</hi> (who are as fond of Liberty, as of ſtrong Drink) were much diſturb'd, and ſome of them went into great Degrees of Exceſs; and New-Year's Day being at Hand, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> frequently honour by being Drunk upon it, by whoſe Example the <hi>Indians</hi> were eaſily led into the Practice, Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT was greatly concern'd, leſt it ſhould be a Day of great Diſorder with them; to prevent which he took a very prudent Method; which I ſhall give in his own Words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>December</hi> 30th 1739. Preach'd as uſual, and propos'd to have an Exerciſe of publick Worſhip on New-Year's Day, now at Hand: for I ſuppoſed the <hi>Indians</hi> deſign'd to have a great Frolick on that Occaſion, after the Manner of the <hi>Dutch</hi> in the neighbouring Government, whoſe Example they are very apt to follow: And I thought to have a publick Exerciſe on that Day, the moſt likely Method to prevent ſuch Exceſs; which accordingly ſucceeded. For on that Day (<hi>January</hi> the 1ſt) the <hi>Indians</hi> were univerſally at Meeting, and there was no Drinking at all, tho' there was plenty of Rum in the Town. Which was a rare Inſtance of Moderation at that Seaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' there were ſome diſorderly Perſons among the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were too free with ſtrong Drink, yet this was what the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of them lamented, and they ſtill, in the general, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to behave well.</p>
            <p>Their Number at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> from Time to Time increas'd, by the Addition of new Families from Abroad; ſo that from
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:007023_0087_102AEAEFB4F4EA50"/>
about 50, the Number when Mr. SERGEANT went among them, they were now increas'd to 120.</p>
            <p>Mr SERGEANT in his Journal of <hi>March</hi> 27th 1740. ſays, <q>The whole Number of Inhabitants is 120. Our Number is increas'd by the Addition of new Families, but reckoning by Births and Deaths the Number is ſomewhat leſſen'd; which has one Year with another been the Caſe ever ſince I have been acquainted with theſe <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This perhaps is the Caſe of the <hi>Indians</hi> in general, who live bordering upon, and among the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Their Numbers do not increaſe, but in ſome Places they are diminiſh'd &amp; come almoſt to Nothing. For which divers Reaſons may be aſſign'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Intemperance. They are ſo often Drunk, both Men and Women, that it is doubtleſs ruinous to the Conſtitutions both of Parents and Children.—Their great Irregularity in Diet, may be another Reaſon; for they frequently go without eating any Thing two or three Days, and when they come again where it is to be had, they eat an immoderate Quantity, ſet no Bounds to their Appetite, but croud down whatever they can.—Again, When they are ſick, they take little or no Care of themſelves, or of one another; for ſo long as the ſick Perſon can ſtand and walk, he goes out of Doors upon all Occaſions, be it Rain or Snow, or whatever the Weather is, and whatever Diſtemper he is exercis'd with. And in the mean Time they make uſe of few, or no Means to help the Sick. It is a Wonder therefore that they be not all ſick, and that any recover when they are ſo!</p>
            <p>In a Letter of <hi>September</hi> 8th Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> inform'd Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT of the Death of the honourable <hi>Samuel Holden</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and adds. <q>So that Spring of your Comfort and Support, is cut off. Bleſſed be God that it run ſo long, and ſo fully!</q> But yet the <hi>Doctor</hi> once more aſſiſted Mr. SERGEANT and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> by ſending them ſome Thing of what remain'd of that Gentleman's Money. In a Letter of <hi>December</hi> 20th he ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>What I am able to do at preſent, is, to deliver into Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Hands, <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> of Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Money for you, and <hi>ten Pounds</hi> for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge.</hi>
               </q> The Receipt of which Mr. SERGEANT acknowledg'd in a Letter of <hi>March</hi> 17th following.</p>

               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:007023_0088_102AEAF143610938"/>
               <p>By Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> I receiv'd your obliging Letter, with the Money and Books you ſent. My Obligations to you increaſe, and my Gratitude, I hope, in ſome Proportion: But God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid that I ſhould forget the Fountain of Good from whence every Stream flows! My Heart and Eye, I truſt, are to him who has put it into your Power and Heart to help me.</p>
               <p>The Funeral Sermon on Mr. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Death, is excellent, which I read with great Pleaſure.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Funeral-Sermon on the Death of Mr. <hi>Holden,</hi> preach'd before the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> and printed at their Deſire, and by their Order.</note> How happy for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to the World, are ſuch large Improvements in Grace? How honourable to Religion and the glorious Author of our Salvation? May many ſuch ſhining Examples of Piety and Vertue appear in the World, to inſtruct the ignorant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the vicious, and to encourage the Hearts of the faithful.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Lieutenant</hi>'s Wife, of whom Mr. SERGEANT has divers Times ſpoken, as a valuable &amp; virtuous Woman, died <hi>July</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>
               <q>With a <hi>comfortable Hope</hi> (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) of eternal Life; ſpending her laſt Moments in exhorting her Huſband and Children to Godlineſs.</q> And when Mr. SERGEANT viſited her a few Days before her Death, and at her Deſire pray'd with her; the told him ſhe was content to die, hoping by that Means to be free from Sin, which was now her Burden; and if her Life was lengthen'd out, it was likely, thro' Temptation, the ſhould be prevail'd upon to commit more Sin.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Captain</hi>'s Wife alſo, whom Mr. SERGEANT eſteem'd a pious Woman, died the <hi>March</hi> following of a Conſumption.</p>
            <p>
               <q>March the 29th. This Evening (ſays Mr. SERGEANT) died <hi>Kunkapot</hi>'s Wife, having enjoyed, all along in her Sickneſs, a good Hope thro' Grace of a happy Eternity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the foremention'd Letter of <hi>March</hi> 14th 1741. Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT firſt proposed to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> his Thoughts of ſetting up a <hi>Charity-Houſe,</hi> afterwards call'd a <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Children in Labour and Induſtry, as well as Learning. Experience taught him that the <hi>Indian</hi> Cuſtoms and Way of Living, were great Impediments to the Progreſs of Chriſtianity among them, and their behaving agreable to their Profeſſion: for the Men live an idle &amp; indolent Life, which is very unfriendly to Religion; it being their Cuſtom for the Women to do all the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007023_0089_102AEAF3C00BF298"/>
Work, as getting Wood, Planting, Howing, &amp;c The Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally eſteem it a Shame for them to follow any <hi>other</hi> Buſineſs <hi>but that of Hunting.</hi> Hence the Women cannot, if they would, be acquainted with I Houſewifry, being oblig'd to carry on all the Buſineſs abroad. Mr. SERGEANT's Deſign therefore was better to regulate their Conduct in that Reſpect, by taking their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when young, and training up, both Sexes, in Buſineſs proper for them, that when they ſhould be grown up, they might be both able and willing to provide for themſelves in a Way of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and Induſtry, which would in great Meaſure free them from many of thoſe Temptations, by which they are now inſnar'd; and enable them to make a much better Figure than they now do, or can do, while they continue entire Strangers to all the Arts of Induſtry and good Living, and indulge themſelves in Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have (ſays Mr. SERGEANT to the <hi>Doctor</hi>) entertain'd Thoughts (and they have made a ſtrong Impreſſion on my Mind) of attempting to ſet up a <hi>Charity-Houſe,</hi> for the Inſtruction of our <hi>Indian</hi> Children, both Boys and Girls, in Buſineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, as well as in Reading, and Writing, and the Matters of Religion. Whether the Motion be from God, Time will make more manifeſt. I ſhould be glad of your Opinion of the Thing. This I believe Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> expected would be the End of his noble Beginning. The Deſign, I am certain, is good; whether it be feaſible, you may be a better Judge than I. It is what I have tho't of for a long Time; but ſuppos'd the Jealouſies of the <hi>Indians</hi> would be a Bar in the Way; but hop'd that Difficulties of that Nature would vaniſh with Time. I have kept the Deſign to myſelf, nor have I ever mention'd it to any of the <hi>Indians.</hi> It may perhaps now be Time to act upon it. I doubt not but I can procure a good Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Land for ſuch a Purpoſe. The Charge I know would be conſiderable; but after a While it is to be hop'd, with the Bleſſing of God, they may be able to maintain themſelves, at leaſt in great Meaſure. If I ſhould attempt ſuch a Thing, I pray God ſpare your Life to aſſiſt in it, by your Advice, Prayers, and Influence with your Correſpondents Abroad; and to introduce me into their Acquaintance.—</q>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:007023_0090_102AD2B4E08E2EC8"/>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſeems to receive the Propoſal with ſome Surprize, yet bleſſes it; and I hope <hi>a Bleſſing is in it,</hi> and <hi>pray God it may attend it</hi>: tho' at preſent it wants Encouragement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> in a Letter of <hi>April</hi> 4th replies,</p>
            <p>
               <q>— Dear Sir, What mean you by your projected <hi>Charity-Houſe</hi>? The God of <hi>Frankins</hi> lead and animate you, own and ſucceed you. I ſhou'd wiſh to live to aſſiſt in it by the Will of God. But it needs not at all my living to help it. It the Motion be of God, he will find Hands. He makes Hearts, forms Purpoſes in them, and means to execute them. As <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> ſo I am willing to encourage you to hope, <hi>God is with you.</hi> We muſt not be ſudden nether; we may project what others may execute A good Motion (ſay they) ſeldom dies in Parliament; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>There appears to me a fair Proſpect of a happy Miſſion to a Tribe or <hi>Indians</hi> in ſtrict Alliance with ours, known by the Name of the <hi>Showancos,</hi> living in the Province of <hi>Penſylvania,</hi> about 220 Miles diſtant from us; to whom our <hi>Indians</hi> have recommended the Chriſtian Religion; but as yet have receiv'd no direct and particular Anſwer: Only they have heard, that what they ſent occaſion'd much Talk among them; and that ſome propos'd the ſending of two or three of their Children here, to be inſtructed in Chriſtianity, in order to teach them.</p>
                     <p>It was of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> I ſpake to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> laſt Fall; letting him know, that I deſign'd, by the Favour of divine Providence, to make them a Viſit, and to endeavour to open the Way for the glorious Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt among them; and deſir'd his Intereſt and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton</hi>'s with your honourable <hi>Society,</hi> for the Support of ſuch Miſſion, if God ſhould open the Door for it.</p>
                     <p>And now I thank God, and you, into whoſe Heart he has put it, to contribute to this charitable Deſign; which I pray God in his infinite Mercy to ſucceed, to the Glory of his Name among the Gentiles, and to the Honour of his Son, <hi>who is made Head over all Things to the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Forty Pounds Sterling is indeed the leaſt a Gentleman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſuch Service can expect. It is very neceſſary Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of this Nature ſhould be well ſupported, that the Miſſionary may have no other Concern, than to attend the Buſineſs of his Miſſion, in which he will find he has Work enough to do, and muſt put on Reſolution not to be ſhaken by ſmall Oppoſition. I intend (God willing) before Winter to make my propos'd Viſit to thoſe <hi>Indians,</hi> after which I may be able to give you a more particular Account. But now proceed, according to your Deſire, to give a Hiſtory of the Advances Chriſtianity has made among us.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>The <hi>Hiſtorical Account</hi> here ſpoken of, Mr. SERGEANT ſent to the honourable <hi>Society</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but had no Time to take a Copy of it, as he inform'd the Rev.

After his Hiſtory he goes on to ſay,</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Thus, Sir, I have given an Account of the Progreſs Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity has made here, with ſome general Account of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs. I began to write preſently after I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd your Letter in <hi>July</hi> laſt, and deſign'd to have prepar'd the Anſwer to yours, and ſent it before Winter; but the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Circumſtances of my Family prevented me then, and by one Interruption &amp; another, I have not been able to finiſh it till now. I have been ſo particular, that, perhaps, I ſhall be thought tedious. In this Point I hope your Candour will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me. I have omitted a great many Particulars.</p>
                     <p>You will eaſily perceive, in the Peruſal of this Journal, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are a very difficult People to deal with; whoever undertakes to have much to do with them, had need to fortify himſelf with an obſtinate Patience, Oppoſition I always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, but met with it in Inſtances where I dreamt not of it, and leaſt expected it. The Devil has always his Temptations and Inſtruments to promote his Cauſe. A Number we have, I hope, that are truly converted.</p>
                     <p>Our Affairs are now in a good and flouriſhing State, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Oppoſition the Goſpel has met with, eſpecially from ſome profeſſed Chriſtians; I think, the Progreſs it has made has been extraordinary. May God own his Work and bleſs it.</p>
                     <p>I purpoſe, by the Favour of God, ſome Time next Month to make my Viſit to the <hi>Showancos.</hi> What I meet with among them I will tranſmit you an Account of. Let me have the Bleſſing of your Prayers, that, however unworthy, I may be made an Inſtrument of promoting the Kingdom and Glory of our bleſſed Lord. And may God crown all your pious and charitable Deſigns with happy Succeſs, and you finally with immortal Glory. And grant me the Honour of being reputed,</p>

                  <p>I am juſt return'd from <hi>Saſquahannah</hi>; where according to my Deſign, I have been, in order to open the Way for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of the Goſpel among the <hi>Showanoos</hi>: I found the Place about 220 Miles diſtant from us, about 50 from any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants, and the Road to it exceeding difficult.</p>
                  <p>'The Meſſage we carried was this,</p>
                  <p>Brother, who have ſeen ſo many Mornings here at <hi>Mukhhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waumuk,</hi> you live in Friendſhip with our Grandfather, our League reaches as far as the great <hi>Iſland,</hi> and the River <hi>Auwukſauntuguh.</hi> The Reaſon of my coming, is, becauſe I diſlike our Way of living; our Father above does not approve of it, we weary out his Patience.</p>
                  <p>You always stand in the Preſence of our Father, and he would have his Children turn about to him. I am come to turn you to him. If you pity your Body &amp; Soul, you will receive the <hi>Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> It is always the Priviledge of an elder Brother to teach his younger Brother, if he knows any Thing that is Good. If his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be loſt, he will tell him, <hi>This is the Way to Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The enlightening of the Eyes is in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> You will ſome Time come to know that we have been loſt. You will ſee what it is to live in <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> if your Eyes are open'd. In the End of the World you will ſee a Good prepar'd if you embrace the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in Truth; and if you believe it not, you will ſee a Puniſhment provided. Formerly our Fore-Fathers us'd to ſend Meſſages to one another, but their Speeches were Nothing. They were wont in the Concluſion of their Speeches to ſay, now I ſee the Sun at Noon you ſhall always ſee clearly; you ſhall ſee Nothing amiſs: But theſe Things which they ſpake in Darkneſs were Nothing. The only true Light which enlightens the Eyes, is the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="90" facs="unknown:007023_0095_102AEAFFA587D960"/>Brother, this is our Teacher; we have brought him with us, thinking perhaps he may open your Eyes a little, that you may ſee the Way to eternal Life. We wiſh you would hear him. He is our elder Brother.</p>
                  <p>This Meſſage your Brother at <hi>Mauhekun</hi> ſends you: He likes the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be noted that the <hi>Showanoos</hi> call our <hi>Indians</hi> their elder Brother, and ours call them their younger Brother.</p>
                  <p>When we had deliver'd this <hi>Meſſage,</hi> they retir'd a lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le While, and then brought in their Anſwer; which was to this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>It is true, we have one Father above, and we are always in his Preſence. The <hi>Indians</hi> have one Way of honouring and pleaſing him, and the <hi>White People</hi> have another; both are acceptable to Him. I am glad to hear from my Brother, and to cultivate Friendſhip with him. He ſhall always find me here if he has any Meſſage to ſend: But <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> need not be the Bond of Union between us. As for your Teacher I cannot underſtand him. If I could underſtand him, it might be well to hear him; but be ſpeaks in an unknown Tongue.</p>
                  <p>It was eaſy to ſee, by this Anſwer, they had no Mind to receive Chriſtianity. However, I deſir'd them to hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I had to ſay, and they agreed it ſhould be then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. I went out about half an Hour to prepare my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, by reading my Diſcourſe to him. When I came in again, I found many of them diſpers'd, and while I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Chief went out. They gave no ſerious Attention at all to what I ſaid. When I had done, they preſently fell to talking, and reproaching Chriſtianity; and ſhew'd an utter Averſion to it. I would have enter'd into a Debate with them, and endeavour'd to remove their Prejudices, and anſwer'd their Objections; but they would hear Nothing of the Matter. I found they had ſtrong and invincible Prejudices againſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, at leaſt the Proteſtant Religion; deriv'd, it ſhou'd ſeem, from the <hi>French,</hi> and confirm'd by their own Obſervation of the Behaviour of that vile Sort of Men the Traders, that go among them; for they ſaid (which I believe is an unhappy and reproachful Truth) that they would lie, cheat, and debauch their Women, and even their Wives, if their Huſbands were
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:007023_0096_102AEB01EEF5BA80"/>
not at Home. They were further prejudic'd againſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity from the inhoſpitable Treatment they had ſometimes met with from thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians. They ſaid the <hi>Sinnicas</hi> (a Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> much under the Influence of the <hi>French</hi>) gave them their Country where they now live; but charg'd them withal never to receive Chriſtianity from us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſpread their Influence far and wide, and indeed I believe (which I was not ſo much aware of before this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney) that they have ſcatter'd their Poiſon among all the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>North America,</hi> and have been the Means of ſtiring up that Jealouſy and Suſpicion among our <hi>Indians</hi> which has made us ſo much Difficulty in dealing with them: for they tell them that the Deſign of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> is to inſlave, and then to deſtroy them, under the Pretence of making them Chriſtians. By theſe ſtrong Prejudices, I found them ſo averſe to the Reception of Chriſtianity, that I was diſcourag'd in the Attempt, and ſo left them, pitying their Ignorance, and praying God to open their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>When I returned to <hi>Delaware,</hi> I got the <hi>Indians</hi> inhabiting there, together, and preach'd to them in our Dialect, which they could underſtand without an Interpreter. They were about 30 in Number to hear me, who gave a very diligent Attention, and ſeem'd to be mov'd, had no Objections to make, but were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of further Inſtruction. I preached to them twice. The whole Tribe is about 400 in Number; but is much diſpers'd, having no Accommodation of Land; but I have engag'd ſome Gentlemen to endeavour to provide for them in that Reſpect: which, if it can be effected, to their Satisfaction, there is a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Proſpect of a ſucceſsful Miſſion among them. I have drawn out a Journal containing a particular Account of the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity among us, which I have ſent to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to tranſmit to you, which I hope will go ſafe.</p>

            <p>As Mr. <hi>Drummond,</hi> in his foregoing Letter, deſires, by Order of the <hi>Directors,</hi> that Mr. SERGEANT would favour them with a particular Correſpondence, and that he would begin it by giving them an Hiſtorical Account of the Progreſs Religion had made among the <hi>Indians,</hi> &amp;c. So Mr. SERGEANT comply'd with their Deſires, ſent an Hiſtorical Account, and wrote the foregoing Letter. But I find no Return he ever had from Mr. <hi>Drummond,</hi> or any other Member of that <hi>Society,</hi> nor any further Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with it; except a Letter Mr. SERGEANT wrote to the <hi>Preſident,</hi> for the Time, of that <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the 18th 1749. deſiring, if it fell within their Sphere, that they would aſſiſt in promoting the <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> then begun at <hi>Stockbridge.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. SERGEANT's Letter fail'd by the Way, or what elſe happen'd to prevent a friendly Correſpondence, I am not able to ſay.</p>
            <p>Some Time before this, Mr. SERGEANT wrote to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> deſiring he would procure for him Dr. <hi>Watts's</hi> Works, except a few Pieces already in his Hands; which I ſuppoſe the <hi>Doctor</hi> did without Charge to Mr. SERGEANT.

The Books are lately come to Hand, a moſt acceptable Preſent; nor have I had Time to peruſe them, more than juſt to have a Taſte of Dr. <hi>Watts's</hi> Spirit.</p>
                  <p>When I ſpeak of Dr. <hi>Watts's</hi> Spirit in his Writings, I mean ſomething the moſt excellent to be found in Humane Nature, and near akin to angelick Dignity, there is ſomething ſo juſt and rational, and at the ſame Time ſo modeſt, candid and generous in that Gentleman's Sentiments, that they ſtrongly impreſs the Mind, and engage the Attention and Affections. Would to God the ſame Spirit of Candour and ſuperior Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhew'd itſelf in all Writings, eſpecially of Divines, and reign'd in the Heart of every Chriſtian: How many needleſſ Controverſies would be ended by it? And how much ſinful Diviſion ceaſe in the Chriſtian World? Alas! how much Need have we, at this Day, of the ſame Candour and Largeneſs of Soul? Certainly, methinks, that Devotion muſt be leſs accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, which ſubſiſts in a Soul confin'd and narrow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its Fellow-Men. May divine Grace enable me to be wiſer and better by thoſe Means Providence by you has put into my Hands, to make me ſo; and may the Bleſſings of God reſt on you for all your Kindneſs to me. I am aſham'd to deſerve ſo little of the generous and benevolent Notice you have taken of me: But I know 'tis your greateſt Satisfaction to do Good; nor will Heaven forget to reward the Benevolence of your Heart, how little ſoever I have merited your kind Notice. Forgive me. Sir, if Gratitude conſtrains me to write, what perhaps will be offenſive to that Modeſty, which almoſt makes you forget your good Deeds. I thank you particularly for your own Sermon, and am glad to find in it ſo juſt a Cenſure of ſome Things, which unhappily darken the Glory of what has appear'd to bear ſo many Marks of a divine Work in this Land. — I have the Satisfaction to inform you, that there ſeems to appear a more than common Spirit of Seriouſneſs and Reformation among our <hi>Indians,</hi> and a pretty general Diſpoſition among the <hi>Indians</hi> in theſe Parts round about us, to receive Inſtruction.—</p>

            <p>
               <q>Yeſterday came to me another Letter from the Rev.

You at <hi>Boſton</hi> (ſays he) might ſave it out of your fine <hi>Hollands, Silks,</hi> and <hi>Laces,</hi> and <hi>ſuperfine Woollen Cloths</hi>; and have a School erected for <hi>Heathen</hi> Children in Imitation of what <hi>he</hi> has eſſay'd already.

And again <hi>May</hi> 17. 1740. a third Order for <hi>four Hundred and forty-ſeven Pounds nine Shillings.</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>But what have we done in Compariſon of him? Have any of our wealthy Profeſſors put to their helping Hand to this lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable and glorious Deſign? While he has been at the Expence of maintaining 12 Boys, has any private Gentleman <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:007023_0100_102AD2BEF8291728"/>
been at the Expence of maintaining one? If therefore Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> had been inform'd how little we do, is it at all ſtrange that he ſhould <hi>expreſs his Wonder, and very great Offence, that nothing more is done by us</hi> here <hi>in New-England</hi> for the <hi>Propagation of Chriſtian Knowledge among the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> alſo, in the forementioned Letter to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> deſir'd an Account from Mr. SERGEANT how his Money had been expended, and to what Purpoſe? Mr. SERGEANT therefore wrote to him, and not only gave him a particular &amp; ſatisfactory Account how his Money had been laid out, but alſo of what Advantage it had been: That ſeveral of his Scholars had made great Progreſs in Learning, &amp;c:— But Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> having tranſcrib'd the Subſtance of that Letter, in his Recommendation of Mr. SERGEANT's Propoſal of a more effectual Method for the Education of <hi>Indian</hi> Children, which will come in hereafter, I ſhall not inſert it here.</p>
            <p>The Difficulties which Mr. SERGEANT apprehended would attend ſetting up a <hi>Boarding School, viz.</hi> the unreaſonable Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the <hi>Indians,</hi> vaniſh'd more and more, and he now tho't them ripe for ſuch a Propoſal; and therefore wrote to Dr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> upon that Subject, <hi>January</hi> 24th 1742, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <q>—I am much pleas'd with Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Projection for a <hi>School</hi>—wrote to you a Year or two ago about that Matter;— then thought that the <hi>Indians</hi> would not bear ſuch a Deſign; but now their Temper, eſpecially of late, ſeems to be much alter'd for the better, and a more than ordinary Spirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſeems to prevail. Thanks be to divine Grace for it! I am now of Opinion there is little or nothing on the Part of the <hi>Indians</hi> here, and in their Neighbourhood, to diſcourage ſuch an Attempt. And if you think it worth while (as indeed I think it is) to undertake ſo great a Thing, I pray you, either by yourſelf or by the Aſſiſtance of ſome Friend that has a turn of Mind for ſuch Projections, to draw up a <hi>general Plan</hi> of a <hi>School</hi> for the Education of <hi>Indian</hi> Children; which ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide not only for their Inſtruction in Learning, but alſo in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and ſend it to me, and I will try the Temper of the <hi>Indians</hi> with it. You may make ſome gueſs of the different Temper prevailing now among the <hi>Indians,</hi> from what did a few Years ago by this, that two of our young Women, not
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:007023_0101_102AEB0790347FA0"/>
long ſince, of their own Accord, deſir'd me to provide them Places among the Engliſh, that they might live with them, and ſupport themſelves by their own Labour in order to learn the Engliſh Languague &amp; Manners; tho' a few Years ago they would not be hir'd to it. And, accordingly, I ſent two of them to <hi>Northampton</hi> where they liv'd contented as far as I know.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another Letter of <hi>April</hi> 7th he adds upon the ſame Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <q>—You will find in what I have written to Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> that I have propoſed the Affair of the free <hi>Boarding School</hi> to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and that they are mightily taken with it. I wait with Impatience for an Anſwer to what I wrote you laſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What Mr. SERGEANT wrote to Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> he ſent unſealed to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> to which the <hi>Doctor</hi> has Reſpect in the Beginning of his Letter of <hi>May</hi> the 18th 1743. to Mr. SERGEANT.</p>

                     <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I now ſend you a general and rough Draught of that Deſign for the <hi>Education of Indian Children,</hi> which I have ſome Times formerly hinted to you, that I had formed in my Mind, with a <hi>Deſire,</hi> that you would <hi>communicate</hi> it to the World in as publick a Manner, as poſſible, and with ſuch <hi>Recommendations,</hi> as you may think proper.</p>
                  <p>What I propoſe therefore in general is, to take ſuch a <hi>Method</hi> in the Education of our <hi>Indian Children,</hi> as ſhall in the moſt effectual Manner change their whole Habit of thinking and acting; and raiſe them, as far as poſſible, into the Condition of a civil induſtrious and poliſh'd People; while at the ſame Time the Principles of Virtue and Piety ſhall be carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into their Minds in a Way, that will make the moſt laſting Impreſſion; and withal to introduce the <hi>Engliſh Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> among them, inſtead of their own imperfect and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Dialect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to accompliſh this <hi>Deſign,</hi> I propoſe to procure an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of about 200 Acres of <hi>Land</hi> in this Place, (which may be had without any Coſt of the <hi>Indian Proprietors</hi>) and to erect an <hi>Houſe</hi> on it, ſuch as ſhall be thought convenient for a Beginning; and in it to maintain a Number of <hi>Children and Youth</hi> (not under <hi>ten,</hi> nor above <hi>twenty</hi> Years of Age;) and to have them under the Direction, Care &amp; Tuition of <hi>two Masters,</hi> one to take the Overſight of them in their Hours of <hi>Labour,</hi> and the other in their Hours of <hi>Study,</hi> and to have their Time ſo <hi>divided between</hi> Study and Labour as to make one the Diverſion of the other, that as little Time as poſſible may be loſt in Idleneſs. It will, I think, be neceſſary, there ſhould be two Maſters for this Purpoſe, becauſe it will be too tedious a Taſk for one I propoſe that the Fruit of their Labour ſhall go to their own <hi>Maintenance,</hi> and to carry on the general Deſign; except perhaps ſome particular <hi>Premiums</hi> out of the Profits of their Labour, if it can be afforded, to encourage <hi>Induſtry</hi> I
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:007023_0103_102AEB0B690FC7A0"/>
propoſe alſo to have a Stock of <hi>Cattle</hi> &amp;c. maintained on the Place for the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe to take into the Number, upon certain Conditions, from among any of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Indians</hi> found about; that by <hi>their</hi> Means, under the Bleſſing of God, the Principles of Vertue and Chriſtian Knowledge may be ſpread as far as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which, perhaps in a Courſe of Years may, by the Grace of God, <hi>open</hi> the Way for the Propagation Chriſtianity to the <hi>remoteſt Tribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To lay the Foundation, and to <hi>ſupport</hi> ſo great a Deſign as this, will, without Doubt, coſt a <hi>great Deal</hi> of Money; the Supply of which <hi>depends</hi> altogether upon the Smiles of <hi>divine Providence,</hi> and the <hi>Charity</hi> of good People, who may think proper to favour it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Need</hi> of ſome ſuch Deſign as this, is very obvious to all that are in any Meaſure acquainted with the Diſpoſition and State of the <hi>Indians in America.</hi> It is well known, that Vertue and Piety make but <hi>ſlow Progreſs</hi> among them in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that have hitherto been uſed to promote theſe Ends. Nor can I think of any Thing ſo <hi>likely,</hi> as what is here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in human Probability, to <hi>root out</hi> their vicious Habits, and to change their whole Way of Living. I hope therefore the apparent Goodneſs of this Deſign will recommend it to all charitably diſpoſed Perſons, who would gladly <hi>honour God with their Subſtance</hi>; and that it will approve itſelf to, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by, Perſons of <hi>all Parties</hi>; ſince it is a Deſign <hi>generous</hi> in its Intention, and calculated for the common Good of a <hi>very miſerable and degenerate Part of our Race,</hi> and has no <hi>Party-View</hi> in it at all. I perſuade myſelf therefore that all thoſe who are concerned for the <hi>Glory</hi> of our common MAKER, and <hi>the Father of the Spirits of all fleſh,</hi> and for the Honour of our common SAVIOUR, to whom <hi>the Heathen are given for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the utmoſt Ends of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion,</hi> or that are only inſpired with the generous Sentiments of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Miſerable,</hi> will unite in promoting the Deſign here propoſed.</p>
                  <p>If PROVIDENCE encourage and ſucceed this Deſign, and a Fund ſufficient to carry it on, can be procured, I purpoſe to enlarge <hi>the Foundation,</hi> ſo as to take in <hi>Girls,</hi> as well as <hi>Boys,</hi>
                     <pb n="99" facs="unknown:007023_0104_102AEB0DA3CFF030"/>
to be educated in a Manner ſuitable to the Condition of their <hi>Sex</hi>; for I think the Cultivation of <hi>both the Sexes</hi> has a natural Tendency to improve each other more eaſily and ſucceſsfully.</p>
                  <p>I deſign the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> to be uſed with them ſhall be as ſtrict as thoſe will bear, who know <hi>nothing like Government</hi> among themſelves, and have an <hi>Averſion</hi> to every Thing that <hi>reſtrains</hi> their Liberty.</p>
                  <p>I know it is apt to be <hi>ſuſpected</hi> in ſuch Deſigns, pretended to be for the publick Good, that there is ſome <hi>Self-Intereſt at Bottom,</hi> which is the Spring of the Motion. If the World <hi>ſuſpect</hi> any Thing of this Sort in the <hi>preſent Projection,</hi> as ſome no Doubt will; and the rather, perhaps, becauſe it has been <hi>amuſed</hi> with Projections of this Kind, which have appeared to many meer <hi>perſonal and ſelfiſh,</hi> or, at beſt only <hi>Party</hi> Deſigns, I know not how to give any further <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the preſent, than to <hi>declare ſolemnly</hi> that I have <hi>no other Aim,</hi> than the <hi>Good of the Indians,</hi> and that I have no Expectation of any <hi>perſonal</hi> Benefit at all, more than the <hi>meer Satisfaction</hi> of being <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> under GOD, of doing them ſo great a <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> and rendering them a more <hi>happy Society</hi> by cultivating <hi>Humanity</hi> and Vertue among them.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Indians,</hi> in general, are a People <hi>difficult</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed from their own <hi>fooliſh,</hi> barbarous, and wicked Cuſtoms, the <hi>Unſucceſsfulneſs</hi> of Attempts upon them for this Purpoſe is a melancholly <hi>Proof,</hi> which though it may appear <hi>diſcouraging in further</hi> Endeavours; yet, I think, to a generous Mind it ſhould rather be improved as <hi>an Argument to form and execute new Projections</hi> for this Purpoſe. And indeed, perhaps, the <hi>Neglect of promoting Induſtry</hi> among them is the chief <hi>moral Reaſon</hi> of ſo <hi>little</hi> being done to Purpoſe in forming their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And therefore, I hope the Want of <hi>wiſh'd for Succeſs</hi> in other Attempts will be <hi>no Objection</hi> with any that deſire to be <hi>Benefactors to Mankind</hi> againſt contributing their <hi>Part to this,</hi> which I think, has ſo apparent a Tendency to promote <hi>Induſtry and Humanity</hi> among a barbarous People. But tho' I think the Deſign here propoſed has the probable Appearance of proving <hi>ſucceſsful,</hi> yet I do not <hi>flatter</hi> my ſelf with any Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick <hi>Expectations</hi> of accompliſhing <hi>all</hi> the Ends propoſed at once; nor is it to be <hi>expected,</hi> in the ordinary Courſe of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:007023_0105_102AEB0FED871720"/>
Things but that a great Deal of <hi>Ceſt and Pains</hi> with Reſpect to many particular Perſons will be <hi>loſt.</hi> This is what happens of Courſe in all Deſigns of this Nature: And yet, it is to be hoped, <hi>ſome Good</hi> will be done: Nor will the Benefactors looſe their Reward with God, though the Deſign ſhould not be crowned with all the happy <hi>Succeſs</hi> might be wiſhed and hoped for. The meer <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> that the Deſign in the <hi>Event</hi> will prove <hi>unſucceſsful,</hi> ought <hi>not,</hi> I think, to <hi>diſcourage</hi> the Attempt. How many are there, that <hi>fruſtrate the very Grace of God itſelf</hi>? How many with Reſpect to whom <hi>Chriſt has died in vain</hi>? And yet (to ſpeak after the Manner of Men) <hi>this</hi> was no Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to his laying down <hi>his Life</hi> for Sinners. He indeed has obtain'd all the Recompence in the Salvation of Souls, which he had in his Eye, and <hi>GOD all the Glory of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent Purpoſes. He ſees the Fruit of the Travail of his Soul, and is ſatisfied.</hi> Nor will any <hi>Benefactors</hi> here <hi>looſe the Praiſe and Reward</hi> of their gracious Intention and Endeavours. (See <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlix. 1-6.)</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps with ſome be an <hi>Objection</hi> againſt attempting any Thing of this Sort, that the <hi>Indians are a baſe, ungrateful People,</hi> inſenſible of Kindneſſes done them. To this I <hi>reply,</hi> that though it be true, that this is the baſe, ungrateful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>Indians</hi> yet I think it is rather an <hi>Argument in Favour</hi> of a Projection calculated to promote <hi>Humanity</hi> among them, than otherwiſe: For the Objection ſuppoſes them to be greatly <hi>debaſed,</hi> and ſhews the Need there is of <hi>cultivating a Soil ſo barren,</hi> or rather a Soil ſo <hi>over-run</hi> with hateful <hi>Weeds,</hi> and pricking Thorns. But whatever Weight <hi>this</hi> Objection might have with <hi>others,</hi> certainly it ought to have none <hi>with a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> who is commanded to <hi>imitate the Beneficence of his</hi> HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENLY FATHER, who <hi>does Good to the Evil and Unthankful.</hi> Had this Conſideration ſway'd the Mind of our bleſſed SAVIOUR, would he ever have ſhed his <hi>Blood</hi> for thoſe, who purſued his Life to Death? Nor did GOD refuſe to <hi>diſtinguiſh the Iſraelites</hi> with his <hi>peculiar</hi> Favours from all the Families of the Earth, becauſe they were an ungrateful <hi>ſtiff-necked</hi> and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe.</p>
                  <p>I would <hi>not</hi> have it thought from <hi>what</hi> I have written above, that all that has been done here, to introduce Chriſtianity and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:007023_0106_102AEB1178C8C228"/>
good Manners, has proved altogether <hi>in vain</hi>; for, through the Grace of GOD, ſome <hi>good Effects</hi> have attended <hi>our Labours</hi> here: And, the <hi>Indians ſeem now well prepared</hi> for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I have here propoſed; which their <hi>Jealouſy</hi> would have been an effectual <hi>Hindrance</hi> to a few Years ago.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad of the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of candid and ingenious <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen</hi> communicated to me for the Improvement of the <hi>Deſign</hi> here propoſed: And ſhall be ready to anſwer any <hi>Queries</hi> that may be made in Relation to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, you have what I deſire may be communicated to the <hi>publick</hi> from me. It will be well perhaps that you ſhould preface this with ſome general <hi>Account</hi> of what Mr. <hi>Hollis has done,</hi> and what he <hi>expected from this Country</hi> in Proſecution of his Deſign; which was what ſuggeſted to me the Deſign pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed above. Some <hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſeem to be of Opinion, that this is <hi>not an happy Time</hi> to ſet ſuch a Deſign on Foot; which for ought I know is true; but I do not think it beſt to <hi>poſtpone</hi> it on that Account. For who knows when we ſhall have a <hi>better</hi> Time? It is poſſible it may be <hi>worſe.</hi> Nor would I wiſh to have your <hi>bleſſed</hi> MASTER take you from us, 'till you have help'd in laying this <hi>Foundation</hi> alſo for the Increaſe of Glory to his <hi>Name</hi> by promoting <hi>this Scheme,</hi> on which I confeſs <hi>my</hi> Heart is much ſet, and which will (I hope) proſper the better for <hi>your</hi> countenancing it.</p>

                  <p>It having pleas'd my Rev. <hi>Brother</hi> thus <hi>openly</hi> to addreſs and oblige me, I do moſt willingly publiſh his <hi>Letter</hi>: And if <hi>my Name and Hand</hi> can ſerve in any Meaſure to promote the <hi>happy Foundation</hi> which his Heart is ſet on, (I humbly hope under ſome ſpecial <hi>Influence</hi> from above) I give <hi>them</hi> with all my <hi>Heart</hi>; with Thankſgiving to GOD who many Years ago was pleas'd to incline my Honour'd <hi>Friend</hi> and Rev. <hi>Brother</hi> Mr. <hi>Iſaac Hollis</hi> (then of <hi>London</hi>) into thoſe <hi>Bounties</hi> to us, which are now iſſuing in <hi>this Propoſal</hi> of a <hi>Boarding-School</hi> for the <hi>more effectual Inſtruction and Education</hi> of the <hi>Indian Children</hi> in the <hi>Western Borders</hi> of our <hi>Province.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about the Year 1731, 2. that Mr. <hi>Iſaac Hollis,</hi> (Nephew to <hi>Thomas Hollis,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; the great Benefactor to <hi>Harvard College,</hi> and ſoon after his pious <hi>Uncle</hi>'s Deceaſe) ſent me a <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> Sterling, with his particular <hi>Directions</hi> how to diſtribute and lay it out; adding, that he had ſeen many of my <hi>Letters</hi> to his <hi>Uncle</hi> and his to <hi>me,</hi> which now <hi>led him</hi> into his <hi>Writing</hi> to me, and this his Gift to us.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1734, when he had ſeen the printed Account of the <hi>Ordination</hi> of Meſſieurs <hi>Parker, Hinſdel</hi> and <hi>Secombe,</hi> and their <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Indian Tribes</hi> on the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Borders of <hi>New England</hi>; Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> then earneſtly made me a moſt generous <hi>Offer</hi> of <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> Sterling <hi>per Annum, for Ever,</hi> for the Support of a <hi>fourth Miſſionary</hi>; but in Faithfulneſs I advis'd againſt ſuch a Diſpoſition of his Money; &amp; as earneſtly propoſed to him the Application of it for the Support of a <hi>Miſſionary</hi> thro' the wide Spread of the <hi>deſtitute Settlements</hi> I had heard of in the Province of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi>; but he did not approve of my Advice.</p>
                  <p>Within two Years after this, I heard of a very promiſing <hi>Door</hi> opening for the <hi>Goſpel</hi> among the <hi>Indian Tribe at Houſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunnuk,</hi> and that a Perſon of Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>Character</hi> for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Learning, (then one of the <hi>Tutors</hi> in <hi>Yale College</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi>) was willing to quit his <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> and the <hi>Proſpect</hi> he reasonably might have of one of the <hi>beſt</hi> Settlements our <hi>Country</hi> could afford him, in any of our vacant <hi>Churches</hi>; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:007023_0108_102AEB15B8CD0BD0"/>
vote himſelf to the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Service of the Souls of thoſe poor <hi>Heathen Families</hi>; Whereupon I immediately let Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> know, that now I could freely and earneſtly adviſe him to fix his <hi>twenty Pounds Sterling</hi> per An. for the Support of this <hi>Miſſion:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this Motion, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 19. 1736. I receiv'd from Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> his Bill on Col. <hi>Wendell</hi> to pay 56 l. Sterl. for the Education of <hi>twelve Indian Boys</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. SERGEANT; and <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. 1738. I had a <hi>ſecond Order</hi> from him tor 343 l. our Money; and again <hi>May</hi> 17. 1740. a <hi>third</hi> Order for 447 l. 9 s.: (Errors execped.)</p>
                  <p>Upon this gracious <hi>Call,</hi> and bountiful <hi>Direction</hi> of <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT has been laying out himſelf gladly from Year to Year, in the Strength of GOD, in the Truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted to him, with Caution, Care and Diligence, according to the Meaſure of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> given him from <hi>on High</hi>; whence every <hi>good and perfect Gift</hi> comes down, both the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> for the doing Good.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1743. Mr. SERGEANT cover'd to me a <hi>Letter</hi> to be forwarded to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> giving him a particular <hi>Account,</hi> of the laying <q>out his <hi>Moneys</hi> for the <hi>Maintenance of his Boys</hi>; and of the <hi>Methods he bad uſed</hi> for the <hi>cultivating Humanity,</hi> and introducing the <hi>Engliſh Tongue and Manners among them,</hi> and for their <hi>Proficiency</hi> in Knowledge, Vertue and <hi>Piety</hi>; by which Means, through the Bleſſing of GOD, ſeveral of them are affected with a <hi>Senſe and Reliſh of Divine Things</hi>; and <hi>One</hi> of them in particular has made <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Progreſs</hi> in his <hi>Learnings,</hi> and appears truly <hi>pious,</hi> and has been ſingularly <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to him, <hi>aſſiſting</hi> him in his <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations</hi> Expoſtions aod Applications of the Scripture; and alſo very <hi>helpful</hi> among the <hi>young Indians</hi> in a <hi>general religious Concern</hi> that has <hi>of late prevailed</hi> among them.</q> Mr. SERGEANT adds, <q>that <hi>this young Indian</hi> is already well <hi>qualified to keep School</hi> among his <hi>Countrymen</hi>; and within a few Years will probably be fit to be a <hi>Preacher of the Goſpel</hi> to them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two or three other</hi> of his Boys, Mr. SERGEANT ſays, are ſerviceable in <hi>improving the Reſt</hi> of the <hi>Indians</hi> in Knowledge and Virtue; and he adds,— <q>that it had been a <hi>continued Series of unwearied Kindneſs to the Indians, that had at length
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:007023_0109_102AEB181597B1D8"/>
intirely overcome their Jealouſies and Suſpicions</hi>; and gain'd an almoſt <hi>univerſal Diſpoſition</hi> in them to receive Inſtruction.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He then inform'd Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> 
                     <q>that he has had in his Mind, for ſome Years, to ſet up a <hi>free Boarding-School</hi> for the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Indian</hi> Children, in which he propoſes that they be brought up to <hi>Labour</hi> as well as <hi>Learning</hi> and the Exerciſes of <hi>Devotion</hi>; with which Propoſal the <hi>Indians</hi> ſeem to be mightily taken; being ſenſible of their <hi>Folly</hi> in their being formerly ſo <hi>backward</hi> to improve the Advantages put into their Hand.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon all, Mr. SERGEANT adds his <q>
                        <hi>Prayer,</hi> that Almighty <hi>Power</hi> may effect the merciful Purpoſe of Sovereign <hi>Grace</hi> among them!—</q> and then concludes with a free and noble <hi>Declaration</hi> to Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> in the following Words,</p>

                  <p>I was ſo charm'd with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and Contents of <hi>this Letter,</hi> that I took a <hi>Copy</hi> of it before I <hi>ſeal'd</hi> it up, and <hi>forwarded</hi> it to Mr. <hi>Hollis:</hi> And not only ſo, but <hi>old</hi> as I am, and unapt now to <hi>tranſcribe,</hi> yet I wrote ſeveral Copies, and ſent <hi>one</hi> to an Honourable <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Corporation at London,</hi> who have the Diſtribution of the <hi>Indian Fund</hi>; another to the worthy <hi>Secretary</hi> of their Honourable <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> here at <hi>Boston</hi>; and yet a <hi>third</hi> to a Rev. <hi>Miniſter</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if he ſees good to communicate it to the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the Honourable <hi>Society</hi> for propagating Chriſtian Knowledge at <hi>Edinburgh</hi>; and after all I publiſh'd it in the <hi>Weekly Chriſtian Hiſtory</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> No. 19. So that I have in a Manner <hi>prevented,</hi> and abundantly anſwered, Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>Requeſt</hi> to me in <hi>his preſent Letter</hi> before it
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:007023_0110_102AEB19A4AB0238"/>
came; and gone beyond all he could <hi>imagine</hi> or expect from me, in Way of <hi>prefacing</hi> and <hi>recommending his picus Deſign and Propoſal.</hi> And I can truly add, that I ſhall account my ſelf honour'd by GOD in my <hi>advanced Age,</hi> If I may <hi>finiſh my Courſe</hi> of Services to my <hi>Country,</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> of CHRIST here, by miniſtring now under my <hi>dear younger Brother,</hi> in this his ſervent <hi>devoting his Life and Powers</hi> to the <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD in the <hi>Salvation of the Heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I even <hi>dare</hi> therefore to recommend <hi>Him,</hi> and his propoſed <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> not only to the pious and <hi>Charitable</hi> among ourſelves, nor only to thoſe of the Denomination of <hi>New-England</hi> in our <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Provinces</hi>; but alſo (might it not be thought <hi>preſumptuous</hi>) even to the moſt Honourable <hi>Societies for propagating the Goſpel</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtian Knowledge</hi> in <hi>London</hi> &amp; <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> for their generous <hi>Aſſiſtances</hi> to a <hi>Projection truly Catholic,</hi> and without <hi>reſpect of Parties</hi>; which I hope the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> may be laying by the Hands of <hi>his Servants,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> and Mr. SERGEANT, in this obſcure <hi>Corner</hi> of our <hi>Province</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> alias <hi>Houſtunnuk,</hi> for <hi>a more effectual Entrance</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> than we have yet ſeen.</p>
                  <p>But there are <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Things more, that I find my ſelf <hi>obliged</hi> to hint at, before I conclude the preſent Writing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>One</hi> is (as Mr. SERGEANT requeſts of me in his Letter) to intimate to the <hi>Publick</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis his Expectations from Us here in New-England.</hi> And indeed, in ſeveral of his <hi>Letters</hi> to me, he has wrote with ſome <hi>Diſcouragement of Spirit</hi> on this Head; <q>Why <hi>We,</hi> a People of ſuch <hi>Name</hi> for Religion, do not <hi>exert</hi> our ſelves more in Proſecution of like Eſſays for a more effectual goſpelizing the <hi>Heathen</hi> round about us? And now that <hi>He has advanc'd</hi> as he has done for the <hi>Education</hi> of a Number at Houſatunnuk; he hears of <hi>none</hi> of our rich Men falling in with their Aſſiſtances.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This has been Matter of <hi>Stumbling</hi> to him, and I wiſh the <hi>Block</hi> may be now removed by the Contributions of many to the <hi>School</hi> propoſed: which may be <hi>an Odour of a fweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable and pleaſing to GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Thing ſuggeſted by Mr. SERGEANT, and a moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> one in the preſent Caſe, is — <q>his <hi>taking in Girls as well as Boys,</hi> if Providence ſucceed the Deſign, and a Fund
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:007023_0111_102AEB1BA71FE650"/>
Fund ſufficient to carry it on, can be procured:</q> I muſt needs add, on <hi>this</hi> Head, that this Propoſal is a Matter of abſolute <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> wherein we are not left at <hi>Liberty</hi> either as Men or Chriſtians; for there cannot be a <hi>Prepagation of Religion</hi> among any People without an equal Regard to <hi>both Sexes</hi>; not only becauſe <hi>Females</hi> are alike precious <hi>Souls,</hi> form'd for GOD and Religion as much as the <hi>Males</hi>; but alſo becauſe the <hi>Care</hi> for the Souls of <hi>Children in Families,</hi> and more eſpecially in thoſe of <hi>low Degree</hi> lies chiefly upon the <hi>Mothers</hi> for the firſt <hi>ſeven</hi> or eight Years: Which is an Obſervation or <hi>Remark</hi> which I had the Honour to make unto my dear and honour'd ancient Friend <hi>Henry Newman,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Secretary to the Honourable and Reverend <hi>Society</hi> for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge; which when he had communicated to <hi>Them,</hi> they put it into <hi>Print,</hi> and ſent it to the Directors of the 1764 <hi>Schools</hi>; (if I have not miſcounted) that ſo a <hi>greater Proportion of Girls</hi> might be taken into them to receive a religious Education for the ſake of <hi>their Posterity,</hi> and therein for the more effectual anſwering the very End of their <hi>Charity-Schools.</hi> By which <hi>Inſtance</hi> I received the following <hi>Inſtruction</hi> What an <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>untho't</hi> of <hi>Good,</hi> a Man may do by a <hi>ſingle</hi> &amp; occaſional <hi>right Tho't</hi> or <hi>Line</hi>; it proving in the <hi>Caſe</hi> before me, as if I had wrote 1764 <hi>Letters</hi> to the Directors of ſo many <hi>Schools,</hi> for the Service of <hi>Poſterity,</hi> and in Favour of <hi>Female Children</hi>: And what added a <hi>Thouſand-fold</hi> more to the Virtue &amp; <hi>Force</hi> of my Line, was the <hi>Approbation of ſo venerable a Body</hi> of Gentlemen, and their <hi>Recommendation</hi> of it to the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of the <hi>Over-ſeers</hi> of their reſpective Schools.</p>
                  <p>I have now only to add upon Mr. SERGEANT's Poſtſcript, — that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> whom he has <hi>nam'd</hi> to receive &amp; diſburſe the <hi>Moneys</hi> which may be given for the building and ſupport of his <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> are <hi>Perſons of know Character</hi> among us for <hi>Integrity</hi> and Honour; to whom I only wiſh may be added the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi>; whom it pleaſed GOD to uſe ſo much as a <hi>zeaLous and laborious Instrument</hi> of the Settlement of the Goſpel at <hi>Houſtunnak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Thanks</hi> be to GOD for his <hi>Unſpeakable Gift,</hi> a right <hi>liberal Heart and Hand,</hi> in one Part of his <hi>Church</hi> and another. No <hi>Tongue</hi> of Man can fully <hi>ſpeak</hi> of it! or enough celebrate
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:007023_0112_102AEB1D36D2A718"/>
it! <hi>Unſpeakable</hi> is the <hi>Good</hi> done to the World by it! unſeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the <hi>Glory</hi> redounding to the Name of CHRIST from it! and alſo the Good to <hi>our ſelves</hi> in it and from it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, both thro' the Life that now is, and in that which is to come! Only the <hi>Day of</hi> CHRIST can reveal the <hi>Glories and Joys</hi> awaiting it thro' a bleſſed <hi>Eternity:</hi> 
                     <q>—<hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee hungry and fed thee? or thirſty &amp; gave thee Drink? —Verily in as much as you did it unto one of the leaſt of theſe ye have done it unto Me.</hi>

            <p>The foregoing Letter of Mr. SERGEANT containing his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, &amp;c. and Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Return, &amp;c. were made Publick by the <hi>Doctory,</hi> according to Mr. SERGEANT's Deſire; with a Deſign to excite the pious generous and well diſpoſed in this <hi>Country,</hi> and in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to charitable Contributions for the ſetting up &amp; ſupporting the propoſed <hi>Boarding-School.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> diſtributed many of them, where he tho't they would be moſt likely to anſwer the End propoſed. And in a Letter to Mr. SERGEATN of <hi>September</hi> 17th he gives him the following Account.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>—I cover to you your Letter in Print. I wiſh my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it may be acceptable to you &amp; others; and I humbly beſeech God to incline many Hearts, Here and Abroad, to contribute to your moſt pious and generous Propoſal.

            </p>
            <p>And in another Letter of the 22d of the ſame Month.</p>
            <p>
               <q>—It was a great Pleaſure to me Yeſterday to ſee Mr. <hi>Joſiah Jones.</hi> I have deliver'd to him <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> old Tenor, to deliver to you for your further Aſſiſtance and Support in your Work. I have deſir'd him to call at our Deacon <hi>Philips's</hi> for two Dozen Copies of your Letter to me, and my Return to it; preſented by Major <hi>Henchman,</hi> who ſends them to you for the Copy.—I have diſtributed already of them 70, and ſhall receive 50 more to Day to diſtribute.

Side the Water. I have alſo preſented four f(c) Governoor <hi>Shirley,</hi> and am ſending to Lieutenant Governour <hi>Phips</hi> and <hi>Dummer</hi> here; and to the <hi>Governour, Lieutenant Governour,</hi> and ſome <hi>Miniſters</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and to the <hi>Preſidents</hi> of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>By the Pains Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> took in recommending and diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. SERGEANT's Propoſal, it is evident he was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in Favour of it; as Mr. SERGEANT alſo was; and, I think, not without Reaſon: for I look upon it as the beſt concerted Scheme that has ever been propos'd for the Benefit of the <hi>Indians.</hi> Nor do I ſuppoſe it likely, that they will ever be bro't to be a knowing and thrifty People, unleſs, by ſome ſuch Method of Induſtry, they are cur'd of their Idleneſs, and other Vices which proceed from it.</p>
            <p>When Mr. SERGEANT underſtood, by Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Letter, what Care and Pains he had been at to forward this noble Deſign, his generous Soul was too tenderly touch'd to be ſilent. In a Letter of <hi>October</hi> 24, he thus expreſſes his Gratitude to the <hi>Doctor.</hi>

            <p>In another Letter of <hi>November</hi> 25th to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>—Your Care and Pains, under the Decays &amp; Feebleneſs of Age, to promote the Deſign of my Letter, I accept with great Thankfulneſs.— Madam <hi>Holden</hi> is exceeding kind, and ſets a noble Example. May God put it into the Hearts of others to follow it.— I highly approve of the Manner you propoſe to put forward a Subſcription for ſomething annually, and yet not ſo confining it, but that who will, may, give what they pleaſe at once.— Yeſterday<note n="†" place="bottom">A Day of publick Thankſgiving through the Province.</note> we of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, with the Aſſiſtance of two Strangers happening to be preſent, being ten Perſons only that contributed, collected by Subſcription <hi>One Hundred and fifteen Pounds ten Shillings,</hi> towards our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd School; ſome to be paid annually for the Term of ten Years: an Offering which, I hope, will be acceptable to him who gives us the Comforts and Bleſſings of Life, with which we are able to rejoice and give Thanks before him. Yeſterday I alſo gave the <hi>Indians</hi> ſome Account of the Deſign; with what was doing for them, chiefly by your Means. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd very thankful, and this Morning ſent a Meſſage to me, to know where the Houſe was deſign'd to be erected, with the Offer of their Aſſiſtance in clearing a Spot of Land to forward the Deſign.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Letter, which Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> wrote to Mr. SERGEANT, giving hinm Occaſion to ſay, <hi>Madam</hi> Holden is <hi>exceeding kind, and ſets a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>le Example,</hi> is miſſing. Therein I conclude the <hi>Doctor</hi> had inform'd him, that Madam <hi>Holden</hi> had given <hi>one Hundred Pounds</hi> towards his <hi>Boarding-School.</hi> For in his Letter of <hi>May</hi> 18th (before tranſcrib'd) the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I purpoſe to aſk Mrs. <hi>Holden</hi>'s Leave to apply <hi>one Hundred,</hi> our Currency, of her Money, toward your <hi>Boarding-School.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another Letter of <hi>May</hi> 24th 1744, he ſpeaks of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Holden</hi>'s Subſcription of <hi>one Hundred Pounds.</hi> I ſuppoſe
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:007023_0115_102AEB241474D100"/>
therefore in the Letrer that is miſſing the <hi>Doctor</hi> inform'd him of her Donation, which occaſion'd him to expreſs himſelf as above.</p>
            <p>For want of that Letter, I am not able to ſay what Manner <hi>of Subſcription the Doctor</hi> put forward, and which Mr. SERGEANT ſo <hi>highly approv'd of,</hi> but only from this Expreſſion of his; <hi>for ſomething annually, and yet not ſo confin'd hit that who will, may, give what they pleaſe at once.</hi> And what Progreſs it made I know not, but ſuppoſe it was not great. All the Light I have in the Caſe is from a Letter of Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s to Mr. SERGEANT, dated <hi>May</hi> 24th 1744, in which he ſays.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I have as yet no Subſcription but Madam <hi>Holden's one Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he goes on to name four Gentlemen, who ſubſcrib'd in this <hi>Country,</hi> and concludes by ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <q>—I wiſh it may be ſlow and ſure; believing and not making Haſte. God governs, and I truſt will provide.</q> The four Subſcriptions above mentioned Mr. SERGEANT never received. I find them not in his Account, and therefore conclude, that the War now coming on, and diſcouraging any further Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe were not paid.</p>
            <p>It mud be granted, that the People in <hi>Stockbridge</hi> diſcover'd a very noble and generous Spirit, in contributing ſo largely to that pious Deſign. Had the People thro' the <hi>Country</hi> given one tenth Part ſo much, in Proportion to their Numbers &amp; Abilities, that <hi>School,</hi> and another for <hi>Females,</hi> might have been ſet up, and well ſuoported: And had we in general, in this Land, ſuch juſt and affecting Views of the deplorable State of the <hi>Indians,</hi> as the People at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> have, whoſe Eyes affect their Hearts, I doubt not but many Thouſands would have cheerfully given to forward that noble and pious Deſign, the beſt I think that has ever been projected.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſent one of Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letters, and his own Recommendation of it, to a Gentleman in a neighbouring Town, whoſe generous Mind was pleas'd with the Projection; he therefore wrote back, propoſing a Method of Subſcription to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage it, which the <hi>Doctor</hi> approv'd of, and therefore publiſh'd the Gentleman's Letter in the Weekly Journal of <hi>February</hi> 7th 1744. The Letter, with what the <hi>Doctor</hi> or ſubjoined io the publick Print, were as follows.</p>

                     <salute>Reverend and dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>You did me the Favour ſome Weeks ſince, to ſend me the Rev. Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>Scheme,</hi> with your Letter annexed to it, for promoting Chriſtian Knowledge among thr <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatunnuck,</hi> by civilizing and bringing them to a good Opinion of Induſtry, Frugality, &amp;c. which I very much approve of; and the more, becauſe it appears to me, as if he had truly no private or perſonal Intereſt in View; but only the Honour of his great Maſter, and the beſt Welfare of the poor <hi>Heathen,</hi> whom the Father gave him for his Inheritance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I heartily wiſh it Succeſs, and hope the Difficulties in raiſing Money, to carry on ſuch an Affair, may be ſurmounted.</p>
                  <p>I have been expecting every Day, ſince you ſent it to me, to hear of a Subſcription's going forward on that Account, but hear nothing of any ſuch Thing at preſent.</p>
                  <p>I would therefore humbly propoſe, that a Sheet of Paper or two may be ſtitch'd up at the End of one or more of thoſe printed Letters; and a generous Subſcription begun, by a few well-diſpos'd Gentlemen of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and handed about from one to another to try what may be done that Way: And there every Subſcriber may ſee at one View the honeſt Deſign, judge of it's Neceſſity, and act accordingly.</p>
                  <p>I cannot help thinking the generous Beneſactions of the Rev. Mr. <hi>HoIlis,</hi> and his juſt Objection of the Inactivity of a People of ſuch a Name for Religion, as we in <hi>New-England,</hi> in ſuch an Affair, will put many to the Bluſh, and perhaps ſpur them on to bountiful Liberality in this Scheme. I am no Ways qualify'd for a Leader my ſelf, but would willingly follow a few Gentlemen who would be more likely to give it a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Currency, with my Subſcription of —<hi>pounds</hi> and would uſe my ſmall Influence to promote it; but it muſt be ſome how or other ſet a going, whkrh, when once well done, may be eaſily kept alive, and in Motion. I have a great deal of Faith that ſomething of this Nature may be attended with Succeſs, if put into ſuch Hands as ſhall be ſpirited for it, and will not <hi>be weary in well doing</hi>; but ſtir up themſelves &amp; others with a well temper'd Zeal, mixt with Prudence, ſo as not to give Offence to any who do not think exactly as they do; and by ſuch a Behaviour, ſome who may not be well inclin'd at one
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:007023_0117_102AEB27BB6035E8"/>
Time, may be very well diſpos'd at another, to a handſome Subſcription.</p>
                  <p>But, this Method notwithſtanding, I hope it will not be tho't amiſs to have a Brief from Authority (if Need be) procur'd and promoted in every Church, in this Province, to collect what well-diſpos'd People would be willing to give to encourage an Affair of ſuch Importance; and if, before the Collection, theſe two Letters ſhould be read, I am humbly of Opinion it would not be impertinent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we really believe the admirable Charms you mention at the Cloſe of your Letter, have any Reality in them, as I am apt to think they have, viz.</hi> That a right literal Heart &amp; Hand, no Tongue can fully ſpeak it! nor enough celebrate it! Unſpeakable is the Good done to the World by it! Unſpeakable is that Glory redounding to the Name of Chriſt from it! and alſo the Good to ourſelves in it and from it is Unſpeakable, <hi>both thro' the Life which now is &amp; that which is to come!</hi> Only the <hi>Day of Chriſt</hi> can reveal the Glories and Joys awaiting it thro' a bleſſed Eternity:</p>
                  <p>I ſay, if theſe wonderful Truths are duly tho't of, this pious Scheme of Mr. SERGEANT will not, cannot, fall to the Ground for want of Money to carry it on, and ſupport it from Time to Time. I pray God to ſtrengthen our Faith in them.— I entreat an Intereſt in your Prayers, and do aſſure you that I am with great Eſteem and Reſpect,</p>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> wrote to the honourable <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> upon the ſame Subject; of which he gave Mr. SERGEANT the following Account in a Letter of <hi>February</hi> 9. 1743, 4.</p>

               <q>To Day I wrote to <hi>Andrew Oliver,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; <hi>Secretary</hi> to the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> for the <hi>Indians,</hi> to be communicated to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing to them your and my printed Letter, and theſe now inclos'd (<hi>the foregoing Letter publiſh'd two Days before, and no inclos'd to Mr.</hi> SERGEANT) praying them to take your Propoſal into Conſideration, and act as they may ſee becoming them in their publick and private Capacity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It will perhaps be Matter of Surprize to the Reader, that when ſuch an Opportunity preſented, and Subſcriptions were urg'd by ſuch forcible Reaſons by Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> and the Author of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Letter; that no Subſcriptions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> obtain'd in the Country, ſave thoſe four abovementioned: For I find no Account of any more in the Papers before me. All the Reaſon I am able to give for it is, that the War with <hi>France</hi> now came on, which drew the Attention of every one, and might diſcourage, for the preſent, thoſe who were well inclin'd: <hi>Stockbridge</hi> being an expos'd Place, where no ſuch Deſign could be carried on in Time of War, to good Advantage.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible ſome worthy Gentlemen, who were poſſeſt of a laudable Concern for the Good of the <hi>Indians</hi> apprehended, that there was too great a Coldneſs and Indifference in this Caſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Importance of the Affair, and the happy Proſpect there was of its ſucceeding, if it had been duly encourag'd; and that they were a little impatient on the Account of thoſe Excuſes which were made by ſome, from whom Subſcriptions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, <hi>viz.</hi> That we muſt not be too haſty, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Gentleman in a Letter to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 18th ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am ſorry the propos'd Draught for a Subſcription is ſo hard of Digeſtion; I wiſh Gentlemen would not be quite ſo over nice and exact, but leave ſome of the Prudentials in the Affair to the honourable and Reverend Gentlemen; who I hope will be appointed, and who will be charitably inclin'd to take upon them the Management of that Affair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Gentleman alſo in a Letter to Mr. SERGEANT of <hi>July</hi> 9th ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>I could have been very glad, that my poor Endeavours with Reſpect to your <hi>Scheme</hi> to propagate Chriſtianity among the <hi>Indians,</hi> had been attended with any Succeſs; but I cannot
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:007023_0119_102AEB2C7447CA00"/>
learn that any Thing is done, or doing, about it; and it ſeems to me to be as dead at preſent as if it had never been in Motion. I have met with ſeveral Checks for being too haſty in the Affair.—Our Backwardneſs to generous Actions for the Good of our fellow Creatures, notwithſtanding the excellent Rules of Charity preſcrib'd in Chriſtianity, and enforc'd by ſo many powerful Reaſons, is a moſt convincing Argument, that the Spirit of pure and undefil'd Religion but little prevails, where the Form of it appears.</q>—</p>
            <p>I am ready to think that any one, who is well acquainted with this Affair, and is impartial in the Caſe, will judge, that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Subſcription to promote ſuch a noble Deſign, would have well became a People of our Profeſſion: The Rev. and generous Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> when he was made acquainted with Mr. SERGEANT's Scheme, diſcover'd a very different Spirit from what appear'd among us. Before Mr. SERGEANT's Letter, and Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Recommendation of it, were made publick in this Country, in <hi>April</hi> 7. 1743. Mr. SERGEANT in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> inform'd him of his Deſign of ſeting up a <hi>Boarding-School.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> in his Anſwer of <hi>December</hi> 5th 1743, in a moſt effectual Manner, ſhews his Approbation of it, in the following Worlds.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I am pleas'd with your Propoſal about ſetting up a <hi>Boarding-School</hi> for <hi>Indian</hi> Children. I like it well. May it pleaſe the Lord to incline the Hearts of many to contribute towards it. I deſire you would take up for me 12 Boys afreſh, about the Age of 9, 10, 11, or 12 Years, and let them be totally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at my Expence, with Food and Raiment, Education and the like. There may be ſtill a conſiderable Sum of Money in the Hands of Col. <hi>Wendell</hi>; pleaſe to apply to him on my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for what you want, and I will furniſh more as there may be Occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>—<hi>N. B.</hi> I would have none but <hi>Boys</hi> educated for me; but it may be well if a Number of <hi>Girls</hi> could be educated on the Account of ſome others.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> in a Letter inform'd a certain Gentleman in his Neighbourhood of Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Generoſity, who in his Anſwer to the <hi>Dostor,</hi> expreſſes himſelf thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>This extraordinary additional Bounty of that Reverend Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, I hope will quicken the Gentlemen here concern'd in
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:007023_0120_102AEB2E13AD0C60"/>
putting forward Subſcriptions. Is it not amazing to find one ſingle Gentleman (and that a Stranger too) ſo ready and free to be at the Expence of ſupporting 24 Boys, without any Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of his Charity's being miſapply'd, and this <hi>whole Land</hi> ſo backward to ſupport an equal Number of <hi>Girls,</hi> when it is ſo vaſtly more our Duty than any Bodies elſe? May not a little Impatience here be a Virtue?</q>
            </p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Letter, of <hi>December</hi> 5. 1743, Mr. SERGEANT wrote an Anſwer <hi>July</hi> 2. In which, after his grateful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Generoſity, and his hearty Wiſhes that a full Reward might be given him, by that God who is <hi>well pleas'd with ſuch Sacrifices,</hi> he informs him, that the projected Method of a <hi>Boarding-School</hi> was the beſt he could deviſe for the Good of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and then adds,—<q>The <hi>War</hi> with <hi>France</hi> falls out unhappily for this Deſign. We are ſituated upon the Borders of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Province,</hi> open to the <hi>French</hi> Settlements, and in the Road where the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> us'd to make their Irruptions; but have been hitherto, thro' the Goodneſs of God, preſerv'd.—However, for the preſent, I believe, it will not be tho't prudent to be at any Expence in the Affair of the <hi>Boarding-School.</hi> My Houſe is garriſon'd; a Number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are ſent into the Town;—and Proviſions are ſcarce: ſo that I know not what can be done for your <hi>Boys</hi> juſt now. We are, for the preſent, in ſuch Confuſion &amp; Uncertainty, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the War, that it is difficult to ſay what is beſt to be done; a little longer Time will probably direct us what Steps are beſt to be taken. As ſoon as may be, I ſhall gladly proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute your pious Deſign.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a Letter alſo to Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 29th, he ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for our Deſign here, I believe, it will not be tho't prudent to put any Thing in Execution for the preſent, till we ſee a little how the Affair of the <hi>War</hi> will turn.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ceas'd this important Affair of the <hi>Boarding-School</hi> for the preſent, and nothing more was here done about it till the Year 1747. But, in the mean Time, ſome Things were acted in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it in <hi>England,</hi> by ſome generous and publick ſpirited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to whom Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> had ſent Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letter, and his own Return or Recommendation of it; of which I ſhall give ſome Account in its proper Place: Only obſerving
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:007023_0121_102AEB2F9CE82D50"/>
here that it was a Grief to Mr. SERGEANT, that he could not now proceed in it; but he hop'd for a more favourable Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.— In a Letter to Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 7th he expreſſes himſelf thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q>It will be a great Grief to me, if we ſhould not be able to accompliſh the Deſign I have projected.— To God's Power and Grace I refer it.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Projection of a <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> and the Pains Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT was at to promote it, took up a conſiderable Part of his Time and Thoughts; for it lay very near his Heart: But, at the ſame Time, he proſecuted his Work among the <hi>Indians</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Faithfulneſs; and a very hard Service he had of it. For, having a mix'd Auditory, he was obliged, on each Part of every Lord's Day, both to pray and preach in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Language, that all might profit by his Miniſtry. He himſelf eſteem'd his Work to be double on this Account, and us'd it as one Argument, with the honourable <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> to move them to make ſome Addition to his Salary, which was very ſmall. His Words are;— <q>My Labour, by being oblig'd to preach in <hi>Indian,</hi> I ſuppoſe, is double to what it would be, if my Hearers underſtood <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </q>— And I apprehend it was more than double; for he wrote every Word he delivered to the <hi>Indians</hi> (as he further takes Notice in that Letter;) and that he might be very exact, he did, for a conſiderable Time, keep an Interpreter by him two Days in a Week, at his own Coſt, to aſſiſt him in the Tranſlation of his Sermons into the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue. And beſides, the <hi>Indians,</hi> being very ignorant, and not able to gain Knowledge by Reading, as thoſe who can read may do, he was oblig'd to ſpend much of his Time in converſing privately with them, that thereby he might infuſe Knowledge into their Minds; which having been ſo long, as an uncultivated Soil, wanted more abundant Labour.

in a Letter of <hi>December</hi> 11.— <q>I have receiv'd your moſt obliging Letter—and the <hi>ten Pounds</hi> inclos'd, which I accept with great Thankfulneſs. I return Praiſe to God in the firſt Place, as the original Author of every good Thing; and in the next Place to you, who have been made, under him, the Inſtrument of many Kindneſſes to me. You have my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers in Return, ſpringing from an Heart deeply ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the Kindneſs of God to me, by your Beneficence.

            </p>
            <p>As Mr. SERGEANT was laborious and faithful in the Work to which he was call'd; ſo there is good Reaſon to conclude, that he was ſucceſsful therein: not only from the Increaſe of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a viſible Reformation among the <hi>Indians</hi>; but alſo from the Temper of Mind ſome of them diſcover'd at the Time of their Death, ſome Inſtances of which I have given above, and ſhall here add two or three more, by ſuggeſting a few Hints concerning ſome young Perſons who died this Year, and the Beginning of the next. The very brief Account which Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT, in his Journal, gives of them is as follows— <q>
                  <hi>May</hi> 22. died a young Perſon, not baptiſed; but expreſſing a ſerious Diſpoſition of Mind. He was much in Prayer in his Sickneſs; deaf, and not able to ſpeak much; but, juſt before he died, took his Father by the Hand, exhorted him to mind Religion, to get baptiſed; ſaid, he hoped for Happineſs, ſpake <hi>theſe Things</hi> plain, and then died. <hi>January</hi> 19. 1745, 6. This Week died <hi>Katharine, Kunkapot</hi>'s eldeſt Daughter, with good Hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs, and without any Fears of Death. <hi>Feb.</hi> 16. This Week died <hi>Kewaunnoabkub,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Naunaunekennuk,</hi> with a ſtrong Hope of eternal Life.</q> What a deſireable Sight was it to behold ſuch young Perſons, who, a little before, were Strangers to divine Things, leaving the World with ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Hope of a glorious Immortality?</p>
            <p>The honourable <hi>Corporation</hi> for <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs in <hi>London,</hi> to whom Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> had ſent Mr. SERGEANT's printed Letter, and his own Recommendation of it, received it; and their <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> in a Letter to the honourable <hi>Andrew Oliver,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; <hi>Secretary</hi> to their honourable <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> inform'd him, that Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT'S
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:007023_0123_102AEB344FB63398"/>
Propoſal had gain'd the Approbation of the <hi>Society</hi> in <hi>London</hi>; that they were inclin'd to contribute to it; and that when there ſhould be a Proſpect of its taking Effect, they would conſider the Matter, and encourage it as they conveniently could. This Letter Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> communicated to Mr. SERGEANT, who wrote to the honourable <hi>Corporation,</hi> informing them, that the Affair of the <hi>Boarding-School</hi> had been delay'd by Reaſon of the <hi>War</hi>; that the Founding of it would coſt a conſiderable Sum, tho' he hop'd it might, afterwards, be carried on with but little Charge; that, upon a Computation made, it was tho't, that <hi>two Hundred Pounds</hi> Sterling would be needful; that he purpoſed to proceed in that Affair, as far as preſent Circumſtances would admit; and concluded by humbly recommending it to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Notice and Encouragement of that honourable <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> But I find not, among his Papers, any Anſwer to this Letter, nor any Account of Money advanced by the <hi>Corporation</hi> for that Buſineſs; and therefore ſuppoſe Nothing was done by them, while Mr. SERGEANT liv'd. Perhaps his Letter, in Time of War, might fail of reaching the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of thoſe <hi>Propoſals</hi> for a <hi>Boarding-School</hi> was ſent to Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> the Effect of which Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> inform'd Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT of in a Letter of <hi>May</hi> 21.— <q>I am now, dear Sir, (ſays the <hi>Doctor</hi>) to inform you, that laſt Night I received a Letter from Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> dated <hi>March</hi> 26, wherein he ſays to me, I have your Letter from Mr. SERGEANT, and have made a ſmall Collection among a few Friends for his Deſign, and pious Work in the Education of ſome of the neighbouring <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>; and now I incloſe a Bill of Exchange to you, for <hi>ſeventy Pounds</hi> your Currency, from Mr. <hi>Henry Caſwell</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> Merchant.</q> So he ſalutes Mr. SERGEANT, and wiſhes him Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I rejoice with you, Sir, in this firſt Fruit. And in a Letter of <hi>June</hi> 10. the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays,— <q>I lately inform'd you of a Bill <hi>ſeventy Pounds</hi> our Currency, from the excellent Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> of <hi>London,</hi>—The Money is in my Scriptore, wrote upon from him to you. I ſhall be glad to forward a Letter of Thanks from you to him.</q>—Accordingly, Mr. SERGEANT, in his next Letter to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> ſays;—<q>I have inclos'd a Letter, ſuch as it is, for Dr. <hi>Watts</hi>; be pleas'd to forward it to him with as much Safety as you can, and as ſoon as may be.</q> Of this
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:007023_0124_102AEB3643722808"/>
Letter to Dr. <hi>Watts,</hi> and of many others which Mr. SERGEANT wrote to one and another, I find no Copies, which lays me under no ſmall Diſadvantage in my Endeavours to give a good Account of theſe Things.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Thomas Coram of London,</hi> a Gentleman who has diſcover'd a generous and noble Spirit in divers Projections for the Benefit of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and for the Good of Mankind, in ſome of which he happily ſucceeded, receiv'd from Dr. Colman Mr. SERGEANT's Propoſal for a Boarding-School. When he had read the Scheme, he was very much pleas'd with it; and in a Letter dated London, January 23, he gave the Doctor Thanks for the Book,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. SERGEANT's printed <hi>Letter</hi> and Dr. <hi>Colman's Recommendation</hi> make a ſmall Book.</note> and allured him that he had taken no ſmall Pains to promote that good Work, and that he entertain'd Hopes, that the Prince of Wales would encourage that pious Deſign by becoming the firſt Subſcriber.</p>
            <p>Of this Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> inform'd Mr. SERGEANT in a Letter of May 7, which much reviv'd his Hopes reſpecting his <hi>Boarding-School</hi>; and in his Anſwer of <hi>May</hi> 29, he ſays to the <hi>Doctor</hi>: <q>Mr. <hi>Coram</hi> has ſhewn an excellent and moſt generous Spirit in the Matter, for which I thank God; and deſire you, when you write to him again, to give him my moſt hearty Thanks, for the Pains he has taken in this Affair; which I hope will add to the Weight and Glory of that Crown of Righteoufnefs which waits for him, when he has finiſhed the Work deſign'd him by Providence. And if he ſucceeds in this, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear worthy to be the laſt Service of ſo induſtrious a Labourer for the Good of others. If the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> leads in the Subſcription, it looks probable that it may ſecure the Succeſs of that Deſign, I have ſo earneſtly deſir'd to ſee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd. I am waiting to put ſomething in Execution among the pious and liberal in our <hi>own Country,</hi> when the Face of Things, in divine Providence, ſhall appear encouraging.</q>—</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Coram</hi> was ſo charmed (to uſe his own Expreſſion) with Mr. SERGEANT's Undertaking, that he exerted himſelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to promote it. He firſt got a Book bound, and a proper Preamble writ in it for Benefactors to Subſcribe to, for the Benefit of Mr. SERGEANT's <hi>School</hi>: Then he applied to ſome wealthy
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:007023_0125_102AEB37D4EFE0E8"/>
Perſons, both in City and Country: And tho' he found many, who expreſſed their Willingneſs to encourage ſo good a Deſign, by their Contributions; yet he could find no Perſon who was willing his Name ſhould ſtand firſt in the Subſcription: but all choſe to ſubſcribe after it was well begun by ſome proper Perſon. Theſe Objections put this generous Gentleman upon the tho't of prefering a Petition to His <hi>Royal Highneſs the Prince of Wales,</hi> that he would honour &amp; encourage this noble Deſign, by placing his Name at the Head of the Subſcription. He therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd the following Petition for that End.</p>

                        <p>That during his Reſidence in theſe Parts, he obſerv'd with Attention that many Advantages, that might and ought to have been long ſince ſecured there, greatly for the Honour of the Crown, and the Benefit of His Majeſty's Kingdoms, have hitherto been groſly obſtructed or neglected; particularly that of gaining over the many Tribes of the Heathen <hi>Indian Natives,</hi> in the vaſt Wilderneſs behind the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Settlements in <hi>New England,</hi> to the Intereſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and to the Knowledge &amp; Love of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> who, if well treated, and properly inſtructed by fit Perſons, reſiding continually among them, would be effectually attach to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt in all future Times, and prove of vaſt Service to the Crown, eſpecially in Time of War with <hi>France,</hi> whoſe <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> conſtantly reſide among their neighbouring Tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> near the <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>Canada,</hi> and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt render them very uſeful to the <hi>French</hi> in their Wars, and as injurious to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects in the ſaid Plantations:</p>

            <p>Capt. <hi>Coram,</hi> having ſucceeded ſo well with the <hi>Prince,</hi> in the next Place apply'd to the <hi>Duke of Cumberland,</hi> by the Right Hon. Mr. <hi>Points,</hi> deſiring he would contribute ten Guineas. The <hi>Duke</hi> generouſly reply'd, 'It would be Shameful to give ſo ſmall a Sum to ſo good a Purpoſe,' and ſubſcrib'd Twenty. The Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gewer</hi> gave each five Guineas. And here, ſo far as I can learn, this well begun Subſcription ended, which every one who reads the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Account will be ſurpriz'd at, unleſs I relate the Occaſion of it, otherwiſe I ſhould have paſs'd it over in Silence.</p>
            <p>A certain Gentleman in <hi>London,</hi> and a Lady of his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, (which Lady Capt. <hi>Coram</hi> had before appl'd to, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the firſt Subſcriber) had informed the <hi>Captain,</hi> that, when the Subſcription was well begun, they would contribute to that good Deſign.

Would not one have tho't, that ſeeing that Gentleman &amp; Lady fail'd, there was the more Need of applying to others, who had given Encouragement, that they would ſmile upon the Affair by their free Contributions? And is it not more than probable, that the Example of His <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the <hi>Duke of Cumberland</hi> his Brother, and alſo of the noble Perſons who had ſubſcrib'd, would have induced many to free and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Contributions to ſuch an excellent and pious Deſign?</p>
            <p>What Capt. <hi>Coram</hi> collected, he ſent to Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> of <hi>Boston,</hi> by whom it came to Mr SERGEANT's Hand. He wrote alſo a very large Letter, dated <hi>London, May</hi> 10, in which he inform'd Mr. SERGEANT of his Proceeding, in all the foregoing Steps; which Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd <hi>January</hi> 1747; when I find in his Journal theſe ſhort Hints, <q>Received Letters from <hi>London</hi> informing of a Benefaction for the <hi>Indians</hi> School;—went to <hi>Boſton</hi> to take Care of it.— The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> ſubſcrib'd 20 Guineas.</q>—</p>

As it ever has been, ſo it will, I truſt, ſtill be, my zealous Endeavour to communicate to this poor People the pure Doctrines of God, and the Words of eternal Life, as they are contain'd in the holy Scriptures; ever praying that they may be made wiſe to Salvation by them.</p>
                  <p>I am much oblig'd to my Friends, that they have recommened me, in ſo advantageous a Manner, to Gentlemen of ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed and high Stations as yours; and yet I cannot, without Reluctanc, receive their Compliments, To be ſure, Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> has ſpoken too highly of me, and I wiſh ſome Things he has ſaid had been ſuppreſſed. Mr. <hi>Belcher</hi> was ever exceeding kind to me, and highly deſerv'd of the <hi>Indians,</hi> having taken great Pains, while he was in the Chair of this Government, to promote Chriſtianity among them, and to engage them in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt: And it is a great Pleaſure to me, that he has not forgot his former Kindneſs. To his pious Zeal to promote this Intereſt, I attribute his kind Partiality towards me.</p>
                  <p>This Deſign I look upon to be of great importance, and am greatly encouraged in the Undertaking, in that it has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Approbation and good Influence of a Gentleman of your Character and Station, which give you ſo much Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to promote it. I have written largely to Mr. <hi>Coram,</hi> who will gladly embrace an Opportunity to communicate to you, what I have written to him.</p>
                  <p>It is with great Satisfaction I obſerve the Goodneſs, the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour &amp; pious Diſpoſition of your Mind, which certainly muſt be approv'd by that good Being, who is the Father of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and the great Saviour of the World, who has given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Ranſom for all. May his Kingdom be enlarged, and <hi>the Fulneſs of the Gentiles brought</hi> into his holy Church, I have had large Experience of the Truth of his gracious Promiſes, and eſteem your kind and condeſcending Notice of me, is an Inſtance of the Fulfilment of his Promiſe to them that deny themſelves for his, and the Goſpels Sake, May he graciouſly conſider this Inſtance of your Kindneſs, as an Act of Charity done to himſelf, when he ſhall come to judge the World, bringing his Rewards with him.

                  <p>Your moſt obliging Letter of <hi>May</hi> 10. 1746, containing an Account of your generous Endeavours to promote the Deſign of my publick Propoſal for the <hi>Indians,</hi> I have juit now receiv'd together with the Invoice of the Particulars you have ſent to the Care of Mr. <hi>Wallis</hi> in <hi>Boſton.</hi> By Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Favour, I was before, in ſome Meaſure, acquainted with your Zeal, your generous Concern &amp; Pains for us; which gave me great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, &amp; mov'd both my Thankſ givings to God &amp; Prayers for you. But your Letter, containing an Account of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in this Affair, gives me ſuch an Opinion of your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as exceeds what I could readily have imagined. It is a great Pleaſure to me, that you ſeem to be mov'd with ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a Spirit, and ſo much above the narrow and niggardly Conceptions of Bigots; which Temper is as great an Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to my Mind as it can be to yours. And I am ſure the Pleaſure you take, in ſuch generous Labours for Mankind, muſt be as much above the little Satisfaction of Bigots, in promoting their own party Schemes, as the Temper with which you are actuated is preferable to theirs. And your Reward with God will be in Proportion to the Excellency of that Charity that
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:007023_0132_102AEB466B423800"/>
moves you, in your generous Labours for us. Nothing, to be ſure, could have been better deſign'd than to get thoſe great Perſons you applied to, to honour the Deſign with their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions: And that it has been favour'd in our excellent <hi>Royal</hi> Family, is by me eſteem'd an additional Obligation of Duty to endeavour to promote a Spirit of Loyalty in the <hi>Indians,</hi> as far as my Influence now, or any Time hereafter, may reach.</p>
                  <p>It is now a little more than eleven Years ſince I was firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in this Part of the Country, with a Deſign to proſelite the <hi>Indians</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith. Having ſpent Part of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Year with them, in two Viſits I made them, I found ſuch Encouragement as induced me to devote myſelf to this Service: And have now, with a great deal of Pains, gain'd ſuch an Acquaintance with their barbarous Language as to converſe with them in it; and with a little Aſſiſtance, in my Study, from an Interpreter, to preach to them, and to read Prayers, which I have compoſed for the publick Worſhip, which they attend as constantly as People generally do in Engliſh Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies Their Language is extreamly hard to learn, and perhaps I shall never be a thoro' Maſter of it; there never having been any <hi>European</hi> that ever was, except one or two, and they learn'd it when they were Children. But the young People among them learn <hi>Engliſh</hi> well; moſt of them in this Place underſtand a great deal of it, and ſome ſpeak it freely &amp; correctly. There are many that can read <hi>Engliſh</hi> well, and ſome are able to write. When I came into theſe Parts firſt they were much diſperſed, four or five Families in a Place, and often moving from Place to Place. They are now gathered together at this Place, and are much more fixed than they uſed to be. Inſtead of their Bark Hutts, they own ſeventeen <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſes, fifteen of which they have built themſelves at their own Coſt, and ſome of them are comfortably furniſhed with Houſhold Stuff, There were in this Place but eight or ten Families when I firſt came, we now reckon near Fifty beſides old People &amp; tranſient young Perſons. The Families indeed are but ſmall, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the Natives. Near half that are born die in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy or Childhood, which I attribute to their Manner of Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and want of ſuitable Medicines in Time of Sickneſs. The grown People abundantly die with Conſumptions, begun with
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:007023_0133_102AEB485DF55790"/>
violent Colds. The moſt of the ſettled Families in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood are gathered to this Place, and the greater Part of them have received <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Our Number increaſes from Time to Time by the Addition of new Families, eſpecially of thoſe who are kindly diſpos'd to Chriſtianity, It is probable we ſhould have had more of them before now, if there had not come ſome <hi>Meravian</hi> Preachers among ſome of them near to us. I do not pretend to ſo much Acquaintance with that Sort of People, as to paſs any poſitive Judgment about them; the Converts they have made, are, I think, Enthuſiaſtick &amp; bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They have rendred themſelves ſo much ſuſpected in the Governments of <hi>New-York</hi> and <hi>Connecticut,</hi> that they would not tolerate them within their Bounds. They refuſed to take the Oath of Allegiance to <hi>King George,</hi> or even the Quakers ſolemn Declaration. What was the Meaning of this I cannot tell. They drew off a Number of <hi>Indians</hi> from theſe Parts, and ſome from this Place to <hi>Penſylvania.</hi> We have of <hi>Indians</hi> in regular ſtanding in the Church? 35, 13 <hi>Males</hi> and 22 <hi>Females,</hi> beſides five or ſix under a temporary Suſpenſion from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſome of which I hope may be recovered to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Out of our Communion have died eight or nine, moſt of whom ſeem to me to have left the World with a good Chriſtian Temper, and with a well grounded Hope, beſides ſome other younger Perſons, I could not but hope well of. The Succeſs I have had, thro' the divine Bleſſing, has been tho't as great as has attended any late Attempt of this Kind, and yet I have nothing to boaſt of; but have Reaſon to be humbled, that my Labours have been ſo much blaſted: I am ſure nothing affects me with more Grief than to obſerve the little Fruit of my Labours. Some of thoſe who have appear'd the moſt promiſing Converts, have, to my great Grief, and, ſome Times, even to my Aſtoniſhment, ſtrangely fallen away, which has almoſt wholly diſcouraged my further Attempts. The Truth is, the <hi>Indians</hi> are, perhaps, as fickle and irreſolute in their Determinations, as any People in the World: And when they ſeem to be wholly recovered from their Vice. eaſily relapſe into their ſooliſh &amp; wicked national Habits. I ſpeak of the Tribe to which I Miniſter, and ſuppoſe the ſame Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per generally prevails among all the <hi>American Indians.</hi> Their
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:007023_0134_102AEB4AB7C0CFD8"/>
great national and fundamental Vices are, <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, which are a great Obſtruction to the Propagation of Chriſtianity among them, with any due &amp; laſting Effect Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is an almoſt univerſal Jealouſy ſpread among the Tribes of <hi>Indians,</hi> and a Suſpicion of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> This, I am fore, is in a great Meaſure the Effect of <hi>French</hi> Policy and the Work of their Miſſionaries.</p>
                  <p>I cannot think of any Method more likely to conquer theſe Difficulties, and to lay the Foundation for the larger Spreading of the Goſpel, or attaching the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, than what I have publickly proposed. It it pieaſe God to give it Effect, it may, in Time, be a Means of a great Deal of Good: And yet, I dare not promiſe my ſelf fuddenly any extraordinary Succeſs from it. I ſee no Way that will, in human Probability, correct ſo ſucceſsfully their national Habits, as this I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. It is not ealy for thoſe, who are not acquainted with barbarous Nations to conceive, into what a Degree of Barbarity they are funk; nor how difficult it is to recover them. A great Deal has been done for our <hi>Indians.</hi> To their Honour, this Government has done much; but yet, ſo jealous were they at the firſt, that they could hardly be perſuaded to accept the Kindneſſes that were offer'd them, and ſome they actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſed. We are now got over this Difficulty, which has been a vail Hindrance to our Deſign.</p>
                  <p>Our Situation here is the belt, to lay ſuch a Foundation, of any to be found in <hi>New-England.</hi> By the Favour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, we have a good Townſhip of Land, capable of maintaining three Times the Number of Inhabitants that we have; and, I believe, it might be, in Time, repleniſhed with that Number, by this Means. And if we could perſuade a Number of young People, from the ſeveral remote Tribes, to receive an Education here, they might be a Means of Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Chriſtian Knowledge and Vertue very far among their Tribes: And there is Ground to hope, we might obtain this, by the Influence of two <hi>Eagliſh</hi> Miſſionaries in the Weſtern Parts. I mean Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> a worthy Gentleman, and my particular Friend, Miſſionary to the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> who received his Orders from the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and is maintained by the <hi>Society for Propagating the Goſpel</hi>; &amp;c. but as he is <hi>Chaplain,</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="unknown:007023_0135_102AEB4CA8FA20A8"/>
at the ſame Time, in the King's Garriſon at <hi>Albany,</hi> and oblig'd to ſpend halt his Time there, 40 Miles diſtant from them, and has no eſtabliſhed <hi>School Maſter</hi> or <hi>Catechiſt,</hi> labours under great Diſadvantages. The other Gentleman, I mear, is Mr. <hi>Brainard</hi> a zealous and well diſpos'd young Man, ſome Account of whom you have in a Pamphlet, which accompanies this. In a Word, Sir, I think the Deſign of a <hi>School,</hi> in the Manner I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, is of very great Importance, not to ſay abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in order to the effectual Propagation of the Chriſtian Religion among them; and unleſs this People are, beyond all other, under a Curſe from Heaven, this would probably do it: for, except their Complection, I ſee nothings in this People, but that they may be cultivated into as agreable a People as any other. They are naturally ingenious and good tempered as other People, and many of the little Children very pretty and agreable; and ſeem to want Nothing but a right Cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to form their Minds and Manners into every laudable. Quality and Action, human Nature is capable of. If I can be. the Inſtrument in the Hand of Providence, to lay ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as this, it would be a great Satisfaction to my Mind; and, I hope, Generations to come will have Occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my Name with Gratitude.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure, the Deſign is good; and, it ſeems to me, as it is neceſſary as it is good; for indeed, without this Method of Inſtruction &amp; Cultivation of their Children, our Labour ſeems to be, in great Meaſure, vain. I cannot but hope it may be effected, notwithſtanding the Diſcouragements it has hit herto met with. I believe there might have been ſome conſiderable Subſcriptions made in this Country, had not the War prevented. When it ſhall pleaſe God to put an End to this diſtreſſing Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, I ſhall uſe my utmoſt Endeavours with the Aſſiſtance of good and well-diſpos'd Gentlemen, to put the Matter forward.</p>

            <p>Upon this Letter of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s, Mr. SERGEANT wrote, <q>My laſt indeed from this good Man, whoſe Soul is gone to reſt in the Lord.</q> May I be ſuffer'd to add, A rare Inſtance indeed of a good Man's dying, as it were with his Pen in his Hand, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to promote the Good of his Country, the Proſperity of his Friends, and the eternal Salvation of precious; Souls! And who of all his Brethren, die Sons of <hi>New-England,</hi> has he left behind him, who ſo tenderly loves, ſo ardenrly cares for, and ſo vigorouſly endeavours to promote the Good of his native Country, as Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> did?

twelve Boys might be, without any further Delay, taken upon that Foundation, Mr. SERGEANT now entertain'd ſerious Tho'ts of proſecuting that Deſign, in the Manner he had propos'd. He therefore, in the firſt Place, mov'd the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> who are the Proprietors of the undivided Lands in that <hi>Townſhip,</hi> to give 200 Acres of Land, to build a <hi>School Houſe</hi> upon, and to be cultivated by the Children who ſhould receive their Educaticrr there. The <hi>Indians</hi> chearfully comply'd with the Motion, and gave 200 Acres of very good Land, about a Mile from the Meeting-Houſe, for that Purpoſe. The Manner &amp; Time of their giving of it, I am not acquainted with, but the Facl is well known.</p>
            <p>About the Middle of <hi>July,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT ſet out on a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Boſton,</hi> in order to forward this important Affair. He went by the Way of <hi>Northampton, Halfield</hi> and <hi>Hadley,</hi> that he might confer with thoſe Gentlemen whom he had nominated, in the Poſtſcript of his Letter to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1743, to be a <hi>Committee,</hi> or <hi>Trustees,</hi> to receive and diſburſe the Money which might be given to promote that good Deſign, and who had expreſt their Willingneſs to take that Trouble upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> the honourable <hi>John Stoddard, Eleazer Porter, Iſrael Williams</hi> and <hi>Oliver Partridge,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſqrs</abbr>; and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Edwards.</hi> Theſe are the honourable Gentlemen, the Committee, of whom Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> ſpeaks, in his Letter of <hi>May</hi> 21, above tranſcrib'd, to whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> paid, in Mr. SERGEANT's Preſence, Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s <hi>three Hundred and fifty Pounds,</hi> and other Moneys which were in his Hand. By the other Money, I ſuoppoſe he means Madam <hi>Holden</hi>'s <hi>one Hundred Pounds,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wall</hi>'s <hi>ſeventy Pounds,</hi> which he had received for the encouraging the <hi>Boarding-School,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe Gentleman Mr. SERGEANT deſired would meet at Col. <hi>Porter</hi>'s of <hi>Hadley,</hi> on the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> that he might there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with them, and take their Advice and Direction upon the Buſineſs before him. Col. <hi>Stoddard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> came not to the Meeting, and wholly declin'd having any Thing more to do in that Affair. The other Gentlemen, Col. <hi>Porter,</hi> Col. <hi>Williams</hi> and Col. <hi>Partridge</hi> met, before whom Mr. SERGEANT laid open the Affair, with what Clearneſxs he could propos'd to be made a <hi>Body Politick</hi> to act in that Buſineſs, and advis'd Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT to endeavour to accompliſh that Matter, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

I do not find that my Order, for the Maintenance, Cloathing and Inſtruction of twelve more Heathen Boys, has been comply'd with as yet.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> continuing to urge, that twelve Boys might, out of Hand, be ſupported and educated at his Expence, and the

War continuing, which forbid its being done with any Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT determined to provide them a ſuitable Maſter, and to ſend them abroad. He therefore went to Capt. <hi>Martin Kellogg,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Newington</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with whom he prevail'd to take the twelve Boys for one Year; and to inſtruct them both in Learning &amp; in hard Labour. The <hi>Indians,</hi> when it was propos'd to them, conſented that their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould go. Of this Affair Mr. SERGEANT gives us theſe ſhort Hints in his Journal. <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Things Mr. SERGEANT (I conclude) gave Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> an Account in a Letter; for in his next &amp; laſt to Mr. SERGEANT, dated <hi>London, October</hi> 5, he ſays;—<q>I have a Letter from you, wherein you mentioned concerning the <hi>Indian</hi> Boys. Pray let me know if you receiv'd of the Gentleman for my Account £. 350, <hi>New-England</hi> Currency, and in what Manner it may have been diſburſed. If expended let me have Account:—I have inclos'd a Bill of £. 114 <hi>New-York</hi> Currency; Value £. 60 Sterling. Pleaſe to be very particular in yourAnſwer to this.—Pray let the Gentleman, that has the Care of the Boys, be deſired to pray with them every Morning and every Night, and before and after every Meal, and that he endeavour to inſtill into their Minds Principles of Piety &amp; Godlineſs</q>—</p>

               <hi>Feb.</hi> 17th.

In theſe i very pften accompanied him; and, when ſometimes he could not attend, he would deſire me to ſerve in his Stead.

            <p>What Sum of Money Mr. SERGEANT had in Hand, or at Command, to enable him co erect a ſuitable Building for the <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> upon the Lands given by <hi>Indians</hi> for that End, 1 am not able to ſay; but he now reſolved to uſe what he had, for that Purpoſe, and endeavour'd to procure more.</p>
            <p>He wrote to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Andrew Eliot</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> deſiring him to put forward a Subſcription there. That Gentleman, who was a very hearty Friend to the Cauſe, propos'd a Method, that was likely to have ſucceeded, had it been put in Execution: but there aroſe ſo many Objections againſt the preſent Execution of Mr. SERGEANT's Scheme, that Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> was diſcourag'd, and nothing was done them.</p>
            <p>He wrote alſo to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Lebanon</hi> upon the ſame Subject, who communicated his Letter to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> Miniſter of ſecond Pariſh in that Place, call'd <hi>Goſhen</hi>: And in a Letter of <hi>May</hi> 7..

                  <p>Some Years are now paſt, ſince a Propoſal for the more effectual Education of the <hi>Indian</hi> Children, and the further Spreading otChriſtian Knowledge &amp; Piety among their ſeveral Tribes, written in a Letter to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e Reverend and pious Dr. <hi>Colman</hi> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> was publiſhed, with his Recommendation of theDeſign. Several Copies or the Propoſal were diſperſed, not only in theſe Parts, but alſo in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> particularly by the Means of that worthy and excellent Gentleman, and, if I miſtake not, he tranſmitted ſome Copies to your <hi>honourable Society.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Execution of that Deſign has been much hindred and delay'd by the War we have been engag'd in with <hi>France.</hi> But, as there is now a Proſpect of Peace, I hope that Deſign may, by the Bleſſing of God, take Effect. A private Gentleman in <hi>England</hi> ſets a noble &amp; generous Example, which, if it be follow'd as it deſerves, wiil, it is to be hoped, ſoon carry the Deſign ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as to anſwer ſome of the great and good Ends propos'd. That pious and charitable Gentleman propoſes at his own Coſt, to cloath, maintain and educate twelve Boys. The Deſign I think ſo good &amp; ſo neceſſary, conſidering the groſs Ignorance and Barbarity of our <hi>Indian</hi> Tribes, that I would not be wanting in any Thing in my Power to forward it. And ſince your <hi>honourable Society</hi> has ſhown ſo laudable a Zeal to propagate Chriſtian Knowledge and Piety, among the poor barbarous Aborigines of <hi>America,</hi> I tho't it proper, humbly, but yet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, to recommend it to your charitable Notice. If it comes within the Limits of your Province, I cannot think your Charity can be better beſtow'd.</p>
                  <p>The projected <hi>School</hi> is deſign'd much in the Manner of the Charily Schools in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which, we are told, have had won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful good Effects: and why may not the ſame Methods of Education us'd here, by the Bleſſing of the ſame gracious God, have the like good Effects? By ſufficient Experience, I have found, that more effectual Methods of Education, than what have yet been us'd, eſpecially in Reſpect of Manners and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in Buſineſs, are highly neceſſary for this barbarous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="unknown:007023_0144_102AEB5E4B520A70"/>I would gladly have, in the projected School, all the more uſeful and important Parts of Learning that ſerve in common Life, and that ſome, at leaſt, may be fitted there for an <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> Education; and ſo be qualified to inſtruct others; that, in Time, by the Bleſſing of God, the Kingdom of Chriſl may ſpread more ſucceſsfully far and wide, by their Means, among the remoter Tribes. One would hope this might be done, and anſwer, at the ſame Time, both a religious and a political View. Certainly, if, from us, Learning and good Manners could be propagated among them, it would be a Means of engaging them more firmly in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt: but if, with Learning and good Manners, true Religion might take Place among them, then they would become the Subjects of theKing of Heaven, and be joined to theNumber of Chriſt's Redeemed, which muſt needs be the Wiſh and earneſt Deſire of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>The liberal Gentleman, I had Reference to, confines his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>Boys,</hi> and theſe <hi>Heathen.</hi> I do not blame his Intentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>I hope this good Deſign will gain the Aprobation of your <hi>hounourable Society,</hi> and that they will be able to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards iot: at leaſt.

any Thing to promote it.

            <p>It appears by the foregoing Letter, that Mr. SERGEANT had now erected a Building for the Boarding School, and that it was like to be fit, <hi>in a few Months,</hi> for the Reception of the Scholars.

I muſt not only conſider you as a good Chriſtian, but alſo as a uſeful and good Subject, ſince every Convert you make muſt be look'd upon as a new Subject brought over to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt. And truly, the infinite Pains that are taken by the <hi>French</hi> (who ſeldom come behind us in civil Policy) to make <hi>Papiſts</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſhould teach us to uſe ſome Endeavours to make <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of them.

            <p>Mr. SERGEANT receiv'd this Letter but a little While before his Death, and, if I miſtake not, I have been inform'd, that he had not Opportunity to return an Anſwer to it. For the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therefore of thoſe into whoſe Hands this Hiſtory may fall, and who want to be inform'd in the Things after which Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi> enquires; and for the Satisfaction of the <hi>Doctor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if it ſhould ever reach him, I ſhall briefly touch upon what has not been ſufficiently illuſtrated in the foregoing Account.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the Scheme which Mr.</hi> SERGEANT <hi>was purſuing</hi>;—ſome Account was given of it in his Letter of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. 1743, to Dr. <hi>Colman,</hi> to which it may not be amiſs here to add; that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, that the <hi>Indian</hi> Boys, under the Care of a faithful Maſter, who ſhould labour with and inſpect them, ſhould ſubdue and cultivate the 200 Acres of Land upon which they live; that they ſhould raiſe upon it all Sorts of Proviſions; that they ſhould keep upon the Farm a Stock of Cattle, Sheep, Hogs, &amp;c. that the Girls ſhould be employ'd in Manufacturing the Wool, Flax, Milk, &amp;c. that ſhould be rais'd upon it: They alſo, being under the Care of a faithful Miſtreſs, who ſhould inſtruct them in all Sorts of Buſineſs ſuitable to their Sex. By this Means, they
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:007023_0147_102AEB63DEFCB958"/>
might, after ſome Time, in great Meaſure, if not wholly, ſupport themſelves; be form'd to Induſtry; be acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language and Manners; and be fit, at about 20 Years of Age, to ſet up upon Farms of their own. By taking the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Children when young, and bringing them up in the Way of Induſtry (as well as Learning) Mr. SERGEANT deſign'd to cure them of Idleneſs, which they are much addicted to, and which is a Seed Plot of all Manner of Vice among the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>the Situation of the Place where Mr.</hi> SERGEANT <hi>ſettled</hi>;—I obſerv'd before, that <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> is in the S. W. Corner of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Province, butting upon <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> South, and upon <hi>New-York Government</hi> Weſt. For tho' by Charter the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Province</hi> extends Weſt to the South Sea, and muſt therefore Butt upon the Gulf of <hi>California</hi> near the North Part of it, yet the <hi>Dutch</hi> being previouſly ſettled upon <hi>Hudſon's River,</hi> cut this <hi>Province</hi> in two, and at preſent we inhabit no further Weſt than to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Settlements. <hi>Stockbridge</hi> lies at the North End of what goes by the Name of <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> about 16 or 18 Miles North of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Line, upon a Stream which goes by the Name of <hi>Houſatunnuk River,</hi> and empties itſelf into the Sea, between <hi>Milford</hi> and <hi>Stratford</hi> in <hi>Connecticut Colony.</hi> This <hi>River,</hi> tho' it be Navigable for 8 or 10 Miles from the Mouth of it, and extends itſelf croſs the <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and almoſt croſs the <hi>Province</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> more than 120 Miles into Land, yet is not laid down in any of the Maps, which I have ſeen of this Country.</p>
            <p>The Place of this <hi>River</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> is about 40 or 45 Miles Weſt of <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> and about 25 or 30 Miles Eaſt of <hi>Hudſon's River.</hi> It's Courſe at <hi>Houſatunnuk</hi> is from North to South, and after it enters <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> it bears conſiderably to the Eaſt of South, till it falls into the Ocean at <hi>Stratford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Northampton,</hi> upon <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> is in, or near, the ſame Parallel of Latitude with <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>New-England</hi> has, in his Map, laid down <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Hudſon's Rivers,</hi> which in the Latitude of <hi>Northampton &amp; Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> are about 70 or 80 Miles aſunder. Any one therefore, by looking into Mr. <hi>Neal</hi>'s Map, and drawing a Weſt Line from <hi>Northampton,</hi> of 40, or 45 Miles extent, may eaſily fix the Place of <hi>Stockbridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:007023_0148_102AEB65D5B13518"/>As for <hi>the Condition of the Place</hi>;—the foregoing Hiſtory, with what may be further ſaid, will perhaps be tho't ſufficient.—And as for <hi>the Condition of the Country round it</hi>;—South, upon <hi>Houſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunnuk River,</hi> it has lately been purchaſed of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and is ſettled by Inhabitants of this <hi>Province.</hi> The Name of the Town is <hi>Sheffield</hi>; it is divided into two Pariſhes, in each of which there is a Miniſter ſettled. Eaſt of <hi>Stockbridge</hi> there is a Wilderneſs of about 40 Miles extent, which reaches to the Engliſh Settlements upon <hi>Connecticut River</hi>; it is Mountainous, and loaded with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Quantities of Timber, of almoſt all Sorts.<note n="†" place="bottom">In <hi>Stockbridge</hi> Bounds, and, in the adjacent Wilderneſs, is found Plenty of that famous Eaſt India Root, <hi>Gin Sang.</hi> In the Summer 1751, it was firſt found.</note> Weſt is a Wood of about 20 Miles extent, reaching to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>New-York Government.</hi> And North lies that <hi>great and terrible Wilderneſs,</hi> of ſeveral Hundred Miles extent, which reaches to <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Progreſs Mr.</hi> SERGEANT <hi>made,</hi> may, I hope, in ſome good Meaſure, be judged of, by the whole Account I have here given. And with Reſpect to <hi>the Number of Mr.</hi> SERGEANT's <hi>Congregation, and of what Sort of Perſons it conſiſts</hi>;—Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> a little after Mr. SERGEANT's Death, wrote to me, that there were 53 <hi>Indian</hi> Families in the Town, that they own'd 20 Houſes built after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mode, and that the whole Number of Indians living at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> was then 218; of which 129 have been baptized. Of theſe 42 were Communicants, 18 Males and 24 Females. The whole Number of <hi>Indians</hi> baptiſed by Mr. SERGEANT, both living and dead, was 182. The Number of Scholars belonging to Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi>'s School was 55, about 40 is the Number which attend the School at once. There are alſo about 12 or 13 Engliſh Families dwelling there.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the School lately ſet up for the Indian Children,</hi> (by which Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi> intends the <hi>Boarding-School,</hi> and not that under the Care of Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi>) I have before given an Account of Mr. SERGEANT's taking 12 <hi>Indian</hi> Boys upon that Foundation, and at Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Coſt, and committing them to the Care of Capt. <hi>Kellogg</hi> of <hi>Newington,</hi> for a Year. Thoſe Boys made Progreſs in Reading and Writing beyond the Captain's Expectation, and in the general behav'd well. Some Time in the Winter Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT wrote to Capt. <hi>Kellogg,</hi> deſiring him to come up to <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:007023_0149_102AEB682A3534D0"/>
with them in <hi>April,</hi> theCaptain <hi>did ſo</hi>; and upon examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boys Mr. SERGEANT was well pleas'd with the Progreſs they had made in their Learning. Mr. SERGEANT now urg'd Mr. Kellogg to take the Care of the Boys one Year at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> to which he contented: And after inſtructing them a While in a private Houſe, he went with them into the Boarding-School, which was now prepar'd for their Reception, tho' far ſhort or being finiſhed. The Dimentions of this Boarding-School, which Mr. SERGEANT had erected, are, 38 Feet long, 36 wide: It has three Fire Rooms on one Floor, and two convenient Rooms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, with a large Cellar under it. Of theſe Things Capt.<hi>Kellogg</hi> gave me an Account, in a Letter, foon after Mr. SERGEANT's Death: And this, ſo far as I underſtand it, was the State of that School when he died. His Deſign was, this Summer, if his Life had been ſpar'd, to have gone with Capt. <hi>Kellogg,</hi> (who in his Youth was twice taken Captive by the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> and therefore had ſome Acquaintance with the <hi>Mobawk</hi> Language and Cuſtoms) into the <hi>Mohawk</hi> Country, or to the <hi>Six</hi>-Nations as they are call'd, to invite them to ſend their Children, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Education in the Boarding School; and to have opened the Doors of it to the Children of any of the Tribes of Indians, who would fend them there to be educated.</p>
            <p>The laſt Thing that Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi> defir'd to be inform'd of is, <hi>Whether Mr.</hi> SERGEANT <hi>had any Salary or certain Appointment for his Labours or not</hi>? Before Mr. SERGEANT's Ordination he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at the Rate of £. 100 a Year our Currency. At his Ordination they fix'd his Salary at £. 150, when £. 1 7s. 6d. of our Paper Currency was equal to an Ounce of Silver. They continued ic at £. 150 for the Space of fix Years (as Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> informs me) during which Time our Paper Currency was near the ſame in Value, it having depreciated no more than from £. 1 7s. 6d. to £. 1. 9s. an Ounce: But continuing ſtill to fink in its Value, the Commſſioners allow'd him £. 200, aad then £. 250, and ſo it continued till the laſt Year of his Life, when they gave him £. 300; £. 2 17s. 9d. of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Currency then, not being more valuable than an Ounce of Silver.</p>
            <p>If by thoſe Additions, the ſinking of Money was made good (as I am ſenſible he tho't it was not; and his Salary was equal in
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:007023_0150_102AEB69B4AF1B38"/>
Value, to what it was at his firſt Settlement, Silver being the Standard: Yet, it it be conſider'd with Relation to the Neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life, for which it was expended, his Salary was not half ſo good the laſt Year as it was the firſt: for Wheat, when he ſettled at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> was to be had for <hi>eight Sbillings</hi> a Buſhel, and other Proviſions in Proportion; but when his Salary was £. 300, it was not to be had under <hi>forty,</hi> or <hi>forty-five Sbillings</hi> a Buſhel, and other Proviſions were proportionally dear. The Sum itſelf confidered, every one muſt be ſenfible that his Salary was ſmall, for it was but equal to £. 36 7s. 3d. our preſent Lawful Money, at 6s. 8d. the Ounce: and no more than £27 6s. 2d. Sterling. And can it be tho't, that he could ſupport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Family with that Sum, eſpecially ſeeing all the Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Life were then, and are ſtill, very dear in that remote Part of the Country. Had it not been for the Helps he receiv'd from Dr. <hi>Colman</hi>'s Hand, and from other generous and well diſpos'd Perſons, he could not have ſubſiſited at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> ſo long a Time: And after all the Helps he had, he was, while he liv'd, involv'd in many Difficulties, by Reaſon of the Scantineſs of his Support; and when he died, he left his Eſtate involv'd in a Debt of between 7 and £. 800 <hi>New-England</hi> Currency, even tho' he had ſold ſome of it before to anſwer his neceſſary Expences. A Friend of his, who was well acquainted with his Circumſtances, in a Letter to me, written ſince his Death, uſes the following Expreſſions.— <q>I ſhould have mentioned to you the preſſing Want Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT has often been in, for want of a ſufficient Support in his laborious Work. Had not a good Providence, in aſurpriſing Manner, provided and ſent ſome Aſſiſtance to him, it is not at all probable he would have left any Thing that could have been a Benefit to his Family. And had it not been for his ſingular Prudence, and thoſe Helps, he muſt have ſold moſt of what the Government gave him<note n="*">His Right of Land in <hi>Stockbridge.</hi>
                  </note> long ago.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to anſwer the Rev. Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi>'s Enquiries, which had Mr. SERGEANT liv'd to have done, he doubtleſs would have perform'd in a much better Manner, and more to the Satisfaction of thoſe who want to be inform'd.</p>
            <p>It would be a faulty Omiſſion, ſhould I neglect to ſay, that when his Excellency <hi>Governour Beicher</hi> came into his Government of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> Mr. SERGEANT wrote to him, congratulated him
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:007023_0151_102AEB6BA3552698"/>
on that Occaſion, expreſt his Joy and Satisfaction that he was appointed Governour of his native Country, and returned him his moſt hearty Thanks for the favourable Mention his Excellency had made of him in <hi>England,</hi> particularly to Dr. <hi>Ayſcough,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coram.</hi> The <hi>Governour,</hi> yet retaining his former Kindneſs and Friendſhip tor Mr. SERGEANT, wrote, in a moſt kind and obliging Manner, to him; aſſuring him of his Readineſs to ſerve him, in what lay in his Power, and recommending to him the keeping up a careful &amp; dutiful Correſpondence with Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coram,</hi> Gentlemen who were both willing and able to aſſiſt him, in his laudable and pious Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The very great Regard Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi> had for, and his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity to, Mr. SERGEANT, I know not how better expreſs, than in the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s own Words; as they are contain'd in a Paſſage of a Letter which he wrote to his <hi>Excellency Governour Belcher,</hi> dated <hi>December</hi> 9. 1748. where ſpeaking of Mr. SERGEANT he ſays,— <q>I moſt highly honour, and regard, that worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and am proud to call him Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How much greater is his Merit, and how much greater will be his future Reward, than that of many of the moſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and diſtinguiſhed among us? You may be aſſured of my heartieſt Endeavours to promote the good Deſign he is engaged in.— I am in great Hopes of being able to procure ſome Penſion to be ſettled on him, that he may have ſome little Reward for his indefatigable Labours, even in this Life. In the mean Time, I ſhould be glad to have the Sum of <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd <hi>to Him</hi>; but I am ignorant of the Means of doing it, I can only ſay, that if you or he will draw upon me for that Sum, I ſhall think myſelf bound to honour your Bill at Sight.</q> A Bill was accordingly drawn, and the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſent over <hi>twenty Pounds</hi> Sterling to <hi>Governour Beicher,</hi> who, in a Letter of <hi>May</hi> 16, 1749, (about two Months before Mr. SERGEANT's Death) inform'd him of the handſome Remittance the Rev. Dr. Ayſcough had made him; and tells him, that he would pay the Money to his Order: Which was accordingly done: Either juſt before or a little after Mr. SERGEANT's Death.</p>
            <p>I have here been the more exact, and have quoted Dr. <hi>Ayſcough</hi>'s own Words, that I might effectually remove a Miſtake that ſome have gone into, who have tho't and ſaid that the <hi>twenty Pounds</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="unknown:007023_0152_102AEB6DC66B5368"/>
was miſapply'd; that Dr. <hi>Ayſscough</hi> deſign'd it for the Boarding-School, and not for Mr. SERGEANT's own Uſe. Madam <hi>Sergeant,</hi> to ſatisfy others, I ſuppoſe, rather than herſelf (for the Caſe was doubtleſs plain to her) deſir'd <hi>Governor Belcher</hi>'s Sentiments upon that Head, which he gave her in the following Words,</p>

            <head>The CHARACTER, &amp;c. Of the Reverend Mr. John Sergeant.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Reverend Mr. JOHN SERGEANT was born at <hi>Newark,</hi> in New-Jerſey, in the Year 1710. His Father died when he was but a Child, after which his Mother was again married to Col. <hi>John Cooper,</hi> a Gentleman, who not only prov'd a tender Huſband to her, but alſo a kind and generous Father to her Children; having none oF his own. Mr. SERGEANT, to his Childhood receiv'd a Wound by a Sythe in the Ball of his left Hand, near the Joint of his Wriſt, which ſo affected the Sinews and Nerves, that his Hand, perished to that Degree, that it was much leſs than the other, and in great Meaſure uſeleſs. This Accident was the Occaſion of his leaving off the ſecular Buſineſs he was deſign'd for, and of his betaking himſelf to Learning; in which, being a Perſon of a bright Genius, he made great Progreſs: Whereupon his Father in Law, Col. <hi>Cooper,</hi> reſolv'd to give him a liberal Education. He enter'd <hi>Yale-College, at New-Haven,</hi> in the <hi>Golany</hi> of <hi>Connecticut, September</hi> 1725, where the Comelineſs of his Perſon, the Sweetneſs of his Temper, the Docency of his Behaviour, the Agreableneſs of his Converſation, the Diligence with which he apply'd himſelf to and the Progreſs he made in, his Studies, gain'd him the Eſteem, not only of his Companions, but alſo of the Governours of the College. He proceeded Bachelor of Arts, <hi>September</hi> 1729, and commenc'd Maſter 1732, before which he was elected Tutor of the College, in which he had his Education. In that Poſt he continu'd four Years, to the Satisfaction of those who repos'd in him that Truſt, and to the Advantage of those whi were under his Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="unknown:007023_0154_102AEB71F79FA3A8"/>By this Time, he was determin'd for the Work of the Miniſtry; and tho' he was well pleas'd with the Buſineſs he was now in, and ſtood as fair as any Man <hi>whatever,</hi> for a Call &amp; Settlement in any, even the beſt Pariſh, that might become vacant; yet he prefer'd a <hi>Miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Heathen:</hi> not from any Views he could have of Worldly Advantage from thence, but from a pious, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and ardent Deſire of being an Inſtrument in the Hand of God of Good to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who were funk below the Dignity of human Nature, and even to the loweſt Degrees of Ignorance and Barbarity.</p>
            <p>There was ſomething very uncommon, and which ſeems to have been from above, in the Diſpoſiſion and Inclination there was in him to this ſelf-denying Service: For before there was any Proſpect of his being imploy'd among the <hi>Natives,</hi> his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mind was ſo affected with tHe Thot's of their periſhing State, that it had been his Practice, for a long Time, to make it Daily an Article in his ſecret Addreſſes to God, that he would ſend him to the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and make him an Inſtrument in <hi>turning them from Darkneſs to Light</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God granted him that which he requeſted</hi>; for which he return'd his grateful Acknowledgements to <hi>him who beneath Prayer.</hi> And of these Things he inform'd Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> his Fellow Labourer, at his firſt going to <hi>Houſalunnuk</hi>; but strictly injoin'd him to keep them ſecret, which he according did till ſince Mr. SERGEANT's Death.</p>
            <p>He was Perſon to whom Nature prov'd laviſh of her beſt Gifts; or, in Words more agreable to the Christian Scheme, God graciouſly beſtow'd upon him excellent Endowments, both of Body and Mind. In Stature ha was ſmall; yet, of a very exact and comely Proportion, except his Hand before mention; his Hair dark; his Eyes black and lively: <hi>He was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful Countenance, and goodly to look to.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1. Sam. xvi. xii.</note> He was favout'd with a firm, healthy and good Conſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs's, with the greater Eaſe, thro' the many Difficulties and Hardſhips that attended him in the Courſe of his <hi>Miſſion.</hi> He was of a moſt ſweet, kind and benevolent natural Temper; without the leaſt Conſtitutional Turn towards Gloomneſs, Melancholy, of Jealouſy? His Converſation open, free, courteous, pleaſant and very attractive; ſo that all, who had the Happineſs to enjoy it, were pleas'd and delighted by it. The Powers of
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:007023_0155_102AEB73AAADFEB0"/>
his Mind were bright and ſtrong; whence he was able to uſe cloſe Application, and with Eaſe made great Progreſe in Learning: Few of his Years exceeded him.</p>
            <p>His natural Accompliſhments were poliſhed, enlarg'd, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a liberal Education; and rendered him deſireable and amiable to all, and very uſeful in his Day.</p>
            <p>True and undiſſembled Piety gave Luſtre and Beauty to all his other Endowments, both natural and acquir'd; and prepar'd him to be eminently ſerviceable in the Station God affign'd him. In his tender Years he was of a very innocent Turn of Mind, and of a blameleſs Behaviour; free from thoſe Vanities &amp; Vices which young People too often indulge to, and careful to follow the Ways of Virtue: Which might have inclin'd one to think, that he was the Subject of the <hi>Grace of God</hi> from the Womb. But, in his riper Years, while he was at College, he was under thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from above, which he apprehended wrought a <hi>ſaving Change</hi> in him, and form'd him to the divine Life. And what better Evidence could he have, that he was not miſtaken, than what was conſequent upon this Change, viz. a Temper &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation becoming the Goſpel of Chriſt, adorning the Chriſtian Profeſſion he then made? Of this Change, wrought by the Spirit of God upon his Heart, he very modeſtly and privately ſpake to ſome of his intimate Friends, from whom I have my Information: But I find not that he left one Word in all his Writings, reſpecting his religious Experience, Devotion, &amp;c. except one Paſſage in a Letter he wrote to a Friend, by whom he ſeems to have been compel'd to <hi>boaſt himſelf a little,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle of the Gentiles</hi> was before him. The Paſſage is this— <q>With Reſpect to my own Chriſtian Experience, I believe, I could give you that Account which would ſatisfy you, in your own Way of thinking; tho' 'tis now ſo long ſince I paſs'd thro' that Scene of Conviction, Humiliation, and, what I ſuppos'd was Converſion, that a great many Particulars are now eſcaped from my Memory.</q>—Some, perhaps, may blame Mr. SERGEANT, that he did not commit to Writing thoſe Things which paſt over him at uch a Seaſon, that he might have review'd them for his own Comfort, and left them behind him for the Benefit of others. It was owing to his very great Modeſty and Humility, and to his Care not to do any Thing, that might be thought to ſavour of Oftentation in
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:007023_0156_102AEB75ADB13078"/>
Religion (which is a Thing very hurtful to its Intereſt) that he kept thoſe Things to himſelf. And whether he did not, by that Modeſty, Humility &amp; Guard againſt Oftentation, give a clearer Evidence of the Truth of Religion in himſelf, and diſcover a greater Concern for the Honour and Intereſt of Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, than he could have done, by Writing his own Life, publiſhing his own Experiences, and proclaiming his own Goodneſs, I leave others to determine? His Life alſo ſo abounded in the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, and was ſo conform'd to the Goſpel of Chriſt, that we have abundant Reaſon to conclude the <hi>Tree was goody,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Fruit was ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was very conſtant and frequent in the Devotions of the Cloſet, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ring out his Soul to God in ſervent Addreſſes of Prayer, Praiſe,  which he found to be not <hi>in vain</hi>: for, as he himſelf tho't, God graciouſly granted him frequent Anſwers of Prayer.</p>
            <p>He was a devout Worſhiper of God in his Family, fail'd not of Morning &amp; Evening Devotions; on which Occaſions he read, with great Seriouſneſs and Solemnity of Spirit, a Portion of the holy Scriptures, generally making uſeful Observations for the Benefit of his Family. He always read the New Teſtament out of the-original <hi>Greek,</hi> with which he was well acquainted. With great Solemnity and Reverence he approach'd the Throne of Grace, and offer'd his devout Addreſſes to God, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, the Mediator; thro' whoſe Merits, and Mediation only, he hop'd for, and expected, the Acceptance of his Prayers, and of his Perſon. There were Inſtances of his Voice failing, and of his being oblig'd to make a Pauſe in Family Prayer; the Occaſion of which was, a lively Senſe &amp; overbearing Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the glorious Perfections &amp; incomprehenſible Excellencies of the divine Being, as he inform'd one who enquir'd into the Reaſon of thoſe Interruptions.</p>
            <p>He lov'd the Houſe of God and his publick Worſhip, greatly rejoic'd at the Return of holy Sabbaths, enjoy'd much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in his Houſe, but in no Part of divine Worſhip ſo much as in the <hi>Communion of the Supper</hi>: in which he had ſuch evident Communications of divine Love, ſuch Aſſurance of the compleat Satisfaction of Chriſt, of the Sufficiency of his Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the Prevalency of his Interceſſion at the right Hand of God, as almoſt tranſported him, Theſe Emotions were what
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:007023_0157_102AEB77A8540538"/>
attended him in his younger Years, and were not very frequent: But as he advanc'd in Years, and in Grace, he prefer'd the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which proceeds from the calm, rational Exerciſe of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Piety and Devotion, to thoſe Emotions of the Mind. Theſe Things he never openly ſpake of, nor would they ever have been known, had not his moſt intimate Friends, to whom he privately ſpake of them, made them known, after his Death. Thus he walked with God in devout Exerciſes of a publick, private, and ſecret Nature, and enjoy'd much Delight and Satisfaction in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>He was of a moſt tender Conſcience; endeavour'd to keep at the greateſt Diſtance from every Thing that ſavour'd of Impiety, that caſt Contempt upon the Authority of God, or that brought Reproach upon Religion; and us'd his beſt Endeavours <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of Offence, towards God and towards Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had a very great Love to, and the higheſt Veneration for, the ſacred <hi>Oracles of God</hi>; eſteem'd them infinitely preferable to the Treaſures of the World, and incomparably more valuable than the beſt human Compoſures: and the Study of them was his great Delight. He view'd, with Aſtoniſhment and Surprize, the glorious Methods of divine Love and Grace in the Salvation of Sinners by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as diſcover'd in the BIBLE, that pure Source of Light. And while he formed his own Sentiments by the pure <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> and followed the Way of Truth, according to the beſt Judgment he could make, he was of a moſt benevolent and charitable Spirit towards thoſe who differ'd from him. He lov'd Chriſtians of all Denominations, who gave Evidence of their Love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> much lamented the Diſtance, Alienation, and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that appear among Chriſtians of different Sentiments in leſſer Matters, and long'd to ſee them united in Love and Peace.</p>
            <p>His Catholick Temper recommended him to the Eſteem of many; to <hi>Governour Belcher</hi>'s in particular; who, in a Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Letter, written to Mrs. <hi>Sergeant</hi> alter his Death, has this Paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Mr. SERGEANT being now made free among the Dead, it can be no Flattery to ſay, he was a Gentleman of uncommon Piety and Learning, and of great Generoſity and true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the Souls and Bodies of Men: and more eſpecially to that poor benighted People, God had committed to his Care;
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:007023_0158_102AEB79EF731070"/>
and who before were periſhing for lack of Knowledge. God had, to a peculiar Manner, adapted and adorned Mr. SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GEANT with many ſuitable Graces for moving in ſo difficult a Sphere in the Church of God here, and for advancing the Kingdom &amp;Intereſt of the Redeemer. His many ſocial Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and particularly his <hi>Catbolick Way of Thinking</hi> for the better promoting of Chriſtianity, juſtly and highly merited my Eſteem, and I had great Pleaſure in his Acquaintance from firſt to laſt</q>
            </p>
            <p>He was full of benevolent, kind and generous Sentiments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Mankind, which diſpos'd him to <hi>do Good to all as he had Opportunity.</hi> He was a Friend to every Body, wiſh'd well to all, and lov'd to think the beſt of all Perſons, and of all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men. His noble and generous Mind diſdain'd a low, mean, unworthy Action; and he always treated others, of all Conditions, wjtb great Propriety. Strict and exact Juſtice he made his Rule, an his Dealings with all Perſons: yet rather than Cauſe Contention, by inſiſting upon his own Right, he chooſe to foregoe it. He was compaſſionate and tender-hearted to the Afflicted; was liberal and bountiful to tne Poor: and <hi>deviſed liberal Things,</hi> both for their temporal and eternal Good. He ſuffer'd not an hard, envious or ill-natur'd Word to proceed out of his Mouth; nor did he treat any one, whether preſent or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, with Inſolence or Contempt. He was careful <hi>to ſpeak Evil of no Man</hi>: And when he was injuriouſly treated,, and, as he feared,', maliciouſly aſperſed, by others, it did not raiſe in him Heat, and Reſentment, but rather Pity and Compaſſion to thoſe who us!d him ill. He often ſaid, he could freely forgive, as he expected to be forgiven of God; could heartily, pray for thoſe who had been abuſive &amp; injurious to him: aod he earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to others the Duty of praying for Enemies, as an happy Expedient to promote a Spirit of Love, Kindngſs &amp; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs towards them.</p>
            <p>He had a moſt happy Command of his Paſſions, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a conſtant Calmaneſs &amp; Sweetneſs of Temper: Was never melacholy; yet always fetious: Never fill'd with Mirth; yet always chearful bright and active: And ſeem'd always have the quiet Poſſeſſion of himfeſf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:007023_0159_102AEB7BCAD8CF48"/>I know not to whom the Character of <hi>Nathaniel</hi> may, with more Juſtice, be apply'd than to him. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed in whom is no Guile.</hi> He was very diſtant from a craſty, deſigning guileful Spirit; and admir'd by thoſe who were mod acquainted with him, on the Account of his fingular Integrity, Sincerity and Uprightneſs.</p>
            <p>He carefully and induſtriouſly improved his Time, and could not (as he was wont to ſay) look back upon an Hour loſt, without Uneaſineſs and Guilt. It was his Manner to riſe early, and, as ſoon as the Devotions of the Morning were over, he apply'd himſelf to Study; in which, being favour'd with a firm Conſtitution, he was able to bear great Intenſeneſs and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. The Time he found needful for the relaxing of his Mind, &amp; for bodily Exerciſe,(both which were neceſſary to him) he ſpent in a Manner which might beſt conduce to his own Health; the Benefit of his Family; or the Service of thoſe who were under his Care: wiſely and prudently endeavouring, that the Hours in which he refreſh'd his labouring Mind might be imploy'd to ſome good and laudable Purpoſe: <hi>gathering up the Fragments</hi> of his Time, that none of it might <hi>be loſt.</hi> He was indeed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Inſtance of Labour and Induſtry; and by cloſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he brought to paſs a great Deal in a little Time; as all would be ready to grant, could they be made ſenſible how much he did in the few Years he ſpent with the <hi>Indians</hi>; which I ſhall endeavour to ſhow, tho' it will be but in a faint and imperfect Manner, in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſoon became ſenſible, that the Method he was at firſt oblig'd to uſe of inſtructing the <hi>Indians</hi> by an Interpreter, would not anſwer his End; for it was not only a very ſlow, but alſo a very uncertain, Way of communicating to them Things of the greateſt Importance. He himſelf was not able to know what was delivered to them by the Interpreter, and had Reaſon to fear that the Truths, which he endeavour'd to communicate, were not well convey'd to their Minds: for the beſt Interpreters that could then be had, did not well underſtand the Principles of Religion, nor the Engliſh Terms in which Mr. SERGEANT deliver'd them. He therefore tho't it abſolutely neceſſary, that he ſhould learn the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, that he might be more certain what was delivered to them, and make better Progreſs in teaching <hi>of them.</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:007023_0160_102AEB7E40B8DC38"/>
He therefore entered upon the new and difficult Study of their Tongue, and proſecuted it with utmoſt Application. He found it, upon Trial, extreamly difficult to learn, being entirely different from any Language he was acquainted with; and often expreſs'd his Fears, that he ſhould never be able to make himſelf Maſter of it. He alſo tho't it a more difficult Taſk than it would have been to gain the Knowledge of all the learned Languages taught in the Schools. However, in ſomething leſs than three Years, he gain'd ſo much Knowledge in it, as to be able to pray with the <hi>Indians</hi> in their own Tongue, and to preach to them in the ſame, by the Aſſiſtance of an Interpreter; who aided him in the Tranſlation of his Sermons. And, in about two Years more, by conſtant Uſe, he obtain'd an exact Pronunciation of their Tongue, tho' very hard to gain: ſo that the <hi>Indians</hi> were wont to ſay, <hi>Our Miniſter ſpeaks our Language better than we ourſelves cam do.</hi> When Mr. SERGEANT had, by a vaſt Deal of Labour, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of this <hi>ſtrange Language,</hi> he found it to be a dry, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and imperfect Dialect, and by no Means ſufficient to convey to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Hearers the Knowledge of divine Things: for the <hi>Indians</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of divers Things; he was oblig'd therefore to ſupply that Defect by introducing Engliſh Words, ſuch as Jeſus, Chriſt &amp;c. which, in Time, by frequent Uſe, the <hi>Indians</hi> well underſtood. By this Help he ſo perfected their defective Language, as to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it tolerably ſufficient for his Purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Miniſterial Labours were extreamly hard, more than double to thoſe of other Miniſters, in ordinary Caſes. He was oblig'd to compoſe four Sermons every Week two for the <hi>English,</hi> and two for the <hi>Indians</hi>; his Congregation conſiſting of both.
Thoſe he prepar'd for the <hi>Indians,</hi> he firſt wrote at large in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and then tranſlated them into the Indian Tongue, as he alſo did a Portion of Scripture to be read to the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; and notwithſtanding he had ſo many Sermons to make, they wot well ſtudiedc excellent Diſourſes ſhewing that he was a Workman that needed not to be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>He had a moſt laborious. Taſk to perform every Lord's-Day. His Manner was to begin the publick Exerciſe in the Morning, with a ſhort pathetic Prayer for a Bleſſing on the Word, in both Languages, Then he read a Portion of Scripture, with explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:007023_0161_102AEB8028670098"/>
Notes and Obſervations, on ſuch Paſſages as ſeem'd moſt to need them, in both. All his publick Prayers &amp; the Communion Service were in both Languages; and it was his ſteady Practice to preach four Sermons every Lord's Day' two to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and two to the <hi>Indians</hi>; except in the ſhort Days and cold Seaſon of the Winter he preach'd but three, one to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and two to the <hi>Indians.</hi> And beſides all this, it was his conſtant Cuſtom, in the Summer Seaſon, to ſpend about an Hour with the <hi>Indians,</hi> after divine Service was over in the Afternoon; inſtructing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, warning and cautioning of them in a free, familiar and pathetic Manner, in their own Tongue. The Indian Language abounding in Gutturals renders the Pronunciation of it a moſt laborious Exerciſe to the Lungs: that therefore, with his other ſxerciſes, ſo exhauſted Mr. SERGEANT's Spirits and Strength, that he was ſcarcely able to ſpeak when they were over.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Tranſlation, which, with much Care and Exactneſs, Mr' SERGEANT made in His Courſe of Reading the Scriptures to the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſingly conſider'd, coſt him a vaſt Deal of Labour; for, endeavouring to lead them into the Knowledge of the Way of Salvation by Chriſt, to which they were utter Strangers, He, in his Courſe of reading the Scriptures to them, tranſlated thoſe Parts of the old Teſtament, which appear'd moſt needful for that End, viz. The Account of the Creation, of the Fall of our firſt Parents, of God's calling <hi>Abraham,</hi> of his Dealings with the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> of the Propheſies concerning the Coming of Chriſt, &amp;c. the four Evangeliſts, the Acts of the Apoſtles and all the Epiſtles, he alſo tranſlated. A Performance which muſt of Neceſſity coſt him much Time and Pains.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In his publick Diſcourſes likewiſe to the Engliſh of his Auditory, he went thro' all the Epiſtles, with a labour'd and learned Paraphraſe, critical Notes, and uſeful Obſervations: not by the Help of Expoſitors, but by a careful Examination of the Original Greek, endeavouring from thence to gain the true Senſe and Meaning of the, Authors df thoſe Epiſtles. Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> has given me ſome of his Sentiments upon Mr. SERGEANT's publick Performances in the following Words. <q>I think it a great Pity (ſays he) that ſuch learned and well-compoſed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſhould be of no further Influence and Benefit than they are like to prove, by being delivered to a few People from the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:007023_0162_102AEB8238266B90"/>
Deſk. There are a Number of his Sermons very worthy of the Preſs, a Collection of which would, perhaps, be as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as any Diſcourſes of ſuch a Nature that are extant: they being correct, and written in a decent, yet familiar Stile. There appears in them not only his unſhaken Belief of the Truths of the Goſpel, but alſo his good Judgment &amp; Talent of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to others, the Importance and Beauty of Religion, They ſhew him to be an accurate Reaſoner, by the Concluſions drawn from the Propoſitions of his Sermons, and the Force there is in them to convince every Hearer, of the Truth. His laboured and learned Paraphraſes, &amp; critical Notes on the Epiſtles, would (I think) ſerve equal to, if not beyond any Thing that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard'd of that Kind, to lead us into the Knowledge of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Meaning of the Authors.—He wrote his Comments with a ſingle View to diſcover the true Spirit &amp; genuine Senſe of thoſ epiſtolary Writings.— There are two Reaſons which incline me to wiſh they may be made publick; the firſt is the Apprehenſion I have of their being really ſerviceable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: the other is, that it might appear whether he was rightly or groundleſsly, ſuſpected of holding Things contrary to found Doctrine.</q> He alſo ſays concerning his Sermons in general.— <q>His People were not entertain'd with unconnected &amp; undigeſted Matter, but with excellent Diſcourſes.</q>— Such Productions, every one will grant, muſt of neceſſity be the Effect of much Labour and Study.</p>
            <p>It is very true, Mr. SERGEANT was no <hi>Bigot,</hi> but of a moſt <hi>generous &amp; catholick</hi> Temper. <hi>Bigottry</hi> was what he had a great Averſion to; and he was far from the rigged ard nirrow Spirit thoſe are of, who confine Salvation to themſelves, with thoſe who think juſt as they do. It is a Queſtion with me, whether his natural Temper was capable of ſuch Severity: to be ſure, as it was cultivated and improv'd by Grace, he was at a great Diſtance from it. He tho't himſelf very ill-treated and much abus'd by thoſe who repreſented him as being unſound in his Principles, and ſo did thoſe who were beſt acquainted with him.</p>
            <p>But to return.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt add to all his foregoing Labours, the daily and conſtant Appiication he was oblig'd to uſe with the <hi>Indians</hi>; who, being very ignorant, very unſtable in their Virtue, and very much
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:007023_0163_102AEB8427CFBA08"/>
expos'd to Temptations, wanted Guarding on every Side, which he fail'd not of doing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Truſt, which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Iſaac Hollis</hi> repos'd in him, added ſtill more to Mr. SERGEANT's Labour and Care; for it fell upon him to find the twelve Boys, whom Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly offer'd to ſupport, and to perſuade them and their Parents to accept the generous Offer. The Care alſo of providing a Maſter to inſtruct them, and of Victualling &amp; Cloathing of them, lay wholly upon him. In this Truſt he prov'd a faithful Steward of Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s Money; and as he had the whole Care of laying of it out, ſo he gave him an Account how every Penny was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, refuſing to take any Reward for his Labour &amp; Trouble; tho' it was offer'd and urg'd by Mr. <hi>Hollis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. By the foregoing Hiſtory it alſo appears, that the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affair of the Boarding-School, which lay very near his Heart, imploy'd much of his Time and Tho'ts; and was no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his Labour; eſpecially in ſome of the laſt Years of his Life.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To all theſe we muſt add, the unavoidable Cares and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of private Life, which were much increas'd by the Scanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe of his Support; which yet he conducted with ſingular Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Prudence and Frugality.</p>
            <p>View Mr. SERGEANT in this Light; conſider him proſecuting ſuch a Variety of Buſineſs, and performing all in the Manner above deſcrib'd, and muſt we not grant that he was a ſurpriſing inſtance of Labour, Induſtry and Faithfulneſs, in that great and good Work to which he was call'd?</p>
            <p>Could I repreſent Mr. SERGEANT in a true and juſt Light, under the Self-denials, Hardſhips, Troubles &amp; Difficulties, which attended him in the Courſe of his Miſſion, it would appear, not only that he paſt thro' many and great Trials, but alſo that he bear them all with a Fortitude and Calmneſs of Mind, becoming the Chriſtian and the Miniſter of Chriſt; tho', at Times, Things appear'd with ſuch a dark Aſpect, that he was almoſt overborne wich Griefs and Diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>Every one muſt be ſenſible, that, to one of ſo delicate a Make, it muſt be difficult and ſelf-denying, to leave the College, that Seat of Learning, and other Delights, to dwell in a Wilderneſs: To change the polite Society he had been us'd to, for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:007023_0164_102AEB85C360A3A8"/>
of a Number of Savages, the loweſt of human Kind: To forego the Delicacies of Life, for the bare Neceſſaries of it.—But theſe were but light Things to him, compared with many other Troubles he met with.</p>
            <p>The ill Conduct of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Traders, who us'd many Arts and Devices to diſſuade the <hi>Indians</hi> from hearkening to him; the unreaſonable Jealouſies of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſuſpected ſome evil Deſign againſt them, in almoſt every Thing that was projected for their Good, gave him unſpeakable Trouble and Grief: and a vaſt Deal of Pains he was at, to prevent the Evils, which thoſe Things tended to. But that which gave him ſtill greater Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was, the frequent and unhappy Relapſes of ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to their former Vices and ill Cuſtoms, after he had conceived Hopes of their being truly reformed. Some, of whom his Hopes were rais'd, fell again into Drunkenneſs; yea, the Lieutenant him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who appear'd ſo zealous againſt that Vice, and ſeem'd to be firmly fix'd in the Ways of Religion, conducted himſelf in a very diſorderly Manner, for a Year or two together, being frequently intoxicated, and very troubleſome: But he was afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd from his Apoſtacy; confeſs'd his Wickedneſs; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to Charity; and walked orderly, to the Day of his Death, which was <hi>Auguſt</hi> 10. 1751. When Things looked with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Aſpect, and the Indians appear'd to be ſeriouſly engag'd in the Ways of Piety and Vertue, it gave him the higheſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Satisfaction; but (to uſe his own Expreſſion) <q>Nothing ſo affected him with Grief and Sorrow, his own Sins exceptcd, as the diſorderly and wicked Behaviour of thoſe to whom he miniſtred.</q> His Concern on that Account is not to be expreſſed: many Days he ſpent in Faſting and Prayer, and <hi>Sleep departed from his Eyes,</hi> his tender Heart was almoſt broken, and he <hi>forgot to eat his Bread</hi>; and his Eyes <hi>poured out Tears unto God.</hi> But tho' he was ſo tenderly affected, and concerned for them, yet this was what he did not much diſcover to the World; he was alſo very far from a repining diſcontented Spirit in the Caſe; was calm, ſubmiſſive and reſign'd to the Will of God: not forgeting that Expreſſion of his Lord and Maſter.—<hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeem'd good in thy Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he, in ſome Meaſure, had the Trials of <hi>Moſes</hi> in bearing the <hi>Camber, Burden</hi> &amp; <hi>Strife</hi> of his People, ſo he was in a good Degree
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:007023_0165_102AEB87C835B710"/>
poſſeſt of the ſame excellent Spirit that was upon him. Theſe are but a Specimen of the Troubles he met with; many others, too many to be here ſpoken of, he paſt thro', during his Miſſion.</p>
            <p>If we conſider Mr. SERGEANT in a relative Capacity, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd excellently well in every Relation he ſuſtain'd. From a Principle of Conſcience he was very careful to <hi>render to all their Due, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour</hi>  and his benevolent and truly Chriſtian Temper diſpos'd him to <hi>do good to all as be bad Opportunity.</hi> He was an able, painful, faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter among the People, to whom he ſtood in the Relation of a Paſtor. He was a moſt tender, kind and obliging Huſband to a Spouſe, who well underſtood how to receive ſuch Treatment, and to make anſwerable Returns: and while divine Providence continued them in that haypy and honourable Relation, they were a ſhining Example of all that is lovely and beautiful in a married State. He was alſo a compaſſionate, affectionate and loving Father to his dear Children: unwearied in his Endeavours to inſtill into their tender Minds a proper Senſe of their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God; that they might religiouſly remember their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator in the Days of their Youth. As became a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> he <hi>rul'd well his own Houſe, having his Children in Subjection with all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:</hi> And like <hi>David,</hi> he <hi>walked within his Houſe with a perfect Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Week in <hi>June</hi> 1749, he was taken with a Nervous Fever, attended with a Canker and an Inflamation in his Throat: brought upon him, as ſome thought, by exceſſive Care, Fatigue and Application to Buſineſs; more than he was able to bear. He calmly, and without any apparent Concern, ſpake or this as his laſr Sickneſs; and put ſome Things in Order, apprehending it to be ſo. He was able however to keep about, and preach'd on the following Sabbath, which was the firſt in <hi>July.</hi> In this his laſt Sermon to the <hi>Indians,</hi> he let them know, 'that for ſome Time paſt he had been apprehenſive that ſome heavy Judgment hung over them, becauſe of their Wickedneſs: That he fear'd that ſome of them grew worſe &amp; worſe notwithſtanding all that God had done for them, and notwithſtanding the Pains he himſelf had taken with them for their Good: And that there were many Ways in which God could, and often did, teſtify his Diſpleaſure againſt a ſinful People: and added, it may be God will take me
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:007023_0166_102AEB8A0EFCE618"/>
from you, and then my Mouth will be ſhut, and I ſhall ſpeak to you no more.' After this his Illneſs increas'd upon him, and ſoon confin'd him to his Houſe and to his Bed. And tho' his Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was very hard upon him, and he endur'd much Pain and Diſtreſs for about twenty Days together, in all which Time he had but very little Sleep; yet his Head was free from any Diſorder, and even from Pain: and he ſpake of it to his Wife, with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that God had anſwered his Prayers, even to his Deſire; in continuing to him the free Exerciſe of his rational Powers; in favouring him with clear Evidences of his good Eſtate; in granting him Ability to ſpeak freely to thoſe who were about him; and in enabling him clearly to diſcern the great and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Satisfaction ariſing from living devoted to God, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely ſtriving to be faithful to the Death.</p>
            <p>He carefully improv'd the Opportunities he had in counſeling and charging thoſe who were about him; and earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced to them the early Choice and diligent Purſuit of the Ways of Wiſdom, as being full of Pleaſure and Peace, both in Life and Death, to thoſe who follow them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Indians,</hi> who from firſt to laſt had a great Veneration and hearty Affection for him, as their Father and beſt Friend, were greatly concern'd for, and frequently viſited him in, his Sickneſs: upon whom he enforced the Inſtructions, Counſels, Warnings and Admonitions he had given them, in the ſtrongeſt Manner, charging them carefully to follow the Ways of Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they would meet him at laſt in Peace. They were very deſirous that his precious Life might be ſpar'd, and of their own Accord all aſſembled at the Meeting-Houſe, where they earneſtly pray'd that God would continue him to be ſtill a Bleſſing to them. And when his Death put an End to their Hopes, they were very hearty Mourners: and Numbers diſcover'd their Affection for him by Tears, when ever they came to the Houſe, for a long time after his Death.</p>
            <p>He bear with great Patience the Diſtreſs that was upon him, thro' the whole of his Sickneſs, praying and endeavouring that <hi>Patience</hi> might <hi>have its perfect Work</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>His Spouſe, who maintain'd Hopes of his Recovery, till the laſt Day of his Life, being then ſenſible that he drew near his End, enquir'd of him, Whether he had no earneſt Deſires to live?
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:007023_0167_102AEB8B98DAE658"/>
And whether he ſaw any Gloom on the Horrors on the Grave? To which he reply'd to this Purpoſe. 'If it be the Will of God that I ſhould live to do ſome ſingular Service for him in the World, I could wiſh to be continued to my Family; otherwiſe I am willing to die: Death is no Surprize to me. I bleſs God I may and can truſt him in whom <hi>I have believed,</hi> and long ago plac'd my everlaſting Dependance upon. My Acquaintance with the bleſſed World, to which I hope I am now haſtening, thro' the Mercy of God in Chriſt, is not now to commence.' At the ſame Time, he was full of a humbling Senſe of his own Unworthineſs: for when One that ſtood by obſerv'd to him, that his Work was well done, he reply'd, 'I can call myſelf a moſt <hi>unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and ſay, <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>'</p>
            <p>He took his Leave of his beloved Wife and dear Children in an endearing and deſireable Manner; and after ſaying a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Deal, by Way of Counſel and Advice, he in a tender Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſir'd his dear Spouſe, patiently and quietly to ſubmit to the parting Stroke; to go on with good Courage in the Way of Duty; and added, 'It will be but a little While before we ſhall meet to part no more'</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, he devoutly recommended his departing Soul to Chriſt, the glorious Redeemer; and, after a few ſaint Groans, reſted from his <hi>Labours, and his Works do follow</hi> him.</p>
            <p>This ſolemn, awful and laſt Scene of Life, Mr; SERGEANT, to Appearance, paſt thro', With as much Calmneſs, Sedateneſs and Compoſure of Mind, as he ever enjoy'd in his Life; and with a ſerene and pleaſant Countenance; which (as the laſt Act) Death <hi>changed and ſent him away.</hi> The weeping Spectators of theſe Things beheld them with Admiration, and acknowledged they had not before ſeen the like: And one of them obſerv'd, that it was worth While to die, if it might be in ſuch a Manner.</p>
            <p>He left behind him a moſt diſconſolate and ſorrowful Widow, with three ſmall Children, the eldeſt about 8 or 9 Years old, and the youngeſt upon the Breaſt, on whom the Countenance of his Father is drawn to the Life. God grant they may all inherit his Excellencies and Vertues.</p>

               <pb n="163" facs="unknown:007023_0168_102AEB8DB000C1E0"/>I had Tho'ts of continuing this Hiſtorical Account of the Affairs of <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> relating to the <hi>Indians,</hi> down to the preſent Time; and to have given an Account of Mr. <hi>Hollis</hi>'s increaſing the Boys to be maintain'd and educated at his Expence, to the Number of 36, allowing for each Boy £.5 Sterling per Annum: of what the General Aſſemblies of this <hi>Province,</hi> and of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut,</hi> have done to encourage the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> to ſend their Children to be educated at <hi>Stockbridge</hi>; a conſiderable Number of them being already come thither for that End: of what Capt. <hi>Coram</hi> did in <hi>England</hi> before his Death, to promote a Female Boarding-School at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and what the honourable Society in <hi>London</hi> have done with Reſpect to it ſince: of the Rev.

            <head>The Concluſion, in an Addreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall now conclude by endeavouring to repreſent, to the People in this Country, the very great Importance of Treating the <hi>Indians,</hi> who live among us, and upon our Borders, in a juſt, kind and charitable Manner; and that we do, by all proper Means and Methods, endeavour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach them to us, and to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt. This, I apprehend, is a Subject that has been too much neglected, and that greatly wants to be ſet in a clear and juſt Light. And I ſincerely wiſh, that ſome Gentleman of greater Abilities and Addreſs than I can pretend to, would take it in Hand: Tho', if my weak Endeavours may be a Means of moving others to do Juſtice to a Subject of ſuch Weight, I ſhall heartily rejoice in it.</p>
            <p>That I may offer what I have to ſay, in the cleareſt and moſt conciſe Manner I can, I ſhall go into the following Method.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that it is of vaſt Importance to the <hi>Britiſh Provinces</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> eſpecially to the <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts, New-York,</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> that they be in good Terms with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and attach them to their Intereſt. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhow, by what <hi>Means,</hi> this may be effected: or what are the moſt likely Methods to bring it to paſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to ſhow, that it is of vaſt Importance, that we be in good Terms with the <hi>Natives</hi>; and that we ingage them in our Intereſt, I freely grant, that the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſimply conſider'd, are not of ſuch great Conſequence to us. We can ſubſiſt without them. But yet, their Trade is a conſiderable Article, worthy the Care of any politick People, and managed as it might, and ought to be, would yield us great Profit. But if we conſider them with Relation to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> as attach'd to us, or to our <hi>Enemies,</hi> they are of the laſt Importance to us: for they certainly have the Balance of Power in their Hand, and are able to turn it for or
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:007023_0170_102AEB91FA241C08"/>
againſt us, according as they ſtand affected to us. <hi>Canada,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as it is, and from which, ſeperate from the <hi>Indians,</hi> we have little or nothing to fear, in Time of War; <hi>Canada,</hi> I ſay, would be more than a Match for us, in Caſe they join with them againſt us. He muſt be a great Stranger to, and very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, the Circumſtances both of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> who is not ſenſible of this. Our Circumſtances are ſuch, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not guard ourſelves againſt the Incurſions of ſuch Enemies in Time of War: for our <hi>Frontiers</hi> are of vaſt extent, and border upon the adjacent Wilderneſs; which, tho' almoſt inacceſſible to us, yet is the very Element in which they delight to live. They are at Home in it. The People therefore who inhabit our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, while they follow their neceſſary Buſineſs, are expos'd to be an eaſy Prey to them: and many of them have been ſurpriz'd in their Fields and Houſes. and in a moſt barbarous Manner put to Death, A ſmall Number of <hi>Indians,</hi> encouraged &amp; ſupported by the <hi>French</hi> (which they are ready enough to do) can eaſily keep us in a conſtant Alarm, put us to an immenſe Charge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy many, and impoveriſh more, in our expos'd Places, and not put themſelves at all out of their Way; yea, find their Account in it: for as they live by Hunting, ſo where Game is moſt plenty they are beſt off: And where can they find a better Supply, than among our Cattle, Sheep, and Corn-Fields? There they live at Eaſe, diſtreſs and impoveriſh us, and the adjacent Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is their Refuge. By retiring into it, they are ſoon out of our Reach; and long Experience has taught us, how ineffectual the Meaſures we have taken, for our Safety and Defence, have prov'd.</p>
            <p>Some, I am ſenſible, will ſay, let us not be at any Coſt and Pains to gain the Friendſhip of ſuch a perfidious Crew, but let us deſtroy them all. Quickly ſaid indeed, but not ſo ſoon nor ſo eaſily effected. Thoſe Perſons who are for deſtroying them would doubtleſs ſoon do it, where they firſt bound and delivered up to them. But one Queſtion here is, how we ſhall get them into our Power? And another is, Whether it would be ſo human, generous and Chriſtian-like, to take away their Lives, were that in our Power, as it would be to cultivate Friendſhip with them, and to ſeek their beſt Good? If we ſhould be ſo ſanguine as to endeavour to deſtroy them, it would doubtleſs prove a vain At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:007023_0171_102AEB93910D1108"/>
and ſerve only to drive them to the <hi>French</hi>; who would be very ready to receive and protect them. If we neglect them, and take no Meaſures to ingage them in our Intereſt, or to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friendſhip with them, this will probably render them indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to us, and diſpoſe them to hearken to the enticing Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries: and our Situation muſt be very unhappy, when they become engaged in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that the <hi>French</hi> have already gain'd a large Number of <hi>Indians</hi> to their Intereſt, and therefore if we uſe our beſt Endeavours to gain others, it will avail nothing; for thoſe who are devoted to the <hi>French,</hi> will nevertheleſs diſtreſs us in Time of War. I reply,</p>
            <p>It is very true, that the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> thro' their Policy and Vigilance, have taken the Advantage of our Neglect, and gain'd a large Number of the <hi>Natives</hi> to their Intereſt, and are gaining more and more every Year; and ſome even from among our own <hi>Indians.</hi> They ſpare neither Coſt nor Pains to accompliſh their Deſigns of this Nature; being ſenſible enough, how advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous it is to them, and how injurious to us: and if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be active, and we negligent, as in Times paſt, is it not too probable that they will, in a little Time, attach to themſelves all the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>North-America?</hi> Does it not then concern us to uſe proper and vigorous Endeavours to prevent this apparent Miſchief, by counter-working the <hi>French?</hi> who are, I ſuppoſe, tampering with all the Tribes of <hi>North-America,</hi> to ingage them in their Intereſt. And ſhould we ſucceed in our Endeavours (as it is highly probable we might, if proper Steps were taken) ſo as to ingage the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and ſome other Tribes, in hearty Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with us; and eſpecially if we ſhould beſtow ſuch Favours upon them, as would induce them to ſettle upon our Frontiers; it would in all Probability prevent the Evil ſpoken of in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: for the <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi> would not moleſt us, if a Number of the Natives, in hearty Friendſhip with us, were placed in our Borders. Of this we have had a very plain Proof the laſt War, in the Safety of <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and the adjacent Places, from any Attempts of the Enemy from <hi>Canada.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stockbridge</hi> is in the very Road of, and more expos'd to, the <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada,</hi> than any other Place whatever; and yet we ſee that the Enemy turned off Eaſt to <hi>Connecticut-River,</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:007023_0172_102AEB9590509708"/>
Weſt to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Settlements, where they did much Miſchief; while <hi>Stockbridge, Sheffield, New-Marlborough</hi> and <hi>Number One,</hi> tho' more expos'd, were not moleſted. This ſo far as we can diſcern, was owing to a ſmall Number of <hi>Indians</hi> dwelling at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> who are our hearty and faſt Friends: which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being ſenſible of, cared not to come within their Reach, leaſt they ſhould be taken in their own Snare. And if we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Settlement of other Indian Towns upon our Frontiers, where Hunting is moſt handy to them, as <hi>Stockbridge</hi> has been encouraged: ſhould we give them Townſhips of Land ſuitable for their Improvement, build a Meeting-Houſe &amp; School-Houſe in each Town, and ſupport Miniſters and School Maſters in them; would not this convince them that we are their true Friends, and ſeek their Good? Would it not induce them to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in our Borders? eſpecially thoſe of them who are deſirous, that they themſelves &amp; their Children ſhould be inſtructed? Would they not be a Guard to us in Time of War? And if, after all, we ſhould meet with ſome Trouble from the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> might it not be effectually prevented, by playing our <hi>Indians</hi> upon them, as they do theirs upon us? And would not the Charge of all this be a Trifle, compar'd with that of defending ourſelves in Time of War? But if we neglect them, and take no Meaſures to cultivate Friendſhip with them, and eſpecially if we deal injuriouſly by them, ſhall we not put an Advantage into the Hands of the <hi>French</hi> (which they will not fail of improving) to engage them in their Intereſt, and to imploy them againſt us in Time of War? which would prove a very great Calamity to us, if not our utter Ruin. Theſe Things conſider'd, is it not of very great Importance, that we be at good Terms with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Natives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I will, in the next Place, endeavour to ſhow what are the likely <hi>Methods</hi> to bring this to paſs: Or what Meaſures we muſt take with the <hi>Indians,</hi> if we would ingage them in hearty Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with us.</p>
            <p>And here, in general, our Conduct towards them muſt be ſuch as ſhall make them ſenſible, that we are indeed their hearty Friends; and ſuch alſo as ſhall convince them that it is their Intereſt and Advantage to be in Friendſhip with us. Nothing ſhort of this, I apprehend, will attach them to us, ſo as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:007023_0173_102AEB97919E1DD8"/>
the Ends propoſed, if we oft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> treat with them, renew the Friendſhip, and beſtow upon them large Preſents: Or, as they phraſe it, Smoke together, brighten the Chain, or put the Brands together, to kindle up the former Fire; and yet leave Room for them to ſuppoſe that this proceeds not from true Friendſhip, but rather from Fear of them, or from Suſpicion that they will join with our Enemies, &amp;c. This will never be ſufficient to engage them: the utmoſt we can rationally expect from it is. that they will not openly break with us, but keep up a Shew of Friendſhip, that they may have the Benefit of future Preſents at our Hands.</p>
            <p>Again, if we ſhould by any Means convince them that we are their true Friends, and yet not go into ſuch Meaſures with them as ſhould turn to their <hi>Advantage,</hi> they would hardly be engag'd for us. As all other People are govern'd by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſo are they. And the principal Handle we can take hold of, to attach them to us by, is their <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and that would not fail of doing of it. If a Tribe of <hi>Indians</hi> can ſell their Skins to us for <hi>twenty Shillings,</hi> and buy their Blankets for <hi>ten Shillings</hi>; they will never go to <hi>Canada</hi> where they muſt ſell their Skins for <hi>ten Shillings,</hi> and give <hi>twenty Shillings</hi> for a Blanket. Convince them that it is much for their Intereſt and Advantage to be our Friends and Allies, and we need not fear but that they will be ſo. Now, in Order to convince them that we are truly their Friends, and that it is their Intereſt to be ours; We muſt,</p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, treat them according to the Rules of Equity and Juſtice. We muſt not defraud and oppreſs them, but be honeſt and juſt in our Dealings with them.</p>
            <p>The Natives with whom we have to do, are Perſons of ſo much Sagacity that they can diſtinguiſh between juſt and injurious Treatment, as well as other Men. They are alſo as ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and perhaps more forward to revenge Injuries, than any other People under Heaven. If therefore we treat them in an unjuſt Manner, we may rationally expect that they will be ſo far from being our Friends, that they will join with our Enemies, and ſeek Opportunities of Revenge.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the <hi>Indians</hi> are generally addicted to Drunkenneſs, and that when they have taſted a little Liquor, they have a ſtrong Thirſt for more, and will part with any Thing they have, for a ſufficient Quantity to make them Drunk.—And is
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:007023_0174_102AEB99D9E10000"/>
it not as well known, that we have taken the Advantage of this their vicious Appetite, and for a ſew Quarts of Rum have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd valuable ſcffects of them? Have not private Perſons thus made their Gains of them, notwithſtanding the good Laws that have been in Force to prevent it? And is not this the Manner of all private Traders, who go among their ſeveral Tribes for Gain?</p>
            <p>In our publick Dealings with them at our Truck-Houſes, where Rum has been freely ſold them. Care has been taken that they ſhould not be cheated, but that they ſhould have the full Value of what they had to ſell: An Indian therefore, who was Owner of a Pack of Bever, Deerſkins, or any other valuable Goods, could buy a large Quantity of Rum, and might get Drunk perhaps ten Times or more, whereas if he had fallen into private Hands, he muſt have contented himſelf with being Drunk but once or twice. Which of theſe proves moſt injurious to the <hi>Indians</hi> in the End, I ſhall not pretend to determine.</p>
            <p>When they are thus intoxicated, they fall out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Fight, and ſometimes kill one another, and ſome have drunk themſelves dead on the Spot. An Inſtance of each of theſe there has been, if I am rightly inform'd, at <hi>Fort Dummer,</hi> ſince that has been improv'd as a Truck-Houſe. And whether the Guilt of that Blood does not lie upon us, I leave others to judge.</p>
            <p>Now, if we treat the <hi>Natives</hi> in this Form, will they, can they, live with us? Will not the Law of Self-Preſervation oblige them to leave us, and to go where they may be better us'd? Some of the Five Nations plainly ſpeak it out and ſay, "We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live with the <hi>Engliſh &amp; Dutch</hi>; they bring us ſo much Rum that it deſtroys us; we muſt go to the <hi>French,</hi> who will let us have but little ſtrong Drink." Thus we alienate the <hi>Indians</hi> from us, and as it were oblige them to go over to the <hi>French,</hi> who are often our Enemies, and fail not to imploy them againft us in Time of War. And if we proceed to deal thus injuriouſly with them, what can we expert but that they will leave us, and be a ſevere Scourge to us?</p>
            <p>Tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> are ſunk below the Dignity of human Nature, and their Luſt after Drink expoſes them to be cheated out of what little they have; yet this gives us no Right to deal unjuſtiy by them. They have a natural Right to Juſtice, and may, with
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:007023_0175_102AEB9BEFA17370"/>
great Propriety challenge it at our Hand, ſeeing we proſeſs to be ſubject to the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which teach us to do <hi>that which is altogether just.</hi> And we ſhould be ſo far from taking the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their Ignorance, Vice and Poverty, to defraud them of what is their juſt Right, that we ſhould rather be mov'd to Pity, and compaſſionate their deplorable State, and be <hi>Eyes to the Blind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I am fully perſuaded, that if we were upright and juſt in all our Tranſations with them; if our Trade with them were put into the Hands of faithful Men, who would deal juſtly by them; and if they were ſupply'd with all Neceſſaries for themſelves and Families at a moderate Price, it would not be in the Power of all the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Canada</hi> (ſubtil as they are) to alienate them from us. The <hi>French</hi> are not upon equal Ground with us in this Affair. For their Nothern Climate is much more inhoſpitable &amp; ſevere than ours is: Their Country is not ſo productive of thoſe Fruits, which the <hi>Indians</hi> very much live upon, as ours: Nor can they afford Goods which arc proper and neceſſary for the <hi>Indians</hi> at ſo cheap a Lay as we can: Therefore we can give them thoſe Advantages which <hi>Canada</hi> cannot. We can, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Damage to ourſelves, make it their Intereſt to adhere to us: And when Experience has once taught them, that their Intereſt lies with us, they will want no other Inducement to ingage them to us: Yea, it will not only attach thoſe or them to us, who are not yet gone to <hi>Canada,</hi> but it will induce thoſe who are, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Brethren, for the ſake of the Profit they might reap by it; eſpecialliy if we give them all the Advantage we can, conſiſtent with our own.</p>
            <p>As unjuſt &amp; abuſive Treatment of the <hi>Indians</hi> tends naturally to alienate them from us, and to turn them off to the <hi>French</hi>; ſo a Series of juſt and faithful Dealing with them would be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attach them to us, and to make them our faſt Friends. This again appears from the Temper and Conduct of that Part of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of the <hi>River Indians</hi> who live at <hi>Stockbridge.</hi> For tho' they were, for a conſiderable Time, extreamly jealous, that we had ſome ill Deſign upon them, even in the Favours they received at our Hands; (a Jealouſy founded, I ſuppoſe, upon the ill Uſage the <hi>Natives</hi> have too often been the Subjects of) yet by the juſt Treatment they, for a Courſe of Years, have met with, from the
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:007023_0176_102AEB9DEFED5D08"/>
               <hi>Government,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Sargeant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> and others, they are become our hearty Friends; willing to live or die with us, whether in Peace or War.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that in order to obtain the End propos'd, our Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> muft not be in private Hands. It mud not be in the Power of every private Perſon to treat them as he pleaſes. We may upon good Grounds deſpair of their being treated with Equity and Juſtice, if every one may gratify his avaricious Temper in dealing with them. Our Trade therefore muſt be of a publick Nature, and muft be committed to the Care and Management of faithful Men: Not to ſuch as will ſeek the Service, and make Friends to procure the Poſt for them; (certain Indications of a Self-ſeeker) but Men of Uprightneſs &amp; Integrity muſt be ſought out, ſuch and ſuch only muſt be be truſted with Buſineſs of ſuch Importance: Good Inſtructions muſt be given them, which muſt be carefully adher'd to.</p>
            <p>If the Indian Trade at <hi>Canada</hi> were in private Hands; if every private Perſon there might deal with the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> we might then hope that thoſe who are gone from us would ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: for, in that Caſe, it is ſuppoſable enough that they would not meet with much better Uſage there, than they do here: tho' it is ſcarcely ſuppoſable that they would meet with much worſe. The <hi>French</hi> Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> is wholly in the Hand of publick Officers, (if I am rightly informed) and a private Man, if he want a Dear-ſkin, a Beaver-ſkin, &amp;c. is not allow'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of an <hi>Indian,</hi> but muft go to the publick Stores. Upon the Suppoſition that thoſe Officers are faithful, and deal juſtly by the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is ſurely a wife &amp; politick Method to ingage them in their Favour. And ſo long as every private Perſon in the Engliſh Government is at Liberty to trade with them, when, and where, he pleaſes, and to cheat them out of what they have, what can we expect but that they will repair to <hi>Canada</hi> where they may be better us'd? Is it not owing to the ill Treatment they have met with from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> that ſo many of them are gone already? And if no proper Meaſures are taken to prevent their being ill us'd, will not thoſe who are yet behind ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their Brethren? Yea, if we ſurniſh them with large Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Rum, make them Drunk, and then defraud them of what they have, do we not reduce them to a Neceſſity, either of living
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:007023_0177_102AEB9FDE0A1040"/>
low and miſerable with us, or of going from us, that they may ſare better? How low, how diſpirited, how miſerable &amp; brutiſh theſe few are, who live within our Borders, is too manifeſt. And whether we, by our ill treating of them, have not contributed to their Miſery, is worthy of our ſerious Enquiry. Yea, would it not be proper for us to enquire, Whether we have not, by our Neglect &amp; Abuſe of them, provoked Heaven to let looſe the Natives upon us, who have been one of the foreſt Scourges that we were ever chaſtiſed with? What Multitudes have they, in a moſt cruel Manner, murdered in our Borders? How many of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours have they led into Captivity? Some of whom have been redeem'd at a very great Expence, and others are become either Pagans or Papiſts, and continue ſtill in a foreign Land. And who can count the Coſt we have been at, to defend ourſelves againſt their Incurſions?</p>
            <p>If the Britiſh Government ſhould be difpos'd, in Time to come, to ſet up and maintain a publick, honeſt and juſt Trade with the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> or any other Tribes, thereby to attach them to ui, to promote their true Intereſt, with other valuable Ends that might there by be anſwer'd: This Objection perhaps would ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a Proceeding will be a very great Expence to the Publick, for our Trade cannot be ſafe unleſs it be protected by a conſiderable Force. A Fort muft be built, and a Garriſon of 50, 60 or perhaps 100 Men, with their proper Officers, muſt be maintain'd at each Place where the Trade is ſet up: therefore the Advantage would not countervail the Coſt. To this I reply,</p>
            <p>If ſuch Garriſons fhould be tho't neceſſary in the Places where a Trade is ſet up, to be a Guard to it; the Charge would nothing like equal that of an Indian War, which perhaps it might prevent.</p>
            <p>But further, I apprehend that the Charge of fuch Garriſons might be ſpar'd and that, in inſtead of being neceſſary, they would prove very injurious to the Deſign; and that it would be a very wrong Step to be taken in that Affair.</p>
            <p>All who are in any good Meaſure acquainted with the <hi>Indians</hi> know, that they are extreamly jealous, leaſt any Incroachments ſhould be made upon them: and it is not ſtrange it ſhould be ſo, conſidering what has paſt over them. And if a Number of arm'd Men were placed among them, and Forts built for the Defence of our Trade, they would be Suſpicious, that ſomething hoſtile
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:007023_0178_102AEBA1CB9A7D50"/>
was intended, and we ſhould not be able to remove the Suſpicion. They would behold us with, a jealous Eye, and perhaps take Meaſures to fruſtrate the whole Deſign.</p>
            <p>The moſt effectual Way to induce them to truſt us, is to truſt them: and they will be ready enough to protect our Trade, if we deſire it, and ſhow that we confide in them to do it. And when a little Experience has taught them, how advantageous ſuch a Trade would be to them, they would be ready enough to do it, for their own Advantage. It therefore we ſhould deſire them to admit a Trader into one of their own Forts, or to build a Fort at our Charge in ſome convenient Place for ſuch a Defign, and to take Care that our Trade be ſafe; this would tend to convince them, both of our Friendſhip to, and of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in, them; and they would not only be pleas'd with it, but alſo ambitious to ſhow us that we may ſafely truſt them: And were I to be the Truck-Maſter, I ſhouid eſteem my ſelf much later in their Protection, than in a Garriſon of 100 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men: For if ſuch a Gariſon ſhould be placed among them, they themſelves would ſuſpect ſome ill Deſign carrying on againſt them, and the <hi>French</hi> would infallibly tell them, that tho' we pretended Peace and Friendſhip, yet our Deſign in the End is to diſpoſſeſs them of their <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If indeed a Truck Maſter ſhould prove an unfaithful Servant, and inrich himſelf by defrauding them, he might have Qccaſion for Engliſh Soldiers to protect him and his Stores: but if they found him faithful, friendly and juſt in his Dealings with them, they would be as careful of him as of their own Eyes, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their own Lives for him. What would not the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>Stockbridge</hi> have done for Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> in his Day, whom they had found to be their true and hearty Friend? And what would they not now do for Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> of whom they have had the like Experience? <hi>Indians</hi> will be as ready as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and perhaps much more ſo, to ſerve and protect, if there be Occaſion, thoſe whom they have found to be their faithful and real Friends.</p>
            <p>in a Word, I apprehend, that if we had in Times paſt treated the Natives according to the Rules of Equity &amp; juſtice, it would have been quite ſufficient to have ingaged them in our Intereſt, and to have kept them in Amity and Friendship with us. And that, even now, they might in a little Time be attach'd to
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:007023_0179_102AEBA3B1AB7FF8"/>
us, by ſuch Treatment: But this, I confeſs, I deſpair of, if every private Perſon muſt be left at his Liberty to treat them as he pleaſes, and to defraud them of all they have: which I take to be the Caſe in <hi>New-York</hi> Government, who lie next to the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and have their Trade; tho' in this <hi>Province</hi> we have good Laws in Force to reſtrain private Perſons from ſelling them ſtrong Drink.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould alſo exerciſe that Kindneſs and Generoſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that ſhall convince them that it is for their Intereſt to be in Friendſhip with us. We ſhould not, in a Caſe of ſuch Importance, content ourſelves with being bearly juſt in our Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, but we ſhould alſo be kind &amp; generous, as a proper Expedient to obtain the End propos'd. I am aware, I ſhall here be quick interrupted with this Exclamation.</p>
            <p>What! <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> to ſuch an ungrateful evil Crew! to which I ſhall only anſwer. We have good Authority for being <hi>kind to the Unthankful and to the Evil.</hi> And if that good Being who recommends it to us, had not given an Example of it, in his Dealings with us, how deplorable had our State been? This kind Temper and Behaviour is recommended to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, not only becauſe it is the Will of our heavenly Father that we ſhould be kind, but alſo becauſe the Exerciſe of it anſwers excellent Ends; produces very good &amp; deſireable Effects: ſuch as Love, Friendſhip, Peace, &amp;c. And while we make a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianity, it is Pity the Practice of it, in ſo material an Article, ſhould be objected againſt. And is it not very proper that we ſhould exerciſe Kindneſs and Generoſity to the poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, when there is a ſtrong Probability of its being of very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Conſequence both to them and us?</p>
            <p>A great deal of Kindneſs and Generoſity has been exercis'd towards the River <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> by this <hi>Government,</hi> by the honourable <hi>Corporation</hi> at Home, by their honourable &amp; Rev. <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> and others: and the Conſequence has been very happy as to them; they are brought to the Knowledge of the Goſpel, and to a Chriſtian Profeſſion: and many of them; we hope, to the ſaving Knowledge of God, We alſo have found the Benefit of this kind Uſage of them: for thereby they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our hearty Friends, are united to us in their Affections, and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:007023_0180_102AEBA55492B558"/>
were a Means, in the Hand of Providence, of covering our moſt Weſtern Frontiers the laſt War. And were the like Kindneſs ſhown by us to other Tribes, is there not Room to hope that the Effects might be alike happy? If Townſhips ſuitable for <hi>Indians</hi> to ſettle in, were provided in our Frontiers, and it were propos'd to them that if they would come and ſettle in them, they ſhould not only enjoy the Land as their own, but alſo have a Miniſter ſupported among them to inſtruct them in the Chriſtian Religion; and alſo a School-Maſter to teach their Children to read &amp; write; would not this induce many of them, eſpecially of the better Sort, to come and ſettle in our Borders? And would they not cover our Frontiers in Caſe of a War with <hi>Frace</hi>?</p>
            <p>What has been done for the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> has doubtleſs been much obſerv'd, and approv'd of, by the <hi>Natives</hi> far &amp; near. That there is a School ſet up at <hi>Canada,</hi> in Imitation of Mr. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant</hi>'s School at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and a large Number of Scholars in it, we have heard and receive for Truth. That the <hi>French,</hi> who eſteem Ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to teach the <hi>Indians</hi> any Thing more than to ſay their Beads, and to croſs themſelves, have done this out of Choice, is not at all likely. They do not deſire that their <hi>Indians</hi> ſhould become a knowing People. But yet, being ſenſible that the Report of Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi>'s School had ſpread itſelf for &amp; wide, and that, their <hi>Indians</hi> were pleas'd with the Method the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had taken to furniſh the <hi>Natives</hi> with Knowledge they apprehended that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome Thing like it were done among them, there would be Danger of the <hi>Indians</hi> repairing to us for Inſtruction, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, and to ingage them to themſelves, they ſet up their School. This, I conjecture, is the Truth of the Caſe. And if ſo, it is manifeſt that the <hi>Indians</hi> are inclin'd to ſeek after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And therefore would be diſpos'd to hearken to ſuch kind and generous Propoſals, if they were made to them. And who can tell but that this, that, or the other Tribe, would gladly ſettle ſuch Towns, if they were invited to it in a proper Manner?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Step, and, perhaps, the moſt promiſing one we can take, to ingage the <hi>Indians</hi> in Friendſhip with us is, to ſend Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries among their reſpective Tribes, Miniſters &amp; School-Maſters, to inſtruct them in the Principles, and to perſuade them to the Practice of Chriſtianity. Tho' they have ſo long liv'd near us,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:007023_0181_102AEBA7A622B5E8"/>
and been converſant with us, yet they remain ignorant of the Way of Salvation, Strangers to the Goſpel, and are periſhing for lack of Knowledge: A Caſe that might well move our Pity and Compaſſion towards them, and put us upon doing what we can for their Relief. And whether our former Neglect of Things of this Nature has not been provoking to Heaven, may be worthy of our ſerious Enquiry.</p>
            <p>The Intereſt the Rev. Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> had in the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> while he was with them, the Reformation of Manners he wrought among them, their Willingneſs to receive Inſtruction, and their Engaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to proſecute Learning, are a plain Indication that faithful Miſſionaries would be welcome to them. And the <hi>Five Nations</hi> being neareſt us, and their Friendſhip of very great Conſequence, it might be proper to begin with them: And what has been done among them by Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> and others, might be no ſmall Help in the Caſe. If we ſhould ſend Perſons well qualified for the Buſineſs to reſide among them, and ſupport them well, there would be no Foundation for any Jealouſy that we have an ill Deſign upon them, and if at any Time ſuch Jealouſies ſhould striſe they would ſoon ſubſide, upon the <hi>Indians</hi> having a little Experience of our Kindneſs and Friendſhip to them. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Conduct and ſaithful Labours of ſuch Miſſionaries might, by the Bleſſing of God, ſerve to remove their Barbarity, correct their Manners, reform their Lives, promote in them vertuous Sentiments, and by Degrees form them to true Religion. This we may hope would be the happy Event, with Reſpect to many of them, tho' not to all; and it, by much Labour and Expence, it might be brought to paſs, ſhould we not find our Account in it: for what would be the Charge of ſupporting a few Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, compar'd with that of an Indian War? And is there not great Probability that ſuch Meaſures would in a few Years Time attach them to us in a hearty Friendſhip? And it the <hi>Five Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> who are a Terror to, and have in great Meaſure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of, other Tribes, were indeed our Friends, and made ſo by ſuch Obligations laid upon them, would it not be an effectual Means of reſraining other <hi>Indians</hi> from giving us Trouble in Caſe of a War?</p>
            <p>The general Objection here, I am ſenſible will be;—There is no Likelihood of ſucceeding, and therefore it is not worth while
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:007023_0182_102AD2BD72757718"/>
to make any Trial, it would only be to ſpend Labour &amp; Money to no good Purpoſe. To which I reply,</p>
            <p>How can we draw the Concluſion before we have made the Experiment? Have we ever made any proper Trial, and ſound ourſelves diſappointed? And can it be look'd upon juſt to draw ſuch a Concluſion, in a Caſe of ſuch Importance, unleſs we had better Grounds for it?</p>
            <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> made a Viſit to the <hi>Suſquabanza Indians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brainard</hi> alſo, in his Day, did the ſame, without Succeſs: but we know that the Excuſe thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> made was, that they held their Lands of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and therefore could not comply with ſuch a Motion, till their Conſent was firſt obtain'd. And beſides, ſhall we eſteem two or three Viſits made by private Perſons a ſufficient Trial in this Caſe? Sufficient indeed it was to ſhow that thoſe good Gentlemen were poſſeſt of an excellent Spirit, and of a laudable Zeal for the Good of the poor Natives: but yet I apprehend not ſufficient to diſcourage further Attempts. If thoſe Gentlemen, who went in a private Capacity, had ſuſtain'd a publick Character, perhaps they had been more regarded. But however, when we have us'd our beſt Endeavours, and they indeed prove unſucceſsful, we may be excuſable; but can we look upon ourſelves ſo, if we ſit ſtill and uſe no Endeavours for the Help of thoſe poor benighted People?</p>
            <p>It proper Attempts ſhould be made for Chriſtianizing the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> there would, I am ſenſible, ſame notable Difficulties lie in the Way, but yet perhaps none but what might be ſurmounted.</p>
            <p>One Difficulty that would doubtleſs attend ſuch a laudable Undertaking, would ariſe from thoſe who maintain a private Trade among them, from which they reap great Gain; eſpecially by the Article of Rum, too much of which they convey to them, and by the Influence of which the <hi>Indians</hi> are eaſily defrauded.</p>
            <p>Theſe Traders would be very ſenſible, that if Chriſtianity ſhould prevail among thoſe <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>Hope of their Gain</hi> would be <hi>gone</hi> and <hi>ſeeing by this Craſt they have their Wealth,</hi> they would uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to diſſuade the <hi>Indians</hi> from imbrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ways of Religion. They in Fact did ſo at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> where the Number of <hi>Indians</hi> was ſmall, and their Trade not ſo conſiderable (as the foregoing Hiſtory ſhews.) How much more then will they do it, it Endeavours ſhould be us'd to convert the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:007023_0183_102AEBAB7AE7F8A8"/>
               <hi>Mohawks,</hi> whoſe Trade is vaſtly more advantageous? But as the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Houſatunnuk,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi>'s Help, ſaw thro' the Artifice they us'd; and were made ſenſible of the ſelfiſh Views of the Traders, ſo doubtleſs the <hi>Five Nations</hi> may eaſily be inform'd and the Obſtruction ſoon remov'd.</p>
            <p>Another Difficulty will ariſe from the falſe Inſinuations of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries, who will not fail to tell them, that we are about to teach them a falſe Religion, and if they hearken to us, they will all certainly be damn'd. But when thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> are properly inform'd of the Conduct of the <hi>French,</hi> and other Roman Catholicks, how they deny the Uſe of the Bible to the common People among themſelves, and that they have no Deſign to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the <hi>Indians</hi> with the Word of God: And on the other Hand, that our Deſign is not to impoſe upon them, but to open the Bible to them, to enable them to read it, and to judge for themſelves: will not this ſatisfy them of our honeſt Intentions towards them, and of the Safety &amp; Propriety of their examining Things, that they may form a Judgment for themſelves?</p>
            <p>A third, and perhaps much the greateſt Difficulty that would attend this good Deſign is, that thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> eſteem themſelves Chriſtians already, and value themſelves upon their being as good Chriſtians as their Neighbours. Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> in his Journal of <hi>November</hi> 25 1734, ſays,— <q>The <hi>Mohawks</hi> are generally Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, but for want of Inſtruction have but little of it in Reality.—</q> They are ſo ignorant of the Principles of Religion, that they know not the Difference between one who is baptiz'd and calls himſelf a Chriſtian, and one who lives agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the Rules Chriſt has given us to walk by. They are not ſenſible of the Neceſſity of being conform'd to thoſe Rules of Vertue and Holineſs which Chriſt has preſcrib'd. <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have baptiz'd ſome of them, others (as I have been inform'd) have been baptiz'd by <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters; and they eſteem it a Privilege belonging to them to have their Children baptized, whenever they preſent them; without any Regard being had, either to the Qualifications of the Parent, or the religious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Child. When the Rev. Mr; <hi>Spencer</hi> was among them a few Years ago, they were much diſpleas'd that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd baptizing ſome Children, whoſe Parents were notoriouſly ignorant, vicious and wicked. Some <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada,</hi> who
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:007023_0184_102AEBAD9C15F8D0"/>
had an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman to their Mother, came a few Years paſt to <hi>Weſtfield,</hi> to viſit their <hi>Engliſh</hi> Relations there, and while they ſtay'd at that Place, they had a Child born, and were much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Balantine,</hi> who declin'd baptizing of it, as they deſir'd. Since the Rev. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> has been at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> one of the <hi>Mohawks</hi> reſiding there had a Child born, and was highly affronted becauſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> did not baptize it upon his Deſire. From theſe Inſtances it is evident, that they account their Children have Right to Baptiſm, whenever they deſire it. And being baptized, they eſteem them good Chriſtians, whatever their Converſation may be: for they derive their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſtianity, not from the Bible, (to which they are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) but from the Example of the <hi>Dutch</hi> &amp; <hi>French,</hi> with whom they are converſant, and who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And ſo far forth as being baptized, in the forementioned Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and calling themſelves Chriſtians, will make them ſo, they are ſo to be eſteem'd. Now theſe Things being ſo, it may prove a difficult Thing to make them ſenſible, that Drunkenneſs and other vicious Practices are inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity; becauſe thoſe Chriſtians, who fall under their Obſervation, give them an Example of Vice, and go ſuch Lengths therein.</p>
            <p>But yet I apprehend this Difficulty might alſo be remov'd, by giving them a juſt and true Account of the Nature &amp; Extent of the Chriſtian Religion; by informing them what the Will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is; how he expects that we ſhould be conform'd to his Likeneſs, and to his Laws. The <hi>Indians</hi> are as capable of hearing Reaſons and giving them their Weight, as other Men: and it is becauſe they know not what Chriſtianity is, that they eſteem themſelves Chriſtians, in their preſent Circumſtances. When they are made acquainted with the Terms of Salvation, propos'd in the Goſpel, and what they muſt do that they may inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, when they are well inſtructed in the Doctrines of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they will be ſenſible that the Religion which they now have, is little or nothing like that which is taught by the Goſpel. When Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> refus'd to baptize a <hi>Mohawk</hi> Child born at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> (which I have before mentioned) and they were very much diſpleas'd with him on that Account, he went to them, gave them the Reaſons of his Conduct, and inform'd them as clearly as he was able of the Nature and End of Baptiſm: Thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> receiv'd
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:007023_0185_102AEBAF2CD5F378"/>
the Force of his Reaſons, and appear'd to be ſatisfy'd &amp; contented, when he had taken Pains to inform them. And I doubt not but proper Inſtruction and Information would remove the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>Tho' Chriſtianizing thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> may prove a difficult Work, yet if our Endeavours might, by the divine Bleſſing, be ſucceeded, would not the Advantage thence ariſing to them, and us, more than compenſate the Pains and Expence we ſhould be at? And is there not ſo much Ground to hope for Succeſs, as ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to make the Experiment?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude, by briefly ſuggeſting a few Things, not yet mentioned, the ſerious Conſideration of which may excite us to uſe our beſt Endeavours for the Converſion of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indians</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And in the firſt Place, ſhould not the Conſideration of the divine Bounty and Goodneſs, beſtow'd upon us, excite us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy Part of that undeſerv'd Goodneſs to promote the Knowledge of God, our bountiful Benefactor, among thoſe who are deſtitute of it? Thro' the undeſerv'd Favour and Bleſſing of God, we have been proſperous in our ſecular Affairs, ſucceeded in our Huſbandry, Trade, &amp;c. and are become a wealthy People: And, were we as willing as we are able, might we not ſpare large Sums for the Propagation of the Goſpel among the Heathen? Ought we not then to ſhew our Gratitude to the glorious Author of all our Comforts, by imploying a Part of his Bounty to promote the Redeemer's Kingdom? Is it not fit that we ſhould thus <hi>honour the Lord with our Subſtance?</hi> Does it not lie as a Reproach upon us, who make an high Profeſſion, that we expend ſo little to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Knowledge of God among the <hi>Natives,</hi> and ſo much to ill Purpoſes? Were what we imploy in unneceſſary Expences, by which Pride and Luxury are indulged and nouriſhed, imploy'd in the laudable Method I am recommending; would it not be ſufficient, well to ſupport a Multitude of Miſſionaries among the neighbouring Tribes? Would it not probably be a Means of turning many of them <hi>from the Power of Satan to God?</hi> And would it not be <hi>an Odour of a ſweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well pleaſing to God?</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. 4. 18.</note> And ſeeing God, by his Bleſſings, has inabled us to contribute to ſuch a good Deſign, ſhould we not
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:007023_0186_102AEBB11969B4F0"/>
chearfully give of our Subſtance, for the ſpiritual Benefit of the periſhing Heathen?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Should not the Light and Grace of the Goſpel, which we, thro' divine Goodneſs enjoy, be a ſtronger Argument ſtill to excite us to endeavour the Converſion of the Heathen?</p>
            <p>A few Generations back we were in a State of Heatheniſm, as they now are: <hi>Aliens from the common Wealth of Iſrael—and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the World.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. 2, 12.</note> But thro' divine Goodneſs, <hi>the Day ſpring from on High has viſited us,</hi> and we enjoy the Light &amp; Privileges of the Goſpel Diſpenſation. Seeing then God has had Compaſſion on us, and beſtow'd upon us thoſe riches Bleſſings; ought we not to have Compaſſion on the neighbouring Heathen, and uſe our beſt Endeavours that they a ſo may be made Partakers of the Light and Bleſſings of the Goſpel?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Should we not be mov'd to ſuch charitable Endeavours from the Conſideration of the wretched and forlorn Circumſtances, in which the poor <hi>Natives</hi> appear before our Eyes. We often behold thoſe piteous Objects, appearing half naked and almoſt ſtarv'd; which is the Effect of their vicious Way of Living. We ſee them alſo in the Depths of Ignorance &amp; Barbarity; wholly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Way of Salvation, and quite unconcern'd for their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good: And yet their Powers, both of Body &amp; Mind, are not inferiour to our own. Were they brought to Civility &amp; Induſtry, they might ſtand upon equal Ground with us, reſpecting the Comforts of Life: and were they inſtructed in divine Things, made acquainted with the great &amp; important Truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, they might ſtand as fair for the Kingdom of Heaven as we do. Should not our Eyes therefore affect our Hearts, when we behold them in ſuch miſerable Circumſtances? And ſhould we not exert ourſelves in all proper Ways for their Help. Did the Wounds of the poor Man <hi>half dead,</hi> who <hi>fell among Thieves,</hi> plead with ſo much Eloquence for human Compaſſion, as the unhappy State of the poor <hi>Natives</hi> does for Chriſtian Charity? And if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of a <hi>Samaritan</hi> was mov'd by the former, how much more ſhould the Bowels of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> be mov'd by the latter?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The noble Example of ſome generous &amp; pious Perſons, at Home, may well excite us to liberal Contributions for the Benefit of the poor Heathen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="unknown:007023_0187_102AEBB306C598C8"/>Not only publick Societies, but alſo private Perſons, in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> have generouſly and liberally contributed for the Benefit of the <hi>Natives</hi> in this diſtant Part of the World; as the foregoing Hiſtory ſhows. Tho' they are at 3000 Miles Diſtance, and never beheld, as we do, thoſe miſerable Objects; yet, from a truly pious and generous Spirit, they have ſent over their liberal Contributions, that the Heathen, by their Means, may be inform'd in the Way of Life. <hi>Verily, they ſhall not looſe their Reward.</hi> A noble Example they ſet before us, moſt worthy our Imitation: And how can we excuſe ourſelves, if we neglect to copy after it? Some indeed may plead their Inability, but this is not the Caſe of all. Are there not among us many wealthy Merchants &amp; Traders? Are there not alſo many Farmers, who abound in Wealth, upon the Lands which were, a few Years ago, the Property of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who now ſtand in Need of their Charity? Should not ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be mov'd, by the generous Examples of others, to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the noble Deſign of converting the Heathen? Yea, are not the People in general able to do ſomething to help forward ſo good a Deſign? And will it not lie as a Reproach upon us, if we, who make a high Profeſſion of Religion, prove void of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when we are ſo loudly call'd to the Exerciſe of it, not only by the laudable Example of generous Benefactors at Home; but alſo by the periſhing Circumſtances of the neighbouring <hi>Indians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add my hearty Wiſhes, that this <hi>American</hi> Continent, which, for Ages unknown, has been a Seat of Darkneſs, and <hi>full of the Habitations of Cruelty,</hi> may become a Scene of Light and Love; that the Heathen in it, who have been wont to thirſt after Blood, may <hi>hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs</hi>; That <hi>the Wilderneſs and ſolitary Place may be glad for them, the Deſert rejoice and bloſſom as the Roſe;—That the Glory of</hi> Lebanon <hi>may be given unto it, the Excellency of</hi> Carmel <hi>and</hi> Sharon; <hi>That they may ſee the Glory of the Lord, and the Excellency of our God.</hi>
