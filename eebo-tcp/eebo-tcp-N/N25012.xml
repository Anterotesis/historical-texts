            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AGAIN we are met to celebrate the Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of OUR NATION. One, untaught in the Schools of Science, is deputed to address you on the great, the interesting event. In under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the task, he trusts that your candor will accompany him, and that you will not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by the absence of talents which his situation in life has prevented him from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring. He does not aspire to lead the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to rouse the passions by any elocutive strains—the display of Ciceronian oratory or of Demosthenian eloquence; he will be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply gratified, if he can only command your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention while he delivers a few plain senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, expressed in the sincerity of patriotism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:033145_0007_0FF64915E6E13388"/>
The Historians of our country have acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with the rise, progress, and establishment of her freedom and independence. They have told us, and many here <hi>this day</hi> well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how the earnest petitions of the people for a redress of grievances were disregarded; every new supplication producing some new outrage, or some severer act of oppression. A mere posture of defence was at length deemed a signal for the spilling of blood, and at Lexing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton it first streamed, in the glorious cause of Freedom and our Country. Thus rendered hopeless of gaining by submission, and left without prospect of any reasonable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; finding our Country invaded, our Towns fired, and our Citizens inhumanly butchered, the delegates from the then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, solemnly appealing to Heaven for the rectitude of their intentions, declared America emancipated from the yoke of Monarchic So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and freed from any dependance on BRITAIN.</p>
            <p>The language of that celebrated declaration we have just heard<note n="*" place="bottom">It had just before been read by a citizen.</note>. It was the voice of an
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033145_0008_0FF649176D65C3E0"/>
oppressed people exclaiming against the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions of a Government, which while it was arrogating every thing to itself, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated to leave us nothing. The sentiments contained in it, ought to be deeply engraven on every heart—they point out the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man—they speak the language of a bold resistance to tyranny, and we may indeed expect that Liberty herself will expire, when they shall cease to be longer respected among us.</p>
            <p>This, however, we have reason to hope <hi>will not</hi> be the case. We trust that the same Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican spirit and virtue which animated to the contest the Heroes of the Revolution, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to prefer toil, and poverty, and suffering, and death to the slavery of their Country, will still predominate in every breast. It was gloriously triumphant over the proud legions of DESPOTIC BRITAIN; and it has subsequently prevailed in directing the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Convention of '87, to the Constitutional establishment of the liberty we at this day enjoy. May it ever continue the safeguard of Republican virtue, the scourge of anarchy, and our guide to the summit of political hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:033145_0009_0FF649190DC008E8"/>
To those who faithfully accomplished these events, we shall <hi>ever</hi> feel ourselves <hi>greatly</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted, while a sense of LIBERTY and of JUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICE prevails among us. The glory which as a people we have acquired by the Revolution, and the prosperity and happiness we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced since that period, have amply repaid us for all the hardships endured, and all the dangers encountered in its accomplishment. TO PERPETUATE the advantages we possess unimpaired to the latest posterity, is now a duty incumbent on us, as the original actors are daily passing away from this stage of human things, and as they vanish are seeming to say to their posterity, 'improve on what we have done, and let not our labours be lost to the future benefit of Mankind.'</p>
            <p>Perhaps the present opportunity cannot be better employed, than by calling your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a few moments, to some of the means necessary to effect this desirable end.</p>
            <p>And <hi>first,</hi> in addition to the sound system of Legislative policy which has been GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALLY adopted in our country, and has grown
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033145_0010_0FF6491B32E4B3A8"/>
out of the principles of our Revolution, we must individually encourage by example and by precept, the practice of all the <hi>moral virtues.</hi> Without <hi>these</hi> no free government can long exist. That they are the only true sources of individual happiness is generally conceded, though unfortunately they are but little prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised.</p>
            <p>The Bible, a venerable old book, now too often laid by on the shelf, dusty and neglected, contains an ample enumeration of them, and a glorious promise of the advantages resulting from their general application and use. This leading principle in the composition of a free government, "Do unto others as you would others should do unto you," is derived from that invaluable source; and were all our actions performed under the influence of this principle, union, equal liberty, and the steady administration of justice might certainly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as the happy result. We should then become better men, more disinterested patriots and honester politicians. For what man is there who possesses virtuous sentiments him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and would not <hi>cherish</hi> and approve of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033145_0011_0FF6491DDB3CABE8"/>
them in others? Who that sincerely loves liberty, would not conscientiously wish its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment to all the members of the community, and join in every proper measure necessary to its preservation?</p>
            <p>The principle contended for, is so plain in itself, that it would scarcely have been deemed necessary to call it into view, on this occasion, were it not, that many at the present time shew themselves willing to evade every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to the strict observance of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of morality, as bordering too much on the principles of the Christian Religion, a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of superstition, which the <hi>superior light</hi> of the present day has rendered <hi>quite</hi> unfashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> We must guard as a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable privilege, the freedom and rights of election. WHEREVER the wealthy by the influence of riches, are enabled to direct the choice of public officers, <hi>there</hi> the downfall of liberty cannot be very remote. It is our own fault if an influence so dangerous, has become in any measure prevalent among us. It would not be the case if the people did not consent
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033145_0012_0FF6491FF8C32890"/>
to become the dupes of design. It is because tradesmen, mechanics, and the industrious classes of society consider themselves of TOO LITTLE CONSEQUENCE to the body politic that <hi>any thing</hi> belonging to the system of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression at all obtains. We ought to spurn from us with disdain, the individual who would solicit our vote, from motives of personal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. He ought not to be listened to, who would <hi>demand</hi> it as the price of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or who would <hi>expect</hi> it from regard to his superior riches. It too often happens that men only capable of attracting public notice by an ostentatious display of their wealth, are deemed best qualified to protect the rights of the people, and consequently receive their suffrages; while our choice ought only to be directed to men of TALENTS and VIRTUE whatever their situation in life may be. The <hi>possession</hi> of riches is not necessarily accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by superior understanding or goodness of heart. On the contrary, the experience of ages confirms this opinion, that a state of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity is more favorable to them both.</p>
            <p>If, instead of improving on its original plan, our government, at any future period, should

be irresistably impelled in an unalterable course toward despotism, the dividing line between the <hi>rich</hi> and the <hi>poor</hi> will be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked, and the <hi>latter</hi> will be found in a state of vassallage and dependance on the former.</p>
            <p>Be it your care then, my fellow-citizens, to guard with unceasing vigilance against the growth of this evil; assume the native dignity of your character and maintain with a modest but determined spirit, the liberty of opinion. Suffer no one to DICTATE imperiously what line of conduct you are to pursue; but at the same time let no one be sacrificed at the altar of public vengeance, for a candid and liberal expression of his sentiments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> We must endeavor to acquaint ourselves with the political situation and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive interests of our country. Without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we shall either be unable to form an accurate opinion of our own, or often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the dupes of the designing. The PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC PRINTS naturally present themselves as the vehicles of this necessary knowledge. Those conducted in a spirit of liberality, yet altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033145_0014_0FF64922C093B098"/>
consonant to the principles on which our revolution was atchieved, should employ the public attention and meet its decided support. It will be found, that a JUST and EQUAL GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNMENT will ever derive additional stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as the PEOPLE obtain a more general knowledge of its principles and operations. The result is, that every sincere friend to our NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, ought sedulously to promote the dissemination of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as a barrier to the risings of sedition, as well as to the encroachments of arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Be solicitous that your children are properly educated. "Education," says the celebrated Godwin, "has the advantage of taking MIND in its original state, a soil prepared for culture, and as yet uninfested with weeds: certainly the task is much easier, to plant right and virtuous dispositions in unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced understandings, than to root up errors that have already, as it were, become a part of ourselves." Give your children, then, as your ability may permit, the opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033145_0015_0FF6182ACD369568"/>
instruction in the commonest branches; and if possible, instruct them yourselves, as to the RIGHTS which they possess, and the DUTIES which they owe to society. Teach them to love their country; to contend for liberty; to despise monarchy:—That while constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and written forms are susceptible of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, the principles of TRUTH and of JUSTICE are eternal and imprescriptible. Learn them, as their political creed, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal declaration of our rights and emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, the promulgation of which, we have <hi>this day</hi> met to celebrate. Encourage them to the reverence of the aged; to the exercise of candor, sincerity, and universal benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and in general to the practice of every social and moral virtue.</p>
            <p>Thus will the increase of knowledge and patriotism be promoted, and we shall have far less reason to fear the PREDICTED reign of VICE and TYRANNY. How often have we been told, that our government, fast following in the footsteps of the ancient establishments of Europe, will <hi>soon</hi> overtake them in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer of despotism? Have we not heard the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033145_0016_0FF64927CA514410"/>
language of complaint resounding through the nation—'the sword of the REVOLUTION, long since returned to its scabbard, is buried in rust; the rights which it maintained, and the principles which it defended, are nearly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. A FATAL SECURITY, while it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terates and cancels what is past, opens an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple field for the sports of TYRANNY and the arts of CORRUPTION! Reflection, the nurse of manly and heroic sentiments, the guardian, life, and protector of public free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is extinguished! The hoary WARRIOR feels our ingratitude and laments our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The tear of regret steals down his chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neled cheek. On the precipice of the grave, he sighs for the misfortunes and the servitude of future generations. Seven LONG YEARS have I toiled in vain—the principles for which I struggled, are withering away—the rising generation are forgetting their rights, and neglecting the duties of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I rejoice that I cannot live, to be a witness of the shame and enthralment of my country. It wounds me to the heart, to see some of those who gallantly fought by my side—who swore never to survive the disgrace
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033145_0017_0FF6492A1AC81FF8"/>
of their country, the determined advocates of measures that are pregnant with public ruin. With indignation I see them pursuing max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of government, that lead to the misery and degradation of mankind. BUT, I see them through the veil of years, and feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self incapable of arresting their progress. Yet a <hi>little</hi> time and I am no more—a perversion of principle and a corruption of heart, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult my memory, and triumph o'er my grave!' Who can view <hi>without emotion,</hi> this interesting picture of our situation, which the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has drawn? Who is there, that would <hi>designedly</hi> render it just? If none of US would, then ought we to endeavor to preserve the purity of public morals, and to keep a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye over the <hi>conduct</hi> of our public officers: for whatever their political sentiment may be, we ought never to forget that they are MEN.</p>
            <p>Well aware of the rocks, on which SO MANY have been dashed to pieces, let us by a sacred regard to social duty, endeavor to preserve our POLITICAL BARQUS safe, in her progress on the OCEAN OF TIME.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:033145_0018_0FF6492C49F408E0"/>
MY COUNTRYMEN! You have been fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the accomplishment of a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, and for the establishment of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent form of government; preserve with the most scrupulous attention the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages you possess. By your all-important exertions the progress of mind has been greatly accelerated; and the HUMAN RACE must ultimately be benefited by them. The long enslaved nations of EUROPE, have caught the blaze of freedom, and are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your example, in adopting the principles of self-government: The hydra of despotism will THERE soon be subdued, and order and fair liberty, will arise out of the confusion, dismay, and carnage in which the nations are involved. Already the mild lights of reason and philosophy become <hi>superior</hi> to the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism and delusion, of the ignorant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing. Behold! the era of CENERAL VIRTUE, LIBERTY, and HAPPINESS is at hand, may our endeavors be united to hasten its approach!</p>
