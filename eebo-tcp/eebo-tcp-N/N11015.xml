            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have a peculiar claim to an addreſs from the authors of the Criſis, and it ſhall be our buſineſs in this paper to preſerve, if poſſible, the periſhable infamy of your names.</p>
            <p>The motion made by Lord Radnor, on Monday the 27th of February, concerning number III. of the Criſis, was unjuſt and villanous, the paper contains nothing but the moſt ſacred truths, and therefore could not be a falſe or ſcandalous libel; the amendment of the epithet treaſonable, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſupported by the Lords Pomfret, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Apſley and Sandwich, was infamous, and of a piece with every other proceeding of the preſent
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013961_0002_0F925B1A02E84340"/>reign, and preſent miniſtry. It ſhewed, in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner, the bloody minded diſpoſitions of proſtituted Court Lords, the inſtruments of murder and public ruin. The immaculate Lord Sandwich inſiſted that the word treaſonable ſhould ſtand part of the motion, as a proper foundation for bringing the authors to exemplary and condign puniſhment. Suppoſe, my Lords, this infamous amendment to the Radnor motion had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and it had ſtood a falſe, ſcandalous and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable libel, could the mere <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> of a few venal Lords make that treaſon, which in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or conſtructive ſenſe of the word was not ſo.</p>
            <p>The author of number III. is perfectly well acquainted with the ſtatute of treaſons, paſſed in the reign of Edward the IIId. and likewiſe with the various expoſitions and interpretations of it. He well knew, the paper was written upon the true principles of the Revolution, and that it could be juſtified by the laws of the land; he well knew (though there is hardly any villany but what court ſycophants may do with eaſe) that it was not in the power of Lord Mansfield, with all his chica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, with all his artifice, with all his abuſe of the law, with all his perverſion of juſtice, with all the aid of falſe conſtruction, and forced inuendos, to bring it within the meaning of that ſtatute; he well knew the diſpoſition of the ſovereign and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that nothing would, or can ſatiate royal Scotch, or miniſterial revenge, but the blood of thoſe who oppoſe the preſent moſt horridly cruel, and moſt infamouſly wicked meaſures of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, my Lords, he well knew the ſhocking proſtitution of hereditary peerage, and the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced treachery and villany of a purchaſed majority in the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:013961_0003_0F925B1AB89BE9B0"/>
Has there not, my Lords, been innocent blood enough ſhed in this reign, that your Lordſhips ſhould ſtill thirſt for more. Why ſhould your Lordſhips be ſo deſirous of ſtopping every channel of public information, the infamy of your actions are ſufficiently known, and will be handed down to the lateſt ages of time, while your names will ſtink in the noſtrils of poſterity.</p>
            <p>The ſtatute of treaſons, my Lords, paſſed in the 25th year of the reign of Edward the IIId. was an act of vaſt importance to the public weal; for till then, there was hardly a word ſpoke, or a paper written, but what was deemed treaſon, and the parliament, which paſſed it, were called <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum Parliamentum,</hi> the Bleſſed Parliament.</p>
            <p>The ſubſtance of this ſtatute is branched out by my Lord Cooke into ſix heads, which we ſhall here give, with ſome obſervations of our own, to ſhew your Lordſhips, and the world, that number III. of the Criſis is not within the meaning of either of theſe heads, and that by your amended motion you deſigned to lay the ground work of a proſecution, the moſt cruel and infamous ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in this country, worſe than thoſe which, without proof or the colour of guilt, took away the lives of the great Lord Ruſſel, and Algernoon Sidney.</p>
            <p>The firſt head is concerning death; by compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or imagining the death of the King, Queen, or Prince, and declaring the ſame by ſome overt deed. By killing or murdering the Chancellor, Treaſurer, Juſtice of either Bench, Juſtice in Eyre, Juſtices of Aſſize, Juſtices of Oyer and Terminer, in their places, during their offices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:013961_0004_0F925B1BB5AE7268"/>
The ſecond, is to violate, that is to know car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Queen, the King's eldeſt daughter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, the Prince's wife. The third is levying war againſt the King.</p>
            <p>The fourth, is adhering to the King's enemies, within the realm or without, and declaring the ſame by ſome overt act.</p>
            <p>The fifth is, counterfeiting the Great, the Privy-Seal, or the King's coin.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and laſt, by bringing into this realm counterfeit money, to the likeneſs of the King's coin.</p>
            <p>Firſt. To compaſs and imagine, is to contrive, deſign, or intend the death of the King; but this muſt be declared by ſome overt act, declaring by an open act a deſign to depoſe or impriſon the King, is an overt act, to manifeſt the compaſſing his death. I believe, my Lords, the author of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber III. of the Criſis is not under the predicament of this expoſition.</p>
            <p>Second. By the word King is intended, 1. A King before his coronation, as ſoon as ever the crown deſcends upon him; for the coronation is but a ceremony. 2. A King <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> is a King within this act, and treaſon againſt him is puniſhable, though the right heir get the crown.</p>
            <p>Third. Note, It is very ſtrange, but in the printed ſtature book, it is there ſaid, <hi>probably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,</hi> which is a groſs error; for the words of the record are, <hi>et de ceux provablement ſoit attaint,</hi> and ſhall be thereof provably attaint; and it is amazing to me that ſo groſs a miſtake ſhould be ſuffered, ſince my Lord Cooke has ſo expreſſy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the difference in theſe words following, 3.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013961_0005_0F925B1FD39B8030"/>Inſt. fol. 12 In this branch, ſaith he, four things are to be obſerved. 1. This word <hi>(prova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blement)</hi> provably, that is upon direct and manifeſt proof, not upon conjectural preſumptions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, or ſtrains of wit, but upon good and ſufficient proof; and herein the adverb <hi>(provable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi> provably hath great force, and ſignifieth a direct and plain proof; and therefore the offender muſt provably be attainted, which words are as forcible as upon direct and manifeſt proof. Note, The word is not probably, for then <hi>commune ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum</hi> might have ſerved, but the word is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably be attainted. 2. The word attaint neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implieth that he be proceeded with, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted according to the due courſe of law, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of law, and not by abſolute power, or by other means, as in former times had been uſed; and therefore if a man doth adhere to the enemies of the King, or be ſlain in open war againſt the King, or otherwiſe die before the attainder of treaſon, he forfeiteth nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as the act ſaith) he is not attainted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this act hath altered that, which before this act, in caſe of treaſon, was taken for law. And the ſtatute of 34 Ed. III. ſayes nothing to the King, but that which was in <hi>eſſe,</hi> and pertaining to the King at the making of that act. And this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by a judgment in parliament in ann. 29, H. VI. that Jack Cade, being ſlain in open rebellion, could no ways be puniſhed, or forfeit any thing, and therefore was attainted by that act of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. 3. Of open deed, <hi>per apertum factum,</hi> theſe words ſtrengthen the former expoſition of <hi>(prova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blement)</hi> an overt act muſt be alledged in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment upon this act, and proved compaſſing by
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013961_0006_0F925B2008A46ED0"/>bare words is not an overt act, as appears by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporary ſtatutes againſt it. But there muſt be ſome open act, which muſt be manifeſtly proved. As if divers do conſpire the death of the King, and the manner how, and thereupon provide wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, powder, poiſon, harneſs, ſend letters, and the like for the execution of the conſpirators. If a ſubject conſpire with a foreign Prince, to invade the realm by open hoſtility, and prepare for the ſame by ſome overt act, this is a ſufficient overt act for the death of the King. 4thly, A conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy is had to levy war, this is no treaſon by this act, until it be levied, therefore it is no overt act, or manifeſt proof of the compaſſing the death of the King within this act, for the words are <hi>de ceo, &amp;c. thereof,</hi> that is, of the compaſſing of the death. The wiſdom of the makers of this law would not make bare words to be treaſon, ſeeing ſuch variance commonly among the witneſſes, about the ſame, as few of them agree together.</p>
            <p>In the preamble of the ſtatute of 1 Mar. (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the repeal of certain treaſons declared after this ſtatute of 25 Edw. IIId. and before that time, and bringing all things to the meaſures of this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) it was agreed by the whole Parliament, that laws juſtly made for the preſervation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, without extreme puniſhment, are more often obeyed and kept than laws and ſtatutes made with great and extreme puniſhments, and in ſpecial ſuch laws and ſtatutes ſo made, whereby not only the ignorant and rude unlearned people, but alſo learned and expert people, minding honeſty, are often times trapped and ſnared, yea many times for words only, without other fact or deed done or perpetrated. Therefore this act of the 25th
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013961_0007_0F925B2119935148"/>Ed. IIId. doth provide that there muſt be an overt act. 5thly, As to treaſon, by levying war againſt the King we muſt note, that though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring or compaſſing to levy war, without a war <hi>de facto,</hi> be no treaſon, yet it may conſpire a war, and only ſome few actually levy it, all are guilty of the treaſon. Raiſing a force to burn or throw down a particular incloſure is only a riot, but if it had been to have gone from town to town, to throw down all incloſures, or to change religion, or the like, it were levying of war, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended miſchief is public. Holding a fort or caſtle againſt the King's force is levying war. 6th, Counterfeiting the Great or Privy Seal is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but it muſt be an actual counterfeiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, compaſſing to do it is no treaſon; affixing the Great Seal by the Chancellor without warrant, is no treaſon; fixing a new Great Seal to another pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is great miſpriſon, but no treaſon, being not counterfeiting within this act; but aiders and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters are within this act. 7th, Treaſon concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing coin is counterfeiting the King's coin; and this was treaſon at common law, and judgment only as of petty treaſon; but clipping, &amp;c. being made treaſon by other ſtatutes, the judgment is to be drawn, hanged and quartered. Money here extends only to the proper money of this realm. 8th, As this ſtatute leaves all other doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matters to be declared treaſon in parliament, but not to be puniſhed as ſuch, till ſo declared. So in ſucceeding Kings reigns abundance of other matters were declared treaſon, which being found very grievous and dangerous by the ſtatute 1 Mar. it is enacted, that thenceforth no act, deed or offence, being by act of parliament or ſtatute, made treaſon, petty treaſon, or miſpriſon of treaſon,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013961_0008_0F925B2178B0B9D0"/>by words, writing, cyphering, deeds otherwiſe however, ſhall be taken, had, deemed or adjudged to be high treaſon, petty treaſon, or miſpriſon of treaſon, but only ſuch as be declared and expreſſed to be treaſon, petty treaſon, or miſpriſon of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by this ſtatute of 25 Edw. IIId.</p>
            <p>Here we reſt the matter, my Lords, convinced the author of Number III. is not within the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſtatute, nor any expoſition of it, and that the deſign of your Lordſhips, in adding the epithet treaſonable, was wicked, baſe and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and will be ſure to ſecure to you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and deteſtation of every honeſt man.</p>
