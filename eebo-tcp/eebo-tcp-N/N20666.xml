            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM LXXXVII.2.</bibl>
                  <p>THE LORD LOVETH THE GATES OF ZION, MORE THAN ALL THE DWELLINGS OF JACOB.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE heaven of heavens cannot contain the Almighty: Yet he condeſcendeth to dwell with man on earth, with him that is of a humble and contrite ſpirit: He look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from the habitation of his holineſs, with grace and goodneſs, on every humble ſupplicant of his mercy: He acknowledges a temple, in every heart, that truly worſhips him: He hears the moſt ſecret prayer of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And accepts, as a pleaſing ſacrifice, even the hidden devotion of the inmoſt ſoul.</p>
            <p>Real piety, however, is not confined to the boſom where it reſides. And though, in the view of him who deſireth truth in the inward part, that ſervice only is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, that is offered with a diſpoſition which can be diſcerned by none but God; yet genuine religion will not conceal itſelf from the public eye. Like the lamp that giveth light to every part of the houſe, it will ſhine in all our deportment; and be viſible through every part of our character, as men, and as creatures of the living God.</p>
            <p>From a general conviction of this truth, probably hath ariſen the general conſent of mankind, to the obligations of public and ſocial worſhip.</p>
            <p>However this may be, we find it to have been the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all nations, from the earlieſt periods, to cultivate ſome public inſtitutions of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which, in a ſocial manner, they preſented the ſacrifices of devotion to the Deity.</p>
            <p>It is our privilege, who enjoy the light of revelation. to know, that what men have generally eſteemed the firſt
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:027135_0003_0FD495620A5A2198"/>
duty of ſociety, is a duty of the firſt importance, and moſt highly acceptable in the eye of God himſelf: As it is expreſſed in our text, "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob."</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary to enter on a critical examination of this Pſalm, in order to throw light upon theſe words. The reaſon of ſo honorable a preference given to Zion, was that there was the ſeat of the temple. There, in a peculiar manner, dwelt the divine preſence. Thence it pleaſed God to deliver the divine oracles, and to ſend forth his prophets. And there was the place, appointed for the aſſembling of all Iſrael, to preſent their united offerings to the Lord.</p>
            <p>The chriſtian diſpenſation, it is true, enlarges and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends our privilege. God is not now confined to temples made with hands: And neither the mountain of Samaria, nor yet Jeruſalem, is entitled to the peculiar honor of his ſacred preſence. The promiſed hour is come, when the true worſhippers worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth. In every place where men call upon the Lord, where two or three are gathered together in the name of Chriſt, he is there in the midſt of them. We immediately perceive, however, on contemplating theſe circumſtances, how friendly an aſpect they have towards the public worſhip of chriſtian ſocieties: And we naturally infer from them, that if it pleaſed God to honor with the peculiar tokens of his favor, the coſtly rites and laborious forms of the Moſaic inſtitutions, much more will he accept the ſimple and unadorned, but ſpiritual worſhip of the goſpel. In this view how animating and encouraging is ſuch a declaration as this in the text, to every undertaking for the promotion of public worſhip in the goſpel church: "The Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more than all the dwellings of Jacob." The import of this is, that God is pleaſed indeed with the ſacrifice of an humble mind, with the ſecret worſhip of the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with the retired offerings of the individual; but will more eſpecially bleſs and honor the public aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of his ſaints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:027135_0004_0FD49565D2F4C498"/>It is my intention in conſidering this ſubject, a little more particularly to point out to you the benefits of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and then to direct to ſome ſuitable application of the diſcourſe. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is an important benefit of public worſhip, that it promotes the improvement of human nature, in the moſt uſeful and valuable attainments; inſpires and cultivates thoſe diſpoſitions and habits, which enable men to act their part with propriety, in the preſent world, and fits and prepares them for future happineſs.</p>
            <p>It is obvious that the chriſtian worſhip, of which we are now ſpeaking, is calculated to enlarge the ſphere of the human underſtanding, preſents to its conſideration many new objects of infinite importance to the happineſs of mankind, and if duly attended to, muſt accelerate the advancement of the rational powers towards their higheſt ſtate of perfection. Thoſe pure and exalted conceptions which the goſpel worſhip inſpires of the great God, as the creator of the univerſe, the kind and gracious parent of his intelligent creatures, the righteous governor of the world, who diſpoſeth all things, relating to men, for the promotion of the virtue, the wiſdom, and the happineſs of mankind: Thoſe glorious and ſublime ideas, under which the divine perfections are preſented to us, as the objects of our adoration: That humbling impreſſion of our own condition, which is enforced on our hearts, as in a ſtate of apoſtacy and revolt from God; and that illuſtrious diſplay of mercy towards fallen man, in the redemption, by which alone we can draw nigh to our Maker in hope: Muſt at once enkindle the devout affections, inſpire with the love of virtue, and arm the ſoul with fortitude in the purſuit of divine attainments.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the frequent recollection of theſe great ideas, eſpecially with a view to the devout expreſſion of our reverence and regard to God, cannot but raiſe the mind to a degree of elevation, far above what it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of by any other means.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:027135_0005_0FD4956745332188"/>Doth the knowledge of human ſciences improve the underſtanding? Is the ſoul enlarged by an acquaintance with the works of nature, with hiſtory and philoſophy? How inferior are the higheſt attainments in theſe, to thoſe juſt apprehenſions of the divine perfections, and of the myſtery of ſalvation which we are taught in our holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion! Even in this view, the chriſtian worſhip preſents us with a ſource of knowledge, the moſt improving and ſublime. But while, by theſe means, it ſets before our eyes the perfections, the government, and the grace of God, in a light the moſt amiable and captivating, in a light the moſt encouraging to every truly pious and devout mind: There is a grandeur and ſolemnity in the principles of the goſpel worſhip, which muſt at once awaken in the heart, a reſpect for the divine adminiſtration and a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſuitable to our condition as lapſed, but redeemed creatures.</p>
            <p>What an awful and affecting circumſtance is it, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when a whole aſſembly proſtrate their ſouls at the foot-ſtool of ſovereign mercy: Where none preſumes to claim acceptance, but on the principles of repentance and faith in the atonement of the redeemer! What an idea doth it give us of the ſanctity of the divine laws, of the ſtrictneſs of his juſtice, and of the wonders of his love, when we contemplate that aſtoniſhing method of ſalvation which is frequently preſented to our conſideration, and ought always to be kept in recollection in our ſolemn approaches to the Deity. How ſtrongly are the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of piety and virtue enforced by the conſideration of the reſpect which theſe ſolemn tranſactions have to futurity. While in public worſhip we ſtand, as it were, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of both worlds, an unbounded proſpect opens upon us into eternity, and marks, with peculiar emphaſis, the importance of our ſtation and character here on earth. We are led to conſider ourſelves as probationers for a future ſtate of exiſtence, in which we are to be fixed in everlaſting abodes of happineſs or puniſhment, agreeably
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027135_0006_0FD49568BB0632F0"/>
to our improvement or neglect of the advantages and duties of the preſent ſtate.</p>
            <p>Who that familiariſes theſe ſentiments to his ſoul, by a regular attendance on the duties of ſocial worſhip, will not experience ſome happy influence of them on his heart! At leaſt, as far as religious principles can, in the nature of things, be effectual, he muſt be rendered by them a wiſer and better man.</p>
            <p>In proportion to the ſincerity of his belief of them, they muſt not only humble him in the duſt, as a ſinner who hath forfeited the favor of heaven; and impreſs upon his heart a thankful ſenſe of his obligations to redeeming grace: But diſpoſe him, in all things, to maintain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence both towards God and towards man.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, under this head, that a ſtated atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the ordinances of public worſhip hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to fit and prepare the ſoul for future happineſs.</p>
            <p>As it improves and enlarges the underſtanding, as it inſpires with ſentiments of devotion, as under the divine bleſſing, it is highly inſtrumental in purifying the heart, and promoting the habits of godlineſs and virtue; it aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milates the mind to that bleſt ſociety, who have already arrived at a ſtate of perfection. But as it conſiſts in itſelf, of a ſeries of devout employments, it may be conſidered, in ſome ſenſe, as heaven already enjoyed on earth. The ſame gratitude and love, that animate the ſongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the hearts of the redeemed in glory; the ſame unity of ſpirit that binds them in everlaſting bonds of angelic affection, are already in ſome meaſure in exerciſe, in every pure goſpel church on earth; and by means moſt proper for the purpoſe, are in the way of improvement towards perfection.</p>
            <p>While, therefore, we unite in the devout employments of goſpel worſhip, we are in the practice of thoſe habits which conſtitute the employments of the heavenly ſtate; of thoſe habits which tend to imprint upon our ſoul a ſenſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:027135_0007_0FD4956C822CB3A0"/>
of our obligations to every moral virtue; of thoſe habits which refine and purify the heart, and fit and prepare us for eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. It is an intereſting advantage of public <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>ip, that it prepares the mind for thoſe trials to which human nature is unavoidably expoſed; and furniſhes it with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt the ills and diſtreſſes of life.</p>
            <p>It would be eaſy to expatiate on the forlorn and helpleſs ſtate of a man, without the benefits and conſolations of religion. He finds himſelf, by the very conſtitution of his nature, in many reſpects, a child of ſorrow. Through all the various ſtages of his being, his way is marked with unexpected viciſſitudes. The blandiſhments of childhood and youth are ſucceeded by the woes of riper years. The proſperity of the morning is eclipſed by the afflictions which ſuddenly ariſe to darken his horizon; and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the evening deſcend upon him thickened with the gloom of melancholy diſappointment. Untaught in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious truths, he perceives nothing in the ways of providence but myſterious darkneſs. He is loſt in a labyrinth of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable events. He knows not what to look for from preſent appearances; whether he may hope in the divine protection on the tempeſtuous ſea of life; or what is to be the final iſſue of thoſe perplexing circumſtances with which he is ſurrounded.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation, what a ſource of light, of comfort and ſupport are the ordinances of religion? In the goſpel we are inſtructed in thoſe ways of providence, which philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and reaſon have attempted to inveſtigate in vain. We here learn, that the occaſion of thoſe calamities which happen alike to the good and the wicked, is the univerſal guilt of human nature: That in the midſt of the days of our vanity, however, God is the father and the friend of them that fear him: That he conducts the diſpenſations of his providence with an eternal regard to order, truth and virtue: That, however complex our preſent ſituation may appear, he hath ordained an happy iſſue to every event, in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:027135_0008_0FD49570C6F7B100"/>
which the children of his mercy are concerned: That he hath opened a way for the deliverance of his fallen crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from all the inconveniencies which they are liable to on account of ſin, by Jeſus Chriſt his beloved ſon: And hath ſecured to them that return to him and accept his grace, a preſent benefit in all their ſorrows, and in future, a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</p>
            <p>It would be a pleaſure to reflect on theſe truths—It would at leaſt, inſpire the ſuffering mind with hope, were it only probable he might become a partaker in ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. But how much more cheering is it, in a diſtreſſed hour, to know that God himſelf, hath appointed the means by which theſe bleſſings flow to every creature, who ſeeks them according to his goſpel: That for this end he hath "given ſome apoſtles, and ſome prophets, and ſome evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, and ſome paſtors and, teachers, for the perfecting the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying the body of Chriſt."</p>
            <p>How ſupporting, how encouraging is it in the moſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeaſons of adverſity, to be permitted to approach to the Almighty in thoſe ſealing ordinances, in which he ratifies the promiſes of his grace; in which he admits the claim of the children of his covenant on his favor and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: in which he renews and confirms the declarations of his grace and kindneſs towards them that hope in his ſalvation, and are obedient to his word.</p>
            <p>Do we derive ſupport from religion in the ſilent hours of retirement? How much more may we expect it in the uſe and enjoyment of thoſe pledges of unchanging goodneſs, to which we are invited, in the aſſemblies of his ſaints! <hi>That</hi> furniſhes a recollection of the grounds of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and of a better hope, and more ſubſtantial enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hereafter: But <hi>theſe</hi> are the evidences, that enſtamp with a ſacred authority all the promiſes of God, become a viſible ſecurity, on the part of heaven for the accompliſhment of his word, and add ſtrong conſolation to the confidence of theſe, who have fled for refuge, to the hope of the goſpel.</p>

            <p n="3">3d Place; it is a high advantage of public worſhip, that it is one of the beſt means of promoting and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benevolent and ſocial affections in the human heart.</p>
            <p>There is no ſituation in which men can poſſibly appear in ſo endearing a point of light to one another, as when they are aſſembled in one ſociety, to adore the God and Father of the univerſe. No circumſtance ſo effectually calls every generous affection into exerciſe, as when they offer their united praiſes, join in one common ſupplication before the mercy ſeat of heaven; and expreſs their earneſt hope and expectation of living together forever in the enjoyment of undivided bleſſings in the kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Here all diſtinctions die. All animoſities and contentions ceaſe. In the preſence of God we ſtand all on one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon level. As ſinners we are naturally alike; in the ſame ſtate of condemnation, entitled to the ſame hopes, liable to the ſame fears, with an equal intereſt in the benefits of pardoning mercy, and equally concerned in the worthy performance of the duties we are employed in.</p>
            <p>How much is it to the intereſt of mankind, that thoſe ſeaſons, which habituate them to conſider one another in ſo pleaſing a point of view, return as frequently as poſſible! Theſe are the moſt effectual means of ſoftening and human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing the heart; and of promoting thoſe noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſpoſitions, which are the higheſt ornament of human nature.</p>
            <p>It may be thought, that moral virtue may ſubſiſt equally well independent of religion. Articles of religious belief it may perhaps be ſaid, are mere points of ſpeculation, which have little influence on the morals of mankind. But the obſervances we are pleading for, have an indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effect on the ſentiments of the heart; and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt have a ſenſible influence on the life and manners of the ſincerely conſcientious. In them, at leaſt, they muſt promote a generous philanthropy; and will become a ſtrong ſecurity for their performance of all the duties

which they owe to ſociety. Nay, even the inconſiderate and unthinking, who have not experienced the ſublime influence of religion in ſo effectual a manner, may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs be reſtrained by them in their career, and become better members of the community.<note n="*" place="bottom">This appears to me to be a moſt important conſideration, in a young country, riſing by a ſwift progreſs to opulence and power.

In many reſpects it does not lie within the reach of ſocial regulations; but a ſenſe of God and religion naturally reſtrains the exceſſes which grow out of a ſtate of proſperity, and teaches men to correct in themſelves, many of thoſe levities, which, however pernicious their tendency in ſociety, cannot be ſuppreſſed by its laws.

            <p>For the application of this ſubject:</p>
            <p>What hath been ſaid on the advantages of public worſhip, may be conſidered as an argument of our obligation to encourage and promote it.</p>
            <p>You have well done, my brethren, who have entered on this uſeful, neceſſary and intereſting undertaking in this place. The ſucceſs, which hath thus far followed your endeavours, and enabled you to repair a building for the worſhip of God, which hath ſo long lain uſeleſs and in ruins, is a pleaſing intimation of the favor of Providence on the deſign. What hath already been effected, ought to evince to you, with what facility you may accompliſh any pious and uſeful undertaking, when you act in concert and with a willing mind. With equal eaſe, I doubt not, you will be able to proceed in the fulfillment of your plan, in eſtabliſhing amongſt you, the miniſtry of the word of God. Conſiderable and perſevering exertions may ſtill be requiſite for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:027135_0011_0FD49577C5911068"/>Permit me, however, to remind you, that the object you have in view is well worthy of all your attention. When obtained, it will bring with it a reward, which will be of growing value to them that enjoy it, through all the changing ſcenes of this mortal ſtate, and which will ſhine with inextinguiſhable luſtre in the world to come.</p>
            <p>In this building you have opened a fountain from which, with the bleſſing of God, will flow ſome of the moſt invaluable benefits to yourſelves, to your children, and to ſociety. The word of truth, diſpenſed from this place, like a river that enriches the ſoil, while it beautifies and adorns the country through which it paſſes, will diffuſe thoſe ſtreams of religious knowledge which ſhall improve the heart and better the underſtanding, and add the beauty of virtue to the life of many. No deſign could be better calculated to promote individual or ſocial happineſs; for, while Chriſtianity forms a man for the enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while it furniſhes his mind with uſeful and intereſting ſentiments, while it refines his ſoul, adminiſters comfort to him in adverſity, and heightens his enjoyment in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; while thus it multiplies and enlarges his means of perſonal ſatisfaction, it renders him a more uſeful mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the community. The example of a good man is a public benefit; religion ſheds a luſtre on his conduct which makes it venerable; his virtues command the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and recommend themſelves to the imitation of all around him; his preſence chaſes away vice and folly; and his converſation, generally, is promotive of ſound and uſeful knowledge.</p>
            <p>In all the ſocial characters men are improved by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The magiſtrate and the private citizen, the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Religion is the firſt bond of the ſocial compact, the only tie of union among

mankind, which can preſerve that harmony, good order, and decorum, which are eſſential to the common good. We find that this formed the baſis of thoſe ſyſtems of policy by which men have, from the earlieſt ages, been reduced to a ſtate of ſociety; and if religion, darkened with ignorance and error, and burdened with ſuperſtition, was ſo precious an inſtrument in the hands of the wiſeſt legiſlators and ſovereigns, how much more may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it when illuſtrated and explained in the purity and under the authority of the goſpel?</p>
            <p>After all the parade that hath been made of philoſophy, of the light of reaſon, and of natural virtue, it is to the influence of Chriſtianity that we are indebted for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the refinement and purity of morals that is to be found amongſt men at this day. As Chriſtianity hath ſpread her light around, learning and the liberal arts have been more cultivated and improved; men have acquired a better knowledge of the general rights of human nature, have framed wiſe and liberal ſyſtems of civil government, and are advancing towards that ſtate of light and purity when they ſhall no more hurt nor deſtroy, and the
<q>earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</q>
But, above all, by the light of Chriſtianity many are conducted in the paths of truth and virtue, are inſtructed in the knowledge of eternal life, and prepared for the everlaſting bleſſings and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Such are the benefits you are obtaining, ſuch the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which, by divine goodneſs, you are enabled to promote in ſociety; and you have the greater reaſon to expect to ſucceed in it, when you recollect that it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign on which the divine approbation is pronounced, in ſuch expreſſions as thoſe in the text—
<q>The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</q>
Private methods of inſtruction and improvement may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his bleſſing, and be attended with advantage; but it is to public worſhip, and to the ſocial uſe of divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:027135_0013_0FD4957B229D7B10"/>
that his favour is peculiarly promiſed. This auſpicious day places you, in that reſpect, in a ſituation the moſt eligible and promiſing. Many motives ariſe from this conſideration, to induce your ſtedfaſtneſs and perſeverance in promoting the cauſe which you have ſo ſeaſonably and ſo judiciouſly undertaken.</p>
            <p>By theſe means you will contribute towards the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the beſt intereſts of ſociety. You will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the diſſemination of religious and uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; you may probably have the ſatisfaction of reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many from the error of their ways; the benefit of your pious care will deſcend to the lateſt poſterity; and the bleſſing of millions, that were ready to periſh, will come upon you.</p>
            <p>Go on, therefore, with the reſolution and unanimity with which you have begun; endeavour to ſtrengthen amongſt you the bonds of peace, and to be yourſelves living examples of that virtue, benevolence and juſtice, which are the ornaments of human nature, and which it is the deſign of all religious inſtitutions to promote. Above all, endeavour to obtain thoſe ſaving benefits by the goſpel, which, as they will add a luſtre to your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and render you a bleſſing to mankind, will alſo fit and prepare you for future happineſs. Uſe your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages with a view to the renovation of your nature, and for your improvement in all holy and godlike attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that while, in the goſpel, you behold the glory of the Lord, as in a glaſs, you may be changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord; and may the God of all grace ſhine upon you and bleſs you. In a peculiar manner may he own and proſper this pious work, and cauſe
<q>the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ariſe upon it with bleſſings in his rays! Then ſhall your light go forth as the morning, and your judgment as the noon day.</q>
