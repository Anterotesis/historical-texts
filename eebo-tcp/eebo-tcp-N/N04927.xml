            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AFTER an Abſence of near ſix Years from this Province (my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) and my Arrival among you, I have beheld the Faces of many of the Inhabitants whom I have known, and been known to, ſome Years: But the Novelty of my religious Sentiments, and Meanneſs of my Appearance, has, I find, render'd me deſpicable in your Eyes; which has been obvious, when a few of us, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have met to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Supreme Being in a Manner agreeable to the beſt of our Underſtanding and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And tho' ſome perhaps may ſtile our Principles <note n="*" place="bottom">Any Perſon who deſire to be informed of the Principles of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> is referred to <hi>Robert Barclay's Apology,</hi> ſince I find we are oftentimes condemned unheard. <hi>But he that anſwereth a Matter before he heareth it, it is Folly and Shame unto him,</hi> Prov. xviii. 13. The <hi>Apology</hi> may be had at <hi>Mary Blamyer</hi>'s, in <hi>Charles-Town.</hi>
               </note> and Tenets by the hard Name of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and our Mode or Manner of Worſhip, rediculous or abſurd; nevertheleſs, we are humbly of Opinion, they are neither <hi>unſcriptural</hi> nor <hi>unchriſtian,</hi> having, as we think, the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Authority of our Lord himſelf, the Example of primitive Believers, and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on our Side.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006166_0003_1027FD1CF53A3498"/>But notwithſtanding, as I have noted, that I have ſuffered your Ridicule and Reproach, as I am conſcious it is for no other than Obedience to the Will of my Heavenly Maſter, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, I am willing to become more vile in your Eyes; which, it is more than probable, I ſhall appear, when I expoſe the following Lines to your Obſervation and Cenſure. I would not have you imagine that any Conſideration, leſs than his Favour, could have prevailed with me to have appeared thus publickly in Print, or otherwiſe; for could I, with any eaſe to my own Mind, have evaded this, or been excuſed from returning to this Place (as I apprehended it required of me by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) you had never beheld my Face in the Province, much leſs any Performance of this Sort in publick. I am not inſenſible, that the Reaſon I have offered for writing, as well as the Subject itſelf, may probably be conſidered as the Production of a diſtemper'd and enthuſiaſtick Brain; as it is poſſible, on ſuch a novel and uncommon Occaſion, as a Woman's appearing on the Behalf of God and Religion, you may (as others have done in the like Circumſtances) be induced to conſider ſuch an One under ſome unaccountable Deluſion, or affected with religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Madneſs; and more eſpecially, as the Things recommended to your Conſideration, are offered by a ſimple Female of your own Country: Some, in this Caſe, I expect, will afford me a Smile of Contempt, while others (acted by a more generous Paſſion) pity my Folly and kindly wiſh me a Return of my Senſes: But
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006166_0004_1027FD1E812FB600"/>
however this may be, I have conſidered, that from the earlieſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in all preceeding Time, thoſe who refuſed to conform to the Uſage and wicked Cuſtoms of the Age, and lived a ſelf-denying Life,
<q>Their Lives were counted Madneſs by the World, and their End to be without Honour:</q>
Not conſidering that Religious Minds deſpiſe and contemn all worldly Honour, and earthly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, ſeeking that only which comes from God, and which he is pleaſed to diſtinguiſh thoſe by, who honour him (by walking in Conformity to his Laws and Precepts) as he himſelf declares, <hi>Thoſe who honour me, I will honour; but thoſe who deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I proceed to what the Title-page mentions, I ſhall premiſe one Propoſition, on which all I have to offer will greatly depend, <hi>viz. That all Mankind have a Meaſure and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Light, Spirit, or Grace of God, given them to profit withal.</hi> This Doctrine of the univerſal Extent of the Grace of God, the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> hold in a peculiar Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and are diſtinguiſhed by, from ſome other diſſenting Sects, who generally limit God's Gifts of his Holy Spirit, or ſaving Means, to what they call <hi>The Elect</hi>; and aſſert, that the reſt of Mankind are (as they term it) <hi>paſſed by,</hi> or denied the Means of Salvation, being <note n="*" place="bottom">To refute the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> read Doctor <hi>Whitby</hi> on the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi>; and his Diſcourſes on the <hi>Five Controverted Points</hi>; which may be had of <hi>John Whitter,</hi> on <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Iſland.</hi>
               </note> predeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinated from all Eternity to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>However, we ſay that this Gift of the Holy Spirit, or Grace of God, is beſtowed on all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006166_0005_1027FEAC6131B610"/>
Mankind without Exception, agreeable to the Aſſertion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul; The Grace of God, which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching us, that denying Ungodlineſs, and the World's Luſts, we ſhould live righteouſly, ſoberly and godly, in this preſent World.</hi> But tho' all Men have received this Talent of Grace, or Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Chriſt, all are not ſaved, as Men may rebel againſt, or quench the Spirit; and, by fruſtrating its Motions, render it ineffectual. Under the Law it is ſaid, <hi>The Almighty gave of his good Spirit to the</hi> Jews <hi>to inſtruct them, but they rebelled againſt it,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah ix. 20. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo tells us, <hi>They rebelled, and vexed God's Holy Spirit.</hi> And, under the Goſpel, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cautions the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> againſt <hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> or extinguiſhing the Light, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the conſuming Force, that would deſtroy Sin and Iniquity in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Thus, according to the Teſtimony I have offered, and many I might produce, all Men have received a Proportion of Light and Grace, but all have not obey'd its Leadings; all have heard, but all have not obey'd: However, this internal Monitor or Director, is ready on all Occaſions (if we will apply to it for Knowledge and Help) to inſtruct us in our Duty, and aſſiſt us in overcoming the Temptations of the great Adverſary of our Soul's Happineſs; but we muſt diligently attend to its Voice, and not only hear, but obey its Inſtructions, that our Souls may live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006166_0006_1027DA0331E3BE68"/>But ſome have ſaid to me, <hi>We grant that Chriſtians ought to walk agreeable to the Dictates of the Spirit of Chriſt; but the</hi> Quakers <hi>make the Guidance and Direction of the Spirit neceſſary in trivial and indifferent Matters; nay, ſometimes they offer its Dictates as a Reaſon for many Things accounted by us irrational and abſurd.</hi>—I anſwer; With Reference to our Duty and Obedience to the Almighty, I conſider no Action indifferent; every Thing of this Nature muſt tend to ſome Purpoſe, good or evil: And 'tis upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that we extend the Doctrine of the Croſs, Self-denial and perfect Obedience to the Precepts of Chriſt, farther then the Generality of thoſe who profeſs the Chriſtian Name: And I take this Occaſion to ſay, my principal Errand among you is to recommend, as far as I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, theſe Chriſtian Doctrines; ſince our Lord himſelf poſitively declares, <hi>That unleſs we take up a daily Croſs,</hi> (to our Corrupt Wills and Affections) <hi>we cannot be his Diſciples:</hi> And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to adviſe you to a ſtrict Adherence to the Light or Grace of God in your own Conſciences or Underſtandings, as unto <hi>a more ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> or perfect Director; <hi>whereunto you will do well to take Heed, as unto a light ſhining in a dark Place:</hi> For the Nations of them that are ſaved, muſt walk in this Light of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, "That many of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have anciently bore Teſtimony to thoſe Doctrines, and continue ſo to do; then what need of my feeble Teſtimony or Evidence?" 'Tis true that numerous Pens have been employed, and many earneſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006166_0007_1027DA23A00622A8"/>
and fervent Deſires of this People, to recommend and propagate (as far as they are enabled by divine Aſſiſtance) thoſe Chriſtian Doctrines, which they have proved by their own happy Experience to be ſo beneficial and advantageous to themſelves; and being thro' Grace made partakers of that Charity or Love, which is the Bond of Perfection, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtick of a genuine and real Chriſtian; theſe, I ſay, by this Goſpel-love, are excited to wiſh well to all Mankind, and, as much as in them lies, they endeavour to ſerve one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it, as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 13. And their frequent Supplications aſcend to the moſt High, on behalf of Mankind in general, that all People may come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as it is in JESUS, and be ſaved. And when our Hearts are thus enlarged, both to God, and one towards another, then are our Mouths opened to declare of his wonderful Works to the Children of Men, and ſhew forth his mighty Acts, which he is able and ready to perform, by the powerful Operation of his Holy Spirit in our Hearts, in ſubduing every evil and inordinate Deſire and Affection, and bringing them under his Government, and into Subjection to his divine Will; and by ſpeaking well of his great Name, to invite and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others to <hi>come taſte and ſee that the Lord is good,</hi> and to partake of his Offer of great Salvation, no leſs than the Redemption of the Soul (by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) from the Bondage of Sin and Satan. And indeed the Peace that flows from, and the Promiſes annexed, to a perfect
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006166_0008_1027DA26C1678EE0"/>
Obedience to the righteous Laws of God, are ſufficient Inducements to excite us to a godly, righteous, and Self-denying Life; for as the royal <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> greatly experienced formerly, ſo we at this Day experience, and ſubſcribe to this Truth, That in keeping the Commandments of God there is great Reward; and that great Peace have they who love his Law, and nothing ſhall offend them: <hi>For He ſpeaks Peace to his People, and to his Saints; but let them not turn again to Folly,</hi> Pſalm lxxxv. 8. <hi>And the Lord will ordain Peace for the Righteous, for the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Righteouſneſs is Peace and Aſſurance for ever,</hi> Iſaiah xxxii. 17. Agreeable to this our Lord tells his Diſciples, <hi>My Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you; not as the World giveth,</hi> but a Peace which paſſeth the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the carnal Man, And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to encourage and excite the <hi>Romans</hi> to the Obedience of the Faith deliver'd, and a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Continuance in Well-doing, tells them, Their Reward ſhould be, <hi>Glory, Honour, and Peace, to every Man that worketh Good, to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Gentile</hi>; Rom. ii. 10. But, on the contrary, that thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, and do not obey the Truth, but obey Unrighteouſneſs, Their Portion will be <hi>Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguiſh, upon every Soul of Man that doeth Evil</hi> as there is no Peace to the Wicked; for what have they to do with Peace, ſo long as they continue in Diſobedience? Indeed the Wicked may, as they often do, cry Peace to themſelves, when there is no Peace, or at leaſt not a ſolid One; as a real and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

Peace and Happineſs, can only reſult from an Acquaintance with God, and the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience: But a falſe and polluted Reſt and Peace, which many are erecting to themſelves, will deſtroy them with a ſore De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, without timely Repentance and Amendment of Life; <hi>for inſtead of this Peace, they ſhall have great Bitterneſs,</hi> Iſaiah xxxviii. 17.</p>
            <p>Many and ſingular are the Advantages and Priviledges which I might enumerate, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a Life of Piety and Holineſs, no leſs than an Hundred-fold of Peace in our Boſoms in this Life, and the great and precious Promiſe of Life Eternal in the World to come. And as I have, by the Grace of God, and thro' Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, witneſſed in Degree this Peace from God, (which is beyond the Conception or thoſe who have never enjoyed it) I became greatly concerned for Mankind in general, and in a particular Manner for the Inhabitants of my native Country, that they might witneſs this Peace; and I often petitioned the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he would in his wonted Mercy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to you the Things that belong to your Soul's Peace, before they might, by Unbelief, be hid from your Eyes. Having had this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for ſome Time on your Account, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was pleaſed to lay a Conſtraint upon me to declare it among you. This, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, I am ſenſible will ſound as idle and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Tales in the Ears of many; however, I ſhall go on to tell you, that I conſider myſelf as a very ſeeble Inſtrument in the Cauſe of God, and one of the leaſt Servants in my
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006166_0010_1027DA3F8FC907E8"/>
Maſter's Houſe. I have alſo conſider'd, how backward the Generality of People are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Advice, even when it has been offered by religious, pious and learned Men; and that the Labours of ſuch have had but little Effect on the Minds and Conduct of many called Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and reflecting on the greatneſs of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, as well as the Improbability of my being ſerviceable in God's Cauſe, I have been induced to ſay, <hi>Lord! who will believe my Report, ſince ſo many have labour'd (as I have thought) in vain? Shall I, a poor Female, undertake for God? Can I preſume to come up to his Help againſt the great Adverſary of Souls? No ſurely; rather, I beeſeech thee, appear in the Glory of thy Majeſty, and by the immediate Act of thy mighty Power, in the Hearts of the People, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and lay waſte the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan! And in the Room thereof eſtabliſh, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, the Kingdom and Dominion of thy dear Son, our Lord, whoſe Right alone it is to reign in the Hearts of the People, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords!</hi> And farther, tho' I am but Duſt and Aſhes, I thus preſumed to excuſe myſelf; <hi>Lord, I am not eloquent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heretofore, nor ſince thou haſt been pleaſed to diſcover thy Will to me.</hi> But to an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power, who doth according to his righteous Will, both in the Armies of Heaven, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Inhabitants of the Earth, who ſhall ſay, What doſt thou? And ſince he is pleaſed to ſend by the Hand of whom he will ſend, I no longer reſiſted his Will, but became obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his Word and Power, againſt which I
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006166_0011_1027DA61E3A5D2F0"/>
had long reaſoned, and objected my Unfitneſs; tho' the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, <hi>That as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as have been baptized into</hi> CHRIST (or with his Baptiſm of Fire and the Holy Ghoſt, and have witneſſed the chaffy Nature in them conſumed, and by this Means) <hi>have put on</hi> CHRIST (that then there is no Diſtinction or Difference among Chriſtians in a religious Senſe) <hi>there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male: For,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>ye are all one in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. Thus he ſeems to allow our Sex the ſame Goſpel Priviledges with the reſt of Mankind. And the royal Prophet calls on the female, as well as the male Part of God's rational Creation, to celebrate the Praiſe of our common Governor and Benefactor. "Why then, ſays one, ſhould Woman be denied her Canticle of Praiſe in the general Chorus, ſince out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings God will ſtill ordain and perfect Praiſe?" And we may further obſerve, when the Tabernacle of the Lord was erected in the Wilderneſs, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, we are told, who were willing hearted, brought their Free-will Offerings, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them towards the Building, or at leaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing of this moveable Temple, which, 'tis ſaid, was a Type of the true Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, and the Tabernacle which God has pitched, and not Man. And if Females were allowed to aſſiſt and contribute to the Work of the Lord, under the Law, why ſhould any, or the leaſt Eſſay towards the repairing the Breaches in God's Building, be rejected under
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006166_0012_1027DA650498A2C0"/>
the Goſpel; ſince we do not offer or propoſe any new Doctrine, nor endeavour to lay any other Foundation than that which is already laid, <hi>viz,</hi> "The Revelation of the Spirit of JESUS CHRIST the Righteous, in the Soul of Man, on which the Church of CHRIST is founded and built: Nor for the moral Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſo viſible among the Profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, do we preſcribe new or untry'd Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; but having experienced the Virtue and Efficacy of the old, we, in great Love and Good-will, endeavour to perſuade you to apply them: For the ſame Fountain of Purgation is now open to Sinners, that was in Ages paſt ſet open for the Houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for Sin and for Uncleanneſs; for the Almighty is not only the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But to proceed; I have told you that this Voyage to my native Place, was undertaken in Purſuance of what I verily believed was the Will of God concerning me, and required of me by him (I make no Doubt) as one amongſt the many Trials I have been exerciſed with, of my Faith, Love and Obedience; wherein I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it my Duty openly and freely to confeſs CHRIST before Men, whoſe operating Power on my Heart I had fearfully and cowardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conceal before I left this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and I take this Occaſion to declare to you, that I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of CHRIST, which I have in Meaſure expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced to be the Power of God to Salvation to all them who believe, and continue to obey
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006166_0013_1027DA669BFF1188"/>
it: And the more numerous the Teſtimonies, and greater the Cloud of Witneſſes, to the Efficacy of the Grace and Power of God, the more will the Truths and Evidences propoſed and produded, be ſtrengthened and corroborated. But ſome may poſſibly ask, 'How I certainly know that I am not miſtaken, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being led by the Spirit of Truth, I am not deceived by the Spirit of Error?" To ſuch I anſwer; I have one Rule to ſquare my Actions by, which never yet fail'd me, when I applied it; and that is, By Application to the Divine Being, that He would be pleaſed to preſerve me from Error and Deluſion, I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, by his Divine Light and Aſſiſtance, the Motive, Deſign, Tendency and End of my Actions; and if I find nothing repugnant to, or inconſiſtent with the Honour of God, and Scripture Precepts or Teſtimony, I make a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Concluſion, that I am ſafe at leaſt. And tho' I do not obſerve from Scripture, that it is my particular Duty to exhort you to yours; nor do I gather from thence, that I ought to declare, in this publick Manner, of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercy and Loving-kindneſs, of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to all who ſeek his Face and Favour in Truth, Sincerity and Uprightneſs; yet I find it there, my Duty to obey all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and that the Almighty may, and does, lay particular Injuctions, and ſpecial Commands, upon his Servants, by the Divine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Holy Spirit, at this Day, as well as in former Ages, I firmly believe: And that the Bleſſing our Lord promiſed to confer on
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006166_0014_1027DA6B68FAC4B8"/>
his immediate Followers, extends as well to all his ſucceeding Diſciples, <hi>viz.</hi> "That he would pray the Father, and he will (ſays he) ſend you another Comforter, that may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth, who will guide and lead you into all Truth, and ſhew you Things to come; for he that dwelleth with you, ſhall be in you; and this Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall teach you all Things and bring all Things to your Remembrance." And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> at that memorable Time, when he was preaching to People of various Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, tells his Audience, firſt quoting a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Prophet <hi>Joel,</hi> Acts ii. 38. <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in the laſt</hi> (or Goſpel) <hi>Days, that I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall prophecy,</hi> &amp;c. And he ſubjoins, <hi>Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the Name of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>for the Remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt: For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. And to you, O Men, he calls, his Voice is to the Sons of Men,</hi> Prov. viii. 4. And we may further obſerve, That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of CHRIST was not limited to his immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Diſciples, to whom it was to be ſent as a Comforter and Director; but he tells them, it ſhould appear to the World of Unbelievers in another Adminiſtration or Office, <hi>viz.</hi> That of a Reprover for Sin. <hi>For when CHRIST aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on high, he gave Gifts to Men, yea, even to the Rebellious,</hi> Eph. iv. 8. And the Gifts of the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006166_0015_1027DA70126D6C28"/>
Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Poole,</hi> in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> tells us, "Was not, as ſome imagine, confined to the Apoſtle's Days, but that Chriſtians, in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, received as large Proportions of the Divine Influences and Gifts of the Holy Spirit as formerly." And that Females did receive theſe Gifts, as well as the Men, and on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Occaſions did exerciſe them, <hi>John Locke,</hi> in his <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> on <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, aſſures us, by Proof. He tells us, "That God, for Order ſake, had inſtituted in the World a proper Subordination of the weaker Sex to the ſtronger; yet (ſays he) this hindered not but that he might make uſe of the weaker Sex to any Function, whenever he thought fit, as well as he did the Men." He ſays much more to the ſame Purpoſe; but I leave him to thoſe who may have an Opportunity and Inclination to read him further on this Subject<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke, on a Corinthians 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </note>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to illuſtrate, as well as I am able, the Rule of my Conduct in religious Matters. I am ſenſible that it is my Duty, firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, and above all other Conſiderations, to love, adore, honour and obey, the Supreme Being; and next, I find it my Duty to love my Neighbour as myſelf; and to obſerve to act in the ſame juſt and upright Manner in every Circumſtance, that I deſire he ſhould act in towards myſelf: Therefore, if, upon a Scrutiny, or Examination, I find my Deſign or Action directly or indirectly tending to the Diſhonour of God, or in any Shape injurious to my Neighbour, I am immediately inſtructed,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006166_0016_1027DA719C40FC88"/>
by the inward Monitor, or Light of CHRIST in my Conſcience, to decline it; and if I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the Action, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I believe you will grant I am right ſo far. Again, if I apprehend I am directed or commanded to do any particular Thing; if, upon Trial, by the above Rule, it bears the Teſt, and has any Tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote God's Honour, Peace, Good-will, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Benevolence to my Neighbour, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I am ſafe, and may venture to conclude that this Suggeſtion can proceed from no other than God; ſince it points to ſome ſmall Degree of Glory to his Name and Power. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, any Deed that can ſtand this Trial, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly have it's Riſe, or be excited by a diabolical Spirit; ſince we have our Lord's Teſtimony to the Truth of this Aſſertion, <hi>That if Satan riſe up againſt himſelf, and be divided, he cannot ſtand, but hath an End,</hi> Mark iii. 26. But whatever Judgment may be made of my religious Sentiments and Conduct, it will be far from affecting me; my Peace and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in no wiſe depending on the Favour or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of Mortals, but on the Favour and Approbation of God, by whoſe juſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Judgment I muſt ſtand or fall; for <hi>God ſeeth not as Man ſeeth,</hi> Man judging by the outward Appearance only; but the Lord looketh at the Heart. And tho' we are told, <hi>The Heart is deceitful above all Things</hi>; and the Prophet queries, <hi>Who can know it?</hi> The Almighty is pleaſed to declare in theſe Words, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart, and try the Reins; and behold he that formeth the Mountains, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006166_0017_1027DA74EF0B6178"/>
createth the Spirit, he declareth unto Man what his Thoughts are: Even he that maketh the Morning Darkneſs, and treadeth upon the high Places of the Earth, the Lord, the God of Hoſts is his Name,</hi> Amos iv. 13.</p>
            <p>Further, I have thought you may poſſibly imagine, that in Pride and Arrogancy of Heart I am come to ſee, how you fare, with regard to your eternal Salvation: But, give me Leave to aſſure you, my Viſit proceeds from no ſuch evil Motive; neither have I any further Views than the Peace and Satisfaction that flows from a Conſciouſneſs of having done my Duty, in coming to proclaim the glad Tidings of Peace and Salvation among you, to all who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it on God's Terms, <hi>viz. Repentance and Amendment of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have no particular Perſon in View, nor Deſign to offend any One living; and if at any time I ſhould expreſs myſelf a little warmly, my Zeal is aim'd againſt Sin, and the Irregularity of People's Lives in general; your Temporal, as well eternal Intereſt, I wiſh as well to, as I do to my own. I do not undertake to addreſs you in pompous Words, nor, where it in my Power, to pleaſe your Ear with fine Periods. The Laws of Method I know little of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I don't attempt any Rule of that Sort; neither do I preſume to offer any Thing new on the Subject of Religion; but if one Line of my own ſhort Experience in the Things of God, may have the leaſt Tendency to excite ſome to the practical Part of Chriſtianity, or to mend the Heart of any One, I have my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006166_0018_1027DA79A02C30D8"/>
my honeſt Aim, as far as my weak En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour will allow, being the Promotion of God's Honour, and the Wellfare of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and, to borrow the Words of one of our Worthies, <hi>I have no Plot or Deſign, but an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Wiſh for the Salvation of your Souls:</hi> And, if I may be allowed to uſe the Words of the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> I will further aſſure you, <hi>I covet no Perſon</hi>'s <hi>Silver, Gold or Apparel.</hi> On the contrary, having ſeen and lamented the divers and hurtful Luſts I was obnoxious to, when I was in Poſſeſſion of a plentiful Eſtate, and that they that are rich fall into many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; my Buſineſs is to warn and caution you that are rich, againſt the Miſapplication of your Wealth. Riches, attain'd lawfully, without Covetouſneſs, and too anxious a Deſire and Purſuit (which may obſtruct our godly Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) I grant, are one of the Bleſſings of Heaven, if rightly and properly applied; as they put us in a Capacity of providing a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Subſiſtence for our Families, and doing Acts of Juſtice and Mercy to our Neighbour: But then we muſt remember we are only Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of this, as well as every other Gift of God; and that we are as culpable in his Sight, and as accountable to his Juſtice, for the Waſte and Abuſe of Wealth, as for the ill Uſe of any other of his Favours and Mercies.</p>
            <p>Some plead for Extravagance, Vanity and Luxury, in the abſurd Terms of an old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, that thoſe <hi>who win Gold, have a Right to wear it</hi>; and that they may apply their own Money to what Purpoſes they pleaſe: Not
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006166_0019_1027DA7CD1F83458"/>
conſidering, that all temporal Bleſſings are only lent us, and that we can't properly call any Thing our own. And if we will but look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, we ſhall ſee this Aſſertion greatly proved, by obſerving the many Viciſſitudes in this one Article of Wealth. Riches, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically ſpeaking, take to themſelves Wings, and fly away from one to another, and that we are as often ſnatched from them, as they from us; a ſignificant Inſtance of which we have in our Saviour's Parable of the rich Man, who, having laid up much Goods for many Years, ſottiſhly addreſſes his Soul in theſe Words, <hi>Soul, take thine Eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry,</hi> Luke xii. 19. Thus being in this ſtupid Condition, blinded by the God of this World, he never once reflects on the Poſſibility of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Idols by any Means whatſoever. But now obſerve the Equity and Juſtice of the Almighty in his Judgments, which he often inflicts on thoſe who adore the Gift, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and neglect the Giver; who receive of his Bounty, but fail to acknowledge it; who eat and drink, and riſe up to play: By one Stroke of his Juſtice he breaks the Inchantment this Man had been held in by Satan; diſcovers the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of temporal Goods and Enjoyments, and the Vanity or Folly of truſting and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Happineſs in them; and, by the Word of his Power, he commands this poor, deluded Mortal to reſign, not only his Wealth, but his very Soul, to him that gave it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in theſe Terms, <hi>Thou Fool, this Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee; then whoſe ſhall theſe Things be which thou haſt provided?</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006166_0020_1027DA7E5C3BB8E0"/>
Melancholly Situation indeed! and far worſe than if his Goods had been taken from him. This Man, as far as we may be allowed to judge by his Folly in this Inſtance, muſt be in a very unfit State and Condition for Heaven, where it does not appear he had been careful to lay up any Treaſure, <hi>For where the Treaſure is, there will the Heart be alſo.</hi> And in our Lord's Obſervations on this unhappy Perſon's Condition, he ſubjoins, <hi>So</hi> (or in ſuch a Caſe) <hi>is he that layeth up Treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' I, as well as others, had received a Proportion or Talent of Grace in my Heart, for the great Purpoſes before named, yet I was not careful to improve it; and while I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in neglect of my Duty, ſo long this Grace proved ineffectual, and in vain: But <hi>the Gifts and Callings of God are without Repentance,</hi> Rom. ii. 29. for tho' many may neglect to anſwer his Call, or improve his Gifts, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Almighty repents not that he hath diſpenſed and beſtow'd them; but graciouſly condeſcends, by his frequent Viſitations, either immediately, or inſtrumentally, by Mercies, or by Judgments, to awaken, perſwade, excite or allure us to our Duty; and tho' in Time paſt we believed not God, who in Effect we are ſaid to deny, when we worſhip him not as God; yet he repents not that he hath called us, but repeats his Call to the Careleſs and Negligent; of which Number I was, when the Almighty, whoſe Compaſſion fails not, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to viſit my Soul. In this, the happieſt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006166_0021_1027DA81C7C190B0"/>
Seaſon of my Life, when the Time was come, wherein, thro' Mercy I obtained Mercy; and in which the Moſt High vouchſafed to favour me, by opening my Eyes, and diſcovering to me the Things that belonged to the everlaſting Peace and Happineſs of my Soul. And at the ſame time the Lord was pleaſed to diſplay his excellent Glory, and to give me a Sight of the Beauty of Holineſs; and then I could ſay, <hi>I have heretofore only heard of Thee by the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the outward Ear.</hi> But now mine Eye ſaw his glory: This amazing tho' lovely Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God to my Soul, cauſed me many a time to bow down before the Majeſty of Heaven, and, indeed to abhor myſelf in Duſt and Aſhes, and frequently to mourn over him whom I had many time pierced and griev'd in his Holy Spirit, by my Vanities and Folly, in giving his Glory to Idols, and the Praiſe that was his Due, to the Imaginations of my own Heart. This was the firſt Day's Work of the new Creation in my Soul; the Almighty, by the Word of his Power, had commanded the Darkneſs to be divided from the Light, and, by this happy Medium, I continued to make new, and, to me, unuſual Diſcoveries; I ſaw that I had been an Alien from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>ſpiritual Iſrael,</hi> and a Stranger to the Covenant of Promiſe, having no Hope in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I had lived without God in the World; and, by neglecting to give that Honour due to his Name, I had forfeited the Favour of the Almighty, and that heavenly Paradiſe, which the Smiles of his Countenance and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

But alas! this Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration never ſo much as occurr'd, when I was ſpending my Days in Vanity, and my Years in unprofitable Purſuits; forgetting the holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Days without Number; never ſo much as remarking the royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Aſſertion, That (not only the flagrantly wicked) but <hi>thoſe who forget God, ſhall be turn'd into Hell.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> tells us, <hi>God will pour out of his Anger upon the Families that call not upon his Name,</hi> Jer. x. 25.

of God, yet they cannot be chargeable with worſhipping of Idols, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; ſo that the above Scripture Paſſages cannot be altogether applicable to them. I ſhall anſwer this Objection in the Words of one of the firſt Movers of the Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>John Staupitz: He that prefers any Thing that is outward and temporal before God, prefers the Creature before the Creator; and robs God of his Glory and higheſt Honour, and makes that to be his God, which is not God: For that which the Heart loves moſt, the ſame it honours as God, whatſoever the Mouth may ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Who knows not, that if a Chriſtian ſhould now-a-days ſay, that his Goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were his God, he would be condemned as a Blaſphemer; and yet who is there of us, who doth not ſee, in the daily Practice and Actions of Men, that temporal Goods, Pleaſure and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are preferred before God, and his Love, to that Degree, that it is Matter of Lamentation? We will by no Means endure the Reproach of being Idolaters, tho' indeed we are ſo, really and in Truth, no leſs than others were of old, At this very Day, O gracious God! many in Chriſtendom worſhip Gold, Silver, Wood, and the Goods of this World, as the Heathen did Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Years ago, notwithſtanding they ſay with their Mouths,</hi> Our Father, which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <hi>But true Adoration conſiſts in loving, not in ſpeaking. He prays well, who loves God moſt; and he who does not love God, neither does nor can pray, tho' he repeat a thouſand Pſalms or Prayers: He who loves God, ſerves
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006166_0026_1027FD258D7BACE8"/>
him; but he who does not love him, neither doth, nor can ſerve him, however great Works of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he may outwardly perform.</hi> But to return; In this careleſs and forgetful Situation, which I have mentioned, was I when the Almighty diſpenſed a Share of his temporal Favours to me, which I received with a ſtupid Indifference, and without Thankſgiving, as they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mercies; "And like a certain Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, who devours the Fruit which falls from a Tree, without looking up to ſee from whence it comes:" So I received the Bleſſings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence no otherwiſe, but as Things of Chance, or of Courſe, or the Effect of Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; not conſidering whoſe Hand was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render our Endeavours ſucceſsful and proſperous; nor that the ſame Power that beſtows and diſpenſes Bleſſings and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, can in a Moment remand and call them back, and deprive us of them, whenever he pleaſes; and that for every Morſel we eat, we are indebted to God's Bounty and Goodneſs, and not to our own Wiſdom or Prudence: In a Word, that in Him we live, move, and have our Being. But how inſenſible was I of theſe Truths, when, in Effect, I lived as if I had been an unaccountable and independent Being, and vainly thought my Mountain was made ſo ſtrong, that it would never be removed. I was rich and full, and needed nothing, when alas! I was poor and miſerable, blind and naked, and wanted all Things, when deſtitute of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and without witneſſing the Smiles of his Countenance. Thus, as the Pſalmiſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006166_0027_1027FD2846BCD2B0"/>
confeſſes himſelf once, ſo fooliſh and ignorant was I, ſaying, in Effect, to God, "Depart from me, for I deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways, what is the Almighty that I ſhould deſire him? Or what greater Profit would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue, if we pray'd unto Him, or ſerved Him?" By this falſe Reaſoning is the Candle of the Ungodly extinguiſhed; from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Deſtruction upon the Inconſiderate and Unrighteous, unleſs they return, repent and amend. But now behold the Goodneſs, Lenity and Long-ſuffering, of a merciful God! who had been long alluring me by his Mercies, which I paſſed light by, or rejected; he has now Recourſe to his Judgments; but neither did I yet ſee that Afflictions aroſe not out of the Duſt, but that Mankind were naturally and promiſcuouſly born to Trouble. I was indeed afflicted, and I mourn'd; but it was for the Abſence of temporal Bleſſings; and as my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Purſuits extended no higher, I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupport my Diſtreſs, by gratifying my Pride and Ambition to the Extent of my Power. At length, in this Day of Adverſity, I began a little to conſider, and applied to God, in Prayer and Supplication, that he would be pleaſed to deliver me out of my Diſtreſs, or ſupport me under it; ſtill ignorant of the Joys of his Salvation, or that there was ſpiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in ſtore for me on certain Conditions, if I rightly applied for them; but being inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Want of them, I as yet asked them not, till the happy Seaſon of my Life, wherein I witneſſed a religious Turn of Mind, and the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006166_0028_1027FD29CE2E43A8"/>
drawing Cords of God's Love inclining my Heart to ſeek his Face and Favour, with greater Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Fervour than I had ever been ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of before: I now began to view and conſider Things in another Light than I formerly had done; and, by reverſing the Perſpective, the fading Objects and Enjoyments of this Life leſſen'd in my View and Account; and as the Love of God and of heavenly Things increaſed in my Heart, ſo in Proportion my Fondneſs for worldly Enjoyments decreaſed and vaniſhed. At length the warmeſt Returns of Love and Gratitude began to ariſe in my Soul to God, who firſt loved me, and had done great Things for me, by plucking my Feet out of the Mire and Clay of Sin and Folly, and fixing them upon the Rock CHRIST JESUS. He alſo put a new Song in my Mouth, which none but thoſe who are in Degree redeem'd by his precious Blood can ſing, even Praiſes to our God! Thus on my turning to God, I began to witneſs new Thoughts, new Deſires, new Affections, new Hopes, new Joys, and new Fears; and to ſee the Neceſſity of Regeneration and a new Birth unto Righteouſneſs, without which I could not poſſibly enter the Kingdom of God; that all Things muſt be changed, and become new, all of, and pointing to God. And farther, if I would be CHRIST's Diſciple, I muſt deny my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, take up a Croſs to my own Will, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to, and follow him, under whoſe Banner I had now liſted; thus examining and purſuing this Doctrine and Precept of our Lord's, I was naturally led, in ſome Degree, to what is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006166_0029_1027FD2CED2269B0"/>
               <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> (tho' it appear'd to me in no other Form nor Name, than that of primitive Chriſtianity) which, in my firſt Thoughts of Religion, I had no more Intention of embracing than I had of receiving <hi>Mahometiſm</hi>; knowing little more of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> than that They were a plain People in their Garb and Speech. But it has been remarked to me, that my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſome Time of this Perſuaſion, and no Wonder that I ſhould have a warm Side for her Opinion. I anſwer'd, My Father was a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated me in that Way; and I well remember, I had a much warmer Side for his Opinion; not that I knew what was the eſſential Difference in their religious Sentiments, or at leaſt that affected me, any farther than that one allow'd me ſomething more Liberty in Dreſs; whereas the other would tell me Plainneſs in Apparel was moſt agreeable to Chriſtianity, and to the Divine Being, who hated Pride in his Creatures. To be ſure I thought this Doctrine abſurd, by the Reflection I remember I made at the Time, <hi>That God, I believed, would not reject me, on the Score of wearing Lace, or a fine and gay Silk Gown.</hi> I have thought ſince, any one might imagine I had fetch'd my Argument from <hi>Lucretian</hi> Principles, that the Almighty could not deſcend ſo low as to notice ſuch Trifles, or mark little Follies, if Gaiety in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel ſhould be One; but no Wonder that when I was a Child, I ſhould reaſon as a Child. I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that Silks, Ribbons and Lace, are not any where in Scripture directly forbidden; but I
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006166_0030_1027FD30E87B9A08"/>
learn from thence, that Pride, and all Manner of Superfluity, is. And if, by wearing this rich Silk, or adorning ourſelves with the other ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Ornaments, we feed and nouriſh a proud, vain Deſire, it becomes by this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as unlawful as Pride itſelf; and that they do ſo, I have greatly experienced: <hi>For tho' Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſtands not ſimply in Clothes, yet true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſtands in that which ſets Bounds and Limits to the Mind with reſpect to Clothes, as well as other Things.</hi> And to ſtrengthen this Aſſertion, or rather to prove it, I ſhall offer an Inſtance of my own Experience, <hi>viz. When it pleaſed the Lord to viſit my Soul, and to appear to me in his Glory, the View of which diſcover'd to me my own Unworthineſs, and cauſed me not, only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and abhor myſelf, but my ſplendid Apparel alſo: I had now no Delight in Dreſs and Ornament, nor other Things I had uſually taken much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in: True Chriſtianity, which I began to be acquainted with, ſet a Bound to my Deſires, and directed me to Plainneſs, before I had any Intention of joining the Society of the People called</hi> Quakers; <hi>and indeed all earthly and tranſitory Objects were, and are, in my View and Eſtimation, as Loſs, Droſs and Dung, in Compariſon of the Excellency, Glory and Beauty, I behold in God, and find in the Enjoyment of his Divine Favour; and at times I am ready to cry out,</hi> O! how great is his Glory, and tranſcendently great his Beauty!</p>
            <p>But to return: When I was (by Marriage) remov'd from my Mother's Care and Direction, I continued in my Father's Profeſſion of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for no other Reaſon that I remember, but
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:006166_0031_1027FD326EF9FC58"/>
that it allow'd me moſt Liberty in Dreſs and Recreations, tho' my Father, as well as my Mother, did not fail to inculcate a juſt Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Evils the moral Law condemns. However, when I conſider'd and examined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Matters with more Seriouſneſs, Sincerity and Attention, than was uſual with me, I found the little Religion (or rather the Profeſſion of it) that I had, was that of my Education, which I could not properly call my own, as it was not the Religion of my Judgment, which I find abſolutely neceſſary, and highly reaſonable to be concerned for. I read the Scriptures with ſome Attention; and I have conſider'd the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Text, that <hi>unleſs we deny ourſelves, and take up a daily Croſs, we cannot be CHRIST's Diſciples.</hi> This Paſſage appear'd to me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome other and further Conſtruction and Deſign than many People allow, who confine it to moral Precepts and Duties. But before I proceed to ſay in what Senſe others, as well as myſelf, underſtand this Chriſtian Doctrine, I think it may not be impertinent briefly to give ſome Reaſon of my Faith and Hope, which I deſire to do in the ſame Diſpoſition the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle recommends, <hi>viz. In Meekneſs and Fear.</hi> And firſt, upon examining the Creed call'd <hi>The Apoſtles,</hi> I could ſubſcribe to every Article therein contain'd, except one, (<hi>Chriſt deſcended into Hell</hi>) which, if it be meant no other than the Grave, I ſubſcribe to that alſo. Next, I have conſidered and examined <hi>The Articles of the Church of England</hi> (of which I had profeſſed myſelf a Member ſome Years, without ſo much
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:006166_0032_1027FD35579FDA00"/>
as knowing what Doctrines or Principles they profeſſed and held; this, I may venture to ſay, without Breach of Charity, is the Caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Profeſſors at this Day) But upon peruſing the above Articles (as well as conſidering the Opinion of moſt diſſenting Sects) I could not reconcile ſome Opinions therein contained with Scripture Doctrine and Teſtimonies; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Paragraph in the fifteenth Article, where it is ſaid, "Tho' we are all baptized and born again in CHRIST, yet we offend in many Things." This Opinion appears to me mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly repugnant to Scripture Accounts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who attain'd in this Life a perfect Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Sin. And the Text farther quoted by that Church will not import the Apoſtle himſelf to be included in it, 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 8. And I am of Opinion, we may ſafely interpret the Paſſage by ſome other Scripture Text; wherein the Apoſtles include themſelves with Sinners, yet by no Means can be underſtood, that they themſelves were in the like Circumſtances. And now I ſhall offer the following Scripture Teſtimonies, which appear to corroborate, and greatly to juſtify us, with regard to a Tenet we particularly hold, <hi>viz. The Poſſibility</hi> (God's Grace aſſiſting) <hi>of obtaining a perfect Freedom</hi>

applicable to the Condition of others, to whom he ſometimes ſpeaks, in a feeling Senſe, of the different States of the Godly and the Wicked. I have alſo conſider'd it irrational to limit and preſcribe to a Chriſtian, even the weakeſt, a ſet Form of Prayer, ſince the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declar'd, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groanings, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be utter'd,</hi> Rom viii. 26.</p>
            <p>I remember, when I experienced the Work of God's Grace operating on my Soul, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to me my State and Condition, the common Prayer became of no Service to me, as I found it highly neceſſary that my Heart ſhould be prepared by the Lord to enable me to addreſs him by his own Spirit; and when he is pleaſed to touch and incline the Heart to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, behold (as it is ſaid on a memorable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) <hi>we pray</hi>; We are immediately taught to pray in Terms ſuggeſted by the Holy Spirit, who beſt knows our Neceſſities, helps our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and cauſes us ſuitably to approach the Throne of Grace, and to requeſt and pray with the Spirit, and with the Underſtanding. And as we are not to pray in our own Words, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we pray acceptably in our own Time; as I have witneſſed on a very particular Occaſion, when I profeſſed myſelf a Member of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Being return'd from a Voyage, I, according to Cuſtom, ſent Notice, that I ſhould publickly give God Thanks for my Preſervation at Sea; thus when the ſtated Prayer of Thankſgiving was read, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

on my Knees, but my Heart was not properly warm'd, nor influenc'd to addreſs the Almighty, at the Time the Congregation was told, I was giving God humble and hearty Thanks for ſuch a Mercy; I repeated the Form indeed, but it was only with my Lips, my Heart had little Share in this formal Devotion; and reflecting, while on my Knees, that I was wrong, conſequently the Sacrifice of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving I had offer'd in ſo unacceptable a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, muſt be an Offence to God. The above Reflection, I am not aſham'd to ſay, cauſed me to tremble at the very Inſtant. Thus I find, that waiting to be ſuitably influenced by the Spirit, ought to be previous to this ſolemn Act of Worſhip. But farther, as I have above no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I find no Place in the Church of CHRIST for Ceremonies, as they appear to be a very great Obſtacle in the Way of ſpiritual Worſhip; <hi>for bodily Exerciſe profiteth little</hi>; 'tis the Spirit of CHRIST muſt quicken us for ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And tho' God wink'd at Times of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Blindneſs, when Men vainly imagin'd that Worſhip was moſt acceptably perform'd to him at this Place, or the other Mountain; in this, or the other Ceremony; yet CHRIST the Light, who came, and is come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel all the dark Clouds of Ignorance and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and to direct Men to himſelf the Way, the Light, and the Truth, on a remarkable Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion explodes Mens Opinions in this important Matter, by ſaying, that it <hi>was neither at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>nor yet at the Mountain</hi> (of Samaria) <hi>the Father was to be worſhipped; but the Hour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:006166_0039_1027FD4E2911FA20"/>
and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth: For the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spirit, and thoſe who worſhip him</hi> (acceptably) <hi>muſt worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> not in Formality and Ceremonies. The Author of the Preface to the Common Prayer tells us, <hi>The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies retain'd in the Church</hi> (of England) <hi>were deviſed and inſtituted by Man, and ſome that are thrown out, enter'd at firſt with a Zeal without Knowledge, and grew daily to more and more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes; which not only for Unprofitableneſs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have much blinded the People, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the Glory of God, are rejected. Others,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tho' deviſed by Man, are retain'd for Order and Edification:</hi> And at the ſame Time tells us, that CHRIST's <hi>Goſpel is not a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law; but it is a Religion to ſerve God, not in the Bondage of the Figure and Shadow, but in the Freedom of the Spirit.</hi> To this laſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I heartily agree; then why ſhould we return to the weak and beggarly Elements, or deſire again to be in Bondage? <hi>You obſerve,</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) Days and Months, and Times and Years; I am afraid of you, leſt I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon you Labour in vain: But as ye have received</hi> CHRIST JESUS <hi>the Lord, ſo walk in him, aad beware leaſt any Man ſpoil you thro' Philoſophy, and vain Deceit, after the Traditions of Men, after the Rudiments of the World, and not after CHRIST.

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:006166_0042_1027FD5469F1A7D8"/>I would now obſerve to you who indulge yourſelves in the falſe Pleaſures, vain Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Recreations, of the Age, which once I had a Fondneſs for, as well as you now have; that when the Almighty was pleaſed in his Mercy to open the Eyes of my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I plainly perceived by that Light (he had placed in my Conſcience, which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to diſcern between Right and Wrong, the Precious and the Vile) that a Life of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Diverſion was inconſiſtent with the Life of a Chriſtian: I found, that to be thus carnally minded, has been Death to my Soul; but as I gradually witneſſed CHRIST, and the Power of his Reſurrection raiſing me from the Death of theſe Sins, I felt a Neceſſity of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with, and denying myſelf of them; and I conſider'd them to be of the greateſt Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in a religious Progreſs. But it has been objected, that Recreations are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to unbend and relax the Mind, when it has been occupy'd or employ'd in worldly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, or in the more ſerious Attention on divine Objects, to which it is not poſſible it can be attending always. I grant, that our Lord's enjoining his Followers, to <hi>watch and pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhorting the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to <hi>pray without ceaſing,</hi> does not, in a ſtrict and literal Senſe, oblige us to be always on our Knees, nor occupy'd in mental Prayer; for tho' we ought to be led and guided by the Spirit of CHRIST in all our Actions, or, at leaſt, that all we do by Permiſſion, as well as by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Direction, may be approved in his

Sight; yet we are not at all Times under an Influence neceſſary for addreſſing the Throne of Grace, in the ſolemn Act of Prayer: <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we ſhould always be ſo far in a Spirit of Prayer and Watchfulneſs, as we ought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a Chriſtian and virtuous Temper of Mind</hi>; which is indeed truly and effectually worſhipping the Divine Being, when we do not confine our Service to ſet Days, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hours of Devotion, but to a conſtant, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and uniform Life of Virtue, Piety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Some are apt to think all is well, and they have done their Duty to God, when they neglect not cuſtomary times of formal Prayer, or Devotion (as it is falſely called) or their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions don't interfere with this Formality, which by ſome is punctually perform'd. This brings to my Remembrance the abſurd as well as impious Character a certain Author gives of a Woman of this prepoſterous Compoſition of Diverſion and Devotion, or, in his own Words, of Religion and Cards; he repreſents her, in ſome Interval of her Game, juſt recollecting it was her Hour of Devotion or Prayer, upon which ſhe riſes in great Precipitation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires her Neighbour to hold her Cards till ſhe ſteps and ſays her Prayers. To mention this Character, is ſufficient to ſhew the Abſurdity of it. Again, the Deſcription another Writer gives of a Woman at her Gaming-Table, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, one would imagine, to make the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Forehead bluſh: And to ſay no more, than that it renders her unaimable in the Eyes of reaſonable People, one would judge, this would
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006166_0044_1027FD5DA6DCE9E0"/>
be a great Reaſon for her to decline the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but when ſhe is repreſented accuſing her ill Fortune, as ſhe calls it, in Terms of Fury and Abſurdity, the Portrait is horrid and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unbecoming a rational Mind, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy any Perſon who profeſſes Chriſtianity. Compare this Character with humble <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſitting at her Lord's Feet, waiting to hear the gracious Words that proceeded out of his Mouth—compare it with the Apoſtle's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Woman profeſſing Godlineſs, whoſe Mind is adorn'd with <hi>Meekneſs, Quietneſs and Modeſty</hi>; and ſee if you can diſcover one ſimilar Line in the Characters. Again, deſcribe a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dancing at a Ball, and adorn'd with all the Luxury and Pomp of Dreſs, tending, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Opinion of a pious Writer, to excite a Paſſion I forbear to name; and Country Dances, ſome of 'em, you know, are condemn'd by a Writer much admir'd by the polite and faſhionable Part of the World, who peruſe him, I have thought, to very little Purpoſe: Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, I ſay, the Characters I have mentioned, and ſee if you can obſerve the leaſt Trace of Chriſtianity in them: In ſhort, a dancing, gaming, maſquerading Chriſtian, appears as great a Contradiction, and ſounds as harſh and uncouth in one's Ears, as a polluted Chriſtian; which I have heard a learn'd Perſon ſay, was no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency; however, he fail'd in his Proof, ſince I can as ſoon reconcile Light and Darkneſs, CHRIST and Belial, as that a Perſon can be both a Sinner and a Saint, at the ſame Moment of Time. But, further, tho' ſome Recreations,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006166_0045_1027FD5F8709E528"/>
properly choſen and adapted, may be lawful to a Chriſtian; yet I have found thoſe the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People allow themſelves in, are perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and hurtful, in their Conſequences, and therefore unlawful to, and inconſiſtent with the Life of a Chriſtian. Upon peruſing the Scripture, I find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God:</hi> From whence I alſo learn, that I ought not to do any Thing that would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or hinder, or may be in Oppoſition to God's Honour. And tho' I don't find any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Prohibition of Cards, Plays, Balls, Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, Maſquerades, Muſick-gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet I obſerve they are indirectly forbid, as they have not the leaſt Tendency to promote God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but, on the contrary, if you'll take my own Experience for Evidence, tend to hinder and prevent any Taſte or Reliſh for divine or ſpiritual Enjoyments; the Soul given up to ſenſual Pleaſure, lies ſordidly groveling on Earth, when 'tis deſing'd to contemplate and enjoy more rational, as well as ſublime and heavenly Delights. We are told by an Author (pretty generally read) who diſcourſing, in ſome of his Writings, on the Deſign of the Almighty in placing Mortals here on Earth, <hi>We were,</hi> ſays he, <hi>left here for a Time, to be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated for Heaven.</hi> But when we look about, and obſerve what Methods for this Education are purſued, we can't well help concluding, the Generality of People have very unnatural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate and groſs Ideas, of that glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:006166_0046_1027FD6249D2B5A0"/>
and that, if they reflect at all, they muſt conſider it no other than a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Paradiſe; as the Plan of Education now-a-days, ſeems de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and calculated, to qualify for a Place where the Senſes are only to be gratified and entertained: And indeed I am induced to think the Apoſtle's Doctrine quite revers'd by thoſe called Chriſtians, who, many of them, appear to live by Sight, and not by Faith. That Chriſtians ought not to indulge themſelves in the uſual Pleaſures, Diverſions, and vain Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, of the World, ſeems evident from the ſacred Writings; as theſe Amuſements appear to be diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit, Temper and Rules of Chriſtianity; that Syſtem being abſolutely of another Nature and Tendency, calculated to ſubdue and regulate the Paſſions and Affections of the Mind, by calling us to a Life of Self-denial, and inſtructing us to walk in the Steps of an humble, lowly and crucified, Saviour; for whoever will be CHRIST's Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt <hi>crucify the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts</hi>; and I think the following Paſſages of Scripture greatly evince, that a Life of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is inconſiſtent with the Life of Chriſtianity; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>thoſe who live in Pleaſure, are dead while they live:</hi> Dead to God and ſpiritual Enjoyments. Chriſtians are by the ſame Apoſtle exhorted to <hi>redeem the Time, becauſe the Days are Evil</hi>; which I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to the faſhionable Phraſe uſed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſtians; <hi>How ſhall we kill Time?

the greateſt Part of our precious Time in Mirth, Wantonneſs, Gaming, Dancing, <hi>&amp;c. Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe your Adverſary, the Devil, is walking about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour; whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the Faith:</hi> I have conſider'd this Paſſage alſo, and find it contrary to the Practice of modern Chriſtians; who, inſtead of reſiſting the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, blindly ſeek and run into them, by their frequent Attendance on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and wanton Plays, vain Muſick-gardens, and wicked Maſquerades, Opera's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Reaſon why Chriſtians are to be found in a watchful Poſture, is here given; <hi>Becauſe our Adverſary the Devil, is ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>; we are exhorted to take Heed how we ſtand, leſt we fall; to <hi>watch and pray, leſt</hi> we <hi>enter into Temptation</hi>; therefore a Life of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs and Riot, Eaſe and Security, cannot be agreeable to that Circumſpection and Diligence requiſite in every Chriſtian, in order to <hi>make his Calling and Election ſure.</hi> And I have tho't a Life of Diverſion and Pleaſure, is very unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Sinners, who may be guilty of immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts, and, perhaps, have lived long in open Violation of God's Laws: Surely it is high Time for ſuch as theſe to awake out of Sleep, out of the Lethargy and Death of Sin; for the Lord, by the Mouth of his Prophet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a Woe againſt ſuch as are at Eaſe in their Sins; and calls upon them to reform, in theſe Words; <hi>Cleanſe your Hands, ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts, ye double-minded, be afflicted for your Sin, mourn and weep: Go to,

you rich Men, weep and howl for your Miſeries that ſhall come upon you; for you have lived in Pleaſure on the Earth, and been wanton; ye have nouriſhed your Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter,</hi> &amp;c. And our Lord pronounces a Woe againſt them that <hi>laugh now, for they ſhall weep and mourn; but bleſſed are ye that weep now, for ye ſhall rejoice hereafter. Weep for yourſelves, and for your Children,</hi> was the Advice of CHRIST to the Daughters of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>; and very neceſſary for us at this Day, that our Mirth ſhould be turned into Mourning, and the evil Rejoicing of many into Heavineſs. Theſe, and ſuch like Sentences of the ſacred Records, appear to me to be irreconcilable with the common Study and Practice of leaving To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Mirth, Luxury and Wantonneſs, in every Place, ſaying, <hi>To morrow ſhall be as this Day, and much more abundant</hi>; whereas we know not what ſhall be on the Morrow: For what is your Life! It is even as a Vapour, that appeareth for a little Time, and then vaniſhes away. <hi>The Wicked,</hi> ſays holy <hi>Job, ſpend their Days in Mirth, and, in a Moment, go down to the Grave.</hi> But ſome object, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeems to allow us Times and Seaſons for Recreations and Divertiſements, you conſider as unlawful Pleaſures, <hi>viz. A Time to ſing, and a Time to dance,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! what is called an Allowance, appears to me to amount to no more, than that in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Days, as well as in all former Ages of the World, there was Times in which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did thoſe Things he enumerates, and which he obſerves, only adds Vanity to all human

Actions and Inventions; but he does not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether they were lawful or otherwiſe: He tells us alſo, of a Time to laugh, or rejoice; our Lord, as above, pronounces a Woe againſt thoſe that laugh now [<hi>or in this Goſpel-Day, wherein you are called to Repentance, to fit and qualify you to receive the Goſpel of Chriſt and his Kingdom</hi>] for they ſhall mourn and weep. <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions a Time to hate; which under the Goſpel is poſitively prohibited, or forbid, by CHRIST's own Remarks on the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law or Tradition; where he evidently ſhew's, that there is no ſuch Paſſion of the Mind to be exerciſed by Chriſtians (except againſt Sin, as the Godly hate Sin, becauſe it is a Breach of God's Law) no, not againſt our Enemies; his Goſpel being univerſal Love and Beneficence to all Mankind. But granting that <hi>Solomon</hi> indulged himſelf in the Pleaſures and Vanities of the Age he lived in, which indeed, appears to be his Caſe; yet hear how he eſtimates them, in what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called his Recantion; having firſt proved worldly Wiſdom, he perceived that this was Vanity and Vexation of Spirit; <hi>For in much Wiſdom is much Grief, and he that increaſeth Knowledge, increaſeth Sorrow,</hi> Eccl. i. 18. Then ſays he, <hi>I commended Mirth, becauſe a Man hath nothing better under the Sun, than to eat, drink, and be merry—Go to, I will prove thee with Mirth, therefore enjoy Pleaſure, but, behold, this is alſo Vanity; I ſaid of Laughter, it is Madneſs, and of Mirth, what doth it?</hi> Eccl. ii. 1, 2. <hi>For even in Laughter the Heart is ſorrowful, and the End of that Mirth is Heavineſs,</hi> Prov. xiv.

13. And we have this wiſe Man's Opinion, 'That it is better to go to the Houſe of Mourning, than to the Houſe of Feaſting; and that Sorrow is better than Laughter;' for <hi>by the Sadneſs of the Countenance, the Heart is made better: The Heart of the Wiſe, is in the Houſe of Mourning; but the Heart of Fools, in the Houſe of Mirth:</hi> Thus, thou may rejoice, O young Man, in thy Youth, and let thy Heart chear thee in the Days of thy Youth, and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes; but <hi>remember</hi> it is at thy <hi>Peril</hi>; for know thou, that for all theſe Things God will bring thee into Judgment.' Let us now hear his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Matter; <hi>The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wiſdom, and to depart from Evil a good Underſtanding; therefore fear God, and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole Duty of Man: For God ſhall bring every Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be Evil.</hi> But further, to evince that the common Diverſions and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements of the Age, are incongruous and unfit for Chriſtians to recreate themſelves with —do but propoſe to a pious, grave Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, to accompany any one of you to a Ball, a Play, a Maſquerade, or Aſſembly; or invite him to make a Party at Cards, Dice, or any Game; and ſee what an Indignity he'll tell thee thou haſt offered him, telling thee, that theſe Amuſements are inconſiſtent with his Function, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed every one who has, or does frequent Play-houſes, knows that thoſe Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who take the undue Liberty of frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

them, go conceal'd and diſguis'd in what they call a Lay-habit: Whereas, if theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments were ſuitable to a Chriſtian Spirit, and that ſolid, grave, pious Diſpoſition of Mind, which it is the Duty of every common Chriſtian to labour for, and be found in; why may not the beſt Chriſtians frequent them openly, as well as thoſe who pretend to a leſſer Degree of Piety and Holineſs? I am not acquainted with any Text in the ſacred Writings, that allows me, or any one elſe, to be one Whit leſs pious, holy, or virtuous, than our Teachers; nay, <hi>David</hi> did not ſcruple to ſay, 'In Matters of Religion, or the Things of God, that he was wiſer, and had more Underſtanding than all his Teachers;' <hi>For thy Teſtimonies, O Lord, are my Meditation and Delight; I underſtand more than the Antients</hi> (who undoubtedly were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the outward and written Law) for this cogent Reaſon, <hi>becauſe I keep thy Precepts.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>Brethren, be ye Followers of me, and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an Example; and whereunto we have already attain'd, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and mind the ſame Things.</hi> And in his Directions or Council to <hi>Timothy,</hi> tells him, <hi>To be an Example to the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity</hi> [or Love] <hi>in Spirit, in Faith, and in Purity.</hi> He alſo directs <hi>Titus,</hi> 'To exhort the young Men to be ſober-minded; in all Things ſhewing himſelf a Pattern of good Works, in Uncorruptneſs, Gravity, and Sincerity.'</p>

Thus far Biſhop <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon.</hi> Now hear the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi>'s Sentiments of theſe Kind of Books and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments: In his Treatiſe on the Education of Youth he tells us;
<q>Young Perſons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Women, have roving Imaginations, and for want of ſolid Nouriſhment, their Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty turns on vain and dangerous Objects; they are extremely affected with Romances, and chimerical Adventures, and Plays, in which prophane Love bears a mighty Share, and fills their Minds with empty Notions, which bear no Proportion to the true Motive or Spring of our Actions in this preſent World: A poor Girl, whoſe Head is fill'd with ſurprizing Strains, is diſappointed not to find, in the World, real Perſons of the Character of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Heroes; and as ſhe would live like one of their imaginary Princeſſes, what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt muſt it be for her to deſcend from this imaginary State, to the mean Parts and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Houſewifery?</q>

But further; tho' my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is ſhort, and Knowledge ſmall, in the ſublime Myſteries of Chriſtianity, yet I have been induced to conſider it both abſurd and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational to propoſe vain Amuſements and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions to Chriſtians, whoſe Converſation is in Heaven; who have taſted of the good Word of Life, witneſs'd of the Powers of the World to come, ſhar'd, in Part, of the Joys of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by divine Communion and Fellowſhip with God: For, as the Apoſtle ſays truly, "The Fellowſhip of all real Chriſtians is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with the Son, CHRIST JESUS; with whom, having ſat in high and heavenly Places, they look down with holy Contempt on lower Enjoyments: To preſcribe, I ſay, to theſe earthly Pleaſures and Delights, nay, vain and irrational Ones too, is, as the pious <hi>Boyle</hi> juſtly obſerves, as unreaſonable, as if one <hi>ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine an Eagle could be dazzled with a Glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, when, from his high Station, he had been newly gazing at the Sun.</hi> And indeed were the common Recreations both innocent and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a true Chriſtian could not conceive any Delight in them, or in any Thing that tended to divert their Meditation, and carry them ſo far from God, whoſe Words and Preſence are become more to them than their neceſſary Food; and even the Cares and Concerns of this Life, which, on various Occaſions, muſt neceſſarily occupy the Thoughts of Chriſtians, are irkſome and burthenſome to many; as they, in ſome Sort; deprive them of more near and intimate Communion and Intercourſe with God;

Relaxation of the Mind, are theſe; Friends may viſit one another; hear or read Hiſtory; ſpeak of the preſent or paſt Tranſactions; follow Gardening; uſe geometrical and mathematical Experiments, and</hi> ſuch <hi>Things of this Nature; in all which we are not to forget God.</hi> To this let me add the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in his Rules for educating Youth; who, ſpeaking of Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions proper for a young Perſon, ſays thus: <hi>There is no Need of fine Machines or Sights, theatrical Pomps or Expences, to recreate a young Woman; but an inſtructive Reading; a Labour which is by herſelf freely undertaken; a Walk, or a little inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Converſation, which relaxes the Mind after hard Labour, and leaves a purer Joy in her, than of the moſt charming Muſick, or ſtudied Diverſion.</hi> And further, we may conſider the Works and Order of Nature; <hi>for the Heavens declare the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his Handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; Day unto Day uttereth Speech, and Night unto Night ſheweth Knowledge: Thus the inviſible Things of God are diſcerned</hi> (by the Things that are viſible) <hi>even the Eternal Godhead.</hi> By ſuch Obſervations, ſays one of our Authors, <hi>The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would no longer be a Riddle to us; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Earth and Waters, with their reſpective vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and numerous Inhabitants; their Productions, Natures, Seaſons, Sympathies, and Antypathies; their Uſe and Benefit, would be better underſtood by us; and an eternal Wiſdom, Power, Majeſty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, very conſpicuous to us, thro' theſe ſenſible and paſſing Forms; the World wearing the Mark of its Maker, whoſe Stamp is every where viſible, and the Characters legible to the Children of Wiſdom:
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:006166_0058_1027FD8731654F38"/>
This would direct People in the Uſe of the World; for how could Man have the Conſcience to abuſe it, while they ſee the great Creator ſtaring them in the Face, in all and every Part of it.</hi> And he adds; <hi>As Man is conſider'd as the Epitome of the World, we ſhould not be ignorant of our own Make and Frame; a Glaſs, in which we ſhould ſee that true, inſtructing and agreeable, Variety, which is to be obſerved in Nature to the Admiration of that Wiſdom, and Adoration of that Power, that created and formed us.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like Relaxations, from higher Attentions, do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude God; whereas it would be impious ſo much as to imagine, that the Smiles of God's Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or his holy Preſence, can in the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree be enjoy'd in the common Paſtimes and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of the World; 'tis not expected nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by any of the Votaries to Pleaſure. On the contrary, how is the ſacred Name of the Almighty daily and frequently prophaned, not only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Gameſters, but by Perſons of both Sexes, who play, as they ſay, for Diverſion, and who make no Scruple frequently to take God's holy Name in vain, and uſe it wickedly and abſurdly to bleſs or curſe their, as they term it, good or bad Fortune! And indeed it has been often Subject of Amazement and Sorrow to me, when I ſo frequently meet with, and obſerve this Impiety, even amongſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity of moſt Denominations, who irreverently, and, without Fear, take God's ſacred Name into their Mouths in their ordinary and trivial Diſcourſe, and vain Converſation; not conſidering that this Practice is an open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Violation of one of God's Laws or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

in which he declares, <hi>He will not hold them guiltleſs that take his Name in vain</hi> (which Precept they frequently repeat in their Worſhip.) And our Lord aſſures us, that for every idle Word that Men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an Account in the Day of Judgment; how much more then for this daily Breach of One not the leaſt, of his Precepts? I would beg Leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, how careful and circumſpect <hi>David</hi> was in his Words; <hi>I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will take Heed to my Ways, that I ſin not with my Tongue; I will keep my Mouth as with a Bridle,</hi> &amp;c. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells us poſitively, <hi>That Perſon</hi>'s <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vain who bridleth not his Tongue: That we ſuffer no corrupt Communication to proceed out of our Mouths</hi>; but, on the contrary, <hi>ſuch as is good, to the Uſe of edifying, that it may miniſter Grace to the Hearers.</hi> One Mark of the Enemies of God is, that they prophane his Name. <hi>Thine Enemies,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>take thy Name in vain, O God.</hi> In the Life and Character of <hi>Robert Boyle,</hi> as an Honour to his Memory we are told, That he never mentioned the Name of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but with the greateſt Reverence, and always made a Pauſe at the ſame Time: I wiſh the Example of ſo pious a Man may be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and the evil Conſequence of the above impious Practice more conſidered. But to return: The Manner in which we think it allowable to ſpend our leiſure Hours, as has been obſerv'd, does not exclude God; but ever admits and ſuggeſts ſome ſuitable edifying, moral and pious Reflections, never forgetting to have an Eye to God; and as we live in a Senſe of his Fear and Preſence, ſhort

Ejaculations, or Breathings, which come from, will often aſcend to, God. On the contrary, where is the leaſt Room for God, among thoſe People who are ridiculouſly term'd <hi>People of Faſhion,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where the Hours of People of this Name are ſpent in Folly, Impertinence and Wickedneſs? As Home is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to Perſons of this Caſt, 'tis now faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to go abroad to Breakfaſt, and, like thoſe prophane Perſons the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> deſcribes, They count it Pleaſure to riot in the Day-time; ſome of theſe dance great Part of the Morning away, while others are entertained with Drollery, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick'ry and Buffoonery. When they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently tired with this Levity and Wantonneſs, the next Appearance, of the Women at leaſt, is at the Mercer's, Milliner's, or Toy-ſhop, ſpending in Folly, Superfluity and Extravagance, while the Huſbands of ſome of them are perplexing their Brains how to ſupport his Wife's Vanity, which is now become his own, as he proudly conſiders it a Reproach to himſelf, that his Wife ſhould be leſs fine and faſhionable than his Neighbour's. The Toilet claims the Remainder of the Morning, 'till call'd upon at perhaps Three or Four o'Clock, for Dinner; and then ſhe is ſo hurried and uneaſy, that ſhe can't ſtay longer at her Glaſs to admire her Fopperies, that ſhe has little to do but quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel with her Dinner or Servants, 'till the Hour of Viſiting or Diverſions, which poſſibly may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till Three or Four next Morning. By the Account you have of one Day, you may eaſily conjecture how the whole Week is ſpent. The Buſineſs of this Week being over, let us now

ſee how the firſt Day of the next is employ'd, or whether any thing of the Chriſtian appears in their Behaviour on this Day. Having no Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do on this idle Day, as many make it, ſome indulge and ſleep longer than uſual on other Days, except thoſe who uſe it as a Day of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or Recreation, making Excurſions into the Country merely for Pleaſure. But let us attend thoſe who go to their reſpective Places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip regularly; theſe, by the prepoſterous, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical and ſplendid Dreſſes, of both Male and Female, would induce a Stranger to think were Idolators, reparing to ſome Heathen Temple, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Worſhip of the true God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds their Splendor <note n="*" place="bottom">

them bowing and paying Homage to each other, ſometimes in the midſt of their Worſhip. This irreligious Conduct I have not only been an Eye Witneſs of, but in the Practice of it, when I profeſſed with you; on which Behaviour, as well as other Parts of Indevotion, I have ſince reflected with Horror; and found our Lord's Words, on ſeveral Occaſions, veryfied in myſelf; <hi>I had been indeed worſhipping I knew not what; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vain was all the Formalities and Ceremonies I was performing outwardly, when I received no inward or ſpiritual Benefit.</hi> A certain Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now living, as far as I know, (in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Levity and irreverent Conduct of People in this falſe Devotion) wiſhes <hi>Their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may not be found in the Catalogue of their Sins.</hi> And another adviſes them, when at their Prayers, <hi>to pauſe, and aſk themſelves, if they really do pray?</hi> I have been greatly concerned, when I have thought that ſuch Pretences to Worſhip can be conſider'd no other (if I may be allow'd the Expreſſion) than affronting the Almighty to his Face; and that he may take up the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint as he did of old againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This People draw nigh to me with their Tongues and their Lips, but their Hearts are far from me.</hi> And now the Worſhip is over, let us obſerve if we can hear any Remarks on the Sermon: No ſurely; that was not the Buſineſs that principally concern'd them; but the Faſhions and Garbs of one another ingroſs the whole Obſervation, as ſoon as they are diſmiſſed, and are commonly the Subject of Converſation moſt part of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:006166_0063_1027FD95947FD550"/>But when we conſider the Practice and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the foregoing Week, the Horror and Amazement we muſt certainly have been fill'd with, while we are reflecting, will ceaſe; and we ſhall conclude with Regret, That better cannot be expected from People, while they remain in ſuch an inconſiderate, irreligious, and unhappy Situation! The Impiety of a Life thus ſpent in this Circle of Madneſs, Folly and falſe Devotion, is ſufficient, one would think, to provoke and draw down the Indignation of the Almighty on the Heads of ſuch Tranſgreſſors, with whom he has long ſuffer'd, in order to bring them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And I have been led to admire and adore the long Forbearance and Mercy of the Majeſty of Heaven, who is thus daily affronted and provoked by his Creatures; Creatures too of his Pleaſure, whoſe Life, Breath and Being, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his Will; and who placed us here on this Earth to ſerve him our Creator, by glorifying him with our Bodies, Souls and Spirits. But alas! inſtead of giving the Honour due to his Name, or acknowledging him in all our Ways, as we are exhorted, 'tis impoſſible that People in this Courſe of Life that I have deſcribed, can acknowledge God in any of their Ways; and that in the Room of having him in all their Thoughts, they take certain and ſure Meaſures to exclude him from all their Thoughts. And when I have ſometimes been reflecting on the common Expreſſion made uſe of by many of theſe Sort of Chriſtians, when they would confirm ſomething they are going to aſſert for Truth, irreverently uſe theſe Words, <hi>As I hope to be ſaved,</hi> I have been much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;

for how People, who purſue theſe Steps, can rationally hope to arrive at Heaven, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive. But ſuppoſing it poſſible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in their own carnal Way, how wou'd, or cou'd they reliſh the Pleaſure ſaid to be at God's Right Hand, or delight in his Preſence, when they have had no Acquaintance, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Fellowſhip, with him on Earth? What would they think of ſpending an Eternity in his Service and Praiſe, when the very Mention of Religion, and the Things of God, are irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and troubleſome in Time? And it is now become unfaſhionable and mean, and the Mark of a puſillanimous Spirit, ſo much as to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any Care or Concern about their poor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls. But let not any deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hope to obtain Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on eaſier Terms than the Almighty has propoſed: For if we will credit the ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, none but thoſe who have ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of their evil Ways, and turn'd from them; who have lov'd, fear'd and ſerv'd God here below, and who have gain'd the Victory over their ſinful Luſts and Paſſions, can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into this glorious Manſion of Bliſs (nor none but thoſe who are properly qualified for a Part in the heavenly Choir, who can ſing the Song of the Redeemed) where the happy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the Righteous will be praiſing God, and giving Glory to his Name; as <hi>John</hi> (call'd the Divine) teſtifies; <hi>I ſaw,</hi> ſays he, <hi>thoſe who had gotten the Victory, with Harps in their Hands, ſinging the Song of</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord, and the Song of the Lamb,

And every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is in Heaven praiſed God, ſaying, Bleſſing and Honour, Glory and Power, be unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever!

            <p>If this be the happy Situation of the Bleſſed above, as we have no Reaſon to doubt but it is, examine yourſelves, I beſeech you, and ſee how you are prepar'd and qualify'd for ſuch a Place and Condition; and remember 'tis the Living only, thoſe whom CHRIST hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Power of the Grave of Sin, and quicken'd, by the Reſurrection of his Holy Spirit, to a Life of Holineſs, that can truly praiſe God; thoſe who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sin, cannot celebrate his Praiſe, nor ſing the Song of the ranſomed Ones. Therefore you who are as aſleep, in a carnal, eaſy and careleſs State, hear the Voice of the Son of God, which ſpeaks in your Conſcience, ſaying,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:006166_0066_1027FD9E09479858"/>
'Awake, ariſe from the Dead, and CHRIST ſhall give thee Life; ſtand in Awe, and Sin not; commune with your own Hearts, and be ſtill; retire there, and ſee how the Caſe ſtands between God and your own Souls; acquaint yourſelves with God, and be at Peace:' For I teſtify to you this Day, that I have witneſſed his Peace and Favour to be better than Life; for which my Heart, as well as my Lips, have often return'd, to his great Name, high Praiſes and Thankſgivings! O that many may be made ſenſible of his Favour to their Souls! that they may ſee, and fear, and turn unto the Lord, and truſt in his Name: You who are afar off from God, draw near, and behold his Goodneſs, and taſte it; and you who are near, with me, acknowledge his Might. 'Times of Ignorance God winked at; but now, in this Goſpel-Day, he commands all Men, every where, to repent; as Life and Immortality is brought to Light, through the Goſpel of JESUS CHRIST;' whoſe Goſpel you profeſs to rejoice in: But if thoſe, called Chriſtians (whom God hath known, above all the Families of the Earth) rebel againſt the Light, your Puniſhment will be the greater, according to the Proportion of Knowledge and Grace received: For that Servant who knows his Lord's Will, and prepares not himſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does according to his Will, <hi>ſhall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi> Bring your Deeds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Light of CHRIST in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and ſee if they are wrought in God: Remember why ſome formerly refuſed to bring their Deeds to this Light; it was becauſe it

would manifeſt that they were Evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reproved by it. And tho' the Proſpect may appear gloomy and unpleaſant to ſome, and you may be unwilling to break your falſe Peace, and diſturb a Reſt you have created to yourſelves, and find a ſtronger Propenſity to gratify than croſs your ſenſual Inclinations and Appetites; tho' you may be averſe to an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking which is likely to prove troubleſome; a Task ſo diſguſtful and diſagreeable, as changing our old Cuſtoms and Manners; which you are told by the Apoſtle, muſt be done: <hi>All who are in CHRIST JESUS, muſt be new Creatures; Old Things muſt paſs away, all Things muſt become new, and all of God.</hi> Theſe you may poſſibly think hard Sayings; but remember, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of Fleſh and Blood cannot enter with you into the Kingdom of God; whoſe Love, when you are really in Poſſeſſion of it, will make <hi>hard Things, eaſy, and bitter Things, ſweet.</hi> Many are diſcouraged and afraid to enter upon a religious Courſe of Life, as it will, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, retrench their Liberties, and render their Lives unpleaſant, gloomy and melancholy: This, indeed, is one of the Subtilties of Satan; one of his evil Reports of the good <hi>Land of Promiſe,</hi> which 'tis his Advantage to prevent your Entrance into. But don't believe him, nor his evil Spies; he was a <hi>Liar from the Beginning,</hi> and remains ſo to this Day. Though the Path you muſt tread, is narrow, and will not admit of many Things which Pride has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, and the Tyrant, <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> maintains and ſupports (and which by the Way, you will
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:006166_0068_1027FDA149902E60"/>
have no Affection for) yet there is Room enough to enjoy the neceſſary Things of this Life, in Moderation: Lament, you will indeed, becauſe you have been ſo long Sinners, and did not turn to, love and obey God, ſooner; and now will you mourn over him, whom you often pierced with your Sins: Grieve, perhaps, you may; but one Reaſon will be, That the <hi>World lies in Wickedneſs:</hi> But I dare venture to aſſert, that no true and real Chriſtian, ever repented that he was ſo; for all ſuch Experience, in Truth, that God's Service, is perfect Freedom; and that all <hi>His Ways, are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all his Paths, Paths of Peace.</hi> But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you who may be unwilling to enter upon this new but neceſſary Work, this one Thing abſolutely needful, remember and conſider, that CHRIST poſitively aſſures us, <hi>That except a Man be born again</hi> (of the Spirit) <hi>he can in no wiſe enter the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> John iii. 3. And that if ever you are ſaved, it muſt be according to God's own Preſcription, <hi>by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and Renewing</hi> (Power) <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; by his ſanctifying Word and Operation; which is able to do more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for you, than you can ask or think: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let me entreat you, not to forſake your own Mercies: God is waiting to be gracious to you; his Hand is full of Bleſſings; accept, I beſeech you, of the Offers of his Grace, and anſwer to his Call, while the Day of your Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation laſts, leſt when you call, he ſhould not anſwer; for he has declared, That His <hi>Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he

alſo is Fleſh.</hi> Comply then with the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Terms of Salvation, and do not vainly hope or imagine He will be brought down to yours: Don't think yourſelves ſafe, tho' many of you may be innocent from great Tranſgreſſions; remember, all and every Unrighteouſneſs is Sin: But many flatter themſelves, and believe, if they are not chargeable with groſs Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that little Sins will not be noted by the Almighty; that Satan, the World, and the Fleſh, are ſo powerful, that they cannot get the better of thoſe little Weakneſſes and Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo incident to human Nature: and as they do not, on their Principles, expect to be freed from them on this Side the Grave, they do not ſo much as deſire or attempt to obtain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over them; but depend on God's Mercy, hoping he will not be extreme to mark ſmall Offences; and if they are exact in ſome moral Duties, they imagine the Almighty will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for little Reſerves. That God is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Mercy, I grant; but don't forget, that he is alſo Sovereign Juſtice, and will not condemn the Innocent; neither will he ſtep aſide from his Equity, to acquit the Guilty; for as <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Righteous ſhall be upon him,</hi> ſo ſhall the <hi>Wickedneſs of the Wicked be upon him,</hi> Ezek. xviii. 20. <hi>Say ye to the Righteous, it ſhall be well with him, for he ſhall eat the Fruit of his Doings: But woe unto the Wicked, it ſhall be ill with him; for the Reward of his Hands ſhall be given him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, theſe trite Arguments and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, which are ſo generally made uſe of to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:006166_0070_1027FDA99BB11898"/>
defend evil Practices, appear as weak as the Frailties they plead for; and I think, if I may be allow'd the Expreſſion, People make the Almighty a very injurious Compliment, when they aſcribe greater Power and Strength to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, than to the Moſt High. But perhaps they may imagine the Almighty will diſpenſe with ſome of his Attributes, ſince they allow him one in a more abſolute Degree. And now give me Leave to tell you what the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Advocate, <hi>Chillingſworth,</hi> ſays on this Subject, in a Sermon preached before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt (if I remember right) which take it in his own Words and Senſe.
<q>Some aſcribe a Sort of Omnipotency to the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil; and that God neither does, nor will give ſufficient Strength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them; which Opinion he labours to explode, and poſitively affirms, that, by the Aſſiſtance of the Grace of God, it is in our Power to reſiſt them; and ſhews the Neceſſity of ſo doing, from what we are ſo frequently and plainly aſſured of in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> viz. That without actual and effectual Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with actual and eſſential Amendment of Life, Regeneration and Sanctification, no Hope, no Poſſibility of Salvation. Thus you ſee, <hi>ſays he,</hi> all the divine Writers of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> with one Conſent, and with one Mouth, proclaim the Neceſſity of real Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and labour to diſenchant us from the vain Fancy, That Men may be ſaved by ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing for their Sins, and intending to leave them, without effectual Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

of Life: Which, it may be fear'd, has ſent Thouſands of Souls to Hell, in a golden Dream of Heaven:</q>
And therefore he very juſtly apprizes his Audience,
<q>That it was not the pleaſing themſelves, of being of ſuch a Sect or Profeſſion, together with going to Church, ſaying or hearing of Prayers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Sacraments, hearing, repeating or preaching of Sermons; with Zeal for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or Zeal againſt them; or, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, with any Thing elſe, than conſtant Piety towards God, Juſtice and Charity to our Neighbours; Temperance, Chaſtity and Sobriety towards ourſelves; we ſhall one Day find we have not mocked God, but ourſelves; and ſhall have our Portion among Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites! We make the Church a Stage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to act our Part, and playing our Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; there we make a Profeſſion every Day of confeſſing our Sins, with humble, lowly, penitent and obedient Hearts; and yet when we have talked after this Rate, twenty, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or forty Years, our Hearts, for the moſt Part, continue as proud, as impenitent, and as diſobedient, as they were in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note n="*" place="bottom">A certain Author, in ſome Remarks on <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sinners you find us, and miſerable you leave us!, And, in the Caſe of Confeſſion, he thus ſtates the Matter; 'Suppoſe thou hadſt a Son, and ſhouldſt daily let him know what thou wouldſt have him do, and he ſhould Day by Day, Week by Week, and Year by Year, provoke thee to thy Face, and ſhould ſay, Father, I have not done what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandedſt me to do: but I have done quite the contrary; and ſhould continue to provoke thee to thy Face, once, or oftner, every Week, wou'dſt thou not think him a rebellious Child, and that his Application to thee was mere Mockery? And would is not occaſion thee to diſinherit him?</note>. We make great Proteſtations when we meet and aſſemble together to render Thanks to Almighty God, for the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received at his Hands: And if this were

to be performed with Words, with Hoſannas, Hallelujahs, Gloria Patri's, Pſalms, Hymns, and ſuch like outward Matters; peradventure we ſhould do it very ſufficiently: But, in the mean Time, in our Lives and Actions, we provoke the Almighty, and that to his Face, with all Variety of grievous and bitter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations; we do thoſe Things which he has aſſured us to be odious unto Him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Nature. And therefore he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ſee, that the Power of Godlineſs, almoſt in all Places, was decried and vaniſhed; the Form and Profeſſion of it only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that the Spirit and Soul of Religion was, for the moſt Part, gone, and only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Carcaſs or Shadow of it left behind! His whole Diſcourſe was to preſs the abſolute Neceſſity of Converſion from Sin, and to ſhew that nothing ſhort of it would ſtand one in any Stead. That none were CHRIST's, but thoſe who have crucified the Fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts: They that have not done ſo, let them be as ſorrowful as they pleaſe, they, as yet, are none of CHRIST's: And he cries out, Lord! what a Multitude of Chriſtians are there in the World, that do not belong to CHRIST! And then goes on; It is not a wiſhing, but a working Faith: Not a wiſhing you were a new Creature; but being a new Creature: Not a wiſhing you

had kept, nor a ſorrowing you have not kept, nor purpoſing vainly to keep; but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Commandments muſt prevail with Him, as it is not to the Willing, but to the Obedient the Promiſe is given. But is not this, <hi>ſays he,</hi> preaching Works, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do? No, certainly; but it is to preach Works, as CHRIST and his Apoſtles do; it is to preach the Neceſſity of them, which no good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, no good Chriſtian ever denied; but it is not to preach the Merit of them, which is the Error of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </q> By this Author's Manner of Preaching Works, we may infer, that he includes all Chriſtian, as well as moral Virtues; by ſaying, 'We muſt become new Creatures, and keep all God's Commandments:' And I would obſerve to ſome, whom I have elſewhere ſaid ſeem to confine Chriſtianity to moral Duties, and, in ſome Sort, to exclude the Duties of the firſt Table, which we are as punctually to perform, as thoſe of the Second; what will it avail us, tho' we be exact in moral Works, if the Motive of them do not come from God; for tho' we do all imaginable Juſtice to Mankind, tho' we give all our Goods to the Poor, and ſuffer for what we think our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, we may be deficient in the moſt material Point, if we have not <hi>Charity</hi>; or do not act from that which ought to be the Spring and Motive of all our Actions, <hi>viz. Love to God.</hi> The young Man, who came to CHRIST, had, as he ſaid, kept the Commands contain'd in the ſecond Table, and yet we find him unfit for eternal Life; he
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:006166_0074_1027FDB3A8F98468"/>
was negatively good; he had not done any Murther, nor committed Adultery; he had not ſtole from, nor defrauded his Neighbour; he had refrain'd from theſe Evils; but we do not find he had yet learn'd to do well: And when Obedience to a poſitive and particular Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on CHRIST, our Lord, was pleaſed to lay upon him (ſuppoſed) to prove his Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God; when it was required of him to quit, or exchange, his earthly Poſſeſſions, tho' with great Advantage, no leſs than an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance eternal in the Heavens, and take up a Croſs to his own Will and Deſires, and follow CHRIST, in this Way of Self-denial; behold he Coward like withdraws, and departs, we are told, ſad and dejected, being grieved with the Saying: This unhappy young Man's Refuſal of the Kingdom, or Eternal Life, on our Lord's Conditions, occaſioned him, with an apparent Concern, to ſay, <hi>How hardly ſhall they that have,</hi> or in his following Words, <hi>that truſt in Riches, enter into the Kingdom of God!</hi> And, on another Occaſion, he further declares; That <hi>whoſoever came to Him, and took not up his Croſs, and denied himſelf, and hated not Father and Mother, Wife, Children, Brethren and Siſters, yea, and his own Life,</hi> (when brought in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of his Duty and Love to God) <hi>he could not be his Diſciple</hi>; and, conſequently, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternal Life.</p>

viii 14. <hi>Mark</hi> iv. 19. all which Remarks I ſhall paſs over, and only obſerve what he ſays on part of the ſaid 19th Verſe. <hi>The luſting after other Things; hurtful Things, which choak the Seed or</hi> Word of <hi>Life in us—The Luſt of the Eye,</hi> he tells us, <hi>are our Deſires of gay Apparel, rich Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and ſuch like, as by St.</hi> John <hi>are ſtiled, the Pride of Life: Deſire of popular Applauſe, or high Eſtimation in the World: Advancement to high Poſts, or great Places, above others: And, laſtly, Our exceſſive Love to our Relatives; as Parents, Wives, Children, Friends,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For when theſe Affections prove Temptations to Sin, as the Exceſs of them certainly does; they will then be obſtructive of that Influence, the Word of Life ſhould have upon us: And St.</hi> John <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that all theſe are not of the Father; but of the World,</hi> John ii. 15, 16. <hi>And that if we love or ſet our Hearts upon them, the Love of the Father is not in us—Therefore CHRIST re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to deny ourſelves in all theſe Things, to love them leſs, or hate them</hi> (comparatively) <hi>that we may be his Diſciples.</hi> And next I ſhall endeavour to illuſtrate, by one Inſtance, among the many I have experienced, how I underſtand the above Precept, by ſaying how I conducted myſelf in a Circumſtance wherein Self-denial appear'd requiſite and neceſſary to be put in Practice by me: When I was conducted, by my great Leader, into the narrow Path of Self-denial, I was ſenſible that I muſt part with many hurtful and ſuperfluous Things, I had been accuſtomed to; the Way was too narrow to admit of Pride in any Shape or Form; and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:006166_0076_1027FDB94CE75C28"/>
as Superfluity in Apparel, as well as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtances of Luxury, appear'd to me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and the more particular Inſtructions and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of ſeveral of the Apoſtles, I laid aſide ſeveral Things I thought inconſiſtent with the Profeſſion of a Chriſtian; and diſuſed idle and unmeaning Compliments; and further, being convinced of the Principles of the <hi>People called Quakers,</hi> I joined to that Society. Thus I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſingular, and conſequently deſpicable to my Children, and ſome of my Acquaintance and Friends; who not only profeſs'd a Diſlike, but a Concern that I ſhould appear in ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a Manner, and ſo very different from what I uſually had done. Here I had a Croſs to bear. What was now to be done! I was certain I had acted with Sincerity, and done, according to the beſt of my Underſtanding, what I apprehended the Duty of every common Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> To part with all Superfluities of Naughtineſs, which were now beginning to be burthenſome to me, as I gradually experienced, Old Things paſſing away, and new Deſires and Affections to take Place in my Heart. I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Meetings of theſe People, as I was convinced the Doctrines they taught, and their Mode of Worſhip, were free from Ceremonies and Superſtition, and moſt agreeable to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I had made in reading the ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and what was moſt valuable and worthy Imitation, that the true and genuine Members of this Society, walk conſiſtently and agreeably to the Rules and Maxims of CHRIST
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:006166_0077_1027FDBC5F14F090"/>
and his Apoſtles. However, to be deſpiſed by my Acquaintance, Friends and Children, was a Trial hard to bear: But whoſoever he be of you, <hi>that taketh not up his Croſs, and hateth not</hi> (comparatively) <hi>Father, Mother, Children,</hi> &amp;c. ſays our bleſſed Lord, <hi>is not worthy of me, and cannot be my Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, though, in this Inſtance, I endeavoured to pleaſe God rather than Men, I'll venture to aſſert, that few have a more natural Tenderneſs, and affectionate Regard, in both, or all theſe Relations than myſelf. And, indeed, when the Love of God is received into our Hearts, 'tis ſo far from leſſening or contracting our lawful Affections, that it enlarges our Hearts, in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Manner, to our Relatives and Friends; and excites in us a loving and benevolent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards all Mankind, whoſe Happineſs we entirely wiſh: <hi>For if any Man ſay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Liar; for he who loveth not his Brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> And this Commandment we have from him, <hi>That he who loveth God, will love his Brother alſo; and we love God becauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> Therefore, if God ſo loved us, we ought to love one another, and do Good to all; but, <hi>more eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith</hi>; with whom we are made one in CHRIST. But further, among many Inſtances of Self-denial, as I have above remark'd, I found Pride, in Apparel, abſolutely neceſſary to be avoided; and tho' Pride, in every Species and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, is abominable and odious in the Sight of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:006166_0078_1027FDC063ABAB08"/>
the Almighty, yet it ſeems particularly againſt this Branch of it, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims in his third Chapter: And, I am ſorry to obſerve, that the Charge of this odious, as well as irrational Paſſion of the Mind, equally affects the Male, as the Female Part of my Species. <hi>But what renders it the more notable, is, that we don't remark, in preceeding Ages, any Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Article of Apparel, ever ſo much as mention'd; or any Caution given to Men, to avoid Superfluity, or Gaiety, of this Kind</hi>; as if this Folly and Weakneſs, was indeed incident and peculiar to Women only. And we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, from Hiſtory, that wiſe Men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neglected and deſpiſed Gaiety in their Clothes; and, whenever any Vanity of this Sort appeared, tho' in young Men, it was look'd upon with Contempt, and derided by reaſonable Men, who conſider'd it as a Mark or Indication of weak Intellects. But however that be, I ſhall take the Liberty of asking my own Sex, who ſeem moſt concerned in the Judgements pronounced by the Prophet againſt the Pride of Women, their Opinion of the Chapter I have mentioned. After the Prophet had been enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating the great Diſadvantages and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Children or People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had brought upon themſelves by their Sin and Diſobedience, for which, he tells them, the Lord would aſſuredly enter into Judgment, by bringing theſe Calamities ſuddenly upon them; he adds, <hi>Moreover, the Lord ſaith, becauſe the Daughters of</hi> Zion <hi>are haughty, and walk with ſtretched-forth Necks, and wanton Eyes, walking, and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:006166_0079_1027FDC1F49B1638"/>
mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their Feet: Therefore, in that Day</hi> (the Day of his Judgements) <hi>ſaith the Lord, I will take away the Bravery of their tinkling Ornaments from about their Feet, and their Cauls, and their round Tires like the Moon, the Chains, and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers, the Bonnets, and the Ornaments of the Legs, and the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Ear-rings, the Rings, and Noſe-jewels, the changeable Suits of Apparel, and Mantles, and the Wimples, and the Criſping-pins, the Glaſſes, and the fine Linnen, the Hoods, and the Veils. And it ſhall come to paſs, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſweet Smells, there ſhall be a Stink; inſtead of a Girdle, a Rent; inſtead of well ſet Hair, Baldneſs; inſtead of a Stomacher, a girding with Sackcloth; and Burning, inſtead of Beauty.</hi> And hence let us obſerve the Effects of Pride, in Apparel too, which many think ſo inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; and ſome have been ſo abſurd as to ſay, that the Ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> enumerated by the Prophet, were only unlawful to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Women, who poſſibly had borrow'd their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions from the <hi>Heathen,</hi> with whom they were forbid any Sort of Commerce; neither were they to walk after the Cuſtoms and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations. But we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, theſe Things were not to be taken from them, becauſe they had borrow'd the Forms of them from the neighbouring Nations; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Daughters of</hi> Zion <hi>are proud and haughty, and walk with ſtretched-forth Necks,</hi> when they are adorn'd with all the Bravery of theſe Ornaments; therefore the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:006166_0080_1027FDC50F7C0CE0"/>
them of the Things they made ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to their Pride and Vanity; the Sin of which is equally odious and abhorent to God, in us, the Deſcendants of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as it was in the <hi>Jews:</hi> Nor does the Prohibition of Sin, or the Command or Precept of Holineſs, loſe one Whit of its Force and Energy, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliver'd two or three thouſand, or ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Years ago. As the Almighty is unchangeable in his eſſential Holineſs; <hi>for with Him is no Variableneſs, or Shadow of Turning:</hi> Sin, that was Sin ſome Ages back, muſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be ſo at this Day.</p>
            <p>But hear now what ſome of the Chriſtian Apoſtles enjoin, when they were giving Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Churches of CHRIST, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 9. and which Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> thus notes: <hi>In like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo I will that</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Women adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in modeſt Apparel, with Shamefacedneſs and Sobriety</hi>; not ſetting out themſelves <hi>with broider'd Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or coſtly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>; but with that Ornament <hi>which</hi> beſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Women profeſſing Godlineſs</hi>; that is, <hi>with good Works.</hi> And next the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in his particular Inſtructions to Chriſtian Women, he thus expreſſes himſelf; <hi>Whoſe adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and wearing Gold, or putting on of Apparel; but let it be with the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the Sight of God of great Price: For after this Manner, in the old Times, the holy Women alſo, who truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, adorned themſelves.</hi> And the above
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:006166_0081_1027FDC810DF6D70"/>
cited Author, in his Comment on the Words of both theſe Apoſtles, gives you his Senſe thus: <hi>It ſeems evident, that all Attire, which, by the Richneſs and Coſtlineſs of it, ſhews any Pride or Vanity of Spirit, or any Ambition to excel others, is forbid by the Apoſtle<hi>'s</hi> Words: All great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, Care and Study, to appear in ſuch At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, as if it were our trueſt Ornament, and that which made us excel, and be more honourable than others: This Vanity and Pride, this Eſteem of, and Concern for, theſe Things, being not well conſiſtent with Sobriety, and much leſs with the</hi> Profeſſion of true Godlineſs. <hi>And here</hi> (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues he) <hi>'tis worthy to be noted by the Women, that this Precept ought not to be ſlighted by them, as of little Moment, ſeeing it is ſo carefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the two chief Apoſtles of the Jews and Gentiles, St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul. <hi>And the contrary is repreſented as a Practice oppoſite to Godlineſs:</hi> And he ſubjoins; <hi>Let them eſpecially remark the Character here given of a Chriſtian Woman,</hi> viz. <hi>That ſhe is one who does not only profeſs and declare, that ſhe ſerves and worſhips God; but alſo doth ſhew forth Godlineſs in her Life and Converſation. And let the Men note hence, that if it be ſo unbecoming a Chriſtian Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be thus concern'd in adorning and tricking up her Body, it muſt be much more unbecoming a Chriſtian Man to put on ſuch Attire, which makes him truly deſerve the Name of</hi> Fop. And next let us hear the Opinion of one of the Antients, <hi>viz, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; he tells us, <hi>That Women, who wear Gold, and plait the Hair, have not the Image of God in the inward Man;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:006166_0082_1027FDCC0E057270"/>
and that the apoſtolical Conſtitutions forbid Women to wear exquiſite Garments, which were fitted to deceive, or Gold Rings,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Jamblicus,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> ſays, <hi>That no free Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wore Gold, but lewd Women only.</hi> Hence you may obſerve, that the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> are not ſingular in the Conſtruction they put on, or Senſe they conſider the Apoſtle's Words in, in the Article of Apparel; and that our Particularity in this Matter does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Whim, Caprice or Fancy, or any Affectation of being ſingular; but from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in our own Underſtanding, that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity and Luxury, which has its Riſe from Pride, is inconſiſtent and contrary to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lowly, unambitious Temper and Spirit, of Chriſtianity. One Argument ſome have made uſe of to ſupport the Vanity of gay and coſtly Clothing, was this; That the Pride was not in the Clothes, but in the Heart; An Aſſertion I have greatly prov'd true by my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. I could not imagine there could be any moral or inherent Evil in a Piece of gay Silk; for I know full well, that Pride proceeds from a vain and ambitious Heart; and that if it had not its Reſidence, and Seat there, it would not appear in the Habit or Garb. But tho' ſome perhaps may allow me to be acquainted with, and therefore a Judge of my own Heart; yet, wou'd it not border upon Uncharitableneſs, to alledge that all Perſons who wear gay Clothing, are conſequently proud and ambitious? I anſwer; Tho' it may not be ſafe to judge in every Caſe according to the Sight of the Eye, yet our
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:006166_0083_1027FDCD95C8B8A0"/>
Lord ſeems to allow us the Evidence of our Senſes pretty generally. <hi>Every Tree,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is known by its Fruit. Of Thorns Men do not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figs, nor off a Bramble-buſh Grapes.</hi> And then gives us the following Mark or Criterion to judge by, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits.</hi> Thus when I ſee Fruits of the ſame Kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by others, which I certainly know pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the bitter Root of Pride in my own Heart, I do not think it an uncharitable, but a natural and rational Concluſion, that they ſpring from the like evil Root in others. <hi>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit. A good Man, out of the good Treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good; but an evil Man, out of the evil Treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is evil.</hi> I have heard it objected, that Perſons, who have always been accuſtomed to Finery from their Infancy, are not commonly proud of it; it becomes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſo familiar to them, that they have not ſuch high Thoughts of themſelves when gaily attir'd as many imagine; neither value Dreſs and ſplendid Equipages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at ſo high a Rate, as thoſe do to whom they have not been ſo habitual; this I have thought may be partly true; but notwithſtanding I have conſider'd, that tho' theſe Things are habitual and familiar to many, yet People of this Character are not ſo ignorant, as not to be ſenſible that they are reſpected and courted according to the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they make in the World; and ſhould any One propoſe to ſuch to lay aſide their Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:006166_0084_1027FDCF629DC160"/>
and Gaiety, we ſhould ſoon ſee theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not ſo indifferent to them as ſome may think; they only ſeem more careleſs and eaſy about them, becauſe they have been accuſtom'd to Pride of this Sort longer than others, and therefore leſs affected with it, having better learn'd the Art to conceal it: And if every One would be ſo juſt to themſelves, as candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impartially to enquire and ask their own Hearts, from whence proceeds their Fondneſs for Splendor, Shew and Pomp, eſpecially in this Article, they would be obliged to confeſs, or at leaſt not to deny, that Pride was at the Bottom.</p>
            <p>Part of a Converſation I happen'd to have with a faſhionable Woman in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> will ſerve to confirm what I have obſerv'd. She aſſerted ſhe was free from Pride, tho' ſhe did adorn herſelf in a gay and ſplendid Manner. I ask'd her if ſhe could be as well ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in a plain Dreſs, and Stuff or Woollen Gown, as with the gay Silks ſhe uſually wore? She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd yes. I queried why ſhe then dreſſed ſo gay? She anſwer'd, that ſhe might appear agreeable to others. I ask'd her why ſhe was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to pleaſe others with her fine Clothes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> She ſaid, it was leaſt ſhe ſhould be deſpiſed for the Meaneſs of her Appearance. I ask'd her whence proceeded that Fear? Here, I think, ſhe was ſilent, being reduced to an Extremity, which proved the Source of her Vanity to be nothing leſs than Pride, in ſpight of all her boaſted Humility. I have often thought, our Fondneſs for Trifles, Pomp, Shew and Noiſe,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:006166_0085_1027FDD0F123C9C8"/>
may be attributed to Inconſideration: For did we reflect, examine and compare Things, we ſhould certainly make very different Deductions, Concluſions, and Eſtimations, from what the Generality of Mankind are wont to do. And I am certain, from our Ignorance of Divine and Heavenly Things, proceeds our Fondneſs and inordinate Deſires for ſenſual and earthly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Enjoyments. And indeed ſince I have thought at all, I mean to any good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have been amazed at my own Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Folly, when I have conſider'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected how anxious I had formerly been till I was in Poſſeſſion of this gay Silk, and the other fine Lace; and I have bluſhed with an holy Shame, when I reflected how I had ſometimes doated on a Ribbon, or any other Toy or Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that had but the Title of <hi>new-faſhion'd</hi> annex'd to it! One common Argument for Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and Luxury of all Kinds, is, that it encourages and ſupports Trade; and that the Bread and Subſiſtence of Thouſands depend on new Faſhions: But thoſe who offer this Reaſon, do not conſider how many, on the contrary, are ruin'd and undone by contributing to what is alledged the Support of Trade; this being ſo manifeſt, eſpecially in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that it needs no other Proof but the Evidence of our Eyes, if we will but look round and conſider how many Families are reduced to Poverty, Wretchedneſs and Miſery, from this very Source Pride, from whence ſprings Luxury, in all its hideous Forms and Shapes. The Diſorder, as a late Writer obſerves, is become <hi>almoſt epidemical,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:006166_0086_1027FDD6560D7260"/>
as the inferior Claſs of People endeavour all in their Power to appear as grand and faſhionable as their Superiors. And when I have conſider'd, how uſual it is for the lower Part of Mankind to be ſway'd by the Example of the higher, I have thought it greatly behoved People of Rank and Condition to exhibit Patterns of Humility, Temperance, Sobriety and Moderation, with every other Chriſtian Virtue, to their Inferiors. But I have heard it objected, that coſtly and ſplendid Apparel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is neceſſary to make and ſupport a proper Diſtinction between Perſons of high and low Degree. The Argument I have thought weak, and unworthy to be offer'd by a Chriſtian, as I am of Opinion, every reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſon will grant that Piety and Virtue (not Gold and tinſel Ornaments) ought to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and render truly honourable the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rank of People. Beſides, it is evident, that theſe Diſtinctions are not kept up and maintain'd by coſtly Attire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for we may daily obſerve, that Perſons of the loweſt Rank, with Reſpect to their Offices and Employments, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very wealthy; and theſe adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in as pompous a Manner, and have as grand Houſes, Furniture, Equipages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe who are greatly ſuperior to them in other Reſpects.</p>
            <p>But allowing many Things the Title of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity and Luxury, and therefore unlawful to be uſed by Chriſtians; it has been queried how are all theſe Faſhion-mongers, who are ſupported by making and vending Things of this Nature, to be provided for, if they ſhould
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:006166_0087_1027FDDA5DB13240"/>
give up their Employments, which you <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> ſay are contrary to Chriſtianity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawful? I would firſt humbly propoſe to People to examine themſelves, and ſee if they are Chriſtians; not nominal, but real Chriſtians; ſuch as are led, ruled, guided and directed, by the Spirit of CHRIST; thoſe who are not, are none of his, whatever they may pretend to; <hi>for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they</hi> (and they only) <hi>are the Children of God.</hi> Theſe will find, that it is not lawful for them to ſupport any Trade, or uſe any Employment, which is inconſiſtent, or claſhes with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and Rules they profeſs to be govern'd by; ſuch are not often at a Loſs for ſome lawful Calling or Buſineſs, whereby they may obtain Food and Raiment, with which they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; Religion has bounded their Deſires, and they greatly experience, that the Happineſs of a Chriſtian's Life does not conſiſt in the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this World's Goods. I have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Clergyman for what I am now going to mention, <hi>viz.</hi> "That all thoſe who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould, in all their Actions, conſequently in their Callings or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Buſineſs, ask themſelves this neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queſtion," Can I do this Thing as a Chriſtian? Or, is it conſiſtent with the Principles and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of my Chriſtian Profeſſion?" And if upon a ſerious and ſincere Examination, we find that the Calling or Employment on which our Bread depends, be in any wiſe contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of CHRIST, and the Example he left us to follow; if it be either directly or indirectly
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:006166_0088_1027FDDD29B1E788"/>
ſo, I believe we are culpable if we don't leave off. For CHRIST tells us, if <hi>our Right Hand offend us,</hi> or cauſe us to act any Thing againſt his Laws, <hi>we muſt cut it off</hi>; we muſt quit whatſoever cauſes this Offence, how near, dear, and uſeful ſoever it be to us, as 'tis <hi>better to enter into Life halt and maimed, than having two Hands to be caſt into Hell-fire.</hi> I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, that what I have here offered will be thought hard Sayings by many; but for our Encouragement our bleſſed Lord aſſures us, <hi>That any One who hath forſaken any temporal Advantage or Enjoyment, as Houſes, Lands, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Wife or Children, Brethren or Siſters, for his Sake and the Goſpel's, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Hundred-fold in this World, and in that to come Life everlaſting. For Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> We have not only an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold of Peace in our Boſoms, <hi>viz.</hi> The Comforts of an upright Conſcience (a greater Bleſſing than any we have parted with) and ſpiritual Bread to eat, which the World knows not of; but our natural Bread is made ſure, and Water fails not; for the Lord oftentimes caſts away the Subſtance of the Wicked, yet he rarely ſuffers the Souls of the Righteous to famiſh. Agreeable to this the royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>I have been young, and now am old, yet have I never ſeen the Righteous forſaken, nor his Seed begging Bread.</hi> And again, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to "truſt in the Lord and do Good, and thou ſhalt dwell in the Land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed," And further, he calls to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:006166_0089_1027FDE01F6A53F0"/>
to fear the Lord, and believe in him; "Believe in him, and he will help thee, and order thy Way aright; fear and truſt in him, and your Reward ſhall not fail." He ſhall ſave them, becauſe they put their Truſt in him; for look at the Generations of old, and ſee, Did ever any truſt in the Lord, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded? Or, did any abide in his Fear, and was forſaken? Or, whom did he ever deſpiſe that call'd upon his Name in Truth, Sincerity and Uprightneſs? But ſuppoſing that Chriſtians, as a Tryal of their Faith, may ſometimes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to great outward Diſtreſs, which may poſſibly be permitted to extend to want of Bread, <hi>&amp;c. yet ſhall Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or Diſtreſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſeparate us</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>from the Love of God?</hi> No ſurely; <hi>Theſe</hi> (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pararively) <hi>light Afflictions, which we ſuffer for a Moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 17. For tho' the ſpiritual Exerciſes, as well as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Troubles of the Righteous, may be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet the Lord delivereth out of them all. And then can we ſay upon the Banks of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, "We will love the Lord our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he having been our Strength and our Shield, and done great Things for us; therefore will we be thankful to his Name, and rejoice in his Power: For who among the Gods (or Idols many make to themſelves) is like unto our God! Let us therefore aſcribe Strength and Power to God; for his Name is glorious in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; he is fearful in Praiſes and a God that has indeed wrought Wonders for us." Thus
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:006166_0090_1027FDE1A93076D0"/>
are we excited to love God, who firſt loved us, and has called us to Glory, which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, as of the Glory of the only begotten Son of God, full of Grace and Truth, of whom we have received Grace for Grace; and having thus ſeen his Glory, our Hearts are overcome with his Beauty, and we endeavour to return in our Meaſure Love for Love, and can now ſay in Truth and Sincerity, <hi>Whom have we in Heaven but thee, and there is nothing that we deſire on Earth in compariſon of thee? Thou art indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the chief among ten Thouſand to our Souls.</hi> Thus the truly Godly love God above all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conſiderations, and in the higheſt Degree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Love of God,</hi> ſays a pious Writer, <hi>is of ſo noble a Nature, that the Mediocrity, which in other Paſſions is an Excellence, is here an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. The Man, after God's own Heart, is not afraid to own to his Maker an Ardency of Love, which he expreſſes by the ſignificant Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor of Thirſt, My Soul is athirſt for God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Other Paſſions like other Rivers, are beſt liked, when they flow within their wonted Banks; but the Love of God, as of the River</hi> Nile, <hi>the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing makes it the more welcome.</hi> The royal Prophet indeed diſcovers often a fervent Love to, and Deſire after, the Enjoyment of God's holy Preſence: So he no leſs eſteemed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; agreeable to what our bleſſed Lord ſaid in After-ages to his Diſciples, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments. I hate,</hi> ſays David, <hi>vain Thoughts, but thy Law do I love; for how ſweet are thy Words to my Taſte? Yea, ſweeter than Honey to my Mouth. I love thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:006166_0091_1027FDE3309AFA58"/>
above Gold, yea, I eſteem them above fine Gold. Thy Teſtimonies have I taken for an Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for they are the rejoicing of my Heart. Thy Teſtimonies are my Delight, and my Counſellers. I delight to do thy Will, O my God! yea, thy Law is within my Heart,</hi> Pſalm cxix. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo delighted in the Law of God after the inner Man: And agreeably, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, in all Ages, decline not from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of his Lips, but eſteem the Words of his Mouth more than neceſſary Food.</p>
            <p>But let none imagine, that tho' it is our Duty to love God with all our Heart, Soul and Strength, above every Conſideration, and with the greateſt Ardency, that this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction claſhes with, or hinders our exerting this Duty of Love in it's full Force in every natural and ſocial Relation; as it is not the ſame Species of Love with which we love God, as that we extend to our Neighbour, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as God is an infinitely perfect Being, and happy in his own Perfections, we cannot add to his Happineſs by wiſhing well to him; therefore we cannot love him with the Love of Benevolence or Beneficence, with which we love our Neighbour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but with the Love of Deſire, deſiring to be with him, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Fulneſs, agreeable to what the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>One Thing have I deſired, and that will I ſeek after, that I may dwell in the Houſe</hi> (or Preſence) <hi>of the Lord forever; to behold the Beauty of the Lord, and to worſhip in his Temple! A religious Soul,</hi> ſays one, <hi>may obey the Command of loving God intirely, tho'
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:006166_0092_1027FDE78D74A420"/>
ſhe allows her Affections other Objects, provided they be kept in a due Subordination, and from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Competition with that Love which ought to be appropriated to God.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> loved God above all earthly Conſiderations, when he refuſed to obey the High Prieſt, who charged him with the other Apoſtles, that they ſhould not teach in the Name of CHRIST: He anſwer'd, and ſaid, <hi>We ought to obey God rather than Man.</hi> Tho' in ſo doing they incurr'd the Diſpleaſure of Men, and were in Danger of loſing not only their Liberty, but even their Lives; nevertheleſs, ſay they, <hi>we cannot but ſpeak the Things which we have ſeen and heard</hi> (and for which Purpoſe we have been imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commiſſion'd by our great Maſter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) viz. <hi>That by us Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preach'd in his Name among all Nations, beginning at</hi> Jeruſalem. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes the greateſt, as well as the moſt fervent Love to God, when he thus queries, <hi>Who</hi> (or what Conſideration) <hi>ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the Love of God in CHRIST JESUS our Lord? Shall Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, or Famine, or Peril, or Sword? No; in all theſe Things we are more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qurors thro' CHRIST, who hath loved us!</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am perſwaded, that <hi>neither Life nor Death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Heights</hi> (of Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) <hi>nor Depths</hi> (of Adverſity) <hi>nor any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhall be able to ſeparate us</hi> (Chriſtians) <hi>from the Love of God.</hi> And indeed thoſe <hi>inferior Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts bear no ſort of Proportion to the ſuperior
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:006166_0093_1027FDEAB38C2EA8"/>
Advantage of ſupreme and heavenly Enjoyments; they being of ſo precious a Nature, enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to court Heaven, at the Rate of renouncing for them all thoſe unmanly Senſualities, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Vanities, for which inconſiderate Mortals are wont to forfeit the Intereſt their Saviour ſo dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſed for them.</hi> And as I have elſewhere ſaid, we may attribute all the ſordid Vices and growing Follies, which the Generality of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple indulge themſelves in, to Inconſideration, as we don't enough examine and compare the fading Enjoyments of this Life, with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Bleſſings of an happy Eternity; if we did, we ſhould ſoon diſcover the great Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and willingly part with all ſinful and tranſitory Pleaſures. And when I have been reflecting that Vice and Luxury, in every Branch of it, abounds not only in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> where I have ſo lately, and ſo frequently, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented this epidemical Diſorder, among People, who nevertheleſs aſſume the Title of Chriſtians, and Diſciples of CHRIST, without rememb'ring, that all who take that ſacred Name upon them, muſt depart from all Iniquity. (CHRIST came to redeem us from all Sin, and to purify to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a peculiar People, zealous of good Works:</hi>) I ſay, when I have obſerved that Vice, Softneſs, Effeminacy and Luxury, of moſt Kinds, has every where ſown its noxious Seeds, which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in moſt Climes or Countries, my Soul ſhrinks at the Thought of the Poſſibility not to ſay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability and Danger (without timely Repentance and Amendment of Life) of careleſs, negligent and voluptuous Sinners, being precipitated from a
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:006166_0094_1027FDEEC6C6ECA0"/>
Life of Eaſe, Security and Diverſion, to a State of endleſs Woe and Miſery! From the Converſation of wanton and gay Companions, to aſſociate with wicked and unhappy Spirits; whoſe melancholy Bemoanings, and bitter Cries and Complaints, will be far different from the melodious Strains of Muſick the Ears of the Voluptious have been accuſtom'd to: Therefore it greatly behoves Sinners to make a ſuitable Preparation for the trying Time of Death, leſt it ſurprize them at unawares; and the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and dreadful Seaſon approach, wherein it will be ſaid to him that is filthy, <hi>Be filthy ſtill.</hi> Thus will Fearfulneſs ſeize the Hypocrite, and Sinners will be aſham'd of the Idols they once delighted in, and then will they caſt the whole Train of them to the Moles, and to the Batts.</p>
            <p>But after all that can be ſaid againſt Pride or Vice, of what Nature ſoever, the ſtrong Man arm'd will keep Poſſeſſion of your Hearts, till you ſuffer a ſtronger than he to enter, and turn him out, and ſpoil his Goods. Thoſe Sins which do lett or hinder your coming to God, will lett, till you permit them to be removed. Every wild Olive-tree of Vice and Folly will grow and flouriſh, till you find it your Intereſt, and a Neceſſity of being ingrafted into the true Vine and Nature of CHRIST, and ſuffer him to lay the Ax of his Power to the Root of the old and corrupt Tree, and then will every Branch of Pride and Wickedneſs fall of courſe. Therefore, as One who has obtain'd Mercy, in having a Sight afforded me, to ſee the Things that make for my everlaſting Felicity, I wou'd

recommend to you to conſider of theſe Things. It was the great Loſs and Diſadvantage, as well as Folly of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they neglected the great Law of Conſideration, which occaſioned the Almighty thus to lament; <hi>O that my People were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter End!</hi> But, further, as I have above occaſionally men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Muſick, which before I had only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered promiſcuouſly, as an Attendant at Balls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall now obſerve, that it was a Science I formerly greatly delighted in, and ſpent much Time, both in the Theory, as well as in the practical Part: But when Religion began to take place in my Heart, I found Muſick ſtood in my Way, and I conſider'd it only as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement, which detain'd me from more ſolid and uſeful Thoughts and Reflections: In ſhort, it became ſo burthenſome to me, that I could not perform any of my airy Leſſons, which had been uſual, as well as pleaſing to me: And on further Conſideration it appears to me to be a merely ſenſual, and not an intellectual Pleaſure (as ſome would fondly aſſert) therefore I quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Study, as well as Practice of it, for what I now eſteem'd a more uſeful, profitable and rational Science, <hi>viz.</hi> The Study and Knowledge of my own Heart, which I have found worth all I knew of the other ſeven. But further, on peruſing the ſacred Writings, I do not remember to have read of one Chriſtian Muſician in all the New-Teſtament: And in reading the Old, it appears that the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> deſcribing the Wantonneſs of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:006166_0096_1027FDF36286DE00"/>
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and enumerating the many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their Luxury, he mentions Muſick as a Mark of Levity and Wantonneſs; <hi>They chant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to the Sound of the Viol, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to themſelves Inſtruments of Muſick like</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; <hi>but they are not grieved for the Affliction of</hi> Joſeph. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> denounces a Woe againſt them; adding, <hi>the Harp, and the Viol, the Tabret, and Pipe, and Wine, are in their Feaſts; but they regard not the Work of the Lord, neither do they conſider the Operation of his Hands</hi>; not being moved with the Calamities of the ſuffering Part of Mankind, ſo long as they can enjoy Eaſe and Plenty.</p>
            <p>And now hear what the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> ſays on the Subject of Muſick. <hi>As for Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, it is well known, that the Ancients believed nothing more pernicious to a well regulated State, than to ſuffer an effeminate Melody to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into it: It enervates Men and renders their Souls ſoft and voluptuous: Languiſhing Strains are only pleaſant, becauſe the Soul gives itſelf up to the Charms of the Senſes; and this,</hi> adds he, <hi>was one of their moſt important Policies.</hi> Plato, in the like Manner, <hi>ſeverely rejects all the ſoft Airs of the</hi> Aſiatick <hi>Muſick; and with much greater Reaſon Chriſtians who never ought to ſeek Pleaſure for Pleaſure's Sake, ought ſurely to have an Averſion for thoſe poiſon'd Allurements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the larger in my Objections on Diverſions and Recreations, which, by moſt Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are conſider'd as innocent Amuſements; as they ſeem to be moſt hurtful and dangerous. Many Inconveniencies, as well as unlawful

Things, creep into the Hearts and Conduct of People, under the ſpecious Title of <hi>Harmleſs Pleaſures. Poole,</hi> in his Annotations on the Bible, tells us, when diſcourſing on the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of earthly Enjoyments, <hi>'Tis to be fear'd, more Souls miſs of Heaven and Happineſs, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging and allowing themſelves in Things deemed lawful, than by committing groſs and enormous Evils; theſe, many ſhrink at with Horror; but thoſe Things conſider'd lawful, which ſometimes becomes circumſtantially unlawful, and Pleaſures term'd innocent, are uſed and embraced without Fear or Caution; and with all their Train of miſchievous Conſequences.</hi> For this Reaſon I have alſo dwelt the longer on Pride in Apparel; yet I am not inſenſible that it appears in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Forms beſides that, or what I am going to mention, <hi>viz.</hi> That all true Chriſtians conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as an Evil, when it diſcovers itſelf in Houſes, Equipages, Furniture, or our Tables: As one who is endued with the Chriſtian Virtue of Humility, diſcovers it in every Action, or Thing, that he has the ordering and conducting of: Always keeping in Memory the Aſſertion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, He that ſtrives for the Maſtery, or runs ſo as to obtain, is temperate in all Things.</hi> And as he is temperate in the Uſe and Enjoyment of the Things of this Life, ſo is a true Chriſtian moderate in his Deſires and Purſuits after worldly Riches and Profits; he makes not Haſte to be rich; his greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and principal Care, agreeable to our Lord's Direction and Advice, is, <hi>Firſt to ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and his Righteouſneſs</hi>; to lay up a
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:006166_0098_1027FDF91203C160"/>
good Foundation againſt the Time to come; a permanent Inheritance, which fadeth not away: And as Heaven is the End of his Hope and Deſires, he is careful to lay up Treaſure there; uſing the periſhing Enjoyments of the Things of this Life, with as little Concern, and as much Indifference, as if he uſed them not, for this great and good Reaſon, "Becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of them paſſeth away.!" On the contrary, how do we obſerve the ſordid Worldling, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing with Eagerneſs, Sollicitude and Warmth, the periſhing Riches of this Life? And, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Oppoſition to our Lord's Precept, they ſeek firſt, and principally, the Things of this World, which he exhorts us not to be greatly anxious or thoughtful about; but to ſuch as ſeek firſt his Kingdom, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, he aſſures us, <hi>all theſe Things</hi> (that are needful for our Support) <hi>ſhall be added.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, when we come to reaſon with People of this Character, who ſo ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and aſſent to the following Truths? "That as we are in this uncertain and paſſing Situation, 'tis great Folly and Stupidity to be over anxious or immoderate in our Purſuits after Wealth, or to be ſo very careful as ſome are, in making large Proviſion for theſe mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; laying up Goods for many Years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have no continuing City here; that 'tis appointed to all Men once to die, and we know not how ſoon we ſhall be ſummon'd to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to render an Account of the Deeds done in thoſe frail Bodies." Yet what has been Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Aſtoniſhment to me, is, that this very
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:006166_0099_1027FDFA98B50ED8"/>
Body, which People profeſs in Words to make ſo little Account of, when they reflect on the Shortneſs of it's Continuance here in this Life, engroſſes the whole Care: "What we ſhall eat, what we ſhall drink, and wherewith ſhall we be cloathed," appears to be the chief Concern of the Generality of Mankind? Not that I think the Body ſhould be excluded from a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and proper Proportion of our Care and Diligence; as it would be abſurd and irrational to ſuppoſe our Bodies can ſubſiſt without ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Care and Proviſion: On the contrary, it is every Man's indiſpenſable Duty, to provide a Subſiſtence for himſelf and his Houſhold; ſuch who do not, are conſider'd by the Apoſtle worſe than <hi>Infidels; having,</hi> by this Neglect, <hi>denied their Faith in CHRIST</hi>; But then let it be a rational, moderate and Chriſtian Care; let the Things appertaining to this Life, have their juſt and proper Place in our Affections; and not rebelliouſly and unnaturally uſurp an Authority Almighty Wiſdom thought fit to inveſt his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Man with, at the Time when he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the Creation, and put it under his Subjection, ſaying, <hi>Have thou Dominion over every living Thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſubdue the Earth.</hi> Here was all ſublunary and earthly Objects pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under our Feet; that the Creatures were, by the Wiſdom and Order of God, placed in Subordination and Subjection to us; to be our Servants, not our Lords (that our Reaſon ſhould rule them, not they govern our Reaſon) which they immediately become, when we make an unlawful and improper Uſe of them; and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:006166_0100_1027FDFDC04A5B28"/>
which we certainly do, when we employ them to fulfil the ſinful Luſts and Vanities of the Fleſh. And further, is it not Matter of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Amazement, Compaſſion and Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to obſerve ſo little Proviſion made for, or Concern employ'd about the immortal Soul, which muſt abſolutely and certainly have an eternal Exiſtence, either in Bliſs or Miſery? And tho' many who pretend to Religion and Virtue, acknowledge that our Felicity conſiſts in rightly knowing, truly loving, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſerving the Supreme Being: And that Obedience, Submiſſion and Reſignation to his divine Will and holy Commands, is the higheſt Point of Wiſdom, and indiſpenſable Duty of all rational Minds; yet how ſmall the Proportion of thoſe who act agreeable to this Confeſſion, to thoſe, by far the greater Number, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately and blindly follow the dark Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their own Wills and Affections? This Conſideration is indeed Subject of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe whoſe Eyes and Underſtandings the Almighty has mercifully opened by the Hand of his divine Power, and aſſiſted by the Light of his Grace, to ſee their own Miſtakes; and has graciouſly afforded his holy Aid and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by which they were enabled to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them.

the Way and Means by which they may eſcape the Pollution of, and Puniſhment due to Sin; and obtain Acceptance with the Almighty, <hi>viz.</hi> "Repentance towards God, Faith in JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, and, by the Aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, a conſtant and conſiſtent Walking in the Paths of Virtue and Holineſs:" For we are not ſo ignorant as not to know, that his Will concerning us, is our Sanctification; And that we may not be led aſtray, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the grand Adverſary of our Soul's Happineſs, our merciful and benign Creator, knowing our Weakneſs and Inability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any good Action, or to reſiſt the leaſt Temptation, by any Strength or Power of our own, without the Inſtruction, Aid and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Almighty Arm, has provided us a Leader and Conductor, who is mighty to ſave, and able to deliver to the Uttermoſt, all who come to him with full Faith in his Power.

To the Truth and Extention of this Light, or Grace of CHRIST's Holy Spirit, in our Hearts, 'this more ſure Word of Prophecy,' the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bears ample Teſtimony, as I have elſewhere noted, in theſe Words; "The Grace of God, that brings Salvation, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all Men, teaching us that denying Ungodlineſs, and the World's Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent World, <hi>Titus</hi> ii. 11, 12.

               <hi>God, who at this Time didſt teach the Hearts of thy faithful People, by ſending to them the Light of thy Holy Spirit; grant us, by the ſame Spirit, to have a right Judgment in all Things; and evermore to rejoice in his holy Comfort.</hi> And in the Litany; <note n="†" place="bottom">Abſolution.</note> 
               <hi>May it pleaſe thee to endue us with the Grace of the Holy Spirit: Let us beſeech God to grant us true Repentance, and his Holy Spirit, that thoſe Things may pleaſe him that we do at preſent, and that the reſt of our Lives may be pure and holy.</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="unknown:006166_0105_1027DAE918C99C90"/>
others abound with Teſtimonies to the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians being led and guided, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Spirit or Grace of God; which we ſometimes expreſs by the Scripture and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Metaphor, of <hi>Light.</hi> Why ſhould this Doctrine, or theſe Terms, be conſidered and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculed as Abſurdities in our Words or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; ſince we underſtand and uſe them in the ſame Senſe and Acceptation, and pray for the Illumination and Aid of the Holy Spirit, for the ſame good Purpoſe, <hi>viz. To give us a right Judgment in all things.</hi> And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an Underſtanding. <hi>We know that he is come by the Gift of his Holy Spirit ſent into our Hearts; which ſhews us all that we do, or ever have done — This is he of a Truth, whom the Prophets and primitive Chriſtians bore Teſtimony to; By his Heart-ſearching Power, we know him; nor can we miſtake him for another: And as he thus knows the Secrets of all Hearts, and will judge them with righteous Judgment, in the Day God has appointed for it; the only Way for us to be happy here, as well as hereafter, is to obey the Dictates of this moſt holy Gift; and refrain from every Thing it reproves for; and we, as well as thoſe in the Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Time, ſhall feel the Peace of God to fill our Hearts and Minds. This Holy Gift therefore is the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which the Apoſtle foreſaw ſome would deny, tho' they retain'd the Form of it: To deny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this influence, is to deny one of the eſſential Benefits of CHRIST's Death and Mediation; for he leading Captivity Captive, that is, the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:006166_0106_1027FE0BEC5FD148"/>
Power of Hell, Death and the Grave, aſcended up on high, and mediated and obtained theſe divine Gifts for Men; and as the Grave could not hold Captive the Body of this holy One, ſo neither can the Heaven of Heavens contain or limit his ſpiritual Influence; by which his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants receive Power, Knowledge and Wiſdom. Men may, with as good a Grace, go about to deny the Influence of the Sun by its Light and Heat, as that of God upon Man. But poor, proud, finite Man, becauſe he cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Mode and Manner of it, would as preſumptuouſly as injuriouſly (to himſelf) deny it. Whereas he can't ſo much as underſtand or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Manner of the natural Sun's emitting its Rays of Light and Heat, tho' he daily ſees and feels the Neceſſity and Benefit of them: How much more ſtupenduouſly ſublime, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible is the Diffuſion of the Holy Spirit! 'tis ſufficient for us finite Creatures, to feel the Effects of it, as we do of the Sun, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the Manner of its Emanation. As the powerful Operation and Motions of God's Spirit, quickening the Heart towards God, are compared to the blowing of the Wind; for as it is by the Wind, Man perceives the Effect of it, that there is ſuch a Thing, and that it does blow; yet his Power cannot reſtrain it; neither can his Reaſon reach to know, whence it riſes, or how far it comes, or how far it reaches. However, it is fit to be obſerved, that God does not act by a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive or compulſive Power; but as he has given Men ſpiritual Gifts, ſo he has given them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Faculties to uſe them, as well as natural

Ones: But if Men will not hear, the Conſequence as naturally follows, as in any other Caſe, God remaining invariably the ſame, and without the leaſt Shadow of turning.</hi> I ſhall now produce another Teſtimony to the Truth of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Spirit in Man, which the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> gives us in the following Words; <hi>By Scripture 'tis certain that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that it acts there, that it prays there continually, that it groans there, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires there; that it asketh for us, what we know not how to ask for ourſelves; that it excites us, animates us, ſpeaks to us in Silence, ſuggeſts all Truth to us, and unites us to itſelf, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one Spirit with God: This is what Scripture teacheth; this is what the Doctors who are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off of inward Life, cannot but acknowledge: And yet, notwithſtanding their Principles, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſee by their Practice, that they ſuppoſe the outward written Law, or; at moſt, a Light drawn from Scripture and Reaſon, to be what enlightens us inwardly; and that it is not our Reaſon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which acts of itſelf by that Inſtruction. Theſe Men ſet not enough by the inward Teacher, the Holy Spirit, who does all in us; he is the Soul of our Souls; we cannot frame a Thought, or create a Deſire, but through him. Alas! how great is our Blindneſs! We make account as if we were by ourſelves in this inward Sanctuary; but, on the contrary, God is there more nearly than we ourſelves are. Perhaps you will ſay to me, What then, are we all inſpired? Yes, without Doubt; but not as the Prophets and Apoſtles were. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the actual Inſpiration of the Spirit of Grace,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:006166_0108_1027FE12A410F0D0"/>
we can neither believe, will, nor do any Good. We are therefore always inſpired; but we ſtifle this Inſpiration continually. God ceaſes not to ſpeak; but the Noiſe and Hurry of Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and our Paſſions within, deafen us, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from hearing Him. We muſt ſilence every Creature, and ourſelves too, to hear in a profound Stillneſs of Soul, the inexpreſſible Voice of Chriſt, the Bridegroom of our Souls. We muſt liſten dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; for 'tis a very ſtill and ſoft Voice, which is not to be heard, but by ſuch as hearken to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. O how ſeldom is the Soul ſilent enough to let God ſpeak! The leaſt whiſper of our vain Deſires, or of Self-love, attentive on Self, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds all the Words of the Spirit of God. We hear plainly what he ſpeaks, and that he asks for ſomething; but we don't perceive what it is; and very often we are contented not to underſtand it. The leaſt Reſerve, the leaſt Regard for Self, the leaſt Fear of underſtanding too plainly, that God asks for more than we care to give Him, diſturbs this inward Voice. Shall we wonder then that ſo many, and even pious Perſons, but full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing Thoughts, vain Deſires, worldly Wiſdom, and Confidence in their own Virtues, can't hear it; but take this inward Voice to be a Chimera of Fanaticks! Alas, what do they mean by ſuch ſcornful Language? To what Purpoſe would the outward Expreſſions of Teachers be, and even of the Scriptures themſelves, if it were not for the inward Voice of the Holy Spirit; which gives the other all its Efficacy. The outward Words of the Goſpel itſelf without this living, efficacious Word within, would be but an empty Sound. 'Tis
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:006166_0109_1027FE1563EC3290"/>
the Letter that killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life. O eternal and All-powerful Word of the Father! 'tis thou who ſpeakeſt in the very Bottom of our Souls. The Words that proceeded out of the Mouth of our Saviour, when upon Earth, had not been productive of ſo much Virtue, and ſo great Fruits, but becauſe they were animated by this Word of Life, which is the Word himſelf. This made</hi> Peter <hi>ſay,</hi> Lord, to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the Words of eternal Life! <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not the exterior Law or Rule of the Goſpel, which God lets us ſee by the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Scripture; 'tis his Spirit that ſpeaks, that teaches, that operates in, and animates us; ſo 'tis the Spirit that worketh in us, both to will and to do what is good; as 'tis our Soul that animates our Body, and regulates its Motions: 'Tis certain therefore that we are all inſpir'd continually; that we live not the Life of Grace, but in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as we partake of this inward Inſpiration. Theſe Poſitions and Principles being laid, it muſt be acknowledged, that God ſpeaks continually in us: He ſpeaks in harden'd and impenitent Sinners; but they being ſtunn'd, as it were, by the Noiſe of the World, and their Paſſions, cannot hear his Voice; 'tis to them a Tale or Fiction: He ſpeaks in penitent Sinners, they feel a Remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that Remorſe is the Voice of God, which reproaches them inwardly for their Sins: When theſe Sinners are effectually reached and ſmitten, they find no Difficulty in underſtanding this ſecret Voice; for 'tis that which ſmites them ſo ſharply; 'tis in them the</hi> Two-edged Sword <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks of,</hi> which divides aſunder Soul

and Spirit. <hi>God makes himſelf to be felt, taſted, and obeyed: They hear this ſoft Voice, which gently ſmites them in the very Secret of their Heart, and the Heart is tendered, and broken; and that is true Contrition: God ſpeaks in enlightened and learned Perſons, whoſe Lives are to Appearance, exact and regular; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly theſe Perſons being full of themſelves, hearken too much to themſelves, to hear God; they reaſon upon every Thing, and do all by Rules and Principles of human Wiſdom and Prudence; which would be much better done thro' Simplicity, and a Docility to the Teaching of God's Spirit: Such as theſe appear to have more Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than others; and they have, in a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; but then it is a mixed Goodneſs; they are great and big in themſelves, and value themſelves in Proportion to their Capacity and Reaſon; they are always ſway'd by their own Counſel, and ſtrong in their own Eyes and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. O my God, I thank thee with</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>that thou hideſt theſe Secrets from the Wiſe and Prudent in their own Eyes, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeſt them with Pleaſure to weak and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Souls! 'Tis only Children thou art familiar with; Children in Malice, and every other Vice; but behaveſt towards others in their own Way: They will have Knowledge, and other ſplendid Virtues; thou giveſt them ſhining Parts, and makeſt them a ſort of Heroes; but this is not the beſt Portion; there is ſome thing more hidden for thy dear Children; they lean, as</hi> John <hi>the beloved Diſciple did, upon thy Boſom.</hi> If theſe Arguments, drawn from a ſenſible Experience
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:006166_0111_1027FE191B769FD8"/>
and Feeling of God's Operation in the Soul, convince not the Reader; if he be not one of thoſe who think to have eternal Life by the Scriptures; yet will not come to CHRIST, that they may have Life; he would do well to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and ſee, if he is not in the State the Author himſelf once was in; ſeeking for God without, and never think to find him within, <hi>I tried,</hi> ſays he, <hi>by collecting in my Mind all the wonderful Works of Nature, to frame an Idea of thy Grandeur; I ſought thee among thy Creatures, and did not think of finding Thee in my own Heart; where thou art never abſent. Conſider theſe Things, my Soul, and ſhut the Door of thy ſenſual Deſires, that thou mayſt hear what God the Lord ſpeaks; and with the Prophet</hi> Samuel <hi>ſay,</hi> Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth. <hi>Let not</hi> Moſes, <hi>nor any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſpeak; but do Thou rather ſpeak, O Lord God, the Inſpirer and Enlightener of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets! for Thou, alone, without them, canſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtruct me; but they, without Thee, can profit nothing. They ſound forth Words, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give Spirit; they ſpeak well, but if Thou be ſilent, they inflame not the Heart; they teach the Letter, but Thou openeſt the Senſe; they bring forth Myſteries, but Thou unlockeſt the Meaning of them; they declare Thy Commandments, Thou helpeſt us to fulfil them; they ſhew the Way, Thou giveſt Strength to walk in it; they act outwardly upon us, but Thou enlightens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the Heart; they water, but Thou giveſt the Increaſe; they ſtrike the Ear with Words, Thou giveſt Underſtanding to the Heart.</hi>

               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:006166_0112_1027FE1E5E107CC8"/>Thus, my dear Fellow-mortals, I would hope by this Time you are all ſenſible that you have a Portion of Grace or Light, which has manifeſted Sin and Folly to you ſometimes in the Cool of the Day, when you have been a little ſequeſter'd from your Diverſions; liſten then, I beſeech you, to its Voice; it will ſpeak, as I ſaid before, as never Man did; it will tell you all you have done, and continue to reprove when you do amiſs. This is the Voice of that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> told the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> would be raiſed up amongſt them;
<q>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your Brethren like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all Things. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will not hear this Prophet, he ſhall be cut off from among the People,</q>
               <hi>Acts</hi> iii. 22. Hearken, I beſeech you, to his Voice; receive him in his ſpiritual Appearance; kiſs the Son while he offers his Grace, leſt he be angry, and cut you off in the great Sin of Unbelief, in his Power to cleanſe you from all Unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I don't purpoſe to particularize or conſider ſingly every Sin the corrupt Nature of Man is liable to; yet as there have ſeveral Iniquities occurred to me which I have noticed, ſo I ſhall, as it now preſents to my Underſtanding, make a brief Obſervation on that black and cruel One, of Detraction, eſpecially as I have often obſerved how many fall into this Miſchief inconſiderately, without thinking it of ſo cruel and evil a Nature as it really is, this noxious Weed being the Product of moſt Countries, I can't forbear putting you in Remembrance how
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:006166_0113_1027FE226F303EF8"/>
many able Pens have been employed, to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it, by Reaſons and Arguments, ſufficient abundantly to convince us of its hurtful Nature, and give as a juſt Abhorrence of it; as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to our Neighbour ſeldom fails to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil upon our ſelves at one Time or other; for he that diggeth a Pit ſhall fall into it, and he that rolleth a Stone, it ſhall return upon him. And as I have noted, this Vice has been expoſed to the World long ago, in its hideous Forms and cruel Conſequences, I don't here preſume to think myſelf capable of painting it in more gloomy and diſagreeable Shapes than others have done. What I would remark is, That it is to be feared many don't peruſe carefully the Scriptures, and other Books, on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Moral, as well as Chriſtian Virtues; or at leaſt do not ſufficiently conſider them; for did we but rightly and juſtly reflect on this Precept of CHRIST's, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf,</hi> One would think it might be ſufficient to prevent the Mouth of Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Infamy and Detraction, from ever being open'd; and were there but Room for this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in any Interval of ſuch Converſation, how wou'd it ſilence all Uncharitableneſs! CHRIST mentions our <hi>Love to God</hi> in the firſt Place, and in the ſuperlative Degree; and in the next, <hi>Love</hi> (or Charity) <hi>to our Neighbour, as the two</hi> (moſt material) <hi>Commandments</hi> (or Points) <hi>on which depends the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> And he has left us this Injunction, which is ſtiled <hi>the golden Rule,</hi> and ought to be an inviolable One, "Whatſoever ye would
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:006166_0114_1027FE253B649700"/>
that Men ſhould do unto you, do you even the ſame to them." And on another Occaſion he adds, "A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another." And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> recommends to the <hi>Romans</hi> the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Commandment in theſe Words "Owe no Man any Thing, but to love one another; Love worketh no Ill to his Neighbour; therefore Love is the fulfilling of the Law." And after enumerating the Laws of the ſecond Table, he ſubjoins, "If there be any other Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is briefly comprehended in this, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf." But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another." The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tells the Believers, if they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd the royal Law according to the Scripture, "Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf, ye do well." And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> giving the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi> a Catalogue of the Fruits or Sins of the Fleſh, among others he mentions "Backbiting, Envy, Whiſpering, Malice, Emulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>" And he exhorts the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to put away "all Bitterneſs, Wrath, Clamour and Evil-ſpeaking, with all Malice; and be ye kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God for CHRIST's Sake hath forgiven you." And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> dehorting Chriſtians from the Breach of Charity, ſpeaks after this Manner; "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying aſide all Malice, Guile, Hypocriſy, Envy, and all Evil-ſpeaking, by which you will become as new born Babes (innocent and pure) fitted to recive (or deſire) the ſincere Milk
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:006166_0115_1027FE280BA81D98"/>
of the Word, that ye may grow thereby." And next let us obſerve, how that St. <hi>Paul</hi> exalts this Love to God, and Charity (or Love) to our Neighbour, above all other Gifts and Virtues: "Tho' I ſpeak with the Tongue of Men or Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal. Tho' I have the Gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Myſteries and Knowledge; tho' I have Faith, ſo as to remove Mountains, and have not Charity, I am nothing. And tho' I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and tho' I give my Body to be burned and have not Charity (if I don't give and ſuffer from this Principal of Love to God and my Neighbour) it profiteth me nothing. Charity or Love ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth long, and is kind; Charity envieth not (the Happineſs of another) Charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own (Honour or Reputation) is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no Evil, rejoiceth not in Iniquity, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth in the Truth, or (when any act agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Goſpel of CHRIST) beareth all Things, believeth all Things, (all the Good it hears, or can have any charitable Grounds to think of others) hopeth all Things (that if our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is bad he may mend) endureth all Things (patiently) as all Things work together for Good to them that love God. This Charity never faileth; but whether there be Prophecies they ſhall fail; whether there be Tongues they ſhall ceaſe; whether there be Knowledge it ſhall vaniſh away. And now abideth Faith,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:006166_0116_1027FE2993437138"/>
Hope and Charity, but the greateſt of theſe is Charity," as it will continue when Faith ſhall end in Viſion, and Hope in Enjoyment. And now permit me to recommend to you a ſerious Peruſal of theſe, as well as other Paſſages of the Holy Records, which were written for our Learning and Inſtruction: And amongſt many which I might mention, who has wrote againſt the Sin of Detraction, there is one in the Collection called <hi>The Lady</hi>'s <hi>Library,</hi> worth peruſing, as the Arguments ſeem founded on Chriſtian Principles and Doctrines, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning obvious and convincing. But ſuffer me now, without Offence, to mention a Thought I have often had, when I have been reflecting on this Fault in both Sexes. As I endeavour to cheriſh a more charitable Opinion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, than to think any Perſon can delight in Evil ſimply as Evil; and I would fain hope few are of ſo cruel a Diſpoſition, as to receive a Pleaſure in hearing the Errors and Miſcarriages of their Neighbours related. And if any be guilty of the ſame Fault, or any other, our Brother may be charged with, the Company of others in Evil, will by no Means extenuate our Crime, or render ſuch leſs culpable in the Sight of God, or leſs odious to good Men: But, on the contrary (if I may be allow'd the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) the Confederacy againſt Heaven is the more ſtrengthen'd by the Number of its Enemies; yet tho' they join Hand in Hand, they ſhall not go unpuniſhed: However, I have put the Conduct of People of this Character on a more charitable and favourable Bottom; for I
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:006166_0117_1027FE2C618CC2A8"/>
have conſider'd, that theſe ſort of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or rather Conſpiracies, againſt our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Fame, proceed from a Defect of that ſolid Nouriſhment the Author I have before cited ſeems to recommend. And I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought, that it is our Ignorance of other Matters, and better Subjects, which occaſions our Neighbour's Conduct to be ſo frequently the Topick of our Converſations; but I wou'd not be here underſtood to call in queſtion the Capacities of either Sex, and wou'd only deſire the Liberty of giving a Caution againſt the Miſapplication of your Talent or Talents. This appears to me to be the Fault, People's employing their Faculties ſo much, not only on vain, and trifling Subjects, but frequently on pernicious and hurtful Things, ſo that they have no Room nor Leiſure to attend to more uſeful and important Subjects; and as I have ſaid, that tho' we may not be chargeable with the ſame Fault our Neighbour may be guilty of, yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, "All Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have ſinned, and fallen ſhort of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God," and therefore all who have not yet ſincerely repented and amended their Ways, have need of Repentance and Forgiveneſs. But if any commit an Evil, how are Chriſtians to act in ſuch a Circumſtance? Are we to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, blacken and defame our Brother, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in his Miſcarriage? No ſurely; the Goſpel of CHRIST and his Miniſters teach other Things.</p>
            <p>"Brethren, if any be overtaken with a Fault, you that are ſpiritual (endeavour to) reſtore him;" How? "In the Spirit of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:006166_0118_1027FE30B6AA4340"/>
conſidering, leaſt thou thyſelf be alſo tempted," let his Miſcarriage excite our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards him, and Caution towards our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and bear ye one another's Burthen's, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt, "Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thyſelf;" and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we call in Queſtion our Neighbour's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, let us remember we are firſt to be ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ourſelves, walking in all God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments blameleſs: And agreeable to the Doctrines and Principles of Chriſt, let us firſt pull the Beam out of our own Eye, and then ſhall we ſee clearly to take the Mote from our Brother's. And when we are converted then ſhall we be fitted to ſtrengthen our Brethren: Thus the royal Pſalmiſt petitions the Almighty, "Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew a right Spirit within me: Then will I teach Tranſgreſſors thy ways, and Sinners ſhall be converted to Thee."</p>
            <p>I ſhall now mention another particular Evil, not only as I find it greatly blam'd by others, but as it has often been Subject of Concern to me when I have obſerv'd this unnatural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which relates only to the Female Part of the World, ſo juſtly chargeable on them: But which I would charitably hope they have not yet many of them ſeen, or at leaſt reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the great Miſchief it produces, both to themſelves, and their Offspring. The Fault I mean, is Neglect of Duty, and natural Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our helpleſs Infants, which is ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at their firſt Appearance in Life, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them that Nouriſhment Nature has provided
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:006166_0119_1027FE33865CE800"/>
for them, and by framing ſome inſignificant Excuſe, forſake and leave them to others. This inhumane Treatment of our tender little Ones, I can't help thinking has its Foundation in Pride Natural Affection to our Offspring ſeems blended with our very Conſtitution; and it appears to me we muſt uſe uncommon Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ſeparate it from our Make. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Effects of Pride! what Miſchief is there that it is not productive of! Even a few Weeks after our tender Babe beholds the Light, leſt it ſhould occaſion us ſome extraordinary Trouble and Care, or prevent ſome little Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in our Shape or Dreſs, or detain us from making unedifying and impertinent Viſits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we conſign the poor Innocent into the Hands of a Stranger, to be foſter'd by Women, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, of ſavage Tempers, and vile Affections, which ſome are of Opinion the Infant imbibes with its Milk; tho' I can't conceive this, as I apprehend we are not Sinners by Conſtitution, but Corruption. However, it is manifeſt, and often happens, that the Child imbibes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Conſtitution from its Nurſe: And, 'tis the Opinion of ſome, that the Death of many an Infant (in other Places at leaſt) may be chargeable on their Parents, on this Score; as alſo when the Nurſe proves careleſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in her Office; and that this has been frequently the Caſe, few will deny: For how can we reaſonably expect that a Stranger ſhou'd take that due and tender Care, and faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſo troubleſome an Office, which a Parent, ſuppos'd to have a natural Engagement for her
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:006166_0120_1027FE350E660130"/>
Infant, declines and refuſes, for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take upon her. I, who am a Parent, have been fill'd with Aſtoniſhment at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and Compaſſion towards the Child, when I have beheld the delicate Mother ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd and unrelenting, at the Time her little Offspring has been uttering its tender Complaints, and, as it were, petitioning the obdurate Parent with its little eloquence of Tears for its own Support, provided by Nature, without her Care or Trouble. Dr. <hi>Whitby,</hi> in ſome Obſervations on Things natural, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and illuſtrate his Subject, has theſe Words;
<q>'Tis natural, <hi>ſays he,</hi> for a Woman to ſuckle her Infant, becauſe Nature has furniſh'd her with proper and ſuitable Means of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that Purpoſe.</q>
But had that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor lived till this Day; he had poſſibly been told Nature had changed her Order, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally with-held and deny'd the common Means. It has often been Subject of Reflection to me, when I have obſerved that Women pretend they are ſo univerſally diſabled, that they are incapable of taking upon them this tender Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and diſcharging the natural Obligation of Suckling their Children. The general Plea is, want of Milk, or Tenderneſs of Conſtitution, which renders them unfit to take upon them ſo troubleſome an Office: But as often as I have obſerved, examin'd, and traced ſuch Pretences and Excuſes for this Cruelty, I have found (except in ſome few Inſtances) they abſolutely center in Pride and Self-love. But I only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by this ſhort remark, to remind ſome,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:006166_0121_1027FE38104E5100"/>
and inform others, that this unnatural Conduct has been juſtly condemn'd by Arch-biſhop <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon,</hi> to whoſe Diſcourſes, on the Education of Children, I would refer you. However, he (as well as others) does not propoſe Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to any; On the contrary, he goes far in admitting real and reaſonable Pleas and Excuſes; but where none of theſe appear, he is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, 'tis every Woman's indiſpenſible Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to nouriſh her Infant at her own Breaſt. His Arguments are bro't from Nature, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon; and I heartily wiſh every Parent, in this Circumſtance, and of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, may peruſe them impartially and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly; and that they may have the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of reſtoring that natural Affection and Tenderneſs, in the Female Part of the World, which has been ſo long loſt. And before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Obſervation, I ſhall tranſcribe a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from a Pamphlet lately printed in <hi>London,</hi> entitled, <hi>Britain's Remembrancer</hi>; wherein the Author (whom I have heard is a Nobleman) propoſes a Method for improving the preſent unhappy Situation of the Nation and Kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; and ſhews that the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they are involved in, are the Effects of the Vices and Irreligion which prevail among the Inhabitants; againſt whom he brings a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Charge: And then in a particular Addreſs to the Women, he takes the Liberty of telling them, That no ſmall Share of the national Guilt is chargeable on their Account, as, ſays he,
<q>You have given up yourſelves to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Theatrical and Muſical Entertainments,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:006166_0122_1027FE3C0EFF7E28"/>
to the neglect not only of all that is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and ſacred, but alſo of thoſe Domeſtick Cares which are your proper Province. The unavoidable Effect of a conſtant Purſuit of theſe publick Diverſions, muſt be intirely to pervert your Minds from what is the only natural Sphere of Womankind, and what they were originally intended for, by the Ordination of Heaven; who form'd you for the plain and homely, but neceſſary and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Characters, of a Wife and a Mother; and that all the various Ornaments of Pride, which fill a Woman's fantaſtick Brain, and disfigure the native Beauties of her Perſon; and all the giddy Hours ſhe paſſes in a Round of guilty Follies, falſely called Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Diverſion, tend to make her more unfit for what Nature deſign'd her. And whenever you aim at any thing elſe, than to be dutiful Daughters, loving Wives, tender Mothers, prudent Miſtreſſes of Families, faithful Friends, and pious Chriſtians, you aim at ſomething quite out of Nature, and beſide the Intention of Heaven in making you rational Creatures. Will <hi>Vauxhall</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you in Oeconomy and Frugality? Or <hi>Ranelagh's</hi> in the domeſtick Arts that make Families happy? Will the bombaſtick Rant of the Play-houſe furniſh you with Maxims of Prudence? Or its obſcene Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſtore your Minds with the Graces of Modeſty and Virtue? How long muſt you die away to the ſoft Strains of Muſick, or ſtudy theatrical Excellencies of Stage-heroes,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:006166_0123_1027FE3F05EFDDF0"/>
before you will be the fitter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions for Men of Senſe? How long muſt you practice curling the Hair, fluttering your Fans, and overloading your Perſons with falſe Ornaments, before your Converſation will be ever new, and ever entertaining to a Husband of Knowledge and Worth.</q>
This, and much more to the ſame Effect, ſays that noble Author, to whom I refer you; and ſhall only add what he propoſes in general as the beſt Expedient to improve the preſent Juncture of Affairs, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>That every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual endeavour to reform One.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſometimes had a Concern on my Mind to recommend to your Conſideration, the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Duty you owe to your Children in another Reſpect beſide that I have mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The Obligation every Parent is under to manifeſt an eſpecial Regard for the future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Souls of their Children, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Care in their Education: But I have been diſcouraged from offering my Sentiments on this Subject, when I conſider the little Care and Regard too many Parents have for their own Souls, whoſe future Well-being appears to be much diſregarded by many, tho' profeſſing Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I don't purpoſe to ſay much on this Subject; yet think proper to offer a few things to your Conſideration, which tho' they may perhaps appear trifling to ſome at firſt Sight, yet I have ſometimes thought them of greater Conſequence, than I apprehend many others do. That Errors in the firſt Principles of Education (as well as
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:006166_0124_1027FE408E5B2FA8"/>
in other Caſes) are dangerous and pernicious, is a received Maxim; for if we ſet out with wrong Means to obtain a deſired End; we have not only loſt our Time, but with great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Labour muſt unlearn our firſt Rules and Leſſons. Upon reflecting on the Appearances of Anger and Reſentment, which we find ſo early and ſo often glow in the little tender Breaſts of Infants, and the early Propenſities we obſerve in them to Pride, and a Fondneſs for Trifles; it has appeared to me, they may be often attributed to the ill Example of Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Errors in their Management from their Infancy, as young Children we know common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imitate and act from the Example of their Parents, or thoſe concern'd in the Care and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of them. To ſay little of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Ornaments of Lace, Lace-work, and Ribbands, which the Infant is adorn'd with, as ſoon as it comes into the World, as well to pleaſe and gratify the Mother's and Nurſe's Vanity, as that it may be admir'd by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and ceremonious Viſitors; as ſoon as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is capable of the leaſt Notice, it is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſented with a Number of fooliſh Toys, which, tho' ſome, ſuitably choſen, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give them an Idea of natural Things, yet I have thought there are many Trifles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and recommended to them as Things of Value and Worth, which lead them afterwards to entertain a Fondneſs for Vanities and Toys, that are more expenſive and hurtful. By this Time, ſome little Dawning of Reaſon begins to appear in the Child, Care is taken to inculcate
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:006166_0125_1027FE43A1E7A448"/>
the Principles of Anger and Malice, Reſentment and Revenge, as the Child is inſtructed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every little Contradiction, as an Injury or Affront, which he is to revenge, by giving the Nurſe the Blow to execute on the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. Next comes in Courſe, to amuſe the Child, a String of idle abſurd Sonnets and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, which, as ſoon as it is liſping Tongue is able to form Words, it is taught to repeat. The next Inſtruction is, in a Catalogue of vain, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Stories, a Relation of Fairy Tales, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Giants, Tom Thumbs, and ſuch like Stuff, are the young and tender Brains and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of Infants ſtor'd with; as proper Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to fit them for, and introduce more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Lies and Romances. The next Thing Children are early inſtructed in, is Rule and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by teaching, and allowing them a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority over Servants. A Servant tho' never ſo judicious and capable of knowing what is fit and convenient for a Child, is nevertheleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by many Parents from keeping Children in Subjection and Order, or croſſing and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing their Will in any Circumſtance; this manifeſtly teacher the Child a Leſſon of Self-will, which many never unlearn all their Lives after. The next Cruelty we are guilty of to our Children, is Flattery (at the ſame Time by Example or Precept teaching them many little and mean Artifices and equivocal Turns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a rational and generous, to ſay nothing of a Chriſtian Mind) this is commonly practiſed both by Parents and Servants, by whom Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are inſtructed, when adorn'd with all the
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:006166_0126_1027FE467848FB38"/>
Pomp and Vanity within the Parent's Reach, to ſet an high Value and Eſtimation on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on the Score of their fine Clothes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the Perfections of their Bodies, and at the ſame time they are taught to deſpiſe others, by perſwading them they are both finer and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomer than ſome others. And now to finiſh and compleat a modern Education, it requires the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Accompliſhments, <hi>viz.</hi> To be expert in Dreſs and Dancing, Ombre or Gaming in general, to be able to make judicious Remarks on Opera Airs, and ſtage Plays, and to repeat much of the Ribaldry and Prophanity they learn from thence, and reading Romances and other perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Books. Add to all this the Art of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting, where after thoſe preſent are much flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd and complimented; the Abſent, on the contrary, are as ungenerouſly dealt with, and ſeverely handled. But with reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Education of Children, we do not find many Parents employ much of their Time in giving Children an Idea of the Supreme Being, ſuitable to their Underſtanding; and as far as their little Capacities will admit, inſtruct and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Principles of moral and Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: On the contrary, the Generality of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſeem to think they have ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their religious Duty, if they are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful their Children are taught to repeat the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Catehiſm contains; and in the ſame Manner ſay over a Set of Words, entitled, <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Children</hi>; which they neither do nor can underſtand, at the Age they are taught them; and which I can't but conſider as great Impiety
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:006166_0127_1027FE4A842F78E0"/>
and Irreverence in both Parents and School-miſtreſſes, when they teach Children to ſpeak Words, they do not underſtand, to an Infinite Being; of which they, at the Time they are taught them, can have no competent Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo as to enable them to addreſs Him at all; much leſs in the Terms commonly put into their Mouths. The Time I am confin'd to, would fail to enumerate every Inſtance the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Parents are culpable in, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Injuries they inadvertently and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately do their Children, in their Infancy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I can't without a ſeeming Abſurdity, put them in Mind of the Juſtice they owe their Children, when, with Concern, I obſerve ſo many fail in the Juſtice they owe themſelves, by the apparent Neglect of their own Souls. I deſire them to permit me to recommend to each of their ſerious Conſiderations, the ineſtimable Worth and Value of your own immortal Souls, as well as thoſe of your Children: <hi>For what is a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall he give in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul? No Man can give to God a Ranſom for it, ſeeing the Redemption is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, that it ceaſeth forever,</hi> (Pſal. xlix. 7.) when once it is loſt. 'Twould be an inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Happineſs, were every one ſenſible of this Truth; there would be then Hope that they would enter upon the great and neceſſary Work our Lord recommends; that is, 'Firſt that our own Tree be made good, and then the Fruit, it will neceſſarily produce, will be good alſo:' And when we find a Neceſſity of doing Juſtice
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:006166_0128_1027FE4C0C599B18"/>
to ourſelves, in the great Duty and Care of our Souls, we ſhall, I am certain, feel a very ſtrong and ſenſible Concern for the real Happineſs of our Offspring. Whether the Education I have been above deſcribing, is agreeable to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, I leave all Parents, in their ſerious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to conſider; and proceed with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on the Time called <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi>; which being ſo lately obſerved here, occaſioned me to purſue a Reflction I have heretofore had at ſuch Seaſons. I ſhall firſt mention an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Alexander Cruden</hi>'s, a Clergyman (if I miſtake not) After he has given us a Catalogue of the Feſtivals obſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> he adds; <hi>In the Chriſtian Church, we have no Feſtivals that appear to have been inſtituted by</hi> CHRIST <hi>or his Apoſtles: Nevertheleſs Chriſtians have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways celebrated the Memory of</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and kept this Feaſt on every Firſt-day of the Week; which was called the Lord's-Day, ſo early as in St.</hi> John's <hi>Time: I was (ſays</hi> John) <hi>in the Spirit on the Lord's day.</hi> However, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not here to enquire how, or when, this, or any other Feaſt, came to be introduc'd among Profeſſors of Chriſtianity; but only briefly to ſay, Thoſe who obſerve Days and Times, ſhould, as they profeſs, obſerve them to the Lord. You have a pretty large Account (in <hi>Luke</hi>) how the Birth of the holy Child JESUS, was uſhered in. <hi>There were</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Shepherds abiding in the Fields of</hi> Judea, <hi>near unto the Town of</hi> Bethlehem; <hi>watching their Flocks by Night. And lo the Angel of God came upon them, and the Glory of the Lord ſhone round them; and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:006166_0129_1027FE4ED202BF90"/>
they were ſore afraid: And the Angel ſaid unto them, Fear not, for behold I bring you glad Tidings of great Joy which ſhall be to all People: For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you this Day is born, in the City of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour, which is called</hi> CHRIST <hi>the Lord. And ſuddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of heavenly Hoſts, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory to God in the higheſt! on Earth Peace, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to Men! Then ſaid the Shepherds, Let us now go to</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and ſee the Thing which is now come to paſs, and which the Lord hath made known unto us; and when they had ſeen the Child, they made known the Saying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and they that heard, wondered at the Things that were told them by the Shepherds; who returned glorifying and praiſing God, for all the Things they had heard and ſeen, as it was told them by the Angel: And when eight Days were accompliſhed for the circumciſing the Child, they called his Name</hi> JESUS [a Saviour] <hi>which was ſo named of the Angel before he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb</hi>; for this Reaſon, <hi>becauſe he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> Here are Glad-tidings of great Joy to all People, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with the greateſt Solemnity; <hi>For behold ſuddenly a great Multitude of heavenly Hoſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with the Angel, praiſing God</hi> for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to Men; by introducing the Means of Peace on Earth, as God is, in CHRIST recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto Himſelf; and blotting out the <hi>Hand-writing</hi> that was againſt them, <hi>nailing it to the Croſs</hi>; and putting Mankind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Capacity of Salvation. And next good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> who it appears, had been waiting
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:006166_0130_1027FE51E38283E0"/>
for the <hi>Conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> celebrated the Birth of CHRIST on this wiſe, <hi>Lord now letteſt Thou thy Servant depart in Peace, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation, which Thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared before the Face of all People: A Light to enlighten the</hi> Gentiles; <hi>and to be the Glory of thy People</hi> Iſrael! Then <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs, coming into the Temple, <hi>gave Thanks likewiſe unto the Lord, and ſpake of</hi> CHRIST <hi>to all them that looked for Redemption in</hi> Iſrael. And next we may obſerve how the wiſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> behaved on this Occaſion, when they came from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> twelve Days after the Birth of our Lord: Theſe Men tho' they were <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and conſidered Him as a temporal King (as well as a ſpiritual Saviour) yet approach Him with no loud and clamorous Acclamations of noiſy and frantic Joy; no Drums, Trumpets, nor Fiddles; but when they came into the Houſe and ſaw him, proſtrating themſelves, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him.</p>
            <p>And now I would beg Leave to ask the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, if they, on theſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, act conſiſtently with themſelves, who tell us their Times call'd Holy-days are more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſet apart for pious Purpoſes; are they then agreeable to this Deſign employ'd in an Enquiry, whether you have any rational Ground to hope you have an Intereſt in the Saviour, whoſe Birth you profeſs to commemorate? Do you examine whether your Practice keeps Pace with your Profeſſion? Do you live a Life of Humility and Holineſs, agreeable to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple our holy Pattern recommends to our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:006166_0131_1027FE54B96D9D48"/>
who was holy, harmleſs, and undefiled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from Sin, and Sinners? Or, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, are not theſe Times conſider'd, by moſt People, no otherwiſe than Seaſons of Mirth and Jollity? And, as ſuch, are they not chiefly ſpent, by Profeſſors themſelves, in Feaſting, and Dancing, Gaming, Jeſting and Wantonneſs; not conſidering the Work our Lord came to accompliſh, neither do they regard the Hand of Power that would ſave them! And among the inferior Claſs of People, what but one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Scene of Drunkenneſs, Riot, Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Madneſs, appears to every common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver? 'Twould be much more beneficial, <hi>That the Husbandman ſhould till his Grounds, and the Artiſt follow'd or work'd at his Trade, than that they ſhould be thus idle, or, what is worſe, doing wickedly on theſe Occaſions, when, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of wicked Works they crucify afreſh the Lord of Life and Glory, and put him to open Shame!</hi> I would once more ask both Profeſſors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, whether Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in theſe Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, can poſſibly have any juſt Title to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name of Chriſtianity, while they act in direct Oppoſition to the Nature of it? And whether this, and ſuch like Converſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST? Examine, I beſeech you, theſe Things ſeriouſly, and ſolidly; and I dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, you will find, with me (who was once in the Obſervation of Time, <hi>&amp;c</hi>) that all ſuch Rejoicing is Evil; And that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and Feaſts, in the Manner you obſerve them, are an Abomination to the Lord, yea his Soul loaths them!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:006166_0132_1027FE58C79D2860"/>I have before told you, that it was not my Intention to examine and conſider every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tranſgreſſion the Controverſy of God is againſt, yet I ſhall briefly mention the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Sins the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives us, and which he ſays are the Fruits of the Fleſh, and while People continue to produce ſuch Fruit, they cannot poſſibly have an Entrance adminiſter'd to them into the Kingdom of God,
<q>Now, (ſays he) the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, which are Theſe, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Idolatry, Witchcraft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like.</q>
And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> "vi. 10. he adds,
<q>Theft, Covetouſneſs, Reviling, Extortion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which (ſays he) I have told you in Time paſt, that they which do ſuch Things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</q>
And in the firſt of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> he deſcribes ſuch as did not like to retain God in their Knowledge, by theſe Marks or Characters
<q>That they were fill'd with all Unrighteouſneſs, as Fornication, Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Covetouſneſs, Maliciouſneſs, Full of Envy, Murder, Debate, Deceit, Malignity, that they were Whiſperers, Backbiters, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, Deſpiteful, proud Boaſters, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of evil Things, Diſobedient to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, without Underſtanding, Covenant-breakers, without natural Affection, impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable and unmerciful.</q>
And to make the Contraſt or Oppoſition of ſuch Thing to the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:006166_0133_1027FE5A4F48CBC8"/>
Spirit of Chriſtianity the more apparent and obvious, he immediately oppoſes the Works or Fruits, which the Spirit of CHRIST produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his People, who follow its Leadings and Directions:
<q>But the Fruit of the Spirit, is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telneſs, Goodneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, <hi>Galations</hi> v. 22. And the Wiſdom which is from above, (or from God) is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocriſy, <hi>James</hi> iii. 17.</q>
After the Apoſtle had been ennumerating the Sins of the Gentiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whch had been prevalent among them before their Converſion to the Chriſtian Faith; <hi>Such</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in time paſt were ſome of you</hi>; and he tells the Epheſians <hi>you hath Chriſt quicken'd, who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins; wherein, in Time paſt ye walked, according to the Courſe</hi> (or Cuſtoms) <hi>of this World, according to the Power of the Prince of the Air; the Spirit that worketh now in (the Hearts of) the Children of Diſobedience, among whom alſo we had our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the Luſts of our Fleſh; fulfilling the Deſires of the Fleſh, and of the Mind: But God, who is rich in Mercy, even when we were dead in Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath quicken'd us together in Chriſt Jeſus, and made us ſit together in heavenly Places.</hi>"</p>
            <p>And now it ſeems fit we ſhould examine how this great and glorious Work was brought about and effected, <hi>viz.</hi> by a Reſurrection from the Death of Sin to a Life of Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:006166_0134_1027FE5D34A86860"/>
which this ſame Apoſtle tells us, was (and is) done <hi>by the waſhing of Regeneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi> (Power) <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (in the Heart) <hi>But now are ye waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the Name of the Lord</hi> JESUS, <hi>and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Hence we may obſerve, that theſe Believers, who were in Time paſt Sinners, are now, by the ſanctifying Power of CHRIST, and Obedience to the Faith deliver'd, become Saints; agreeable to what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Chriſtian Churches, <hi>Your Bodies</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, which is in you,</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 19. The <hi>Epheſians</hi> were <hi>Fellow-citizens with the Saints, and Houſhold of God.</hi> The Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Philippians</hi> was in Heaven. The <hi>Colloſſians</hi> were <hi>deliver'd from the Power of Darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of the dear Son of God.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> were come <hi>to the City of the living God; to the Heavenly Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells the Churches, that they were <hi>a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 9. <hi>But is this the State of Chriſtians in our Age? Can we ſay that we are come to the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>where the great God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit and in Truth? Or are we Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to thoſe Things, that they experienced; and yet perſuade ourſelves, that we are the People of God, and good Chriſtians. The primitive Churches had the honourable Title of Saints, we can give our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no better Name than miſerable Sinners. And what is the Reaſon, that we are ſo much outdone by the Churches aforementioned; we can't conclude,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:006166_0135_1027FE614B226720"/>
that the Kingdom of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>that then appear'd in Power, did, as the Sun in the Firmament ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth, ſhow itſelf in a Morning, and be no more ſeen all the Day; for the Kingdom of Chriſt is an everlaſting Kingdom, and his new Covenant an everlaſting Covenant. Neither can we conclude, that God hath withdrawn Himſelf from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, for he never forſakes us, unleſs we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, as the Clouds hinder, that we cannot at all Times of the Day ſee the Brightneſs of the Sun; ſo Iniquity hinders, that we do not remain ſenſible of the Preſence of God. The Apoſtle foreſaw, that there would be a falling away from the Grace in which many of the primitive Chriſtians were eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it ſoon after his Deceaſe came to paſs. But we ſay, that the dark Night of Apoſtacy is over, and we live in Goſpel-days again; if ſo, where are the Fruits? We may, I confeſs, hear Goſpel-Words; but where is the Goſpel Power, by which Believers come to be Sons of God; to bear his Image in Righteouſneſs? Why are not we, call'd Chriſtians, grown to the Stature of them that were the Children of</hi> Heathens? <hi>The Reaſon to me is this, we have not built upon the ſame Foundation: Thoſe built on the ſure Rock, and living Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on CHRIST; as he, in all Ages, was, and ſtill is, in ſpiritual Appearance, the Light of the World, and the Life of Righteouſneſs; and taking his Eternal Spirit in themſelves for their Guide, turn'd from whatſoever they were reproved for. Thus their ſinful Deſires came to be mortified; and ſuch as were carnal came to be ſpiritual; and this made them a peculiar People. Did we walk in their Footſteps, we might riſe to their Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:006166_0136_1027FE62DA066250"/>
but if we build on Words, and outward Services, without Spirit and Life, we can never riſe. For as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid in another Caſe,</hi> If I ſpeak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as ſounding Braſs, <hi>&amp;c. So I ſay in this Caſe, if we hear Men and Angels; if we could live continually under the Sound of good Words, if we have no Regard to that inward Light, which diſcovers Evil, and gives Power to turn from it, we can never mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Sin, cleanſe our Souls, and become an holy People. The Work of Sanctification is inward in the Heart, and to be effected by inward Means: Nothing but inward Light can expel inward Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Since Men fondly perſuade themſelves, that tho' they ſow Tares, they ſhall reap Wheat; tho' they go down into the Grave Sinners, they ſhall riſe Saints; and attain in another World what primitive Chriſtians attain'd in this: Their Converſation hath not been in Heaven; but in Earth: They have walked in Darkneſs, and not in the Light; the God of this World hath been ſerved, and not the God of Heaven.</hi> And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this is the unhappy and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtance of many of the Profeſſors of this Age; yet from the Mouths of ſuch, how frequently do we hear Exclamations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, againſt the daily Growth of <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Deiſm!</hi> never ſo much as imagining that they are any way acceſſary or inſtrumental to this Miſchief; yet one great Cauſe thereof, I take to be, the irregular and unholy Lives of Profeſſors. And till ſuch can be perſwaded, that a conſiſtent Practice with the Religion they
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:006166_0137_1027FE646269E7F0"/>
profeſs, is abſolutely requiſite, to recommend the Chriſtian Religion; and till they produce the moſt convincing and prevailing Argument, <hi>Example,</hi> how can they hope or expect to be credited by this Infidel Race, which ſo much abounds; as every one muſt be ſenſible of the Difficulty of enforcing a Precept (tho' never ſo laudable in itſelf) in Words, which in our Lives and Practices we notoriouſly deny? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the only Expedient that I know of, to ſtop the Mouths of Unbelievers, will be, <hi>To ſhew forth your good Converſation in CHRIST JESUS, coupled with the Fear of God</hi>; to <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they ſeeing your good Works, may glorify God, and be excited to follow your good Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now dear People, having, in a broken Manner, declared to you theſe Things which lay as a Weight on my Mind, there remains little but to propoſe to you, to try the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your Faith and Hope: Truth never loſes by Examination, but ſhines with greater Light and Splendor: Therefore, agreeable to the Apoſtle's Advice, "Examine yourſelves, whether you be of the (true) Faith; know you not your ſelves, how that CHRIST JESUS is in you, except you be Reprobates?" "That is, (ſays <hi>Grotious</hi>) Chriſtians in Name, and not in Deeds." Do not trifle, I beſeech you, in a Matter of ſuch Importance, as the future Well-being of your immortal Souls! To be miſtaken in this Point, will be of fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; Errors of this Sort being only to be rectify'd while we remain in this Life; for we
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:006166_0138_1027FE66F0CDF908"/>
are poſitively told, <hi>That there is no Wiſdom, nor Knowledge, Work, nor Device, in the Grave, whither we are all haſtening.</hi> And our Lord tells us, He wrought while it was Day, and excites us ſo to do, by ſaying, <hi>The Night cometh wherein no Man can Work.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enquire whether our Faith is ſuch an One as operates by Love: <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Lord. Let us remember what Obſtacles this true Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for the primitive Chriſtians, what Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties it enabled them to ſurmount. <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. "Without this Faith (in the Power of CHRIST) it is impoſſible to pleaſe God." "I will (ſays the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi>) ſhew thee my Faith by my Works; for as the Body, without the Spirit, is dead, ſo Faith, without Works, is dead alſo. Ye are my Friends (ſays CHRIST) if ye do whatſoever I command."</p>
            <p>What will it avail us, tho' his outward Goſpel be taught in our Land, if we do not obey his Law written in our Hearts, and conform to its Rule and Government. And tho' CHRIST our Lord is the Fountain to cleanſe us from the Pollution of Sin; yet if we refuſe to be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his ſpiritual Baptiſm; "If he waſh us not, we can have no Part in Him," nor his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And indeed my Friends, I have taken ſome Pains, by divine Aſſiſtance, to examine and enquire how I might have a well-grounded Hope to obtain Salvation, or, in other Words, eternal Life and Happineſs. And in all my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries and Reſearches, I have not been able to diſcover any other Way than this, which the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:006166_0139_1027FE6C360A4638"/>
Almighty continues to direct Mankind in at this Day, as well as heretofore, "The Way of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs thro' CHRIST," he being the Author of eternal Salvation to all Believers. "Be ye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I the Lord your God am holy;" and "without Holineſs, no Man ſhall ſee the Lord:" And I find I can be made ſo no other Way, but thro' "Sanctification of the Spirit, unto the Obedience of Faith, and Sprinkling of the Blood of JESUS CHRIST." For every one who has, or can reaſonably have any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Hope to be ſaved by CHRIST's Life, Sufferings, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, muſt, by his Grace aſſiſting, purify himſelf, as he is pure; as no unclean Thing can poſſibly enter his holy Kingdom. And it is by his Grace we are ſaved, thro' Faith, operating by Love, "not of ourſelves, it is the Gift of God!" Thus, as I became obedient to the Teaching of this Grace received, I came to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Mercy and Peace multiplied to me; for which, in great Reverence and Humility, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire always to bleſs God, the Father of our Lord JESUS, for His unſpeakable Gift! and for his abundant Mercy wherewith he hath vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited my Soul in his Day-ſpring from his high and holy Preſence; and afforded me a good Foundation to hope for his Salvation; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to give all the Glory to God, and to ſay, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy great Name and Power, be the Glory!" <hi>Be ye holy,</hi> is a Precept which contains no Myſtery; here is no <hi>Enigma</hi> to unriddle; no Need of Commentators; no Room for <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> nor

Controverſy; but a plain and poſitive Command, ſo legible, that he that runs may read; the Wayfaring Man, tho' a Fool (with reſpect to the Wiſdom of the World) cannot err here. Therefore ſuffer me to counſel you, to break off the Sin that you find eaſily beſet you, by Righteouſneſs; and your Iniquities by Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life; that ſo your Tranquility may be lengthened, and attend you beyond the Grave. And to you, as I have ſaid before, who may not charge yourſelves with groſs Immoralities, yet who prefer a Portion in this Life, to the durable Riches and Righteouſneſs in another; who ſay unto Gold, "Thou art my Hope, and make fine Gold your Confidence; who have forſaken God, the Fountain of living Waters, and hewn to yourſelves, Ciſterns, broken Ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, that will hold no Water; who have changed the Glory of the incorruptible Being, and given it to your corruptible Things: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, God will not give his Glory to Idols, nor his Praiſe to your graven Images: Therefore keep yourſelves from Idols, and love not the World nor the Things of this World; for if any Man love the World (inordinately) the Love of the Father is not in him." And to you who are Lovers of Pleaſure, more than Lovers of God; who delight and place your Felicity in Grandeur, Pomp and Noiſe; conſider, I beſeech you, that all this will afford you no Comfort nor Satisfaction in a dying Moment; but, on the contrary, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and Sorrow: They will each one aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don you in your greateſt Extremities; and you will then ſee how you have been deluded and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:006166_0141_1027FE71BB1CD000"/>
miſtaken, when the undeniable Meſſenger of Death lays his Arreſt upon you, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Hour aſſures you, that a few Moments will decide your Judgment, and caſt you either for eternal Bliſs or Miſery! Of what Eſteem then will be all your Pleaſures, and all your Toys? The greateſt and moſt exalted of all human Glory, "even Crowns themſelves will then be Toys." This then will be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, "The Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not by fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in this World, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 12." And when we look back, and make our Appeal to God, as good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did on his Death-bed;
<q>Remember now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy Sight.</q>
O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py State! O glorious Condition! May God of his infinite Mercy ſo incline your Hearts to keep his Commandments, that when the Time of your Diſſolution approaches, you may all die the Death of the Righteous, and that your latter End may be like his! On the contrary, how will the Wicked look back with Horror and Affright on a Life ſpent in open Defiance and Violation of God's Laws, or a total Neglect of and Indifference for them? What will appear in ſuch a melancholy Seaſon to ſuch as theſe, a certain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which will devour the Adverſaries of the Lord, whoſe Wrath will then be revealed in a more extraordinary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:006166_0142_1027FE734D001448"/>
againſt all Unrighteouſneſs and Ungodlineſs of Men. This will be a Day of Trial (<hi>viz.</hi> the Day of Death) which will come on all the Inhabitants of the Earth; wherein the Faces of the Unrighteous will gather Paleneſs. A Day of Trouble and Diſtreſs! A Day of Darkneſs and Gloomineſs! A Day of Awakening and Alarm! wherein neither Silver nor Gold ſhall be able to deliver! Conſider this in time, all you that forget God, leſt he <hi>laugh at your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and mock when your Fear cometh.</hi> But ſome may object, this is not always the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Caſe and Situation of Sinners, who defer the Work of Repentance to a ſick or dying Bed; God is very merciful, and is he not always willing and ready to accept returning, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, tho' at the eleventh or laſt Hour? I ſhall reply in the Words of an Author known to ſome of you at leaſt;
<q>Death puts an End to our Day of Grace, and determines our fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal State; then all Men muſt confeſs of what mighty Conſequence it is to die well; we can die but once, and if we miſcarry that once, we are undone forever!</q>
And what conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man would make ſuch dangerous Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as Sinners do every Day, when their Souls are the Price of the Experiment? Who would try how long Death will delay its coming? how long he may Sin on, without thinking of Death and Judgment? Whether Death will give him timely Notice to repent? Or whether God will give him Grace to repent? And if he does, who wou'd venture the Hazard of a Death-Bed Repentance? Whether after a long Life of
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:006166_0143_1027FE7888FFFC50"/>
Sin and Wickedneſs, a few diſtracted, confuſed and almoſt deſpairing Sighs and Groans will carry him to Heaven, and commute for what ought to have been the Work and Buſineſs of our whole Lives, <hi>viz.</hi> a Preparation for Death: If ſuch could after they have diſcover'd their Miſtake and Folly return and live over their Lives again; the Hazard were not ſo great; but this is an Experiment not to be twice made. If they Sin on till they harden themſelves in Sin, and are forſaken of the Grace of God; if Death come long before they expected, and cut them off by Surprize, and without Warning, if their dying and deſpairing Agonies and Horrors, ſhould not prove a godly Sorrow, nor that Repentance to Salvation not to be repented of, they are loſt to Eternity! And what Man in his Senſes wou'd expoſe his Soul to ſuch a Hazard as this? Who wou'd not take Care to make his Calling and Election ſure before Death comes, and in a Matter of ſuch great Concernment (wherein one Miſcarriage is irreparable) to prevent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at a Diſtance. Some Men talk of Death, as if it were a Thing that could be done in two or three Days, and that the proper Time of doing it was a little before they die. But I know of no other Preparation for Death, but living well, which is the only ſure Evidence for Heaven. Men may cheat themſelves with vain Hopes and Imaginations when they come to die; but nothing will be a ſolid Foundation for Peace, but an univerſal Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore I entreat you, the Inhabitants of this Place, to diſabuſe yourſelves; don't ſell
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:006166_0144_1027FE7B4A746828"/>
your Birthright on ſuch diſadvantageous Terms, nor barter eternal Felicity for momentary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; give not Sleep to your Eyes, nor Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to your Eye-lids, till you are become fit Temples for the mighty God of <hi>Jacob</hi> to dwell in! Bring Preſents to God (who ought to be fear'd) even the Preſents of humble and peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Hearts; the Lord calls for your Hearts, not for your Lip-Service; <hi>My Son, give me thy Heart; Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates; even lift up the everlaſting Doors of your Hearts, and the King of Glory will come in, and dwell with you, and you with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now ſuffer me to remind you, that you no longer deſpiſe the Riches of God's Goodneſs and Mercy, ſince his Long-ſuffering and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance is deſign'd to lead to Repentance. By the Mercies of God I beſeech you, that you preſent yourſelves a living Sacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, which is but your reaſonable Service. And be not conformable to this evil World, but be transform'd, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect Will of God concerning you; which is no leſs than your Sanctification. And now I think fit to obſerve to you, that while almoſt all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and even the Dominions of the King to whom you are Subject, are unhappily engaged and involved in the miſerable and deplorable Conſequences of a cruel and bloody War, you have enjoyed unmoleſted Tranquility, your Rights at home have not yet been invaded by your Enemies; indeed your Properties at Sea have ſometimes been wreſted from you by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:006166_0145_1027FE7CDCC85CC8"/>
Men; but what is that Evil compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Calamities and Diſtreſſes Thouſands in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and elſewhere have felt and ſuffered; Fire, Sword, Rapine and Plunder, deſſolate Widows, and diſtreſſed and fatherleſs Children, have been the diſmal Effects of theſe unhappy Diſputes and Differences between the Powers of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               <q>And cannot we yet diſcover a Providence in all this Deſtruction, which is ſuffered to prevail among Men Are we not yet convinced that there is a God of Juſtice that rules in the Kingdoms of the Earth, and that he is about to take Vengeance on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Families that call not upon his Name in Truth and Righteouſneſs.</q>
What greater Inducement can I propoſe to you to turn and love God, than his manifold Mercies? Do not you think they call for your Gratitude? He allures you by his Favours; he gives you Corn, Wine, and Oil; he gives you Vine-yards and Olive-yards, or at leaſt the Means of procuring them; he draws with the Cords and Bands of his Love; he would take you by the Hand, and would heal you; he would take the Yoke of hard Servitude from off your Necks; and, if you are but willing to part with your Idols, he is ready to take the very Names of them out of your Mouths, and to betroth you to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Righteouſneſs, Loving-kindneſs and Mercy. Tho' the whole Head be ſick, and the whole Heart ſaint; tho' your Soul's Enemy may have wounded and left you half dead; yet there is Balm in <hi>Gilead</hi>; there is a Phyſician there, who offers you his Aid, and is willing
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:006166_0146_1027DAF18510CC78"/>
to recover you from your moral and ſpiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. And tho' you may be never ſo great Prodigals, if you have not ſinned out the Day of his Grace, Reſolve upon returning, and the heavenly Father is ready, on your unfeigned Repentance, to receive you into the Arms of his Mercy, and to put on you the beſt Robe you ever wore, even that of his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Thus having brieſty obſerved, how greatly we are indebted to the Almighty, for his manifold Mercies; I would wiſh you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what Returns of Love and Gratitude you have made; for remember tho' God bears long, yet he will not always bear; but expects that we ſhould not only praiſe Him with our Lips, but with our Lives alſo: Turn then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, to God, while he viſits you in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for unto his Power ſhall every Tongue confeſs, and every Knee bow, either in Mercy or in Judgment.</p>
            <p>I have ſometimes thought it would be of ſingular Advantage to Profeſſors of Chriſtianity of all Denominations, ſeriouſly to examine and enquire of your own Hearts, what our Religion has done for us; or what Benefits have accrued to us from it? Whether the Grace we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived has aſſiſted us to reſiſt the Temptations of our Soul's Adverſary; and whether we are nearer Salvation than when we firſt believed? For a being inveſted with a Power to do a Thing, will no longer be of Uſe to us than as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it. The Grace and good Spirit, tho' it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us to deny all Ungodlineſs, is of no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Benefit to us, but as we obey its Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:006166_0147_1027FE7FA42DD358"/>
and follow its Leadings; therefore I am of Opinion it would not hurt the beſt Chriſtians, nor any others, ſometimes to ask themſelves the following Queſtions: Have I witneſs'd the ſtrong Man armed caſt out of my Heart, and his Goods ſpoil'd, and a ſtronger than he in Poſſeſſion? Have I who aſſume the Name of a Chriſtian departed from all Iniquity? Are all old things done away (<hi>for he that is in CHRIST is a new Creature</hi>) and do I experience new Thoughts, new Deſires, new Converſation, a total Change, all Things become regular, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and conſiſtent with my high and holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Is CHRIST the beſt beloved of my Soul? Does my Heart pant and mine Eyes fail for his Salvation? Is my Soul a thirſt for God? Do I long for his Preſence more than for hidden Treaſure? Do I love God above all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations (and my Neighbour as myſelf?) Am I careful leſt I offend him? Do I live in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Obſervance of his Laws, do I live in his Fear? Am I circumſpect in all my Words, that I ſin not with my Tongue? Does my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation become the Goſpel of CHRIST? And am I careful to adorn his Doctrines, which I profeſs to believe and be guided by? If upon a candid Examination, this be the happy State of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, my Soul can rejoice with them, let them call themſelves by what Denomination or Sect they may: For happy is the People who are in ſuch a Caſe! yea bleſſed are they whoſe Portion is the God of <hi>Jacob!</hi> On the contrary, if we are only profeſſing, and not in the Poſſeſſion of Godlineſs; if we have a
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:006166_0148_1027FE83AE7737C8"/>
Form, but are inſenſible of the Power to work a Change in our Hearts; our Religion as yet, has done nothing for us; therefore I entreat all who are in this Caſe, to conſider, 'tis an unfit State for Heaven; for if we have not witneſſed a being created anew in CHRIST JESUS; born of the incorruptible Seed and Word of God; known a Death unto Sin, and a new Birth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteouſneſs; born again of the Spirit; our Lord poſitively ſays, we cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Let the Time paſt then ſuffice; and for the future redouble your Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; and no longer hold the Truth in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, walk circumſpectly as wiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the Time. The Kingdom of God does not ſtand in Form, but in Power, neither is Religion to be taken up by Fits and Starts, as it ſuits our Leiſure and Conveniency; nor by Imitation, but Conviction, we muſt cleave to God, with full Purpoſe of Heart; what our Hand finds neceſſary to do in this great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Salvation, we muſt do it with all our Might; we muſt not indolently ſeek, but (by God's Aſſiſtance) ardently ſtrive to enter the Kingdom of God. Our Talent muſt gain ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Talent; leſt as the unprofitable Servant was, we be deprived of that which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Falſe Pretences to Religion, and a bare Belief of the Truths of the Goſpel, will be of no Advantage to us: Crying Lord, Lord, will not avail if we do not the Things which his Precepts enjoin: No Man can truly call CHRIST Lord, but ſuch as witneſs his Rule and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in their Heart, bringing them into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:006166_0149_1027FE8542D32118"/>
to his Power: Not the Hearers of the Law, but the Doers, ſhall be juſtified: Not he that hears CHRIST's Saying, but he that doth them, is accepted. On a memorable Occaſion the ſacred Hiſtory informs us, the Almighty heard the Voice of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Words, when they ſpake to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he tells him that the People had well ſaid all that they had ſpoken, but knowing the Inſincerity and Inconſtancy of their Hearts, he ſaith,
<q>O! that there were ſuch an Heart in them, that they would fear before me, and keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments always, that it may be well with them and their Children forever!</q>
Religion is an Heart Work, it muſt be begun, and carried on and compleated there: Nothing but keeping God's Commandments will entitle us to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Nothing ſhort of having diſcharged our Parts in the Chriſtian Warfare, and obtained a Victory over Sin, will entitle us to a Crown of Glory: Nothing leſs than being true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Members of CHRIST's Church Militant here on Earth, will ever admit us Members of his Church triumphant in the Heavens. 'Tis to thoſe that overcome that our Lord will give to ſit with him in his Throne; even as he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and is ſet down with his Father in his Throne. A being convinc'd in our Judgments of God's Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that his Laws are righteous altogether, and therefore we ought to obey them, is not Converſion. Faith is not Practice; therefore <hi>add to your Faith Virtue, to Virtue Knowledge, to Knowledge Temperance, to Temperance Patience, to Patience Godlineſs, to

Godlineſs Brotherly Kindneſs, and to Brotherly Kindneſs Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus my dear Friends and Neighbours, I have declar'd in great Truth and Sincerity, my earneſt Concern and Deſire for the real Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inhabitants of my native Country in general; and having an eſpecial and peculiar Regard for many that I have known for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Years, when I have reflected on the bare Poſſibility of your miſſing Heaven and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thro' Inadvertency, Inconſideration, and an inordinate Love for the Things of this Life, it has been Subject of Mourning to me; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as I have thro' Mercy ſeen, that when I was in the like Situation, how dangerous a One it was, and that all who are in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Caſe, ſtand indeed in ſlippery Places. And many a Time has my Soul grieved ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when I have obſerved the Purſuits of ſuch, how earneſtly they are running after Vanities, and purſuing Lies (which will indeed deceive) and turning their Backs on God's Offers of Love, and refuſe to let him put his Beauty on them, and to make them glorious within; and ſince I have witneſſed the great Diſproportion between the Love of God, and the Love of the World, I am the more earneſtly concern'd to invite you to come taſte and ſee of the Goodneſs of the Lord; O make but Trial of his Love, and you'll ſay the one half was not told you. Then will you find the moſt exalted Happineſs this World can yield, will be nothing, and Vanity, yea, lighter than Vanity; but were you once in Poſſeſſion of the Love of God, you'd be
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:006166_0151_1027FE8C395E7A48"/>
ſenſible that you inherited Subſtance, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Joys, unſpeakable Delight, Satisfaction and Peace. O! that this unutterable Love of God might be once impreſs'd and engraven on your Hearts; Then would you confeſs with me, that one Day in his Courts, Preſence and Favour, is better than a thouſand ſpent in the Enjoyment of earthly Delights and Pleaſures. But now I would ſtop a while, and ask, If you have not been cheated by deluſive Hopes and Promiſes of obtaining Satisfaction from temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Have you never diſcover'd their Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Have they not Vaniſhed into Air, even when you fancy'd yourſelves juſt in Poſſeſſion? And don't you find they leave you diſſatisfied and uneaſy? I am certain this is the Caſe with many; you ſtill feel a painful Vacancy, even in the midſt of your ſenſual Delights and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Enjoyments; which, be aſſured (I ſpeak by happy tho' ſhort Experience) nothing ſhort of the Approbation and Favour of God, and a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Love and Peace, can ever poſſibly ſatisfy. I have told you already, that I have felt great Trouble and Anxiety of Mind on your Account; but tho' my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears; and cou'd I, or any one elſe, weep continually Day and Night for you, that you may reſt in the Day of Trouble; yet another's Concern cannot do this great Work for you, without your own Hand in the Buſineſs which relates to your Soul's Happineſs; ſince an inſpired Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures you, you muſt, by Divine Aſſiſtance, "work out your own Salvation with Fear and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:006166_0152_1027FE8DC5C84D08"/>
Trembling:" For no Man can redeem his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor give to God a Ranſom for his Soul. I may (as I do earneſtly) deſire your Happineſs, but I can't procure it for you. I may wiſh you Heaven, but I can't obtain it for you: Yet I earneſtly pray, <hi>That the God and Father of our Lord JESUS CHRIST may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom, and Revelation of the Knowledge of himſelf, whom</hi> (rightly) <hi>to know is eternal Life</hi>; that the Eyes of your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be enlighten'd, and that <hi>you may know what is the Hope of his Calling; and the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints,</hi> and what the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to us-ward who believe, according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his mighty Power, by which he has vanquiſhed and brought down all the ſtrong Holds of Sin and Satan in the Hearts of them who confide in his mighty Arm, which is now extended over you for Good; God has viſited and called you often, and now waits to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to you: The Almighty I ſay, has long viſited and try'd you by his Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance; He has ſpoke to you by the Voice of his Holy Spirit, which ſome of you have neglected, overlooked and quenched: Hath not Wiſdom long utter'd her Voice, even at your Doors? Is ſhe not come up into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? Does not Underſtanding cry in the moſt ſecret Receſſes of your Conſciences, ſaying, <hi>How long, ye ſimple Ones, will you love Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and Scorners delight in Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you therefore at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of Inſtruction, which is the Way to Life</hi>;
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:006166_0153_1027FE908AC1AD68"/>
and then behold he will more abundantly pour out of his Spirit upon you; and if ye hearken and obey his Voice, he will make his Words and Will known to you; on the contrary, if you continue to refuſe and rebel againſt his Light and Truth in your inward Parts, the Conſequence is ſure, He will certainly forſake and leave you to your own Deluſions; becauſe he hath call'd, and you refuſed; he hath ſtretched forth his Hand, and no Man regards; but have ſet at nought all his Counſel, turn'd his Word behind your Backs, and will hear none of his Reproofs. Therefore unleſs you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and repent, with all your Hearts, and amend your Ways and your Doings, he will, when your Diſtreſs comes upon you, laugh at your Calamities, have you in Deriſion, and mock at all your Fears.</p>
            <p>But I fervently pray, that this may never be your deplorable Condition; but that you may be, not only the Viſited, but the Redeemed of the Lord; not only the Called, but the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of God! And, in order to make your Calling and Election ſure, take to yourſelves the whole Armour of God, that you may ſtand againſt the Wiles of the Enemy of your Soul's Happineſs; <hi>Having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breaſt-plate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and your Feet ſhod with the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel; but, above all, taking the Shield of Faith, whereby you'll be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked One; and take the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="unknown:006166_0154_1027FE921536D4F8"/>
(or Power) <hi>of God.</hi> Finally, <hi>Whatſoever Things are true, whatſoever Things are honeſt, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Things are juſt, whatſoever Things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoever Things are of good Report; if there be any Virtue, if there be any Praiſe; think on theſe Things and practiſe them. But we muſt remember, in all theſe Things, that God be our</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega: <hi>His Love muſt be the Motive, and His Honour the End of all our Actions; and then the God of Peace will be with us, and bleſs us. To Him, and to the Word of his Grace, I commit and commend you; aſſuring you, my dear Fellow-mortals, that my fervent Deſire and unfeigned Prayer, unto the God of my Life, for you all, is, that you may be ſaved!</hi>
