            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON viewing the following Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Goodneſs of a merciful God appeared to have waited on the ſaid <hi>John Hammett</hi> from time to time, and the Voice of Chriſt is plainly diſcerned to have drawn him from one Step to another, which for ſome Time he neither knew nor ſtedfaſtly believed to be divine: But as <hi>Samuel</hi> miſtook when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him in the Temple, ſuppoſing the Voice he heard was <hi>Eli</hi>'s, he repair'd to him, but was ſent back, being in part informed of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. The Voice he heard again and again, and <hi>Samuel</hi> makes his ſecond and third At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to know <hi>Eli</hi>'s Will. The old Man now perceiving that it was the Lord's Voice, gave him Inſtruction how to anſwer; and if <hi>John Hammett</hi> had met with ſuch happy Advice from his Brethren the baptiſts, he had not been reinſtated amongſt them as a Miniſter after that religious Scruple, which was of the Lord's begetting, tho' they in a miſtake took it to be a deluſion of Satan. And it can't be otherwiſe look'd upon in them than a miſtake, who no doubt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves to be in the Purity of Religion tho' 'tis to be feared too many content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Symbols thereof, refuſing, it's
<pb facs="unknown:002877_0003_0FE6847E066A8460"/>
doubted, to come to the Word of Faith and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ in their Hearts, <hi>that they might have Life;</hi> that <hi>Life which is the Light of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, We request all to take <hi>John Hammett</hi>'s Example, on the like Uneaſineſs and religious Scruple, when they find it on their minds to bring their Principles and Practices to the Tryal on this Touchſtone of the Goſpel, <hi>the Word of Faith in their Hearts,</hi> as <hi>John Hammett</hi> hath done. Thus will they be able rightly to understand the holy Scriptures, and apply them to their own Experience; and will infallibly ſee whether they are in a State of Salvation or Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the Faith of Chriſt. And that this may be their Practice and Experience, even to the Salvation of their Souls, and not only theirs, but Thouſands and tens of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, is our fervent Deſire and Prayer, who in much Sincerity are Lovers of, and Well-wiſhers to the Souls of all Men.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts had a Letter of mine in their Hands, which ſome Years paſt I ſent to one <hi>John Wright,</hi> which hath been lately printed and cryed about the Streets; and the Publiſher of the ſaid Letter hath taken the Liberty at the Time of printing it to add the following Lines of his own in the Front of it, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002877_0005_0FE6847040FF3408"/>
               <q>A Letter from <hi>John Hammett</hi> to <hi>John Wright,</hi> giving an Account why <hi>John John Hammett</hi> turned from the Baptiſts to the Quakers; alſo why he turned back again: Wherein are diſcovered the Devices and Temptations of the Devil. Publiſhed from his own Hand Writing, for a Caution and Information to all un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſteady Profeſſors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though I don't determine what Deſigns the publiſher of the ſaid Letter had, in inventing and publiſhing this Addition, but rather chooſe to ſubmit the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it to others; yet I ſhall venture to ſay, that the Addition it ſelf is in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reſpects very unfair, and in Fact an abſolute Falſhood; for the Letter to which the above mentioned Addition refers, gives not the leaſt Account why I turned from the Baptiſts to the Quakers, and why I turned back again, as the Publiſher in his Addition ſo poſſitively affirms it to do: Neither was there any ſuch thing in Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for I had not turn'd to, or join'd with the Quakers till ſome Years after the writing of the ſaid Letter: Neither did I ever turn back again to the Baptiſts, or had any Inclination ſo to do, ſince I turned to,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002877_0006_0FE684789E1A6BC0"/>
or joined with the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>And though the ſaid Letter is now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed almoſt Six Years ſince the Date of it, as may be ſeen by the Letter it ſelf, yet thoſe who read the ſaid Addition (who are not acquainted with my preſent Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) will readily conclude, from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, that at the Time of its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I was with the Baptiſts, (as when the ſaid Letter was written;) and if ſo, the Concluſion muſt be, that I publiſh'd the ſaid Letter and Addition my ſelf; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the time of the Publication of the ſaid Letter, and ſome Years before, I was ſeparated from the Baptiſts, and joined to the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>And tho' I am not angry with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts upon Account of the ſaid Letters being publiſhed, nor upon any other Account whatſoever, but ſincerely deſire their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and have always behaved my ſelf like a peaceable Chriſtian towards them; yet I think a modeſt Defence of my ſelf, when I apprehend my ſelf ſo much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to it, can't but be excuſable: And therefore I ſhall farther endeavour ſo to do, by publiſhing the Relation following; wherein I intend in a brief Manner, to ſet forth how I came to withdraw from the Baptiſts Communion: and how I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002877_0007_0FE6846CA4D277C8"/>
upon to join with them again; alſo how I came to ſeparate my ſelf from them, and join my ſelf to the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>After I had been in Communion with the Baptiſts for almoſt twenty Years, and my ſelf with the reſt of my Brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as zealous for ſupporting and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the outward Figures now common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiced, as the Jews were for the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo as cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt all thoſe who conformed not exactly to us, as they were againſt their Fellow Chriſtians who conformed not to them, at length it pleaſed God to put it into my Mind to enquire into my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual State; and an Eye was opened in me to ſee, that notwithſtanding my zealouſly pleading for, and diligently performing thoſe outward Symbols, yet according, to their proper Nature, they brought forth only an <hi>outward, lifeleſs Religion,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved far from being the Means of <hi>inward ſpiritual Grace,</hi> as they are generally cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eſteemed to be: Alſo I came to apprehend, that the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt</hi> is the only Means of <hi>inward and ſpiritual Grace.</hi> And when I came thus far to my ſelf, and to the Exerciſe of my Spiritual Senſes, I clearly diſcern'd, that for a long Time I had been feeding on the barren Mountains of a formal, lifeleſs Religion, and upon
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002877_0008_0FE68467493139C8"/>
the Prodigal's Husks, that could not fill his Belly nor mine; the Apprehenſion whereof brought a great Concern and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe upon my Spirit, greatly deſiring to attain to a more inward ſpiritual Religion, whereby I might be made a true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Witneſs of the ſaving Work of Grace, and of the Offices and Performances of Chriſt which I had read of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that my Soul might be brought into Union and Communion with God, and be daily fed and nouriſhed with the Bread and Water of Life, and to enjoy the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Life giving Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I enquired into the outward Inſtitutions, (that is,) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were ſubſtantial Things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of a durable Nature, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were originally intended figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to guide the Minds of People to the more inward ſpiritual Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, and then to expire in Point of Obligation, like the legal Ceremonies; and I came to this Concluſion, that the latter was intended: And this I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that as I grew leſs outward and formal, I grew more inward and ſpiritual, and experienced a more near Acquaintance with God; whereby I began to be weaned from theſe outward Performances. And not enjoying that ſpiritual Life and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction among the Baptiſts which I deſir'd
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002877_0009_0FE68489279777B0"/>
and longed for, I was conſtrained to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from them. And ſome Time after, as I was conſidering where I might find a People amongſt whom I might enjoy what I wanted, it pleaſed God to encline my Mind towards the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I went two or three Times to their Meeting: And when the Baptiſts underſtood that I was enclining towards the Quakers, they came often to viſit me, and ſome of them, I muſt confeſs, treated me with a tender Spirit; but the Generality of them carryed themſelves far otherwiſe; for they were almoſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally filling my Ears with the Sound of my being led away by Satan, and that thoſe inward Workings were nothing but diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Deluſions; alſo often repeating and applying to me abundance of the moſt dreadful Denunciations in the Scriptures, and repreſenting the Quakers in ſeveral Reſpects to be a deluſive, erronious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. By this Means I was brought into great Confuſion; for when I look'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Quakers, who I was ſenſible made a more religious and ſpiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance than any others, my Mind and Affections inclined towards them; but the many Prejudices which I was filled with againſt them, together with the heavy

Croſs that I muſt unavoidably take up, and the frightful mountainous Difficulties that lay in my Way, greatly diſcouraged me from going forward; whereupon I was afraid to go to their Meetings, or much to enquire into their Principles: And when I look'd back on the Baptiſts, I conſider'd that I had been in Unity with them almoſt twenty Years, and during all that time there aroſe no Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweeen them and me; which I found had begotten a great Affection towards them: And on the other Hand I dreaded to make them my Enemies, who had ſo long been my Friends; whereupon I found a great Difficulty to ſeparate my ſelf wholly from them, and join my ſelf to the Quakers, with whom I never had any religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; whereupon I drew to this Concluſion, neither to go to the Meetings of the Baptiſts or Quakers, and knew not but that I ſhould ſpend the Remainder of my Days in this loneſome ſeparate State: And being brought into many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in ſeveral Reſpects, I began to be weary of my Life, and eſpecially when I found my Mind inclining toward the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; inſomuch that thoſe divine Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings became more terrible than Death it ſelf. Sometimes I feared I ſhould loſe my
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002877_0011_0FE68478C030DBD0"/>
natural Underſtanding; for I could neither eat, drink, or ſleep but very little for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days and Nights together, whereby I was in Time reduced almoſt to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and thrown into a very great Inflamation; and in my Diſtreſs ſometimes petitioned the Lord rather to take my Life from me than to encline me toward the Quakers; at other Times the Enemy would tempt me to put an End to my temporal Life, to get rid of my ſpiritual Troubles; and ſometimes I was very near being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him, but it pleaſed the Lord in great Mercy to reſtrain me; and in time I was quite tired out with this miſerable Condition, and began to look back and confer with the Fleſh and the World, and often ſtrove againſt thoſe divine Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, until it pleaſed God to withdraw thoſe Influences from me; and then in that dark and bewilder'd State I look'd back with the Eyes of my carnal Reaſon, which cannot comprehend <hi>the Things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> and to which the <hi>Wiſdom of God ſeems Fooliſhneſs,</hi> and began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine thoſe divine Viſitations and Workings to be the Deluſions of Satan; being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto greatly forwarded and aſſiſted by the Baptiſts, who were my only Companions, and almoſt continually filling my Ears and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002877_0012_0FE6849EF47B8FE8"/>
Thoughts with Abundance of Diſcourſe of that Nature; ſo that by this Means I began to be in an eaſy quiet Frame again, in reſpect of my latter Difficulties; and the Baptiſts being now ſenſible what their diligent Endeavours had effected, they were under Encouragement of my returning to their Communion, and altered their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Treatment, carrying themſelves very loving and courteous towards me; which begat Thoughts in me of joining with them again: And as this Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevailed, my Affection towards the outward Performances increaſed likewiſe, which cauſed me to ſpeak favourably of them again, whereby I ſoon recovered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect again, not only from the Baptiſts, but alſo from others of other Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome of whom alſo uſed their zealous Endeavours to diſencline me from the Quakers; and being therewith greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I endeavoured ſtrongly to oppoſe all Thoughts that would come into my Mind againſt the outward Figures, and alſo to cheriſh and ſtrengthen all Inclinations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; till at length I had got a great Eſteem of them again; and being thereunto often perſwaded, I was again united to the Baptiſts Communion, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002877_0013_0FE6847DE38AE080"/>
not long after I writ the Letter before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: And when I had ſpent ſome Time in Unity with the Baptiſts, I was by the unanimous Approbation of the Meeting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to my former Station of a Miniſter, and ſo continued for a conſiderable Time; till at length I began to obſerve, that ever ſince I was re-united to the Baptiſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, I had ſat down contented and eaſy under formal, lifeleſs Principles and Performances, and had not enjoy'd that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual Life which ſome Time before I had a Taſte of, and that my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Apprehenſion grew more dark and carnal, the Lord having ſome Time before withdrawn his divine Light, by which my ſpiritual Eye diſcerned, and left me to the Exerciſe of my humane Reaſon; ſo that my Apprehenſions of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Things were formed and determined accordingly.</p>
            <p>At length it pleaſed God to begin to open my Underſtanding in ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Doctrines; and as I ſaw further, I ſpoke plainer, at which they were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid, <hi>I preach'd up Quaker Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and if I went on, I would bring in Quakeriſm among them:</hi> I told them, <hi>I knew the Lord was inſpiring my Mind with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002877_0014_0FE6849F168E1028"/>
divine Underſtanding, and the more I ſearch'd the Scriptures, the more I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed therein, and therefore could not be confined to ſuch Doctrines as pleaſed them, but muſt perform my Duty according as the Lord would be pleaſed to open my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I was brought into a great Difficulty again, and conſidered what I had beſt to do; whereupon (though it may be my Weakneſs) I drew to this Concluſion, rather to be wholly ſilent than raiſe a Diſturbance, and ſo continued for ſome Time: Then it was brought to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration again what a dull, lifeleſs Frame I was in, notwithſtanding my zealous and diligent Performance of the outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and in this contemplative Frame the Lord was pleaſed to encline my Mind again towards the Quakers, very contrary to my Expectation or Deſire, the Apprehenſion whereof greatly ſurpriſed me; for the many Difficulties that lay in my Way came into my Mind like an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inundation. The Baptiſts obſerving my melancholy diſtreſſed Condition, enquired the Reaſon of it, which I was free to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; then they came often to viſit me again, ſome treating me ſmoothly, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002877_0015_0FE684A1195EA8D0"/>
ſome roughly. I told them, I had now wholly committed my ſelf to God for his Directions, and had a Faith and Hope rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in me, that he would make me ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what his Pleaſure was concerning me; that I had reſolv'd to have no Regard to any mortal Creature, and intended not to be led by fair Means, nor driven by foul, and deſign'd not to be confus'd as I had been, and therefore deſir'd them to be wholly ſilent, and let me alone. Then I kept ſeveral Days of Faſting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God for his Direction, that he would be pleaſed to diſcover to me, whether thoſe Drawings proceeded from him or from Satan, the which I could not now diſtinguiſh to my Satisfaction; ſo that I was in great Fear and Trembling: I thought if this Inclination proceeded from Satan, I ſhould be undone, If I went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in Obedience to him; and if it was from God, I alſo trembled at the Thoughts of keeping back and being diſobedient to him; therefore I concluded to keep my Mind in a ſtill, quiet, paſſive Frame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſtand ſtill, and neither ſtep for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor backward, but reſign my ſelf up to God, patiently to wait for his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Direction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002877_0016_0FE6847A376146D0"/>At length it pleaſed God to ſhine into my Heart by his divine, reſplendent Light, to my great Joy and Satisfaction; and at the ſame Time renewed my Inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Quakers: And finding my Mind growing very uneaſy and diſatisfied again amongſt the Baptiſts, I had Thoughts of going to the Quaker's Meeting; but cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Remembrance my former Miſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, I thought I would now be more deliberate, and make no Alteration but on a more ſolid and thorough Examination.</p>
            <p>Then I ſet my ſelf again to examine into the Baptiſts Principles and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances; and the more I ſearched the more Cauſe of Diſatisfaction I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for I plainly diſcerned, that the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof was to lay the Soul down, and lull it aſleep on lifeleſs Principles and Performances, and many of them were ſuch as I could not ſtand by or maintain. Then I thought I would enquire into the Quakers Principles; but I ſoon found that the Prejudices which I had received from the Repreſentations of <hi>Keith, Bugg, Hox, Fal<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and others, greatly unqualified me for an Impartial Enquiry. Then I conſidered that theſe were all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Adverſarys, and it may be they may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002877_0017_0FE684A1411ADE10"/>
miſrepreſent them; and I was the rather inclin'd to think ſo, becauſe I had then by me a Book of <hi>Keith</hi>'s, writ againſt the Quakers wherein I found he plainly owns in one part what he denies in another, affirms, and then contradicts himſelf; and from this Piece of abſolute Confuſion and Self-contradiction I was inſtructed to lay by all Prepoſſeſſions and Prejudices, and enquire of themſelves, whom I thought beſt know their own Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I got ſome of their Books, which contain'd a Declaration of their Principles, and in my impartial Enquiry I found them groſly miſrepreſented; for their Principles were all ſubſtantially proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that the proper Tendency of them was to promote a ſpiritual, pure, and holy Life, and to bring the Souls that are led by them into Unity and Communion with God, and to ſet forth the Power and Glory of the Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. And though I once thought this People to be the moſt weak and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of all, I found them in ſpiritual Underſtanding and Experience to be the wiſeſt of all; and admir'd my own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ignorance, in Compariſon of that admirable Underſtanding I found amongſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002877_0018_0FE684A5ADA45B50"/>
them. Then I ſet my ſelf to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Conſtitution, Orders and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and found the Concluſion far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Expectation; for tho' I have read the Conſtitution, Orders and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of moſt of the reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> yet I can truly declare, that I believe this People in all Reſpects to be the moſt harmonious, religious, and perfect, of any religious Body of People on the Face of the Earth: So that the more I ſaw the more I admir'd, and ſaid in my Heart, <hi>Is this the People that are ſo deſpiſed by all, that all Denominations of Chriſtians, though greatly oppoſing one another, yet all combine againſt this People?</hi> The Reaſon I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be in part, that their Principles and Conſtitution are built on the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God revealed unto them by his Spirit, that ſearcheth the deep things of God; and others beholding them with the Eye of humane Reaſon, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand the Things of the Spirit of God, and to which the Wiſdom of God ſeems Fooliſhneſs they cannnot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended until a ſpiritual Eye is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them that behold them; and alſo their Principles and Conſtitution tending above all others to exalt the Kingdom of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002877_0019_0FE684A5D03C6710"/>
Chriſt, and to deſtroy the Kingdom of Satan, he fills the World with Prejudices againſt them; and becauſe they are not of the World, but are choſen by Chriſt out of the World, to teſtify that the Works thereof are evil, therefore the World hateth them. Then I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them and ſay, <hi>How goodly are thy Tents, O Jacob, and thy Tabernacles, O Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael!</hi> And yet the many great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that lay in my Way, detained me among the Baptiſts. At length, one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I was in the Baptiſts Meeting, I found an exceeding powerful Viſitation of God, ſtrongly enclining my Mind, and the inſhining Light of Chriſt directing me towards the Quakers; ſo that I could hardly ſit out the Meeting. This Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conquered all carnal reaſoning and fleſhly Conference, and raiſed in me a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reſolution, in the Strength of the Lord, to bear the Croſs and deſpiſe the Shame, and come what would, I would no longer delay, but give up to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influence; and in the Afternoon I went to the Quakers Meeting, where I obſerved the ſolid grave Compoſedneſs, and humble Deportment of the People, who plainly diſcovered their Minds were
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002877_0020_0FE684A9210CE448"/>
given up to the Buſineſs their Miniſters declared they were met for, (that is,) <hi>to worſhip God in Spirit and Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had not come long to their Meetings, being emptied of Partiality and Prejudice, but found what I long'd to enjoy, to my great Joy and Satisfaction, which was the Crown and Glory of all, that God was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly among them, making their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Worſhip refreſhing and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the Soul; whereby I was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to join my ſelf in ſpiritual Unity with them, and can truly declare, for the Encouragement of all other religious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers, that the Lord upon a ſpiritual Account, hath fully ſatisfied me for all the Troubles and Difficulties I have paſs'd through: To whom, for all his Bleſſings and merciful Dealings towards me, be rendred as His Due, and my Duty, <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, Glory and Praiſe, for ever,</hi> AMEN.</p>
