            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AN acquaintance with the hiſtory of paſt ages will lead us to obſerve, that a common method of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of a people, hath been by a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of men of eminent abilities and influence. A great genius appears at their head, and forms a general ſcheme of inſtitutions and laws. This being adopted, active ſpirits follow, who carry it into execution, and the community ſwiftly aſcends to the height of proſperity.</p>

EVEN <hi>Iſrael</hi> taken under the peculiar tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage of Jehovah thus aroſe to a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate. <hi>Moſes,</hi> by divine direction, gave them the rudiments of civil and eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal polity.<hi>Joſhua,</hi> by the ſame influence, led them over Jordan, and fixed them in the deſtin'd inheritance.</p>
            <p>IN a way ſomewhat ſimilar may we well ſuppoſe a people emerging from the depths of diſtreſs to regain their national character. Patriots, perhaps of different qualities, exert themſelves in turn, agreable to their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, 'till they make a reſpectable fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as in the former period of their exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>An illuſtration of this we have in the caſe of Judah reſtored to Paleſtine and the rights and privileges of their fathers, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence in a ſtrange land, and ſubjection to a foreign yoke, for ſeventy years.</p>
            <p>DURING ſo long a term, when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic offices of religion could not be regularly performed, when they were converſant with the ſuperſtitions of Gentiliſm, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of maſters upon whom they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

dependant, it is ſcarce poſſible but that the knowledge of divine truth muſt be greatly loſt, the ardor of devotion cool'd with many, their ſpirits broken, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous public temper well nigh extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>LET us view theſe exiles going to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate country, and a capital in ruins, with intention to poſſeſs and improve their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent patrimony, rebuild their city, ſet up the worſhip of God upon the Hebrew ritual, and ſettle the civil adminiſtration to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; at the ſame time deſpis'd and hated by their neighbours, and retarded as much as poſſible in every ſalutary projection.</p>
            <p>THESE things conſidered, nothing can be clearer than the vaſt importance that they ſhould have <hi>wiſe men</hi> for <hi>pilots</hi> to direct them, men of goodneſs and intrepidity, to animate them to every arduous undertaking.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY a gracious God not only favored them with his prophets to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and ſupport them, but rulers to lead and protect them, and forward the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes to which they were called—firſt

               <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> under whom the temple was built, and altar for daily ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; then <hi>Ezra</hi> a ſcribe well inſtructed to the kingdom of heaven, who reſtored the ſcripture to its primitive purity, and diſſolv'd thoſe interdicted alliances which weakened their attachment to their religion and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>BUT Jeruſalem yet laid defenceleſs, enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in part remained.</p>
            <p>THE full accompliſhment of the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intention of heaven towards that afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people was reſerved for <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS man held a lucrative poſt<note n="†" place="bottom">Prid. Connect. Vol. 2.</note> in a court the center of the wealth and glory of Aſia, and had an intimate acceſs to the mightieſt monarch then living. But ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with affluence and honor, he mourned for Zion. His countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed a troubled ſoul to his maſter, who underſtanding the cauſe, gave him liberty of abſence for a term, inveſted him with a public character in Judea, and ſent manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory letters to his officers bordering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to aſſiſt him.</p>

His arrival to Jeruſalem was like the light of the morning which diſſipates the incumbent gloom, and invigorates nature. Every heart was revived, every hand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. Preſent with them the walls went up, and the city filled with inhabitants. By his inceſſant care and labours grievances were redreſſed, and all things regulated in ſuch a manner as to render them eaſy and happy.</p>
            <p>THIS is the <hi>lover of his nation,</hi> whoſe words I have read. <hi>Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LANGUAGE this conſonant to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon and revelation. Natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion dictates that God is good, and a lover of righteouſneſs. The ſacrifical ſervices of the temple as inſtituted for particular caſes, or pointing to the promiſed Saviour, while they imply'd guilt, gave aſſurance that it was conſiſtent with the rectoral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God to have reſpect to imperfect virtue. Nothing therefore is here expreſſed but what is agreable to a juſtneſs of tho't, to a due humility of mind.</p>

THIS paſſage as uttered by <hi>a ruler in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> ſuggeſts to us ſome things of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuitable to the occaſion of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent aſſembling.</p>

            <p>WE are in the firſt place to take notice of the ground of this requeſt to God.—<hi>According to all that I have done for this people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS naturally leads us into ſome reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon civil government, it's deſign, and the proper ſteps whereby it is purſued. But the ſubjects have been handled with ſo much copiouſneſs and accuracy in this deſk, that they muſt be but tranſiently touch'd upon.</p>
            <p>IT hath pleaſed the creator of all things to implant in mankind a deſire of happineſs in the continuance of being, and acceſſions to their enjoyments. This may be deem'd a kind of inſtinct, which urges them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010235_0010_0F7E0A8EF8DFB140"/>
any rational arguments to ward off an injury, or take hold of an offered advantage; and is an engine of providence, whereby they are impelled to action, and the human ſpecies is preſerved. To this the Father of ſpirits hath ſuper-added reaſon, to direct it in it's operations into a track conſiſtent with the welfare of others, and moſt adapted to a proper end.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent ſtate this principle gaining an undue aſcendancy over the intelligent powers is apt to excite men to the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purſuit of perſonal intereſt, to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the weaker. The proportion of an attainable good is moreover as the means of arriving to it. Many can effect more than one.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING then the incapacity of individuals to defend themſelves from the rapacious, or to reach that degree of good they might in a collective view, they are led to union. Union for theſe ends ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes rules framed in ſubſerviency to them. Occaſions are continually riſing for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of general rules, or additions to them, and particular caſes occur which it
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010235_0011_0F7E0A8FB1C58FD8"/>
is not poſſible at once to provide for. So a ſtanding legiſlature is erected. Laws with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out execution are as none, therefore there muſt be an authority to ſee them take effect. This ſeems the natural courſe of things.</p>
            <p>THE exterior ſtrength of a community, it's internal ſafety and advantage, preſent neceſſity, or ſecurity for time to come, and a variety of adventitious circumſtances, have their weight in the model of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore it differs according to the light in which either is viewed.</p>
            <p>SURROUNDED by formidable adverſaries, a people may chuſe to give to ſome one a kind of dictatorial authority for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. <hi>Iſrael</hi> vexed with the frequent ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their neighbours deſired a king to judge them, and <hi>fight their battles.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty gives influence, and founds a ſort of claim to rule, and a large intereſt connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that of the public ſeems to render the poſſeſſor worthy of confidence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the ſole dominion been committed to a certain number. Equality of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a quiet ſituation, or perhaps painful experience of the ill effects of unlimited ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010235_0012_0F7E0A912A303778"/>
have introduced a popular juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the ſociety at large reſerving to themſelves the final determination of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which concern them.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER each of theſe may anſwer good purpoſes for a term, yet ſingly they are liable to exception. The ſupreme legiſlative and executive power lodged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the ſame hands uncontrouled, tends to tyranny. A government altogether po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular by reaſon of an infinite diverſity of particular intereſts, diſſonant opinions, and formal conſultations of the whole body, is ſlow, uneven, and liable to convulſions, and ſubverſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Heineccius Syſtem of Univerſal Law.</note>

            <p>HAPPY are thoſe whoſe political plan al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſuch prerogative as is ſufficient to the vigor, uniformity, and diſpatch, of public meaſures, but at the ſame time with ſuch reſtrictions, as that the liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are ſafe, and by a wiſe mixture of the ſeveral powers which alone become pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, renders them highly beneficial.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT originating from the law of ſelf preſervation properly directed, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010235_0013_0F7E0A9131B49FE8"/>
being the baſis of public happineſs, we may eaſily collect the methods to be proſecuted in conſequence.</p>
            <p>FROM hence 'tis evident that the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> claims the firſt attention of ſuch as are in the legiſlative capacity.</p>
            <p>THROUGH the weakneſs of human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, fundamental principles may poſſibly be productive of ill conſequences. Through a corrupt bias falſe deductions may be made from maxims true and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which practiſed upon will be highly detrimental. It ſhould therefore be their care within their line to correct miſtakes of either kind; <hi>for if the foundations are out of courſe what ſhall the righteous do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AN equitable conſtitution on the other hand, the ſubſerviency of which to general utility experience demonſtrates, is to be ſtrenuouſly maintained. The ballance of power in a mixed government is no empty theory. The deſtruction of it is terrible. The revolutions of Rome in former days we need not recur to in proof of this. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh records will inform us of the abolition
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010235_0014_0F7E0A91F1FC4B90"/>
of the ancient ſyſtem, the calamities thence enſuing, ſo ſeverely felt as to induce a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it with as much zeal as it was rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It lays with rulers to preſerve this bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, (every inclination of which is in a double proportion) by a ſcrupulous adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the duties of their department, and the ſeaſonable check to the violation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed limits.</p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe evident that the <hi>whole</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſhould fall under the equal eye of rulers—that their concern ſhould be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for <hi>all.</hi> Rivalſhip there often may be between the ſeveral parts of ſociety, and ſtruggles for immunities and privileges. Conſtituents may expect that thoſe whom they elect prove their advocates in prejudice to others. But ſuch <hi>particular</hi> reſpect is a perverſion of the great intention of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, oftentimes rendering the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>ſome,</hi> of <hi>many,</hi> worſe than if they had remained in a ſtate of nature, by tying them down under public ſanction to what in that ſtate they might have proſpect of relief from. Neceſſary burdens are to be adjuſted to the different capacities of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and advantages to be alike open to every one properly qualified to improve them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:010235_0015_0F7E0A956A8AEE20"/>
IT is equally evident that what concerns the <hi>welfare of the ſtate</hi> is a proper object of human <hi>laws.</hi> Proviſion therefore is to be made for the ſupport of thoſe who ſerve the public agreable to the places they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain—for defence from, and oppoſition to, the unwarrantable encroachments of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies—for the determination of conteſted rights, neceſſary to peace and order—for the encouragement of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, from whence are derived wealth and plenty—for the ſuppreſſion of immorality, in its native tendency as well as by the righteous providence of God preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with ruin—for maintaining ſocial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſo friendly to that impreſſive ſenſe of divine things whereby the ſolemnity of an oath (the grand inſtrument of government) is kept up, and adds to the force of civil authority that of conſcience—for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the intereſts of learning, which ſoftens a natural ferocity, aſſiſts in the arts and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of common life, capacitates for great undertakings, and with which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the exclamations of ignorance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, or a narrow ſpirit,) religion and liberty are cloſely united.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:010235_0016_0F7E0A96767A4DE8"/>
To the efficacy of authoritative decrees to theſe purpoſes 'tis neceſſary that they be dictated with as much preciſion as poſſible, ſo as to be eaſy of application—that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments annexed ſhould be ſuited to the circumſtances and prevailing paſſions of thoſe for whom they are framed, and a freedom of acceſs be ever preſerved to the tribunals of juſtice.</p>
            <p>HENCE finally the true uſe of <hi>executive</hi> power is readily perceived. It is the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and influence of the <hi>legiſlative</hi>—the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative put forth into act. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who are veſted with it are never at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to diſpenſe with laws—are ever to make them their rule of conduct, and to their utmoſt, endeavour a concurrence with the ſpirit and deſign of them.</p>
            <p>WITH this general idea of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment coincides the word of inſpiration, when it aſſures us that the ruler is the <hi>miniſter of God for good—a revenger</hi> to <hi>execute wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him</hi> that <hi>doeth</hi> evil, <hi>attending continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this very thing.</hi> With this coincide the common ſentiments of antiquity. <hi>The kings of the Gentiles</hi> (ſome of the ſucceſſors of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010235_0017_0F7E0A97368E3B78"/>
Alexander particularly) choſe to be called <hi>benefactors,</hi> when they reverſed the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Pagan deities were at firſt earthly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes—good rulers who laid themſelves out for the benefit of mankind. Whether they had an <hi>apotheoſis</hi> in <hi>gratitude</hi> for what they did here, or as <hi>beſt qualified</hi> to ſuperintend affairs below, or as an <hi>incentive</hi> with their ſucceſſors to <hi>an imitation,</hi> it ſhows the ſenſe of mankind upon this head.</p>
            <p>II. THE other thing which comes under conſideration is the requeſt to God. <hi>Think upon me my God for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS in connection with the latter clauſe is worthy of diſtinct remark, as containing ſeaſonable and weighty hints, viewed in a diverſity of lights.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE may underſtand it as an implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ruler's governing aim at the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Heaven in his adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THE favourable regards of God cannot be conceiv'd to be extended to any whoſe habitual converſation in the world he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, and therefore cannot fitly be applied
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010235_0018_0F7E0A97F7D54DF0"/>
for by thoſe who have not made it their main care to pleaſe him. Such a ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God in the heart by the influence of his ſpirit and truths as ſhall give the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy to his approbation, is of vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to rulers, having a prodigious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy with them in the ſpecial buſineſs to which they are called.</p>
            <p>PERFECT wiſdom hath made nothing without deſign. The faculties of the minds of men are for improvement, the talents given them for uſe in ſome particular ſphere. The diſpoſal of circumſtances, and adapted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of talents thereto, point out this ſphere. Hereby induſtry is recommended in every ſtation, and the command proclaimed as with an audible voice from heaven, <hi>Occupy 'till I come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITHOUT ſubjection to the will of God the ruler cannot enjoy his ſmiles. Seriouſly and deeply affected herewith, he gives all diligence (never content merely with the honors and emoluments of a place) that his mind may be furniſhed for exalted ſervice. He will therefore carefully examine the beſt policy of ſtates, the cauſes of their gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010235_0019_0F7E0A98B7D75190"/>
and declenſion, attentively ſurvey his own country, it's ſituation, connexions, and manners, inveſtigate the foundation of laws, and their true ſenſe, by intenſe thought, and the ſtudy of the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious writers upon the ſubject, and converſe with the remoter branches of knowledge (according to opportunity) which throw light upon what he is more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with. He riſes early, and ſits up late, deliberating upon the public ſafety. Contemplation and reading are for active duties, and the treaſures of wiſdom labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly acquired are freely expended for the good of ſociety. The ſenate complains not of his abſence, or the ſeat of judgment. He propoſes, ſupports, objects, determines, and executes, and ſtrains every nerve in the fulfillment of his truſt.</p>
            <p>UNDER a firm perſwaſion that the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, deſireth truth</hi> in <hi>the inward parts,</hi> and that <hi>in his favor</hi> is <hi>life,</hi> he engages in every momentous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action with ſolemnity of ſpirit, is exceeding cautious that he does not pervert judgment nor conſent to any thing merely for it's plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance. Whatever comes before
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010235_0020_0F7E0A998E6DF840"/>
him paſſes under a ſevere ſcrutiny; aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon to its rectitude it is received and proſecuted. He is not a wed into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances diſagreable to the convictions of his mind by menaces from any quarter.—<hi>The fear of man bringeth a ſnare, but whoſo putteth his truſt in the Lord,</hi> maintains due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him, <hi>ſhall be ſafe</hi> from the prevailing power of ſuch a temptation. Tenacious of a well formed purpoſe, ſecular arguments of no ſort are ſufficient to warp him, he purſues it with an inflexible ſtability. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted guardian of liberty, it is ever before him, and dear to him above any earthly enjoyment. He is ready to all juſt means for it's preſervation, even to the laying down his life if called for in providence: But never will he abuſe the venerable name through precipitancy of paſſion, and for the gratification of any perſonal ſiniſter views.</p>
            <p>INCOMPATIBLE with this perſwaſion is an habit of intrigue and diſſimulation,—every ſubtle evaſion of right, and thoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices which create confidence and ruin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants. It leads to fairneſs of expreſſion and behaviour—to account obligations ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and a punctual conformity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:010235_0021_0F7E0A9A3AA4EC98"/>
THE greateſt may have ſome avenue whereby they are acceſſible to the crafty and deſigning. A latent vanity not eaſily ſubdued renders adulation too palatable. Sucking in the luſcious draught, the ruler (as well as others) may be intoxicated with the poiſon. Not ſo if he loves the <hi>praiſe of God</hi> more than of man. This is an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al antidote againſt it's baneful influence.—This cloſes the ear to the artful panegyricks of the fawning paraſite.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed that other principles beſides this we have been conſidering may carry the ruler into a channel of duty in many inſtances beneficial to a people. The enquiry is whether any ſhort of this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to carry him through the whole courſe of allotted duty.</p>
            <p>NATURAL benevolence—a diſpoſition to ſerve mankind and to ſerve them grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at once charms us, and we are ready to preſage much good when this is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of a ruler. But a little attention will convince us that it is often accompanied with a certain indolence, averſe to that cloſe application which forms the great, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010235_0022_0F7E0A9AFA1F7888"/>
the active patriot, and involves in it that deſire to pleaſe which tends to an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate treatment of all, and a flexibility which is ſometimes prejudicial. Religion gives vigor and compactedneſs to this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit; by this aided and exalted, it brings forth fruit equal to the moſt ſanguine proſpects.</p>
            <p>SENSE of honor hath been much extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and is not without its advantages in high life. But if all which is meant by it is a regard to decorum of behaviour as it comes under the obſervation and judgment of the world, 'tis too ſtinted, too fluctuating always to be depended upon. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with private vices, which by a kind of fatality draw on ſuch as are more flagrant, and widely miſchievous. Ages differ in their taſte, none are free from corruption, and a compliment to that we live in may betray into a violation not of <hi>received,</hi> but <hi>real</hi> propriety of conduct.</p>
            <p>AFFECTATION of parade—of ſhining in auguſt aſſemblies, and being accounted pillars of the ſtate, prompts at times to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, the good effects of which a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010235_0023_0F7E0A9BB35B1840"/>
ſenſibly feels. But how will this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the day of trial, when fame and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty come into competition, and a reſignation of the former is plainly incumbent? What but a principle of piety will produce the coſtly ſacrifice?</p>
            <p>APPREHENSIONS of the intrinſic excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of virtue, nice ideas of moral beauty, are worthy of the mind of man, and have their attractive influence. But abſtract no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>only</hi> ſeem fitter for pure intelligences, than thoſe who dwelling in houſes of clay have paſſions perpetually applied to by a thouſand ſenſible objects. To look in the critical hour to God whoſe favour and friendſhip are of infinite importance, will be likely more to warm the heart, and excite the ſprings of action, than the fineſt ſpeculations of this kind.</p>
            <p>ADMITTING then that in many inſtances theſe principles have been beneficial in their conſequence, ſtill this muſt have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, as an incentive to more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive goodneſs, and the proper reſult of which is a conſiſtent and uniform character.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010235_0024_0F7E0A9C74155020"/>
2. THIS clauſe connected with the latter may import the ruler's conſciouſneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity in office, and his appeal to God on behalf of it.</p>
            <p>MANKIND with underſtanding, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and memory, are capable of recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the paſt temper and conduct, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with ſome rule—the divine law. Conformity or diſagreement herewith begets ſatisfaction or uneaſineſs in review, eſpecially as relative to the final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the character and ſtate by God the judge of all. What reverence is due to conſcience, whoſe power is alike exerciſed in abſolving or condemning the <hi>great</hi> and the <hi>ſmall?</hi> How much ſhould we prize his friendſhip, how fearful left we exaſperate him?</p>
            <p>THE ruler is not always exempt from the cenſure and reſentment of the world. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy beyond deſcription is his caſe if the reproaches of conſcience are joined with thoſe of a people—when deſerted by man, he cannot look up to God with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for the voice of conſcience is the voice of God. But cenſure and reſentment are
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010235_0025_0F7E0A9D3ACF63B0"/>
not confined to thoſe only that are culpable. Sometimes they fall upon the upright; through miſapprehenſions, jealouſies atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon a warm paſſion for liberty, heavy burdens and diſappointments fermenting the ſpirit, or under ſome particular malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent influence. Moſes was <hi>faithful in all God's houſe;</hi> but for an extraordinary divine interpoſal he would have ſuffered from thoſe for whom he ſo fervently pleaded. If <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> is deemed an exception to the reſt of mankind let us look elſewhere. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were the moſt polite and ſenſible peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on earth; quick in diſcerning merit, and ready to embrace it. Yet thoſe for whom they ordained public honours, by reaſon of unfortunate events in which they had no ſhare, felt the weight of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. Even <hi>Ariſtides</hi> by the ſuperior intereſt of a powerful adverſary, endur'd the ſeverity of <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> wiſhing as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed his country that it might never want him. Now when ſuch a diſaſtrous lot befals a faithful ruler, leading him to a ſolemn retroſpect, vaſt indeed muſt be his happineſs with the teſtimony of conſcience in his favour. He hath that within which is far more than a ballance to what he feels
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010235_0026_0F7E0A9DF49FBDA0"/>
from without, (though that muſt be painful) he hath a <hi>joy unſpeakable,</hi> which <hi>no man can take from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſing ſuch a day as this never to happen, yet mortality is the end of all men. Rulers are ſtiled <hi>gods</hi> as in an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtation, but they muſt <hi>die like men.</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the bed of death that ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection is ſcarce avoidable which a crowd of buſineſs and ſplendid ſcenes prevented in ſome. How diſtreſſing muſt be that period, to one who for long time hath loſt fight of his errand, and perverted the ends of his divine appointment, oppreſſed with guilt peculiarly accumulated? On the contrary what tranſports are at this ſeaſon the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, who hath exerciſed a <hi>conſcience void of offence,</hi> whoſe applauſe reaches to the lateſt moments? <hi>Remember O Lord,</hi> as once a jewiſh monarch, ſays he, (as ſuppoſed upon the verge of life) <hi>how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy ſight,</hi> and ſmiles in the pangs of diſſolving nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS clauſe may be underſtood as denoting a ruler's faith in and hope of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010235_0027_0F7E0A9EC279FCC8"/>
gracious rewards of futurity agreable to his ſervices.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER important the diſpute may be concerning the intimation of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the old teſtament, 'tis needleſs to enter upon it now. Suffice it at preſent that the Jews in fact believed, and were actuated by it.</p>
            <p>ETERNAL life is the free gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, but a gift appropriated to thoſe who poſſeſs a temper devoted to his ſervice and glory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed according to their aſſiduity in his work. Agreably our divine prophet hath repreſented mankind as ſervants, betruſted with pounds or talents—ſomething improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and diſtinguiſhed as they gained by trading.</p>
            <p>WHAT reſtraint is the faith which is the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> and <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen</hi> from predominant worldly ambition and avarice, prolific ſources of venality and corruption! We judge of the value of things very much by compariſon, and the proſpect of obtaining them. In
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010235_0028_0F7E0AA00D9DBF90"/>
nature and duration the bleſſings above far ſurpaſs any thing below. While they are at a diſtance the ſuperiority does not appear in a ſtriking light, but brought near to the ſoul how is every enchanting object here diminiſhed! Still does the eſtimation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe when there is ſtrong conſolation through grace of an heirſhip to them.</p>
            <p>WITH this faith and hope who among the ſons of the mighty can burn with reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſires of mounting higher in the ſcale of human glory, indifferent to any methods of advancement however baſe or unworthy? Incongruous herewith is an inſatiable gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of wealth, an unbridled appetite to the wages of unrighteouſneſs. The <hi>crown which fadeth not away reſerved in heaven,</hi> and a fair reverſionary <hi>inheritance</hi> in the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> which <hi>cannot be moved,</hi> being objects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the mind is fixed, temptations from this world muſt loſe their ſtrength.</p>
            <p>THAT God is not unrighteous to forget the <hi>work,</hi> and <hi>labour of love ſhewed towards his name</hi> and people, being deeply imbib'd in the heart, is a powerful impulſe with a ruler to unſhaken perſeverance in duty. <hi>By
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010235_0029_0F7E0AA0A0643898"/>
patient continuance in well doing,</hi>—with a zeal unabated by reſentment, undiſmayed by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, he <hi>ſeeks for</hi> the ſublime <hi>honour,</hi> the immenſe treaſures of <hi>immortality.</hi> If his work is attended with embarraſſments very exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing, diſcharging it with fidelity 'tis enough that this <hi>work is with the Lord</hi> and his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his God;</hi>—that God who with unerring rectitude weighs the actions of his ſervants, with all the enhancing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending them, and will award a fate accordingly, in that day when the kings of the earth, and great men, ſhall in their united nature ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt, to receive a deciſive ſentence for eternity.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the ſentiments which ariſe in contemplation upon this text of ſacred ſcripture, which ſhould be wrote in deep and laſting characters upon the hearts of every one that ruleth over men, and upon which the general temper and tenor of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be formed.

How great is the privilege by which civil rulers are diſtinguiſhed by God, while they have it in their hands above moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do good to his people?—a privilege this with which the external badges of greatneſs, the tokens of ſubmiſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect juſtly belonging to them, or the moſt ample revenues annex'd to their office, are not worthy to be compared;—a privilege augmented according to the elevation of dignity.</p>
            <p>THE chief magiſtrate of this province hath eminent <hi>advantages</hi> to <hi>ſerve this people.</hi> With pleaſure we own his <hi>capacity,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his diſpoſition to improve <hi>it</hi> for this purpoſe.

            <p>THROUGH the tender mercy of our God upon us the day is returned wherein the elective power veſted in two branches of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010235_0031_0F7E0AA1B1E64AC0"/>
the legiſlature for our benefit is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The ſubject upon which I have been treating points out their duty in the choice of his Majeſty's Council. So great a truſt as is lodg'd in this part of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, moſt certainly ought to be repoſed in ſuch as manifeſt an high opinion of the kind ends for which government is inſtituted, and their value of a place in it for the exerciſe of a benevolent public ſpirit,—who in addition to political wiſdom, diſcover a mind impreſſed with a ſenſe of religion, which will render them impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to any attacks upon their virtue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with heroic fortitude in every exigency, and an unſhaken reſolution to ſpend and be ſpent in the execution of the charge devolved on them. In the choice of ſuch the whole community is greatly intereſted. Sollicitude that theſe have a ſeat at the Council Board will poſſeſs each one upon whom it depends, who is deſirous of the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, and of giving up his account with joy. Fully perſwaded of the critical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the moſt High, and impartially conſulting the monitor within, we truſt the heads of our tribes will ſo act this day,

as that they and we may rejoice together,—they in remembrance of their upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we in the bleſſings derived from it.</p>
            <p>MAY God be preſent with the <hi>Aſſembly of the mighty</hi> through the year, inſtructing his ſervants in <hi>the things of our peace,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining them with one heart and one ſoul to purſue them.</p>
            <p>THE burdens of faithful magiſtrates are at all times heavy, but have been greatly increaſed in the months which have paſſed over us. Serious perſons anxious for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and offspring, have not been unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the perplexing cares of their rulers, nor without deſires that they might be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>UNDER our ſorrows and diſtreſſes, we have not been without conſolatory proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and thoſe upon whoſe hearts the proſperity of Zion hath laid, while they have <hi>poured out tears unto God,</hi> have revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their minds ſuch things as have mightily ſupported them.</p>

OUR fathers melted when they parted from their native country,—as leaving a parent, and taught their offspring to eſteem it as a mother. Diſmiſſed from her boſom they and we have been afflicted in all her afflictions, and triumphed in her proſperity. No event hath happened to her which we have not ſenſibly felt. Looking upon her always as our mother country, we have looked upon ourſelves as children,—of the ſame family. Our connection therefore with her hath led us into dependance of ſeeing <hi>peace in her peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AT a diſtance from the throne, with duty to our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> we have confided in him, to give us favourable audience, and extend his paternal concern to the remoteſt parts of his dominions,—a <hi>Sovereign</hi> who taketh pleaſure in the happineſs of his people.</p>
            <p>THE wiſdom of a Britiſh parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to equity—to the welfare of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout, muſt always incline to a review of every important affair as more light is offered—to allow due weight to the repreſentations that are made, to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which are propoſed.</p>

WITH ſuch conſiderations hath the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude of our minds been much allayed, our ultimate truſt being ſtill in the <hi>hope of Iſrael and the ſaviour thereof in the time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have <hi>waited for thy ſalvation O God as they that watch for the morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE mercy of the Lord hath been upon us according as we have hoped in him.</hi> God hath ſpoken in his providence, ſaying, <hi>let there be light, and it is light;</hi> we ſee it and are glad. May God be duly acknowledged, whoſe goodneſs is unfailing. May our warmeſt affections flow to our King, and his government! May thoſe who have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly intereſted themſelves in our behalf be had by us in everlaſting grateful remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance!</p>
            <p>WHILE every eye ſparkles with joy, and every mouth is opened in mutual congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations, how natural is it in a fulneſs of ſpirit, to anticipate the bleſſings concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with privileges freely enjoyed,—to look forward to a diſtant day? We behold the wilderneſs bloſſoming like a roſe, under
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010235_0035_0F7E0AA934A416E8"/>
the cultivation of the hand of induſtry. We behold our commercial intereſts flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,—the land of our original pouring in her ample ſtores upon us, for <hi>convenience</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> we making as ample returns, to the increaſe of her <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>opulence.</hi> We behold a race of princes proceeding from the illuſtrious Houſe which now reigns, ruling over Great-Britain and her American colonies, 'till theſe colonies and Britain are no more.</p>
            <p>BUT in the midſt of our tranſports let us think ſoberly. Indulging high expectations of <hi>ſeeing the good of</hi> God'<hi>s choſen,</hi> we ought to remember that liberty,—the beſt civil privileges which can be imagined, by no means neceſſitate the happineſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. With theſe alone, with theſe miſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, we do but dream of becoming great and glorious.</p>
            <p>IF when that is removed which ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed our ſpirits, inteſtine heats ſhould prevail, and every thing be made matter of ſharp diſpute, if we ſhould crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into parties, each one ſtriving with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence for the maſtery, if crowned with
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010235_0036_0F7E0AA9FA95E4F0"/>
proſperity we ſhould grow proud in heart, and forget God, and make proficiency in extravagance, luxury, and every vice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon plenty, how ſad would be our condition? This (I was going to ſay) would be like children, to throw away what we now ſeem ſo much pleaſed with; happy if no more than children we were reſponſible for our conduct. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is not ſtrong enough. This is more than merely to neglect the proper improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the gifts of God,—'tis turning them againſt our ſupreme benefactor, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the means of happineſs to our ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated ruin. <hi>Rejecting the counſel of God againſt ourſelves,</hi> we cannot look for any thing but <hi>deſtruction</hi> to advance like an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable <hi>whirlwind,</hi> and that when <hi>we call,</hi> God ſhould <hi>refuſe to hear,</hi>—that he ſhould <hi>laugh at our calamity,</hi> and <hi>mock</hi> when terror invades us.</p>
            <p>BUT we hope better things,—that our liberty will be uſed by all ranks and orders, as the <hi>ſervants of God,</hi> that in love we ſhall aſſiſt and ſupport one another—that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhall ſerve God in <hi>truth,</hi> and with a <hi>perfect heart, conſidering what great things he hath done for us.</hi>

THE truths which have been expatiated upon this morning as agreable to my text, are not unapplicable to a people. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of civil adminiſtration being the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of communities, it is clear that unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſubmiſſion,—ſubmiſſion in all caſes, cannot be duty. It is as clear that when in the general adminiſtration this deſign is kept in view, and proſecuted, reſpect and ſubjection are due to thoſe concerned in it. If rulers are to have habitual regard to the approbation of heaven, the dictates of conſcience, and future bleſſedneſs, ſo ſhould thoſe in inferior ſtations. The civil diſtinctions which ſubſiſt here among men, although neceſſary to the well-being of the world, are yet but ſmall, compared with that moral and probationary light, in which all mankind are to be conſidered as ſtanding upon a level.</p>
            <p>IF theſe things are ſuitably digeſted we ſhall be led to that temper, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which forming the general character, cannot fail to make us happy.</p>
            <p>MAY God imprint them upon our hearts, and fulfil to us his ancient promiſes, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

            <p>
               <hi>O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt, and not comforted, behold I will lay thy ſtones with fair colours, and lay thy foundations with ſapphires.—For braſs I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring ſilver, and for wood braſs, and for ſtones iron: I will alſo make thine officers peace, and thine exactors righteouſneſs.—Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous; they ſhall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</hi>
