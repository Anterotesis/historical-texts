            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PRESIDENT</hi> EDWARDS, in the eſteem of all the judicious, who were well acquainted with him, either perſonally, or by his writings, was one of the <hi>greateſt—beſt</hi>—and <hi>moſt uſeful</hi> of men, that have lived in this age.</p>
                  <p>He diſcover'd himſelf to be one of the <hi>greateſt of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> by his converſation, preaching and writings: One of remarkable ſtrength of mind, clearneſs of thought, and depth of penetration, who well underſtood, and was able, above moſt others, to vindicate the great doctrines of chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>And no one perhaps has been in our day, more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally eſteemed and acknowledged to be a <hi>bright chriſtian,</hi> an eminently <hi>good man.</hi> His love to God and man; his zeal for God and his cauſe; his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, humility, ſelf-denial, and weanedneſs from the world; his cloſe walk with God; his conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, conſtant and univerſal obedience, in all exact and holy ways of living: In one word, the goodneſs, the holineſs of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s heart, has been as evident and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, as the uncommon greatneſs and ſtrength of his underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And that this diſtinguiſhed light has not ſhone in vain, there are a cloud of witneſſes. God who gave him his great talents, led him into a way of improving them, both by preaching and writing, which has doubtleſs proved the means of converting many from the error of their ways; and of greatly promoting the
<pb facs="unknown:009961_0004_0F7B3F08C81127B0"/>
intereſt of Chriſt's church, both in <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> And there is reaſon to hope, that tho' he is now dead, he will yet ſpeak for a great whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> yet to come, to the great comfort and advantage of the church of Chriſt; that his publications will produce a yet greater harveſt, as an addition to his joy and crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>But the deſign of the following memoirs, is not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to publiſh theſe things, and tell the world how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently great, wiſe, holy and uſeful Preſident <hi>Edwards</hi> was; but rather to inform in what way, and by what means he attained to ſuch an uncommon ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and holineſs; and how, in the improvement of this, he did ſo much good to mankind; that others may hereby be directed and excited to go and do likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>The reader is therefore not to expect a meer encomium on the <hi>dead,</hi> but a faithful and plain narration of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact, together with his own internal exerciſes, expreſs'd in his own words; and is deſired not to look on the following compoſure ſo much an act of friendſhip to the <hi>dead,</hi> as of kindneſs to the <hi>living;</hi> it being only an attempt to render a life that has been greatly uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, yet more ſo. And as this is deſigned for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's good, he is deſired to remember, that if he gets no benefit hereby; is not made wiſer nor better, gains no ſkill or diſpoſition to live an holy and uſeful life, all is in vain as to him.</p>
                  <p>IN this world, ſo full of darkneſs and deluſion, it is of great importance that all ſhould be able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between true religion and that which is falſe. In this, perhaps none has taken more pains, or labour'd more ſucceſsfully, than he whoſe life is ſet before the reader. And it is preſumed that his religious reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, exerciſes and conduct here exhibited, will ſerve well to exemplify and illuſtrate all that he has wrote on
<pb facs="unknown:009961_0005_0F7B3F0978220A78"/>
this ſubject. Here pure and undefiled religion, in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all counterfeits, appears in life and practice, exhibiting a picture which will tend to inſtruct, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and comfort all thoſe, who in their religious ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and exerciſes, are built on the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, of which Jeſus Chriſt is the chief corner ſtone; while their hearts and practice in ſome meaſure anſwer to it, as in water; face anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to face. And here, they who have hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily been in darkneſs and deluſion, in this infinitely important affair, may have matter of inſtruction and conviction.</p>
                  <p>This is a point about which, above many other, the proteſtant world is in the dark, and needs inſtruction, as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was more and more convinced, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he lived; and which he was wont frequently to obſerve in converſation. If therefore theſe his remains are adapted to anſwer this end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and may be conſidered as a word behind all to whom they ſhall come, "ſaying, THIS IS THE WAY, walk ye in it", and ſhall in this view, be bleſſed to many, it will be a relief under one of the greateſt calamities that attend the chriſtian world, and promote that important end, ſo worthy the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tention and purſuit of all; and in which he from whom this mantle falls, was zealouſly engaged, and which he purſued to the end of his life.</p>
                  <p>In this view eſpecially, is the following life offered to the public, with an earneſt deſire that every reader may faithfully improve it to this purpoſe; while he candidly overlooks any improprieties and defects which he may obſerve to be chargeable on the compiler; who is he knows, in a great degree unequal to what is here attempted.</p>

Mr. TIMOTHY EDWARDS, Miniſter of the Goſpel on the eaſt Side of <hi>Connecticut</hi> River in <hi>Windſor.</hi> He began to reſide and preach at <hi>Windſor</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 1694 but was not ordained till <hi>July,</hi> 1698. He died <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. 1758. in the 89th Year of his Age, not two Months before this his SON. He was in the Work of the Miniſtry above 59 Years: And from his firſt beginning to reſide and preach there, to his Death, are above 63 Years; and was able to attend on the Work of the Miniſtry and preach conſtantly till within a few Years before his Death. He was very univerſally eſteemed &amp; beloved as an upright, pious, exemplary Man, and faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel; and was greatly uſeful. He was born at <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, May</hi> 14. 1669, received the Honours of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> by having the Degrees of Batchelor and Maſter of Arts given him the ſame Day, <hi>July</hi> 4. 1694, one in the Forenoon, and the other in the Afternoon.</p>

They lived together in the married State above 63 Years. Mrs. EDWARDS was born <hi>June</hi> 2. 1672, and is now living in her 89th Year, remarkable for the little decay of her mental Powers at ſo great an Age.</p>
                     <p>THEY had eleven Children: All which lived to adult Years, viz ten Daughters, ſeven of whom are now living, and this their only Son and fifth Child.<note n="*" place="bottom">

He was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable as a Politician, and for his Spirit of Government; a wiſe Counſellor, an upright and ſkilful Judge, a ſteady and great Friend to the Intereſt of Religion. He was a great Friend and Admirer of Mr <hi>Edwards,</hi> and greatly ſtrengthen'd his Hands in the Work of the Miniſtry while he lived.

He had the Character of a ſober Youth, and a good Scholar while he was a Member of the College. In his ſecond Year at College, and thirteenth of his Age, he read <hi>Locke</hi> on the human Underſtanding, with great delight and profit. His

uncommon Genius, by which he was, as it were by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, form'd for cloſeneſs of Thought and deep Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now began to exerciſe and diſcover it ſelf. Taking that Book into his Hand, upon ſome Occaſion, not long before his Death, he ſaid to ſome of his ſelect Friends, who were then with him. That he was beyond Expreſſion extertain'd and pleas'd with it, when he read it in his Youth at College; that he was as much engaged, and had more Satisfaction and Pleaſure in ſtudying it, than the moſt greedy Miſer in gathering up handfuls of Silver and Gold from ſome new diſcovered Treaſure.</p>
                     <p>THO' he made good Proficiency in all the Arts and Sciences, and had an uncommon Taſte for natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which he cultivated to the end of his Life, with that juſtneſs and accuracy of Thought which was almoſt peculiar to him; yet moral Philoſophy or Divinity w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>HE lived at College near two Years after he took his firſt Degree, deſigning and preparing for the Work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. After which, having paſſed the pre-requiſite Trials, he was licenced to preach the Goſpel as a Candidate. And being pitched upon, and applied to by a Number of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in <hi>New-England,</hi> who were intruſted to act in Behalf of the Engliſh Preſbyterians at <hi>New-York,</hi> as a fit Perſon to be ſent to them, he complied with their Requeſt, and went to <hi>New-York</hi> the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1722; and preach'd there to very good Acceptance about eight Months But by Reaſon of the Smallneſs of that Society, and ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Difficulties that attended it, he did not think they were in a Capacity to ſettle a Miniſter, with a rational Proſpect of anſwering the good Ends propoſed. He therefore left them, the next Spring, and retired to his Father's Houſe; where he ſpent the Summer in cloſe Study. He was indeed earneſtly ſolicited by the People he had been among at <hi>New-York</hi> to return to them again; but for the Reaſon juſt mentioned, he could not think himſelf in the way of his Duty to gratify them.</p>

                           <hi>"SAturday, December</hi> 22. 1722. This Day revived by God's Spirit. Affected with the Senſe of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Holineſs. Felt more exerciſe of Love to Chriſt than uſual. Have alſo felt ſenſible Repentance of Sin, becauſe it was committed againſt ſo merciful and good a God. This Night made the 37th Reſolution.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sabbath Day-Night, Dec.</hi> 23. Made the 38th Reſolution.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Wedneſday, January</hi> 2 1722, 3. Dull. I find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that let me make Reſolutions, and do what I will, with never ſo many Inventions, it is all nothing, and to no Purpoſe at all, without the Motions of the Spirit of God: for if the Spirit of God ſhould be as much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from me always, as for the Week paſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all I do, I ſhould not grow; but ſhould lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and miſerably fade away — There is no Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon my ſelf. It is to no Purpoſe to reſolve, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we depend on the Grace of God; for if it were not for his meer Grace, one might be a very good Man one Day, and a very wicked one the next.</p>

                           <hi>Sabbath-Day, Jan.</hi> 6. at Night. Much concerned about the improvement of precious Time. Intend to live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Mortification, without ceaſing, as long as in this World.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 8. in the Morning. Higher Thoughts than uſual, of the Excellency of Chriſt, and felt an unuſual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of Sin therefrom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wedneſday, Jan.</hi> 9. at Night. Decayed. I am ſometimes apt to think, I have a great deal more of Holineſs than I have. I find now and then, that abominable Corruption which is directly contrary to what I read of eminent Chriſtians.— How deceitful is my Heart! I take up a ſtrong Reſolution, but how ſoon does it weaken!</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thurſday, Jan.</hi> 10. about Noon. Reviving. 'Tis a great Diſhonour to Chriſt, in whom I hope I have an Intereſt, to be uneaſy at my worldly State and Condition. When I ſee the Proſperity of others, and that all Things go eaſy with them; the World is ſmooth to them, and they are

happy in many Reſpects, and very proſperous, or are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to much Honour &amp;c. to grudge and envy them, or be the leaſt uneaſy at it; to wiſh or long for the ſame Proſperity, and that it would ever be ſo with me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded always to rejoyce in every one's Proſperity, and to expect for my ſelf no Happineſs of that Nature as long as I live; but depend upon Afflictions, and betake my ſelf entirely to another Happineſs.</p>
                        <p>I think I find my ſelf much more ſprightly and healthy, both in Body and Mind, for my Self-denial in eating, drinking, and ſleeping.</p>
                        <p>I think it would be advantageous every Morning to conſider my Buſineſs and Temptations; and what Sins I ſhall be expoſed to that Day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make a Reſolution how to improve the Day, and to avoid thoſe Sins. And ſo at the beginning of every Week, Month and Year.</p>
                        <p>I never knew before what was meant by not ſetting our Hearts upon theſe Things. 'Tis, not to care about them, to depend upon them, to afflict our ſelves much with Fears of loſing them, nor pleaſe our ſelves with Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obtaining them, or hope of the Continuance of them At Night made the 41ſt Reſolution.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saturday, Jan.</hi> 12. in the Morning. I have this Day ſolemnly renewed my baptiſmal Covenant and Self-Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which I renewed when I was received into the Communion of the Church. I have been before God; and have given my ſelf, all that I am and have to GOD, ſo that I am not in any Reſpect my own: I can challenge no Right in my ſelf, I can challenge no Right in this Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, this Will, theſe Affections that are in me; neither have I any right to this Body, or any of its Members: No Right to this Tongue, theſe Hands, nor Feet: no Right to theſe Senſes, theſe Eyes, theſe Ears, this Smell or Taſte. I have given my ſelf clear away, and have not retained any Thing as my own. I have been to GOD this Morning, and told Him that I gave my ſelf <hi>wholly</hi> to him. I have given every Power to him; ſo that for the future I will challenge no Right in my ſelf, in any Reſpect. I have expreſly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Him, and do now promiſe Almighty God, that by his Grace I will not. I have this Morning told Him, that I did take Him for my whole Portion and Felicity, looking on nothing elſe as any Part of my Happineſs, nor acting as if it were; and his Law for the conſtant
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009961_0020_0F7B3F171C135120"/>
Rule of my Obedience: and would fight with all my Might againſt the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, to the End of my Life. And did believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as a Prince and a Saviour; and would adhere to the Faith and Obedience of the Goſpel, how hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and difficult ſoever the Profeſſion and Practice of it may be. That I did receive the bleſſed Spirit as my Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, Sanctifier and only Comforter; and cheriſh all his Motions to enlighten, purify, confirm, comfort and aſſiſt me. This I have done. And I pray God, for the ſake of Chriſt, to look upon it as a Self-Dedication; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me now as entirely his own, and deal with me in all Reſpects as ſuch; whether he afflicts me or proſpers me, or whatever he pleaſes to do with me, who am his. Now, henceforth I am not to act in any Reſpect as my own.— I ſhall act as my own, if I ever make uſe of any of my Powers to any thing that is not to the glory of God, and don't make the glorifying Him my whole and entire Buſineſs; if I murmur in the leaſt at Afflictions; if I grieve at the Proſperity of others; if I am any way uncharitable; if I am angry becauſe of Injuries; if I revenge: If I do any thing, purely to pleaſe my ſelf, or if I avoid any thing for the ſake of my Eaſe: If I omit any thing becauſe it is great Self-denial: If I truſt to my ſelf: If I take any of the Praiſe of any Good that I do, or rather GOD does by me; or if I am any way proud.</p>
                        <p>This Day made the 42d and 43d Reſolutions.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Monday, Jan.</hi> 14 — The Dedication I made of my ſelf to my God, on Saturday laſt, has been exceeding uſeful to me. I thought I had a more ſpiritual inſight into the Scripture, reading the 8th Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than ever in my Life before.</p>
                        <p>Great Inſtances of Mortification are deep Wounds given to the Body of Sin, hard Bows that make him ſtagger and reel: we thereby get great Ground and footing againſt him.—While we live without great Inſtances of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Self-denial, the old Man keeps whereabouts he was; for he is ſturdy and obſtinate, and will not ſtir for ſmall Blows. After the greateſt Mortifications, I always find the greateſt Comfort.</p>
                        <p>Suppoſing there was never but one compleat Chriſtian, in all Reſpects of a right Stamp, having Chriſtianity ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its true Luſtre, at a time in the World; Reſolved

to act juſt as I would do, if I ſtrove with all my Might to be that One, that ſhould be in my Time.</p>

                           <hi>Tueſday, Jan.</hi> 15. It ſeemed Yeſterday, the Day before and Saturday, that I ſhould always retain the ſame Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to the ſame Height, but alas, how ſoon do I decay! O, how weak, how infirm, how unable to do any thing am I! What a poor, inconſiſtent, what a miſerable Wretch, without the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit! While I ſtand, I am ready to think I ſtand in my own Strength, and upon my own Legs; and I am ready to triumph over my Enemies, as if it were I my ſelf that cauſed them to flee: when alas! I am but a poor Infant, upheld by Jeſus Chriſt; who holds me up, and gives me Liberty to ſmile to ſee my Enemies flee, when he drives them before me; and ſo I laugh, as tho' I my ſelf did it, when it is only Jeſus Chriſt leads me along, and fights Himſelf againſt my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And now the Lord has a little left me, and how weak do I find my ſelf! O, let it teach me to depend leſs on my ſelf, to be more humble, and to give more of the praiſe of my Ability to Jeſus Chriſt. The Heart of Man is deceitful above all Things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</p>

Lord, grant that from hence I may learn to withdraw my Thoughts, Affections, Deſires and Expectations, intirely from the World, and may fix them upon the heavenly State; where there is fulneſs of Joy; where reigns heavenly, ſweet, calm and delightful Love without Alloy; where there are continually the deareſt Expreſſions of their Love: where there is the Enjoyment of the Perſons loved, without ever parting: where thoſe Perſons, who appear ſo lovely in this World, will really be inexpreſſibly more lovely, and full of Love to us. How ſweetly will the mutual Lovers join together to ſing the Praiſes of God and the Lamb! How full will it fill us with Joy to think, this Enjoyment, theſe ſweet Exerciſes, will never ceaſe or come to an End, but will laſt to all Eternity.</p>

                        <head>SECTION III. REFLECTION <hi>on the foregoing</hi> EXTRACTS.</head>
                        <p>THE foregoing Extracts were wrote by Mr. EDWARDS in the 20th and 21ſt Years of his Age, as appears by the Dates. This being kept in Mind, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader will make proper Allowance for ſome Things, which may appear a little Juvenile, or like a young Chriſtian, as to the Matter, or Manner of Expreſſion; which would not have been found, had it not have been done in early Life. Which, indeed are no Blemiſhes, the whole being taken together: as by this, it appears more natural, and the Strength of his Reſolution, and fervor of Mind; and his Skill and Diſcerning in divine Things, ſo ſeldom found even in old Age, are the more ſtriking. And in this View, we ſhall be led to admire his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Strictneſs, his Zeal and Painfulneſs, his Experience and Judgment in true Religion, at ſo early an Age. For here are not only the moſt convincing Evidences of Sincerity and thorough Religion, of his engaging in a Life devoted to GOD in good earneſt, ſo as to make Religion his only Buſineſs; but thro' his great Attention to this Matter, he appears to have the Judgment and Experience of grey Hairs.</p>
                        <p>THIS is the Beginning of a Life ſo eminently holy &amp; uſeful as Mr. EDWARDS's was. He who became one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Divines in this Age; has had the Applauſe and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>America, Britain, Holland,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germany,</hi> for his Piety, and great Judgment &amp; Skill in Divinity; and has been honored above moſt others in the Chriſtian World, in this Century;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009961_0030_0F7B3F1F39844DE0"/>
in his being made the Inſtrument of doing ſo much good: HE began his Life thus: He enter'd on a publick Life with ſuch Views, ſuch Exerciſes, ſuch Reſolutions.</p>
                        <p>THIS may ſerve as a Direction and Excitement to thoſe who are Young, to devote themſelves to GOD in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and enter on the Buſineſs of ſtrict and thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without delay: eſpecially thoſe who are looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Work of the Miniſtry, as they would take the moſt direct, the only Way to anſwer the good Ends which they profeſs to ſeek.</p>
                        <p>IT is to be lamented, that there is ſo much Reaſon to think, there are ſo few Inſtances of ſuch early Piety in our Day. If the proteſtant World abounded with young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of this Stamp; with young Men, who were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Work of the Miniſtry, with ſuch a Temper, ſuch Exerciſes, and ſuch Reſolutions, what a delightful Proſpect would this afford, of the near approach of happier Days, than the Church of GOD has ever yet ſeen! What pleaſing Hopes that the great, the merciful Head of the Church, was about to ſend forth Labourers, faithful, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Labourers into his Harveſt; and bleſs his People with "Paſtors which ſhall teach them with Knowledge and Underſtanding!"</p>
                        <p>BUT if our Youth neglect all proper Improvement of the Mind; are ſhy of Seriouſneſs and ſtrict Piety; chooſe to live Strangers to it, and keep at a Diſtance from all Appearance of it; are wanton, and given to carnal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; what a gloomy Proſpect does this afford! If they who enter into the Work of the Miniſtry; from a gay, careleſs, and what may juſtly be called a vicious Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to a little ſuperficial ſtudy of Divinity, and ſoon begin to preach; while all the external Seriouſneſs and Zeal they put on, is only from worldly Motives; they being without any inward, experimental Acquaintance with ſpiritual, divine Things, and even ſo much as any Taſte for true Divinity; no wonder if the Churches "ſuck dry Breaſts"; and there are many ignorant Watchmen</p>
                        <p>BUT, as the beſt Comment on the foregoing Reſolutions and Diary; and that the Reader may have a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, full and inſtructive View of Mr. EDWARDS's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on a religious Life, and Progreſs in it, as conſiſting in the Views and Exerciſes of his Mind; a brief Account
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009961_0031_0F7B3F21749C27A8"/>
thereof is here inſerted, which was found among his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in his own Hand-writing: and which, it ſeems, was wrote near twenty Years after, for his own private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>I Had a variety of Concerns and Exerciſes about my Soul from my Childhood; but had two more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seaſons of Awakening, before I met with that Change, by which I was brought to thoſe new Diſpoſitions, and that new Senſe of Things, that I have ſince had. The firſt Time was when I was a Boy, ſome Years before I went to College, at a Time of remarkable Awakening in my Father's Congregation. I was then very much affected for many Months, and concerned about the Things of Religion, and my Soul's Salvation; and was abundant in Duties. I uſed to pray five times a Day in ſecret, and to ſpend much Time in religious Talk with other Boys; and uſed to meet with them to pray together. I experienced I know not what Kind of Delight in Religion. My Mind was much engaged in it, and had much ſelf-righteous Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and it was my Delight to abound in religious Duties. I, with ſome of my School-mates joined together, and built a Booth in a Swamp, in a very ſecret and retired Place, for a place of Prayer. And beſides, I had particular ſecret Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my own in the Woods, where I uſed to retire by my ſelf; and uſed to be from time to time much affected. My Affections ſeemed to be lively and eaſily moved, and I ſeemed to be in my Element, when engaged in religious Duties. And I am ready to think, many are deceived with ſuch Affections, and ſuch a kind of Delight, as I then had in Religion, and miſtake it for Grace.</p>
                        <p>"BUT in proceſs of Time, my Convictions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wore off; and I entirely loſt all thoſe Affections and Delights, and left off ſecret Prayer, at leaſt as to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Performance of it; and returned like a Dog to his Vomit, and went on in Ways of Sin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="24" facs="unknown:009961_0032_0F7B3F2220189168"/>"INDEED, I was at ſome Times very uneaſy, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter Part of the Time of my being at College. 'Till it pleas'd GOD, in my laſt Year at College, at a Time when I was in the midſt of many uneaſy Thoughts about the State of my Soul, to ſeize me with a Pleuriſy; in which he brought me nigh to the Grave, and ſhook me over the Pit of Hell.</p>
                        <p>"BUT yet, it was not long after my Recovery, before I fell again into my old Ways of Sin. But God would not ſuffer me to go on with any Quietneſs; but I had great and violent inward Struggles: 'till after many Conflicts with wicked Inclinations, and repeated Reſolutions, and Bonds that I laid my ſelf under by a kind of Vows to God, I was brought wholly to break off all former wicked Ways, and all Ways of known outward Sin; and to apply my ſelf to ſeek my Salvation, and practiſe the Duties of Religion: But without that kind of Affection and Delight, that I had formerly experienced. My Concern now wrought more by inward Struggles and Conflicts, and Self-reflections. I made ſeeking my Salvation the main Buſineſs of my Life. But yet it ſeems to me, I ſought after a miſerable manner: Which has made me ſome times ſince to queſtion, whether ever it iſſued in that which was ſaving; being ready to doubt, whether ſuch miſerable ſeeking was ever ſucceeded. But yet I was brought to ſeek Salvation, in a manner that I never was before. I felt a Spirit to part with all Things in the World, for an Intereſt in Chriſt. My Concern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and prevailed, with many exerciſing Things and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Struggles; but yet it never ſeemed to be proper to expreſs my Concern that I had, by the Name of Terror.</p>
                        <p>"FROM my Childhood up, my Mind had been wont to be full of Objections againſt the Doctrine of GOD's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, in chooſing whom he would to eternal Life, and rejecting whom he pleaſed; leaving them eternally to periſh, and be everlaſtingly tormented in Hell. It uſed to appear like a horrible Doctrine to me. But I remember the Time very well, when I ſeemed to be convinced, and fully ſatisfied, as to this Sovereignty of God, and his Juſtice in thus eternally diſpoſing of Men, according to his ſovereign Pleaſure. But never could give an Acccount, how, or by what Means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was thus convinced; not in the leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009961_0033_0F7B3F23473039A8"/>
there was any extraordinary Influence of God's Spirit in it: but only that now I ſaw further, and my Reaſon appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of it. However, my Mind reſted in it; and it put an end to all thoſe Cavils and Objections, that had 'till then abode with me, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding part of my Life. And there has been a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Alteration in my Mind, with reſpect to the Doctrine of God's Sovereignty, from that Day to this; ſo that I ſcarce ever have found ſo much as the riſing of an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God's Sovereignty, in the moſt abſolute Senſe, in ſhewing Mercy on whom he will ſhew Mercy, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dening and eternally damning whom he will. God's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Sovereignty, and Juſtice, with reſpect to Salvation and Damnation, is what my Mind ſeems to reſt aſſured of, as much as of any Thing that I ſee with my Eyes; at leaſt it is ſo at Times. But I have often times ſince that firſt Conviction, had quite another Kind of Senſe of God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, than I had then. I have often ſince, not only had a Conviction, but a <hi>delightful</hi> Conviction. The Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of God's Sovereignty has very often appeared, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding pleaſant, bright and ſweet Doctrine to me: and abſolute Sovereignty is what I love to aſcribe to God. But my firſt Conviction was not with this.</p>
                        <p>"THE firſt that I remember that ever I found any thing of that Sort of inward, ſweet Delight in GOD and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, that I have lived much in ſince, was on reading thoſe Words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i. 17. "Now unto the King eternal, immortal, inviſible, the only wiſe GOD, be Honor and Glory for ever and ever, Amen." As I read the Words, there came into my Soul, and was as it were diffuſed thro' it, a Senſe of the Glory of the Divine Being; a new Senſe, quite different from any Thing I ever expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced before. Never any Words of Scripture ſeemed to me as theſe Words did. I thought with my ſelf, how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Being that was; and how happy I ſhould be, if I might enjoy that GOD, and be wrapt up to GOD in Heaven, and be as it were ſwallowed up in Him. I kept ſaying, and as it were ſinging over theſe Words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to my ſelf; and went to Prayer, to pray to GOD that I might enjoy him; and prayed in a manner quite different from what I uſed to do; with a new ſort of Affection. But it never came into my Thought, that there was any thing ſpiritual, or of a ſaving Nature in this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="26" facs="unknown:009961_0034_0F7B3F23C2A12050"/>"FROM about that Time, I began to have a new Kind of Apprehenſions and Ideas of Chriſt, and the Work of Redemption, and the glorious Way of Salvation by him. I had an inward, ſweet Senſe of theſe Things, that at times came into my Heart; and my Soul was led away in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Views and Contemplations of them. And my Mind was greatly engaged, to ſpend my Time in reading and meditating on Chriſt; and the Beauty and Excellency of his Perſon, and the lovely Way of Salvation, by free Grace in him. I found no Books ſo delightful to me, as thoſe that treated of theſe Subjects. Thoſe Words <hi>Cant.</hi> ii. 1. uſed to be abundantly with me: <hi>I am the Roſe of Sharon, the Lilly of the Valleys.</hi> The Words ſeemed to me, ſweetly to repreſent, the Lovelineſs and Beauty of Jeſus Chriſt. And the whole Book of Canticles uſed to be pleaſant to me; and I uſed to be much in reading it, about that time. And found, from Time to Time, an inward Sweetneſs, that uſed, as it were, to carry me away in my Contemplations; in what I know not how to expreſs otherwiſe, than by a calm, ſweet Abſtraction of Soul from all the Concerns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o this World; and a kind of Viſion, or fix'd Ideas and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, of being alone in the Mountains, or ſome ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Wilderneſs, far from all Mankind, ſweetly converſing with Chriſt, and wrapt and ſwallowed up in GOD. The Senſe I had of divine Things, would often of a ſudden as it were, kindle up a ſweet burning in my Heart; an ardor of my Soul, that I know not how to expreſs.</p>
                        <p>"NOT long after I firſt began to experience theſe Things, I gave an Account to my Father, of ſome Things that had paſs'd in my Mind. I was pretty much affected by the Diſcourſe we had together. And when the Diſcourſe was ended, I walked abroad alone, in a ſolitary Place in my Father's Paſture, for Contemplation. And as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and looked up on the Sky and Clouds; there came into my Mind, a ſweet Senſe of the glorious Majeſty and Grace of GOD, that I know not how to expreſs. I ſeemed to ſee them both in a ſweet Conjunction: Majeſty and Meekneſs join'd together: it was a ſweet and gentle, and holy Majeſty; and alſo a majeſtick Meekneſs; an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sweetneſs; a high, and great, and holy Gentleneſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="unknown:009961_0035_0F7B3F248067FD18"/>"AFTER this my Senſe of divine Things gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and became more and more lively, and had more of that inward Sweetneſs. The Appearance of every thing was altered: there ſeem'd to be, as it were, a calm, ſweet Caſt, or Appearance of divine Glory, in almoſt every Thing. God's Excellency, his Wiſdom, his Purity and Love, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear in every Thing; in the Sun, Moon and Stars; in the Clouds, and blue Sky; in the Graſs, Flowers, Trees; in the Water, and all Nature; which uſed greatly to fix my Mind. I often uſed to ſit &amp; view the Moon, for a long time; and ſo in the Day time, ſpent much time in viewing the Clouds &amp; Sky, to behold the ſweet Glory of GOD in theſe Things: in the mean Time, ſinging forth with a low Voice, my Contemplations of the Creator &amp; Redeemer. And ſcarce any Thing, among all the Works of Nature, was ſo ſweet to me as Thunder and Lightning. Formerly, nothing had been ſo terrible to me. I uſed to be a Perſon uncommon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified with Thunder: and it uſed to ſtrike me with Terror, when I ſaw a Thunder-ſtorm riſing. But now, on the contrary, it rejoyced me. I felt GOD at the firſt Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a Thunder-ſtorm. And uſed to take the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity at ſuch Times, to fix my ſelf to view the Clouds, and ſee the Lightnings play, and hear the majeſtick &amp; awful Voice of God's Thunder: which often times was exceeding en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining, leading me to ſweet Contemplations of my great and glorious GOD. And while I viewed, uſed to ſpend my time, as it always ſeem'd natural to me, to ſing or chant forth my Meditations; to ſpeak my Thoughts in Soliloquies, and ſpeak with a ſinging Voice.</p>
                        <p>"I felt then a great Satisfaction as to my good Eſtate. But that did not content me. I had vehement Longings of Soul after GOD and CHRIST, and after more Holineſs; wherewith my Heart ſeemed to be full, and ready to break: which often brought to my Mind, the Words of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, Pſal. cxix. 28. <hi>My Soul breaketh for the Longing it hath.</hi> I often felt a mourning and lamenting in my Heart, that I had not turned to GOD ſooner, that I might have had more time to grow in Grace. My Mind was greatly fix'd on divine Things; I was almoſt perpetually in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of them. Spent moſt of my Time in thinking of divine Things, Year after Year. And uſed to ſpend abundance of my Time, in walking alone in the Woods, and ſolitary Places, for Meditation, Soliloquy and Prayer, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009961_0036_0F7B3F2547C1EA88"/>
Converſe with GOD. And it was always my Manner, at ſuch times, to ſing forth my Contemplations. And was almoſt conſtantly in ejaculatory Prayer, wherever I was. Prayer ſeem'd to be natural to me; as the Breath, by which the inward Burnings of my Heart had vent.</p>
                        <p>"THE Delights which I now felt in Things of Religion, were of an exceeding different Kind, from thoſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that I had when I was a Boy. They were totally of another Kind; and what I then had no more Notion or Idea of, than one born blind has of pleaſant and beautiful Colours. They were of a more inward, pure, Soul-anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and refreſhing Nature. Thoſe former Delights, never reached the Heart; and did not ariſe from any Sight of the divine Excellency of the Things of GOD; or any Taſte of the Soul-ſatisfying, and Life-giving Good, there is in them.</p>
                        <p>"MY ſenſe of divine Things ſeem'd gradually to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, 'till I went to preach at <hi>New-York;</hi> which was about a Year and a half after they began. While I was there, I felt them, very ſenſibly, in a much higher Degree, than I had done before. My Longings after GOD &amp; Holineſs, were much increaſed. Pure and humble, holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Chriſtianity, appeared exceeding amiable to me. I felt in me a burning Deſire to be in every Thing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Chriſtian; and conformed to the bleſſed Image of Chriſt: and that I might live in all Things, according to the pure, ſweet and bleſſed Rules of the Goſpel. I had an eager thirſting after Progreſs in theſe Things. My Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after it, put me upon purſuing and preſſing after them. It was my continual Strife Day and Night, and conſtant Inquiry, How I ſhould be more holy, and live more holily, and more becoming a Child of God, and Diſciple of Chriſt. I ſought an encreaſe of Grace and Holineſs, and that I might live an holy Life, with vaſtly more Earneſtneſs, than ever I ſought Grace, before I had it. I uſed to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually examining my ſelf, and ſtudying and contriving for likely Ways and Means, how I ſhould live holily, with far greater diligence and earneſtneſs, than ever I purſued any thing in my Life: But with too great a Dependence on my own Strength; which afterwards proved a great Damage to me. My Experience had not then taught me, as it has
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009961_0037_0F7B3F2600458CB0"/>
done ſince, my extream Feebleneſs and Impotence, every manner of Way; and the innumerable and bottomleſs Depths of ſecret Corruption and Deceit, that there was in my Heart. However, I went on with my eager purſuit after more Holineſs; and ſweet conformity to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>"THE Heaven I deſired was a Heaven of Holineſs; to be with GOD, and to ſpend my Eternity in divine Love, and holy Communion with Chriſt. My Mind was very much taken up with Contemplations on Heaven, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of thoſe there; and living there in perfect Holineſs, Humility and Love. And it uſed at that Time to appear a great Part of the Happineſs of Heaven, that there the Saints could expreſs their Love to Chriſt. It appear'd to me a great Clog and Hindrance and Burden to me, that what I felt within, I could not expreſs to GOD, and give vent to, as I deſired. The inward ardor of my Soul, ſeem'd to be hinder'd and pent up, and could not freely flame out as it would. I uſed often to think, how in Heaven, this ſweet Principle ſhould freely and fully vent and expreſs it ſelf. Heaven appeared to me exceeding delightful as a World of Love. It appear'd to me, that all Happineſs conſiſted in living in pure, humble, heavenly, divine Love.</p>
                        <p>"I remember the Thoughts I uſed then to have of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. I remember I then ſaid ſometimes to my ſelf, I do certainly know that I love Holineſs, ſuch as the Goſpel preſcribes. It appeared to me, there was nothing in it but what was raviſhingly lovely. It appeared to me, to be the higheſt Beauty and Amiableneſs, above all other Beauties: that it was a <hi>divine</hi> Beauty; far purer than any thing here upon Earth; and that every thing elſe, was like Mire, Filth and Defilement, in Compariſon of it.</p>
                        <p>"HOLINESS, as I then wrote down ſome of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations on it, appeared to me to be of a ſweet, pleaſant, charming, ſerene, calm Nature. It ſeem'd to me, it brought an inexpreſſile Purity, Brightneſs, Peacefulneſs &amp; Raviſhment to the Soul: and that it made the Soul like a Field or Garden of GOD, with all manner of pleaſant Flowers; that is all pleaſant, delightful &amp; undiſturbed; enjoying a ſweet Calm, and the gently vivifying Beams of the Sun. The Soul of a true Chriſtian, as I then wrote my Meditations, appear'd like ſuch a little white Flower, as we ſee in the Spring of the Year;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009961_0038_0F7B3F279B5D9D80"/>
low and humble on the Ground, opening it's Boſom, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the pleaſant Beams of the Sun's Glory; rejoycing as it were, in a calm Rapture; diffuſing around a ſweet Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy; ſtanding peacefully and lovingly, in the midſt of other Flowers round about; all in like Manner opening their Boſoms, to drink in the Light of the Sun.</p>
                        <p>"THERE was no Part of Creature-Holineſs, that I then, and at other Times, had ſo great a Senſe of the Lovelineſs of, as Humility, Brokenneſs of Heart and Poverty of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and there was nothing that I had ſuch a Spirit to long for. My Heart as it were panted after this, to lie low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, and in the Duſt; that I might be nothing, and that GOD might be all; that I might become as a little Child.</p>
                        <p>"WHILE I was there at <hi>New-York,</hi> I ſometimes was much affected with Reflections on my paſt Life, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how late it was, before I began to be truly religious; and how wickedly I had lived till then: and once ſo as to weep abundantly, and for a conſiderable time together.</p>
                        <p>"ON <hi>January</hi> 12. 1722, 3. I made a ſolemn Dedication of my ſelf to GOD, and wrote it down; giving up my ſelf, and all that I had to GOD; to be for the future in no Reſpect my own; to act as one that had no right to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in any Reſpect. And ſolemnly vowed to take GOD for my whole Portion and Felicity; looking on nothing elſe as any Part of my Happineſs, nor acting as if it were: and his Law for the conſtant Rule of my Obedience: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to fight with all my Might, againſt the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, to the End of my Life. But have Reaſon to be infinitely humbled, when I conſider, how much I have fail'd of anſwering my Obligation.</p>
                        <p>"I had then abundance of ſweet religious Converſation in the Family where I lived, with Mr. <hi>John Smith,</hi> and his pious Mother. My Heart was knit in Affection to thoſe, in whom were Appearances of true Piety; and I could bear the Thoughts of no other Companions, but ſuch as were holy, and the Diſciples of the bleſſed JESUS.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="31" facs="unknown:009961_0039_0F7B3F284C9B6EA8"/>"I had great Longings for the Advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom in the World. My ſecret Prayer uſed to be in great Part taken up in praying for it. If I heard the leaſt hint of any thing that happened in any Part of the World, that appear'd to me, in ſome Reſpect or other, to have a favourable Aſpect on the Intereſt of Chriſt's Kingdom, my Soul eagerly catch'd at it; and it would much animate and refreſh me. I uſed to be earneſt to read publick News-Letters, mainly for that End; to ſee if I could not find ſome News favourable to the Intereſt of Religion in the World.</p>
                        <p>"I very frequently uſed to retire into a ſolitary Place, on the Banks of <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River, at ſome Diſtance from the City, for Contemplation on Divine Things, and ſecret Converſe with GOD; and had many ſweet Hours there. Sometimes Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and I walked there together, to converſe of the Things of GOD; and our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uſed much to turn on the Advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom in the World, and the glorious Things that GOD would accompliſh for his Church in the latter Days.</p>
                        <p>"I had then, and at other Times, the greateſt Delight in the holy Scriptures, of any Book whatſoever. Often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in reading it, every Word ſeemed to touch my Heart. I felt an Harmony between ſomething in my Heart, and thoſe ſweet and powerful Words. I ſeem'd often to ſee ſo much Light, exhibited by every Sentence, and ſuch a refreſhing raviſhing Food communicated, that I could not get along in reading. Uſed often-times to dwell long on one Sentence, to ſee the Wonders contained in it; and yet almoſt every Sentence ſeemed to be full of Wonders.</p>
                        <p>"I came away from <hi>New-York</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> 1723, and had a moſt bitter parting with Madam <hi>Smith</hi> and her Son. My Heart ſeemed to ſink within me, at leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Family and City, where I had enjoyed ſo many ſweet and pleaſant Days. I went from <hi>New-York</hi> to <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield</hi> by Water. As I ſail'd away, I kept Sight of the City as long as I could; and when I was out of Sight of it, it would affect me much to look that Way, with a kind of Melancholly mixed with Sweetneſs. However, that Night after this ſorrowful parting, I was greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in GOD at <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> where we went aſhore to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009961_0040_0F7B3F28F85EBD88"/>
lodge: and had a pleaſant Time of it all the Voyage to <hi>Saybrook.</hi> It was ſweet to me to think of meeting dear Chriſtians in Heaven, where we ſhould never part more. At <hi>Saybrook</hi> we went aſhore to lodge on Saturday, and there kept Sabbath; where I had a ſweet and refreſhing Seaſon, walking alone in the Fields.</p>
                        <p>"AFTER I came home to <hi>Windſor,</hi> remained much in a like Frame of my Mind, as I had been in at <hi>New-York;</hi> but only ſome times felt my Heart ready to ſink, with the Thoughts of my Friends at <hi>New York.</hi> And my Refuge and Support was in Contemplations on the heavenly State; as I find in my Diary of <hi>May</hi> 1. 1723. It was my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to think of that State, where there is fulneſs of Joy; where reigns heavenly, ſweet, calm and delightful Love, without Alloy; where there are continually the deareſt Expreſſions of this Love; where is the Enjoyment of the Perſons loved, without ever parting; where theſe Perſons that appear ſo lovely in this World, will really be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly more lovely, and full of love to us. And how ſweetly will the mutual Lovers join together to ſing the Praiſes of GOD and the LAMB! How full will it fill us with Joy, to think, that this Enjoyment, theſe ſweet Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes will never ceaſe or come to an End; but will laſt to all Eternity!</p>
                        <p>"CONTINUED much in the ſame Frame in the general, that I had been in at <hi>New-York,</hi> till I went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> to live there as Tutor of the College; having one ſpecial Seaſon of uncommon Swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After I went to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> I ſunk in Religion; my Mind being diverted from my eager and violent Purſuits after Holineſs, by ſome Affairs that greatly perplexed and diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Mind.</p>

And in this Sickneſs, GOD was pleaſed to viſit me again with the ſweet Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his Spirit. My Mind was greatly engaged there on divine, pleaſant Contemplations, and Longings of Soul.

I obſerved that thoſe who watched with me, would often be looking out for the Morning, and ſeemed to wiſh for it. Which brought to my Mind thoſe Words of the Pſalmiſt, which my Soul with Sweetneſs made it's own Language. <hi>My Soul waiteth for the Lord, more than they that watch for the Morning, I ſay, more than they that watch for the Morning.</hi> And when the Light of the Morning came, and the Beams of the Sun came in at the Windows, it refreſhed my Soul from one Morning to another. It ſeemed to me to be ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the ſweet Light of GOD's Glory.</p>
                        <p>"I remember, about that Time, I uſed greatly to long for the Converſion of ſome that I was concerned with. It ſeem'd to me, I could gladly honor them, and with Delight be a Servant to them, and lie at their Feet, if they were but truly holy.</p>
                        <p>BUT ſome Time after this, I was again greatly diverted in my Mind, with ſome temporal Concerns, that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took up my Thoughts, greatly to the wounding of my Soul: and went on through various Exerciſes, that it would be tedious to relate, that gave me much more Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of my own Heart, than ever I had before.</p>
                        <p>"SINCE I came to this Town, <note n="*" place="bottom">Northampton.</note> I have often had ſweet Complacency in GOD, in Views of his glorious Perfections, and the Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt. GOD has appeared to me, a glorious and lovely Being, chiefly on the account of his Holineſs. The Holineſs of GOD has always appeared to me the moſt lovely of all his Attributes. The Doctrines of God's abſolute Sovereignty, and free Grace, in ſhewing Mercy to whom he would ſhew Mercy; and Man's abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dependance on the Operations of God's Holy Spirit, have very often appeared to me as ſweet and glorious Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines. Theſe Doctrines have been much my Delight. GOD's Sovereignty has ever appeared to me, as great Part of his Glory. It has often been ſweet to me to go to GOD, and adore Him as a ſovereign GOD, and aſk ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Mercy of Him.</p>
                        <p>"I have loved the Doctrines of the Goſpel: They have been to my Soul like green Paſtures. The Goſpel has ſeem'd to me to be the richeſt Treaſure; the Treaſure

that I have moſt deſired, and longed that it might dwell richly in me. The Way of Salvation by Chriſt, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in a general Way, glorious and excellent, and moſt pleaſant and beautiful. It has often ſeem'd to me, that it would in a great Meaſure ſpoil Heaven, to receive it in any other Way.

That Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, has often been ſweet to me, <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children &amp;c.</hi> I love to think of coming to CHRIST, to receive Salvation of him, poor in Spirit, and quite empty of Self; humbly exalting Him alone; cut entirely off from my own Root, and to grow into, and out of CHRIST: to have GOD in CHRIST to be all in all; and to live by Faith on the Son of GOD, a Life of humble, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Confidence in Him.

                        <p>"SOMETIMES only mentioning a ſingle Word, cauſes my Heart to burn within me: or only ſeeing the Name of CHRIST, or the Name of ſome Attribute of GOD.

                        <p>"I have ſometimes had a Senſe of the excellent Fulneſs of Chriſt, and his Meetneſs and Suitableneſs as a Saviour; whereby he has appeared to me, far above all, the chief of ten Thouſands.

                        <p>"ONCE, as I rid out into the Woods for my Health, <hi>Anno</hi> 1737; and having lit from my Horſe in a retired Place, as my Manner commonly has been, to walk for divine Contemplation and Prayer; I had a View, that for me was extraordinary, of the Glory of the SON OF GOD; as Mediator between GOD and Man; and his wonderful, great, full, pure and ſweet Grace and Love, and meek and gentle Condeſcention. This Grace, that appear'd to me ſo calm and ſweet, appear'd great above the Heavens. The Perſon of CHRIST appear'd ineffably excellent, with an Excellency great enough to ſwallow up all Thought and Conception. Which continued, as near as I can judge,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009961_0044_0F7B3F2D25ECA610"/>
about an Hour; which kept me, the bigger Part of the Time, in a Flood of Tears, and weeping aloud. I felt withal, an Ardency of Soul to be, what I know not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how to expreſs, than to be emptied and annihilated; to lie in the Duſt, and to be full of Chriſt alone; to love him with a holy and pure Love; to truſt in him; to live upon him; to ſerve and follow him, and to be totally wrapt up in the Fullneſs of Chriſt; and to be perfectly ſanctified and made pure, with a divine and heavenly Purity. I have ſeveral other Times, had Views very much of the ſame Nature, and that have had the ſame Effects.</p>
                        <p>"I have many Times had a Senſe of the Glory of the third Perſon in the Trinity, in his Office of Sanctifier; in his holy Operations communicating divine Light and Life to the Soul. GOD in the Communications of his Holy Spirit, has appear'd as an infinite Fountain of Divine Glory and Sweetneſs; being full and ſufficient to fill and ſatisfy the Soul: pouring forth it ſelf in ſweet Communications, like the Sun in its Glory, ſweetly and pleaſantly diffuſing Light and Life.</p>
                        <p>"I have ſometimes had an affecting Senſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Word of GOD, as a Word of Life; as the Light of Life; a ſweet, excellent, Life giving Word: accompanied with a thirſting after that Word, that it might dwell richly in my Heart.</p>
                        <p>"I have often ſince I lived in this Town, had very affecting Views of my own Sinfulneſs and Vileneſs; very frequently ſo as to hold me in a kind of loud Weeping, ſometimes for a conſiderable time together: ſo that I have often been forced to ſhut my ſelf up. I have had a vaſtly greater Senſe of my own Wickedneſs, and the Badneſs of my Heart, ſince my Converſion, than ever I had before. It has often appeared to me, that if GOD ſhould mark Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity againſt me, I ſhould appear the very worſt of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; of all that have been ſince the beginning of the World to this time: and that I ſhould have by far the loweſt Place in Hell. When others that have come to talk with me about their Soul Concerns, have expreſſed the Senſe they have had of their own Wickedneſs, by ſaying that it ſeem'd to them, that they were as bad as the

Devil himſelf; I thought their Expreſſions ſeemed exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faint and feeble, to repreſent my Wickedneſs. I thought I ſhould wonder, that they ſhould content themſelves with ſuch Expreſſions as theſe, if I had any Reaſon to imagine, that their Sin bore any Proportion to mine. It ſeemed to me, I ſhould wonder at my ſelf, if I ſhould expreſs <hi>my</hi> Wickedneſs in ſuch feeble Terms as they did.</p>
                        <p>"MY Wickedneſs, as I am in my ſelf, has long ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me perfectly ineffable, and infinitely ſwallowing up all Thought and Imagination; like an infinite Deluge, or infinite Mountains over my Head. I know not how to expreſs better, what my Sins appear to me to be, than by heaping Infinite upon Infinite, and multiplying Infinite by Infinite. I go about very often, for this many Years, with theſe Expreſſions in my Mind, and in My Mouth, "Infinite upon Infinite. Infinite upon Infinite!" When I look into my Heart, and take a view of my Wickedneſs, it looks like an Abyſs infinitely deeper than Hell. And it appears to me, that were it not for free Grace, exalted and raiſed up to the infinite Height of all the fulneſs and glory of the great JEHOVAH, and the Arm of his Power and Grace ſtretched forth, in all the Majeſty of his Power, and in all the Glory of his Sovereignty; I ſhould appear ſunk down in my Sins infinitely below Hell it ſelf, far beyond Sight of every Thing, but the piercing Eye of God's Grace, that can pierce even down to ſuch a Depth, and to the bottom of ſuch an Abyſs.</p>
                        <p>"AND yet, I ben't in the leaſt inclined to think, that I have a greater Conviction of Sin than ordinary. It ſeems to me, my Conviction of Sin is exceeding ſmall, and faint. It appears to me enough to amaze me, that I have no more Senſe of my Sin. I know certainly, that I have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Senſe of my ſinfulneſs. That my Sins appear to me ſo great, don't ſeem to me to be, becauſe I have ſo much more Conviction of Sin than other Chriſtians, but becauſe I am ſo much worſe, and have ſo much more Wickedneſs to be convinced of. When I have had theſe Turns of weeping and crying for my Sins, I thought I knew in the Time of it, that my Repentance was nothing to my Sin.</p>
                        <p>"I have greatly longed of late, for a broken Heart, and to lie low before GOD. And when I aſk for Humility of

GOD, I can't bear the Thoughts of being no more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than other Chriſtians. It ſeems to me, that tho' their Degrees of Humility may be ſuitable for them; yet it would be a vile Self-exaltation in me, not to be the loweſt in Humility of all Mankind. Others ſpeak of their long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be humbled to the Duſt. Tho' that may be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Expreſſion for them, I always think for my ſelf, that I ought to be humbled down below Hell. 'Tis an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that it has long been natural for me to uſe in Prayer to God. I ought to lie infinitely low before GOD.</p>
                        <p>"IT is affecting to me to think, how ignorant I was, when I was a young Chriſtian, of the bottomleſs, infinite Depths of Wickedneſs, Pride, Hppocriſy and Deceit left in my Heart.</p>

                        <p>MR. EDWARDS made a Secret of his private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it cannot be particularly known: tho' there is much Evidence, that he was punctual, conſtant and frequent in ſecret Prayer, and often kept Days of Faſting and Prayer in ſecret; and ſet a part Time for ſerious, devout Meditations on ſpiritual and eternal things, as part of his religious Exerciſe in ſecret. It appears by his Diary that in his Youth he determined to attend ſecret Prayer more than twice a Day, when Circumſtances would allow. He was, ſo far as it can be known, much on his Knees in ſecret, and in devout reading God's Word, &amp; Meditation upon it. And his conſtant, ſolemn converſe with GOD in theſe Exerciſes of ſecret Religion made his Face, as it were, to ſhine before others.

                        <p>AGREEABLE to his Reſolutions, he was very careful and abſtemious in eating and drinking; as doubtleſs it was neceſſary ſo great a Student, and a Perſon of ſo delicate and tender a bodily make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

When he had, by careful Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, found what kind, and what quantity of Diet, beſt ſuited his Conſtitution, and render'd him moſt fit to purſue his Work, he was very ſtrict and exact in complying with it; and in this reſpect <hi>lived by Rule;</hi> and herein conſtantly practiſed great Self-denial: Which he alſo did in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant early riſing, in order to redeem Time for his Study. He uſed himſelf to riſe by four or between four and five in the Morning.</p>
                        <p>THO' he was of a tender and delicate Conſtitution, yet few Students are capable of cloſe Application more Hours in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He would commonly, unleſs diverted by Company, ride two or three Miles after Dinner to ſome lonely Grove, where he would diſmount and walk a while. At which times he generally carried his Pen and Ink with him, to note any Thought that ſhould be ſuggeſted, which he choſe to retain and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, as what promiſed ſome Light on any important Subject. In the Winter he was wont almoſt daily to take an Ax and chop Wood moderately for the ſpace of half an Hour or more.</p>
                        <p>HE had an uncommon thirſt for Knowledge, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of which, he ſpared no Coſt nor Pains. He read all the Books, eſpecially Books of Divinity, that he could come at, from which he could hope to get any help in his purſuit of Knowledge. And in this, he confin'd not himſelf to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of any particular Sect or Denomination; yea took much pains to come at the Books of the moſt noted Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who advance a Scheme of Divinity moſt contrary to his own Principles. But he ſtudied the BIBLE more than all other Books, and more than moſt other Divines do. His uncommon acquaintance with the Bible appears in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and in moſt of his Publications: and his great pains in
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009961_0049_0F7B3F3082705420"/>
ſtudying it are manifeſt in his Manuſcript Notes upon it; of which a more particular Account may be given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. He took his religious Principles from the Bible, and not from any human Syſtem or Body of Divinity. Tho' his Principles were <hi>Calviniſtic,</hi> yet he called no Man, Father. He thought and judged for himſelf, and was truly very much of an Original. This is evident by what he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his Life-time, and is yet more ſo by his MSS. Many Volumes of which he has left; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nd the Reader may expect a more particular Account of them in the Sequel. For reading was not the only Method he took to improve his Mind; but he did this much by Writing; without which, 'tis probable no Student can make Improvements to the beſt Advantage. Agreable to Reſolution 11th, he applied himſelf with all his Might to find out the Truth: He ſearched for Underſtanding and Knowledge, as for Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and digged for it, as for hid Treaſures. Every thought on any Subject, which appear'd to him worth purſuing and preſerving, he purſued, as far as he then could, with his Pen in his Hand. Thus he was all his Days, like the buſy Bee, collecting from every opening Flower, and ſtoring up a Stock of Knowledge, which was indeed ſweet to him, as the Honey &amp; the Honey-comb. And as he advanced in Years and in Knowledge, his Pen was more and more employed, and his Manuſcripts grew much faſter on his Hands.</p>
                        <p>HE was thought by ſome, who had but a ſlight Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him to be ſtiff &amp; unſociable; but this was owing to want of better Acquaintance. He was not a Man of many Words indeed, and was ſomewhat reſerved among Strangers, and thoſe on whoſe Candor and Friendſhip he did not know he could rely. And this was probably owing to two Things. Firſt, the ſtrict Guard he ſet over his Tongue from his Youth, which appears by his Reſolutions, taking great Care never to uſe it in any way that might prove miſchievous to any; never to <hi>ſin with his Tongue;</hi> or to improve it in idle, trivial and impertinent Talk, which generally makes up a great Part of the Converſation of thoſe who are full of Words in all Companies. He was ſenſible that in the multitude of Words there wanteth not Sin; and therefore refrained his Lips, and habituated himſelf to <hi>think</hi> before he <hi>ſpoke,</hi> and to propoſe ſome good End even in all his Words; which led him to be above many others, ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>eable to St. James's Advice, <hi>ſlow to ſpeak.</hi> Secondly,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009961_0050_0F7B3F31403FD7C0"/>
this was in Part the effect of his bodily Conſtitution. He poſſeſſed but a comparative ſmall Stock of animal Life: his animal Spirits were low, and he had not Strength of Lungs to ſpare, that would be neceſſary in order to make him what would be called, an affable, facecious Gentleman, in all Companies. They who have a great flow of animal Spirits, and ſo can ſpeak with more Eaſe and leſs Expence, may doubtleſs lawfully practice free Converſation in all Companies for a lower End, (e. g. to pleaſe and render themſelves acceptable) than he, who has not ſuch a Stock to expend upon. It becomes <hi>him</hi> to reſerve what he has, for higher and more important Service. Beſides, the want of animal Spirits lays a Man under a <hi>natural</hi> inability to that freedom of Converſation, at all times, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Company he is; which thoſe of more Life naturally go into; and the greateſt Degree of a ſociable Diſpoſition, Humility and Benevolence, will not remove this Obſtacle.</p>
                        <p>HE was not forward to enter into any Diſpute among Strangers, and in Companies where were Perſons of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sentiments; as he was ſenſible that ſuch Diſputes are generally unprofitable, and often ſinful and of bad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and he tho't he could diſpute to the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage with his Pen in his Hand: Yet he was always free to give his Sentiments on any Subject propoſed to him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any Difficulties or Objections offered by way of Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as lying in the Way of what he looked upon to be the Truth. But how groundleſs the imputation of <hi>ſtiff</hi> and <hi>unſociable</hi> was, his known and tried Friends beſt knew. They always found him eaſy of acceſs, kind and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending; and tho' not talkative, yet affable and free. Among ſuch whoſe Candor and Friendſhip he had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, he threw off the Reſerve, and was moſt open and free; quite patient of Contradiction, while the utmoſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was made to his Sentiments, that could be by any plauſible Arguments or Objections. And indeed, he was on all Occaſions, quite ſociable and free with all, who had any ſpecial Buſineſs with him.</p>
                        <p>IN his Conduct in his Family he practiſed that conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious exactneſs which was perſpicuous in all his Ways. He maintained a great eſteem and regard for his amiable and excellent Conſort. Much of the tender and kind was expreſſed in his Converſation with her and conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009961_0051_0F7B3F3361675888"/>
her. He was won't frequently to admit her into his Study, and converſe freely with her on Matters of Religion. And he uſed commonly to pray with her in his Study, at leaſt once a Day, unleſs ſomething extraordinary prevented. The time in which this uſed to be commonly attended, was juſt before going to Bed, after Prayers in the Family. As he roſe very early himſelf, he was wont to have his Family up in ſeaſon in the Morning; after which, before the Family entered on the Buſineſs of the Day, he attended on Family Prayers. When a Chapter in the Bible was read, commonly by Candle-light in the Winter; upon which he aſked his Children Queſtions according to their Age and Capacity; and took Occaſion to explain ſome Paſſages in it, or enforce any Duty recomended &amp;c. as he thought moſt proper.</p>
                        <p>HE was careful and thorough in the Government of his Children; and, as a Conſequence of this, they reverenced, eſteemed and loved him. He took ſpecial care to begin his Government of them in Seaſon. When they firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any conſiderable degree of Will and Stubbornneſs, he would attend to them till he had thoroughly ſubdued them and brought them to ſubmit. And ſuch prudent thorow Diſcipline, exerciſed with the greateſt Calmneſs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly without ſtriking a Blow, being repeated once or twice, was generally ſufficient for that Child; and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually eſtabliſhed his parental Authority, and produced a chearful Obedience ever after.</p>
                        <p>HE kept a watchful Eye over his Children, that he might admoniſh them of the <hi>firſt</hi> wrong Step, and direct them in the right Way. He took Opportunities to treat with them in his Study, ſingly and particularly about their own Soul's Concerns; and to give them Warning, Exhortation and Direction, as he ſaw Occaſion. He took much Pains to inſtruct them in the Principles of Religion; in which he made uſe of the <hi>Aſſembly's Shorter Catechiſm:</hi> not meerly by taking care that they learned it by Heart; but by lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into an underſtanding of the Doctrines therein taught, by aſking them Queſtions on each Anſwer, and explaining it to them. His uſual time to attend this was on the Evening before the Sabbath. And as he believed that the Sabbath or holy Time bgan at Sun-ſet the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Day, he order'd his Family to finiſh all their
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009961_0052_0F7B3F340CB50570"/>
ſecular Buſineſs by that time or before; when they were all called together, and a Pſalm was ſung and Prayer at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as an Introduction to the ſanctifying the Sabbath. This care and exactneſs effectually prevented that intruding on holy Time, by attending on ſecular Buſineſs, too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Families where the Evening before the Sabbath is pretended to be obſerved.</p>
                        <p>HE was a great Enemy to young People's unſeaſonable Company-keeping and Frolicking, as he look'd upon it a great Means of corrupting and ruining Youth. And he thought the Excuſe many Parents make for tolerating their Children in it, (viz. that it is the Cuſtom, and others Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren practiſe it, which renders it difficult, and even impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to reſtrain theirs) was inſufficient and frivolous: and manifeſted a great Degree of Stupidity, on ſuppoſition the practice was hurtful and pernicious to their Souls. And when ſome of his Children grew up he found no difficulty in reſtraining them from this pernicious Practice; but they chearfully complied with the will of their Parents herein. He allowed not his Children to be from home after nine o'Clock at Night, when they went abroad to ſee their Friends and Companions. Neither were they allowed to ſit up much after that Time, in his own Houſe, when any came to make them a viſit. If any Gentleman deſired Acquaintance with his Daughters; after handſomely intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing himſelf, by properly conſulting the Parents, he was allowed all proper Opportunity for it; a Room and Fire, if needed: but muſt not intrude on the proper Hours of Reſt and Sleep, or the Religion and Order of the Family.</p>
                        <p>HE had a ſtrict and inviolable regard to Juſtice in all his dealings with his Neighbours, and was very careful to provide for Things honeſt in the ſight of all Men; ſo that ſcarcely a Man had any Dealings with him, that was not conſcious of his uprightneſs. He appeared to have a ſacred regard to truth in his Words, both in Promiſes and Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, agreeable to his Reſolutions. This doubtleſs was one Reaſon why he was not ſo full of Words as many are. No Man feared to rely on his Veracity.</p>
                        <p>HE was cautious in chuſing his <hi>intimate Friends,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not many that might properly be called ſuch. But to them he ſhewed himſelf friendly in a peculiar manner.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009961_0053_0F7B3F34E0462D30"/>
He was indeed a faithful Friend, and able above moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to keep a Secret. To them he diſcover'd himſelf more than to others, led them into his Views and Ends in his Conduct in particular Inſtances: by which they had abundant Evidence that he well underſtood human Nature; and that his general Reſervedneſs, and many particular Inſtances of his Conduct, which a Stranger might impute to ignorance of Men, were really owing to his uncommon Knowledge of Mankind.</p>
                        <p>HIS Converſation with his Friends was always ſavory and profitable: In this he was remarkable, and almoſt ſingular.—He was not wont to ſpend his time with them, in Scandal, Evil-ſpeaking and Back-biting, or in fooliſh Jeſting, idle chat, and telling Stories: But his Mouth was that of the Juſt, which bringeth forth Wiſdom, and his Lips diſperſed Knowledge. His Tongue was as the Pen of a ready Writer, while he converſed about important, heavenly, divine Things, which his Heart was ſo full of, in ſuch a natural and free manner, as to be moſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and inſtructive: ſo that none of his Friends could enjoy his Company without Inſtruction and Profit, unleſs it was by their own fault.</p>
                        <p>HIS great Benevolence to Mankind diſcovered it ſelf, among other ways, by the uncommon regard he ſhewed to Liberality, and Charity to the Poor and Diſtreſſed. He was much in recommend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ng this, both in his publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and private Converſation. He often declared it to be his Opinion, that profeſſed Chriſtians, in theſe Days are greatly deficient in this Duty; and much more ſo, than in moſt other Parts of external Chriſtianity. He often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how much this is ſpoken of, recommended and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in the holy Scripture, eſpecially in the New-Teſtament. And it was his Opinion, that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church ought by frequent and liberal Contributions, to maintain a publick Stock, that might be ready for the poor and neceſſitous Members of that Church: and that the principal Buſineſs of Deacons is to take care of the Poor in the faithful and judicious Diſtribution and Improvement of the Church's temporals, lodged in their Hands. And he did not content himſelf with only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending Charity to others, but practis'd it much him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Tho', according to his Maſter's Advice, he took
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009961_0054_0F7B3F35063D0BC0"/>
great Care to conceal his Deeds of Charity; by which Means doubtleſs moſt of his Alms-deeds will be unknown till the Reſurrection, which if known, would prove him to be as great an Inſtance of Charity as any that can be produced in this Age. This is not meer Conjecture, but is evident many ways. He was forward to give on all publick Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Charity, tho' when it could properly be done, he always conceal'd the Sum given. And ſome Inſtances of his giving more privately have accidentally come to the Knowlede of others, in which his Liberality appeared in a very extraordinary Degree. One of the Inſtances was this. Upon hearing that a poor obſcure Man, whom he never ſaw, or any of his kindred, was by an extraordinary bodily Diſorder, brought to great Straits; he, unaſked, gave <note n="*" place="bottom">A conſiderable Sum.</note> to a Friend to be delivered to the diſtreſſed Perſon; having firſt required a Promiſe of him, that he would let neither the Perſon, who was the Object of his Charity, nor any one elſe know by whom it was given. This may ſerve both as an Inſtance of his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Charity, and of his great Care to conceal it. <note n="†" place="bottom">As both the giver, and the Object of his Charity are dead, and all the Ends of the propoſed ſecrecy are anſwered; 'tis thought not inconſiſtent with the above mentioned Promiſe, to make known the Fact, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS had the moſt univerſal Character of a <hi>good Preacher</hi> of almoſt any Miniſter in this Age. There were but few that heard him, who did not call him a good Preacher, however they might diſlike his religious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and be much offended at the ſame Truths when delivered by others: And moſt admired him above all that ever they heard. His Eminency as a Preacher ſeems to be owing to the following Things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Firſt,</hi> The great Pains he took in compoſing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, eſpecially in the firſt Part of his Life. As by his early riſing, and conſtant attention to his Study, he had more time than moſt others; ſo he ſpent more time in making his Sermons. He wrote moſt of his Sermons all out, for near twenty Years after he firſt began to preach; tho' he did not wholly confine himſelf to his Notes in his delivering them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="47" facs="unknown:009961_0055_0F7B3F35B7ED8140"/>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> His great acquaintance with Divinity, his ſtudy and knowledge of the Bible. His extenſive and univerſal Knowledge, and great clearneſs of Thought, enabled him to handle every Subject with great Judgment and Propriety, and to bring out of his Treaſury things new and old. Every Subject he handled was inſtructive, plain, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profitable; which was much owing to his being Maſter of the Subject, and his great ſkill to treat it in a moſt natural, eaſy, and profitable Manner. None of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures were dry Speculations, or unmeaning Harangues, or Words without Ideas. When he dwelt on thoſe Truths which are much controverted and oppoſed by many, which was often the Caſe, he would ſet them in ſuch a natural and eaſy Light, and every Sentiment from Step to Step, would drop from his Lips, attended with ſuch clear and ſtriking Evidence, both from Scripture and Reaſon, as even to force the aſſent of every attentive Hearer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His excellency as a Preacher was very much the Effect of his great Acquaintance with his own Heart, his inward Senſe and high Reliſh of divine Truths, and the high Exerciſe of true, experimental Religion. This gave him a great inſight into human Nature: He knew what was in Man, both the Saint and the Sinner. This helped him to Skill, to lay Truth before the Mind, ſo as not only to convince the Judgment, but touch the Heart and Conſcience; and enabled him to ſpeak out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Heart, what he knew, and teſtify what he had ſeen and felt. This gave him a taſte and diſcerning, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not have been able to fill his Sermons, as he did, with ſuch ſtriking, affecting Sentiments, all ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſolemnize, move, and rectify the Heart of the Hearer. His Sermons were well connected, not uſually long, and commonly a large Part taken up in the Improvement; which was cloſely connected with the Subject, and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sentiments naturally flowing from it.</p>
                        <p>BUT no Deſcription of his Sermons will give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Idea of them which they have who ſat under his Preaching, or have even read ſome of his Diſcourſes which are in print. There is a great Number now in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, which are probably as worthy the view of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and at leaſt tend as much to inſtruct and quicken Chriſtians, as moſt that have been publiſhed in this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="48" facs="unknown:009961_0056_0F7B3F3686DF71F8"/>HIS Appearance in the Deſk was with a good Grace, and his delivery eaſy, natural and very ſolemn. He had not a ſtrong, loud Voice; but appear'd with ſuch gravity and ſolemnity, and ſpake wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h ſuch diſtinctneſs, clearneſs and preciſion; his Words were ſo full of Ideas, ſet in ſuch a plain and ſtriking Light, that few Speakers have been ſo able to demand the Attention of an Audience as he. His Words often diſcover'd a great degree of inward fervor, without much Noiſe or external Emotion, and fell with great weight on the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>AS he wrote his Sermons out at large for many Years, and always wrote a conſiderable part of moſt of his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcourſes; ſo he carried his Notes into the Deſk with him, and read the moſt that he had wrote; yet he was not ſo confined to his Notes, when he had wrote at large, but that, if ſome Thoughts were ſuggeſted while he was ſpeaking, which did not occur when writing, and appeared to him pertinent and ſtriking, he would deliver them; and that with as great propriety and fluency, and oftner with greater pathos, and attended with a more ſenſible good effect on his Hearers, than all he had wrote.</p>
                        <p>THO', as has been obſerved, he was wont to read ſo conſiderable a part of what he delivered; yet he was for from thinking this the beſt way of preaching in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and look'd upon his uſing his Notes ſo much as he did, a Deficiency and Infirmity. And in the latter part of his Life was inclined to think it had been better, if he had never accuſtomed himſelf to uſe his Notes at all. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him that preaching wholly without Notes, agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eable to the Cuſtom in moſt Proteſtant Countries, and what ſeems evidently to have been the manner of the Apoſtles and primitive Miniſters of the Goſpel, was by far the moſt natural way; and had the greateſt tendency on the whole, to anſwer the End of Preaching: and ſuppoſed that none who had Talents equal to the Work of the Miniſtry, was incapable of ſpeaking Memoriter, if he took ſuitable Pains for this Attainment from his Youth. He would have the young Preacher write all his Sermons, or at leaſt moſt of them, out at large; and inſtead of reading

them to his Hearers, take pains to commit them to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Which, tho' it would require a great deal of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour at firſt, yet would ſoon become eaſier by uſe, and help him to ſpeak more correctly and freely, and be of great Service to him all his Days.</p>
                        <p>HIS Prayers were indeed <hi>extempore.</hi> He was the fartheſt from any appearance of a Form, as to his Words &amp; manner of Expreſſion, of almoſt any Man. He was quite ſingular and inimitable in this, by any who have not a Spirit of real and undiſſembled Devotion. Yet he always expreſſed himſelf with Decency &amp; Propriety. He appeared to have much of the Grace and Spirit of Prayer; to pray with the Spirit and with the Underſtanding: and he perform'd this part of Duty much to the acceptance and edification of thoſe who joined with him. He was not wont, in ordinary Caſes to be long in his Prayers: an error which he obſerved wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> often hurtful to publick and ſocial Prayer, as it tends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to damp than promote true Devotion.</p>
                        <p>HE kept himſelf quite free from worldly Cares. He gave himſelf wholly to the Work of the Miniſtry, and entangled not himſelf with the Affairs of this Life. He left the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Over-ſight and Direction of the temporal Concerns of his Family, almoſt entirely to Mrs. <hi>Edwards;</hi> who was better able than moſt of her Sex to take the whole Care of them on her Hands. He was leſs acquainted with moſt of his temporal Affairs than many of his Neighbours; and ſeldom knew when and by whom his Forrage for Winter was gathered in, or how many milk Kine he had; whence his Table was furniſhed &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>HE did not make it his Cuſtom to viſit his People in their own Houſes, unleſs he was ſent for by the Sick; or he heard that they were under ſome ſpecial Affliction. In ſtead of viſiting from Houſe to Houſe, he uſed to preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at private Meetings in particular Neighbourhoods; and often call the young People and Children to his own Houſe: when he uſed to pray with them &amp; treat with them in a manner ſuited to their Years &amp; Circumſtances. And he catechized the Children in publick every Sabbath in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And he uſed ſometimes to propoſe Queſtions to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar young Perſons in writing, for them to anſwer after a proper
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009961_0058_0F7B3F385691C178"/>
time given to them to prepare. In putting out theſe Queſtions he endeavoured to ſuit them to the Age, Genius and Abilities of thoſe to whom they were given. His Queſtions were generally ſuch as required but a ſhort Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and yet could not be anſwered without a particular Knowledge of ſome hiſtorical Part of the Scripture; and therefore led, and even obliged Perſons to ſtudy the Bible.</p>
                        <p>HE did not neglect viſiting his People from Houſe to Houſe, becauſe he did not look upon it, in ordinary Caſes, to be one Part of the Work of the Goſpel Miniſter. But he ſuppoſed that Miniſters ſhould, with reſpect to this, conſult their own Talents and Circumſtances, and viſit more or leſs, according to the degree in which they could hope hereby to promote the great Ends of the Goſpel Miniſtry. He obſerved, that ſome Miniſters had a talent at entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profiting by occaſional Viſits among their People. They have Words at Will, and a knack at introducing profitable, religious Diſcourſe in a free, natural, and, as it were undeſigned way. He ſuppoſed ſuch had a call to ſpend a great deal of their time in viſiting their People. But he looked on his Talents to be quite otherwiſe. He was not able to enter into a free Converſation with every Perſon he met with, and in an eaſy manner turn it to what Topick he pleaſed, without the help of others, and, as it may be, againſt their Inclination. He therefore found that his viſits of this kind muſt be in a great degree unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. And as he was ſettled in a great Town, it would take up a great part of his Time to viſit from Houſe to Houſe; which he thought he could ſpend in his Study to much more valuable Purpoſes, and ſo as much better to promote the great Ends of his Miniſtry. For it appeared to him, that he could do the greateſt good to Souls, and moſt promote the intereſt of Chriſt by preaching and writing, and converſing with Perſons under religious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in his Study; where he encouraged all ſuch to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; where, they might be ſure, in ordinary Caſes, to find him: and to be allowed eaſy acceſs to him, and where they were treated with all deſirable tenderneſs, kindneſs &amp; familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In times therefore of the out-pouring of God's Spirit, and the revival of Religion among his People, his Study was throng'd with Perſons to lay open their ſpiritual Concerns to him, and ſeek his Advice and Direction: whom he received and converſed with, with great freedom and pleaſure, and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009961_0059_0F7B3F38F871DFF8"/>
had the beſt Opportunity to deal in the moſt particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with each one.</p>
                        <p>HE was a ſkilful Guide to Souls under ſpiritual Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And was therefore ſought unto not only by his own People, but by many who lived ſcores of Miles off. He became ſuch an able Guide, partly by his own experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal acquaintance with divine things, and unwearied ſtudy of God's Word; and partly by his having ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern with Souls under ſpiritual Troubles. For he had not been ſettled in the Work of the Miniſtry many Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of GOD was wonderfully poured out on his People, by which a great Concern about their Souls became almoſt univerſal; and a great Number were hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Subjects of ſaving Converſion. This was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the Year 1734. A particular Account of which has been wrote by him, entitled, <hi>A faithful Narrative of the ſurprizing Work of GOD in the Converſion of many hundred Souls in</hi> Northampton. Which has been printed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany and America; to which the Reader muſt be refer'd.</p>
                        <p>AND there was another remarkable Time of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of GOD's Spirit in the Years 1740, &amp; 1741. in which <hi>Northampton</hi> partook largely; tho' not excluſive of moſt other Parts of the Land. Mr. EDWARDS in this time had to deal not only with his own People, but with Multitudes of others. The hearing that the ſame things were at <hi>Northampton</hi> ſome Years before, and the fame Mr. EDWARDS had for Knowledge, Piety, and a great Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with experimental Religion, naturally led both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People, in almoſt all Parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> to look to him for Direction and Aſſiſtance, in this extra-ordinary time. Being in this time earneſtly ſollicited by the Miniſters &amp; People of many Places to come and preach among them, he went to many; tho' he was not able to gratify all who deſired him. And his preaching was attended with great Succeſs.</p>
                        <p>AND as many of the Miniſters &amp; People in <hi>New-England</hi> had been unacquainted with ſuch things as then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were greatly expoſed to <hi>run wild,</hi> as it were, and actually did, by the ſubtle Temptations of the Devil, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS was what by ſome is called a rigid <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt.</hi> Thoſe Doctrines of Calviniſm, which have been moſt objected againſt, and given the greateſt Offence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him as ſcriptural, reaſonable and important as any; and he thought that to give them up, was in effect to give up all. And therefore he looked upon thoſe who called themſelves <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> that were for palliating the Matter, by, as it were, triming off the Knots of Calviniſm, that they might conform it more to the taſte of thoſe who are moſt diſpoſed to object againſt it, were really giving up and betraying the Cauſe they pretended to eſpouſe: and were paving the way not only to Arminianiſm, but to Deiſm. For if theſe Doctrines, in the whole length and breadth of them were relinquiſhed, he did not ſee, where a Man could ſet his Foot down with conſiſtency and ſafety, ſhort of Deiſm, or even Atheiſm it ſelf; or rather univerſal Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>IN this view of Things, he thought it of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that Miniſters ſhould be very critical in examining Candidates for the Miniſtry, with Reſpect to their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> as well as their religious Diſpoſition and Morals.

                        <p>MR. EDWARDS was very happy in the eſteem and love of his People for many Years, and there was the greateſt Proſpect of his living and dying ſo. He was the laſt Miniſter almoſt in <hi>New-England</hi> that would have been pitched upon to be oppoſed and renounced by his People. But by what has come to paſs with reſpect to this, we have an inſtructive Leſſon on the inſtability of all human Affairs, and the unreaſonableneſs of truſting in Man.</p>
                        <p>IN the Year 1744. Mr. EDWARDS was informed that ſome of the young Perſons in Town, who were Members of the Church, had Books in keeping, which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to promote laſcivious and obſcene Diſcourſe among
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009961_0062_0F7B3F3B1CA13558"/>
the young Poople. And upon inquiring, a Number of Perſons were found to teſtify, that they had heard one and another from time to time talk obſcenely; as what they were led to by reading a Book or Books, which they had among them. Upon which Mr. EDWARDS thought the Brethren of the Church ought to look into the Matter. And in order to introduce it, he preach'd a Sermon from <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 15, 16. <q>Looking diligently, leſt any Man fail of the Grace of GOD, leſt any Root of bitterneſs ſpringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: leſt there be any Fornicator, or profane Perſon as Eſau &amp;c.</q> After Sermon, he deſired the Brethren of the Church to ſtay, and told them what Information he had got; and propoſed whether they thought proper to take any Meaſures to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the Matter. They with one conſent, and much Zeal, manifeſted it to be their Opinion, that it ought to be enquired into. And proceeded to choſe a Number of Men, to aſſiſt their Paſtor in examining into the Affair. Upon which Mr. EDWARDS appointed the time for their meeting at his Houſe: and then read a Catalogue of the Names of young Perſons, whom he deſired to come to his Houſe at the ſame time. Some were the accuſed, and ſome Witneſſes; but it was not then declared of which Number any particular Perſon was.</p>
                        <p>WHEN the Names were publiſhed, it appeared, that there were but few of the conſiderable Families in Town, to which none of the Perſons named did belong, or were nearly related. Whether this was the Occaſion of the alteration or not, before the Day appointed came, a great Number of Heads of Families altered their Minds (yea many condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they had done, before they got home to their own Houſes) and declared, they did not think proper to proceed as they had done; that their Children ſhould not be called to an Account in ſuch a way for ſuch things &amp;c. &amp;c. And the Town was ſuddenly all on a Blaze. This ſtrengthen'd the Hands of the accuſed, and ſome refuſed to appear, and others that did appear, behaved unmannerly, and with a great Degree of Inſolence, and contempt of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church. And little or nothing could be done further in the Affair.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="55" facs="unknown:009961_0063_0F7B3F3D8F9D0648"/>THIS was the Occaſion of weakening Mr. EDWARDS's Hands in the Work of the Miniſtry, eſpecially among the young People; with whom by this Means he greatly loſt his Influence! This ſeemed in a great Meaſure to put an end to Mr. EDWARDS's Uſefulneſs at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and doubtleſs laid a Foundation, and will help to account for the ſurprizing Events which will by and by be related. To be ſure he had no great viſible Succeſs after this; but the Influences of God's Spirit were greatly with-held, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and carnality much increaſed among them. That great and ſingular degree of viſible religion and good order which had been found among them, ſoon began gradually to decay: and the youth have ſince been more wanton and diſſolute.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STODDARD, Mr. EDWARDS's grand-father and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor in the work of the miniſtry, was of the opinion, that unconverted perſons had a right in the ſight of God, or conſider'd as ſuch, to the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that therefore it was their duty to come to that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, tho' they knew they had no true goodneſs, or goſpel holineſs. He maintain'd, that viſible chriſtianity does not conſiſt in a profeſſion or appearance of that wherein true holineſs or real chriſtianity conſiſts. That therefore the profeſſion which perſons make in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as viſible Members of Chriſt's Church, ought not to be ſuch as to expreſs or imply a real compliance with, or conſent to the terms of the covenant of grace, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that they who really reject Jeſus Chriſt, and diſlike the goſpel way of ſalvation in their hearts, and know that this is true of themſelves may make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion without lying and hypocriſy. Accordingly he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to form a ſhort profeſſion for perſons to make in order to be admitted into the church and come to the ſacrament, anſwerable to this principle. And it took place and was practiſed upon in <hi>Northampton;</hi> and perſons were admitted into the church, and to the ſacrament, not under the notion of their being true ſaints, or that they had any real goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. STODDARD's appearing to maintain this principle made a great noiſe in the country; and he was oppoſed as introducing ſomething contrary to the principles and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009961_0064_0F7B3F3ED49F3878"/>
practice of almoſt all the churches in <hi>New-England.</hi> And the matter was publickly controverted between him and Dr. INCREASE MATHER of <hi>Boſton.</hi> However, thro' Mr. STODDARD's great influence &amp; aſcendance over the People at <hi>Northampton,</hi> it was introduced there, tho' not without Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And his principles by degrees ſpread very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Miniſters &amp; People in that county, and in other parts of <hi>New England;</hi> tho' no church except <hi>Northampton</hi> publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profeſſedly acted upon this principle, by altering the profeſſion that thoſe made, who were admitted to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to ſuit it to ſuch a notion: but required of all who joined to the church a profeſſion of that wherein true chriſtianity, or real godlineſs conſiſts. And of late years his opinion that perſons who have no real goodneſs, but are in a chriſtleſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS had ſome heſitation about this matter when he firſt ſettled at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and afterwards; but did not receive ſuch a degree of conviction, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting perſons into the church, who made no pretence to real godlineſs was wrong, as to prevent his practiſing upon it with a good conſcience, for ſome years. But at length his doubts about the matter greatly increaſed, which put him upon examining it more thoroughly than he had ever before done, by ſearching the Scripture, and reading and examining ſuch books, as were written to defend the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of perſons to ſacraments, without a profeſſion of ſaving faith. And the reſult was a full conviction that it was wrong, and that he could not practiſe upon it with a good Conſcience. He was fully convinced that to be a <hi>viſible Chriſtian</hi> was to put on the viſibility or appearance of a real chriſtian; that the profeſſion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> chriſtianity was a profeſſion of that, wherein real chriſtianity conſiſts; was therefore a profeſſion of true reſpect of Chriſt, and a hearty embracing the goſpel &amp;c. That therefore no perſon who rejected Chriſt in his heart, could make ſuch a profeſſion conſiſtent with truth. And therefore, as the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper was inſtituted for none but viſible profeſſing chriſtians, none but thoſe who are real chriſtians have a real right in the ſight of God to come to that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009961_0065_0F7B3F3FF8BAD7A8"/>

                        <p>WHEN Mr. EDWARDS's ſentiments were known, in the ſpring of the year 1744, it gave great offence, and the town was put into a great ferment: and before he was heard in his own defence, or it was known by many what his principles were, the general cry was to have him diſmiſſed, as what alone would ſatisfy them. This was evident from the whole tenor of their conduct, as they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and oppos'd the moſt proper means of calmly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, and ſo underſtanding the matter in diſpute, and perſiſted in a refuſal to attend to what Mr. EDWARDS had to ſay in defence of his principles.

                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS thought of preaching on the ſubject, that they might know what were his ſentiments, and what were the grounds of them, (of both which he was ſenſible the moſt of them were quite ignorant) before they took any ſtep for a ſeparation between him and his people. But that he might do nothing to increaſe the tumult, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary take all thoſe ſteps, which he could with a good conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, that tended to peace, he firſt propoſed the thing to the church's ſtanding committee; ſuppoſing that if he entered on the ſubject publickly with their conſent, it would prevent the ill conſequences which otherwiſe he fear'd would follow. But the moſt of them by no means conſent to it, but ſtrenuouſly oppoſed it. Upon which he gave it over for the preſent, as what in ſuch circumſtances would rather raiſe a tumult, and blow the fire up to a greater height, than anſwer the good ends propoſed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="58" facs="unknown:009961_0066_0F7B3F404BCF3D38"/>Mr. EDWARDS being ſenſible that his principles were not underſtood, and much miſrepreſented thro' the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and finding that his people were in too much of a heat calmly to attend to the matter in controverſy then; and were in a diſpoſition even to refuſe to hear him preach upon it, propoſed to print what he had to ſay on the point; as this ſeemed to be the only way left him to have a fair hearing. Accordingly his people conſented to put off the calling a council, till what he ſhould write was publiſhed. But they manifeſted great uneaſineſs in waiting, before it came out of the preſs. And when it was publiſhed, it was read but by very few of them. Mr. EDWARDS being ſenſible of this, renewed his propoſal to preach upon it, and at a meeting of the brethren of the church aſked their conſent in the following terms: <q>I deſire that the brethren would manifeſt their conſent, that I ſhould declare the reaſons of my opinion relating to full communion in the church, in lectures appointed for that end: Not as an act of authority, or as putting the power of declaring the whole counſel of God out of my hands; but for peace ſake, and to prevent occaſion of ſtrife.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>But it paſs'd in the negative.</p>
                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS then propoſed that it ſhould be left to a few of the neighbouring miniſters, whether it was not, all things conſider'd, reaſonable that he ſhould be heard in this matter from the pulpit, before the affair ſhould be brought to an iſſue. But this alſo paſs'd in the negative.</p>
                        <p>HOWEVER, he having had the advice of the miniſters and meſſengers of the neighbouring churches, who met at <hi>Northampton</hi> to adviſe them under their difficulties, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appoint a lecture, in order to preach on the ſubject, propoſing to do ſo weekly 'till he had finiſhed what he had to ſay. On Monday there was a precinct or ſociety meeting, in which a vote was paſs'd to chooſe a committee to go to Mr. EDWARDS, and deſire him not to preach lectures on the ſubject in controverſy, according to his declaration and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. And accordingly, proceeded to chooſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of three men for this purpoſe, who waited on him, and did their errand. However, Mr. EDWARDS thought proper to proceed according to his propoſal, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly preached a number of Sermons till he had finiſhed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009961_0067_0F7B3F410C09C980"/>
what he had to ſay on the ſubject. Theſe lectures were very thinly attended by his own people: but great numbers of ſtrangers from the neighbouring towns attended them, ſo many as to make above half the congregation. This was in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi> 1750.</p>
                        <p>THE calling a deciſive council to determine the matter of difference between paſtor and people, or rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs the paſtor from his church and people, (for the delay of which a great deal of impatience had been publickly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted) was now more particularly attended to by Mr. EDWARDS and the church.</p>
                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS had before this inſiſted upon it from time to time, that they were by no means ripe for ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure; (as they had not yet given him a fair hearing in defence of his cauſe: which if they would do, perhaps the need of ſuch a council would be ſuperſceeded. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he thought there was abundant publick evidence, that they were not yet in a temper ſuited to attend on, and be active in ſuch a tranſaction, as the diſſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

He obſerved, <q>That it was exceeding unbecoming churches of the Lamb of God to manage their religious affairs of greateſt importance in a ferment and tumult, which ought to be managed with great ſolemnity, deep humiliation and ſubmiſſion to the awful frowns of heaven, humble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, and with fervent prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him. That therefore for them to go about ſuch an affair, in ſuch a manner as they did, would be moſt unbecoming the Goſpel, greatly to the diſhonor of God and religion, and a way in which a people cannot expect a bleſſing. That ſuch a great affair as this ſhould be gone about with ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>m conſideration; but that ſuch a temper as the people were then in, was wholly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>BUT having uſed all means which he could think of within his Power to bring them to a more calm and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable temper, and to hear and weigh what he had to ſay in his own defence, with attention and candor; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing prevailed; but rather the tumult and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009961_0068_0F7B3F41D3209758"/>
was increaſed; he conſented that a deciſive council ſhould be called without any further delay.</p>
                        <p>BUT a difficulty attended the choice of a council, which was for ſome time inſuperable. It was agreed that the council ſhould be mutually choſen, one half by the paſtor, and the other half by the church: but the people inſiſted upon it that he ſhould be confined to the county in his choice. Mr. EDWARDS thought this an unreaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint on him, as it was known that the miniſters and churches in that county were almoſt univerſally againſt him in the controverſy that divided him and his people, and made the two parties. He indeed did not ſuppoſe that the buſineſs of the propoſed council would be to determine whether his opinion which was the occaſion of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty between him and his people was right or no; or that what they were to judge of, depended upon this. But their buſineſs would be — to ſee and determine whether any poſſible way could be deviſed for an accommodation between paſtor and people, and to uſe their wiſdom and endeavour in order to this. And if they found this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, they muſt determine, whether things were now ripe for a ſeparation; whether what ought in juſtice to be previous to a ſeparation had already actually been done, ſo that there was nothing further in juſtice to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by either of the parties concerned, before a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould take place. And if he was diſmiſſed by them, it would be their buſineſs to ſet forth to the world in what manner and for what cauſe he was diſmiſſed: how far he was innocent, and whether he might yet be employed in the work of the miniſtry &amp;c. All which were matters of great importance to him, and required upright and impartial judges. And conſidering the great influence a difference in religious opinions has to prejudice men one againſt another; and the cloſe connection of the point, in which moſt of the miniſters and churches in the county differ'd from him, with the matter to be judged of, he did not think they could be reaſonably looked upon ſo impartial judges, as that the matter ought to be wholly left to them. Beſides, he thought the caſe being ſo new and extraordinary, required the ableſt judges in the land. For theſe, and ſome other reaſons, which he offered, he inſiſted up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n liberty to go out of the county
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:009961_0069_0F7B3F4280055F00"/>
for thoſe members of the propoſed council, in which he was to have a choice. In this, as was juſt now ſaid, the people ſtrenuouſly and obſtinately oppoſed him. They at length agreed to leave the matter to a council conſiſting of the miniſters and meſſengers of the five neighbouring chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: who, after they had met twice upon it, and had the caſe largely debated before them, were equally divided, and therefore left the matter undetermined.</p>
                        <p>HOWEVER, they were all agreed, that Mr. EDWARDS ought to have liberty to go out of the county for <hi>ſome</hi> of the council. And at the next church meeting, which was on the 26th of <hi>March,</hi> Mr. EDWARDS offer'd to join with them in calling a council, if they would conſent that he ſhould chuſe <hi>two</hi> of the churches out of the county, in caſe the council conſiſted of but <hi>ten</hi> churches. The church how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever refuſed to comply with this at one meeting after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repeatedly; and proceeded to warn a church meeting and chooſe a moderator, in order to act without their paſtor.</p>
                        <p>BUT, to paſs by many particulars, at lenth at a meeting of the church, warned by their paſtor, <hi>May</hi> 3d. they voted their conſent to his propoſal of going out of the county for two of the churches, ſhould be applied to. And then they proceeded to make choice of the ten miniſters &amp; chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of which the council ſhould conſiſt. Accordingly, the churches were ſent to, and the council convened on the 19th of <hi>June.</hi> Who, after they had made ſome fruitleſs attempts for a compoſition between the paſtor and church, paſs'd a reſolve, by the majority of one voice <note n="†" place="bottom">One of the churches which Mr. <hi>Edward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </hi> choſe did not ſee fit to join the council. However, the miniſter of that church being at <hi>Northampton</hi> at the ſitting of the Council, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and the Church to ſit in Council and act, which he did. But there being no meſſenger from the Church, the council was not full, and there was a diſparity; by which means doubtleſs, there was <hi>Our</hi> vote more for an immediate diſmiſſion, than againſt it.</note> only, to the following purpoſe: "That 'tis expedient that the paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relation between Mr. EDWARDS and his church be immediately diſſolved, if the people ſtill perſiſt in deſiring it." And it being publickly put to the people, whether they ſtill inſiſted on Mr. EDWARDS's diſmiſſion from the paſtoral office over them? A great majority (above two hundred againſt twenty) zealouſly voted for his diſmiſſion. And he was accordingly diſmiſſed <hi>June</hi> 22, 1750.</p>

                           </gap>eſt againſt this proceeding, judging that it was too much in a hurry, as they were by no means ripe for a ſeparation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the paſt conduct, and preſent temper of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And ſome of that part of the council that were active, expreſſed themſelves ſurprized at the uncommon zeal and engagedneſs of ſpirit, publickly manifeſted by the people in their voting for a diſmiſſion; which evidenced to them, and all obſerving ſpectators, that they were far from a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind becoming ſuch a ſolemn and awful tranſaction, conſidered in all its circumſtances.</p>
                        <p>BEING thus diſmiſſed, he preached his farewell Sermon on the firſt of <hi>July,</hi> from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14. The doctrine he obſerved from the words was this, <q>Miniſters and the people that have been under their care, muſt meet one another before Chriſt's tribunal, at the day of Judgment.</q>
It was a remarkably ſolemn and affecting diſcourſe, and was publiſhed at the deſire of ſome of the hearers.</p>
                        <p>AFTER Mr. EDWARDS was diſmiſſed from <hi>Northampton,</hi> he preached there ſome times occaſionally when they had no other preacher to ſupply the pulpit; till at length a great uneaſineſs was manifeſted by many of the people, at his preaching there at all. Upon which, the committee for ſupplying the pulpit, call'd the town together, to know their minds with reſpect to that matter: when they voted that it was not agreeable to their minds, that he ſhould preach among them. Accordingly, when Mr. EDWARDS was in town, and they had no other miniſter to preach to them, they carried on publick worſhip among themſelves, and without any preaching, rather than to invite Mr. ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARDS!</p>
                        <p>EVERY one muſt be ſenſible that this was a great trial to Mr. EDWARDS. He had been near twenty four years among that people; and his labours had been, to all appearance, from time to time greatly bleſſed among them: and a great number looked on him as their ſpiritual father, who had been the happy inſtrument of turning them from darkneſs to light, and plucking them as brands out of the burning. And they had from time to time profeſſed that they looked upon it as one of their greateſt priviledges to have ſuch a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:009961_0071_0F7B3F44863318E0"/>
miniſter, and manifeſted their great love and eſteem of him, to ſuch a degree; that, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians) if it had been poſſible, they would have pluck'd out their own eyes, and given them to him. And they had a great intereſt in <hi>his</hi> heart: He had borne them on his heart and carried them in his boſom for many years; exerciſing a tender concern and love for them: for their good he was always writing, contriving, labouring; for them he had poured out ten thouſand fervent prayers; in their good he had rejoyced as one that findeth great ſpoil; and they were dear to him above any other people under heaven.</p>
                        <p>NOW to have <hi>this people</hi> turn againſt him, and thruſt him out from among them, in a great tumult and heat, with haſte, and a great degree of violence; like the Jews of old ſtoping their ears and runing upon him with furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeal, not allowing him to defend himſelf by giving him a fair hearing; and even refuſing ſo much as to hear him preach; many of them ſurmiſing and publickly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ill things as to his ends and deſigns! To have the tables turned ſo ſuddenly and the voice ſo general and loud againſt him. This ſurely muſt come very near to him, and try his ſpirit. The words of the pſalmiſt ſeems applicable to this caſe, <q>It was not an enemy that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me, that did magnify himſelf againſt me, then I would have hid my ſelf from him. But it was THOU— my guide and mine acquaintance. We took ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together, and walked unto the houſe of God in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</q>
                        </p>
                        <p>LET us therefore now <hi>behold the man!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>THE calm and ſedateneſs of his mind; his meekneſs and humility in great and violent oppoſition, and injurious treatment; his reſolution and ſteady conduct thro' all this dark and terrible ſtorm, were truly wonderful, and cannot be ſet in ſo beautiful and affecting a light by any deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they appeared in to his friends, who were eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS had a numerous and chargeable family, and little or no income, excluſive of his ſalary: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how far he was advanced in years; the general
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:009961_0072_0F7B3F44C3E1DDB0"/>
diſpoſition of people who want a miniſter to prefer a young man who has never been ſettled, to one who has been diſmiſſed from his people; and what miſrepreſentations were made of his principles thro' the country, it looked to him not at all probable that he ſhould ever have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be ſettled again in the work of the miniſtry, if he was diſmiſſed from <hi>Northampton:</hi> And he was not inclined or able to take any other courſe, or go into any other buſineſs to get a living. So that beggery as well as diſgrace ſtared him full in the face, if he perſiſted in his principles. To be ſure, he viewed himſelf as taking the moſt direct way to theſe, according to the natural courſe of things, by diſcovering and adhering to his principles, in the ſituation he then was. For he forſaw all this, before it came upon him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ore had the opportunity and the temptation to eſcape it, by concealing his principles. When he was fixed in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cples, and before they were publickly known, he told ſome of his friends, that if he diſcovered and perſiſted in them, it would moſt likely iſſue in his diſmiſſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; and the ruin of himſelf and family, as to their temporal intereſts. He therefore firſt ſat down and counted the coſt, and deliberately took up the croſs, when it was ſet before him in its full weight and magnitude; and in direct oppoſition to all worldly views and motives. And therefore his conduct in theſe circumſtances, was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable exerciſe and diſcovery of his conſcientiouſneſs; and his readineſs to deny himſelf, and forſake all that he had, to follow Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>A man muſt have a conſiderable degree of the ſpirit of a martyr, not to flinch in ſuch a caſe as this; but go on with the ſtedfaſtneſs &amp; reſolution with which he did. He, as it were, put his life in his hand, and ventur'd on where truth and duty appear'd to lead him, unmov'd at the threatning dangers on every ſide.</p>
                        <p>HOWEVER, God did not forſake him. As he gave him thoſe inward ſupports by which he was able in patience to poſſeſs his ſoul, and calmly and couragiouſly row on in the ſtorm, as it were, in the face of boiſtrous winds, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard upon him, and in the midſt of gaping waves threatning to ſwallow him up: ſo he ſoon appear'd for him,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009961_0073_0F7B3F462CAC2070"/>
in his providence, even beyond all his expectations. His correſpondents and other friends in Scotland, hearing of his diſmiſſion, and fearing it might be the means of bringing him into worldly ſtraits, generouſly contributed a handſome ſum, and ſent it over to him.</p>
                        <p>AND God did not leave him without tender, valuable friends at <hi>Northampton.</hi> For a ſmall number of his people who oppos'd his diſmiſſion from the beginning, and ſome who acted on neither ſide, who joined with him after his diſmiſſion, and adhered to him, under the influence of that great eſteem and love of Mr. EDWARDS were willing and thought themſelves able to maintain him: and inſiſted upon it that it was his duty to ſtay among them, as a diſtinct and ſeparate congregation from the body of the town, who had rejected him.</p>
                        <p>Mr. EDWARDS could not ſee it to be his duty to ſtay among them, as circumſtances were; as this would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be a means of perpetuating an unhappy diviſion in the town; and there was to him no proſpect of doing the good there, which would counterbalance the evil.

                              <p>And in the firſt place <hi>Sir,</hi> I apprehend that with the Church and People of <hi>Northampton,</hi> I ſinned and erred exceedingly in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and labouring that there ſhould be ſo early a diſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>And altho' it does not become me to pronounce deciſively on a point ſo diſputable as what was then in diſpute; yet I beg leave to ſay, that I really apprehend that it is of the higheſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body of this church, and to me in particular, moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly to enquire, whether like the Phariſees and Lawyers in John Baptiſt's time we did not reject the counſel of God againſt our ſelves, in rejecting Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and his doctrine: which was the ground of his diſmiſſion. And I humbly conceive that it highly imports us all of this church, moſt ſeriouſly and impartially to examine what that moſt worthy and able divine about that time publiſhed in ſupport of the ſame, whereby he being dead yet ſpeaketh.</p>
                              <p>

                              </p>
                              <p>In the firſt place I confeſs <hi>Sir,</hi> that I acted very immodeſtly and abuſively to you, as well as injuriouſly to the church and my ſelf, when with much zeal and unbecoming aſſurance, I moved the council that they would interpoſe to ſilence and ſtop you in an addreſs you was making one morning to the people, wherein you was, if I don't miſremember, briefly exhorting them to a tender remembrance of the former affection and harmony that had long ſubſiſted between them and their reverend paſtor, and the great comfort and profit which they had apprehended that they had received from his miniſtry; for which <hi>Sir,</hi> I heartily aſk your forgiveneſs; and I think, that we ought inſtead of oppoſing an exhortation of that nature, to have received it with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
                              <p>Another particular of my conduct before that council, which I now apprehend was criminal, and was owing to the want of that tender affection and reverend reſpect and eſteem for Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> which he had highly merited of me, was my ſtrenuouſly oppoſing the adjournment of the matters ſubmitted to that council, for about two months; for which I declare my ſelf unfeignedly ſorry; and I with ſhame remember, that I did it in a peremptory, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, vehement and very immodeſt manner.</p>
                              <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> the moſt criminal part of my conduct at that time, that I am conſcious of, was my exhibiting to that council a ſet of arguments in writing, the drift whereof was to prove the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and neceſſity of Mr. <hi>Edward's</hi> diſmiſſion in caſe no accommodation was then effected with mutual conſent; which tract by clear implication contained ſome ſevere, uncharitable, and if I don't miſremember, groundleſs and ſlanderous imputations on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and expreſſed in b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>As to the church's remonſtrance (as it was called) which their committee preferr'd to the laſt of ſaid councils, to all which I was conſenting, and in the compoſing whereof I was very active, as alſo in bringing the church to their vote upon it: I would in the firſt place only obſerve, that I don't remember any thing in that ſmall part of it which was plainly diſcurſive of the expediency of <hi>Mr. Edwards</hi>'s re-ſettlement here as paſtor to a part of the

                        <p>THE India, Miſſion at <hi>Stockbridge</hi> (a Town in the weſtern part of the Province of the <hi>Maſſachusetts-Bay,</hi> ſixty Miles from <hi>Northampton</hi>) being vacant by the death of the late reverend Mr. SERGEANT, the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reverend Commiſſioners for Indian affairs, in <hi>Boſton,</hi> who have the care and direction of it, applied to him, as the moſt ſuitable perſon they could think of to betruſt with
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:009961_0081_0F7B3F4DE16CF9F0"/>
that miſſion. And he was at the ſame time invited by the inhabitants of <hi>Stockbridge;</hi> and being adviſed by the council, above mentioned, to accept of the invitation, he repair'd to <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> and was introduced and fixed as miſſionary to the Indians there by an eccleſiaſtical council call'd for that purpose, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 8 1751.</p>
                        <p>WHEN Mr. EDWARDS firſt engaged in the miſſion, there was a hopeful proſpect of it's being extenſively ſerviceable, under his care and influence; not only to that tribe of Indians which was ſettled at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> but among the <hi>Six Nations:</hi> ſome of whom were coming to <hi>Stockbridge</hi> to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and bring their own, and as many of their neighbours children as they could get; to be educated and inſtructed there. For this end, a houſe for a boarding ſchool, which was projected by Mr SERGEANT, was erected on a tract of land appropriated to that uſe by the Indians at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:</hi> where the Indian Children, male and female were to be educated, by being cloath'd and fed, and inſtructed by proper perſons in uſeful learning. And the boys to be learned huſbandry or mechanic trades, and the girls all ſorts of women's work. For the encouragement of which, ſome generous ſubſcriptions were made both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> And the great and general Court of the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> did much to promote the affair, and provided lands for the Mohocks to ſettle on, who ſhould incline to come. And the generous Mr. HOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS, to be encourage the thing, order'd twenty four indian Children to be educated on the ſame footing, wholly at his coſt. Alſo the Society in <hi>London,</hi> for propagating the Gospel among the Indians in and about <hi>New-England,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their Commiſſioners in <hi>Boſton</hi> to do conſiderable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this deſign.</p>
                        <p>BUT partly by reaſon of ſome unhappy differences that took place among thoſe who had the chief management of this affair at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> of which a particular account would not be proper in this place; and partly by the war's breaking out between England and France, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally very fatal to such affairs among Indians, this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect came to nothing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="74" facs="unknown:009961_0082_0F7BD07A96D93A58"/>Mr. EDWARDS'S labours were attended with no remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable vaſible ſucceſs while at <hi>Stockbridge:</hi> tho' he perform'd the buſineſs of his miſſion to the good acceptance of the inhabitants in general, both Engliſh and Indians, and of the Commiſſioners, who ſupported him honorably, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided very much in his judgment and wiſdom in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to the miſſion.</p>
                        <p>STOCKBRIDGE proved to Mr. EDWARDS a more quiet, and, on many accounts, a much more comfortable ſituation than he was in before. It being ſo much in one corner of the country, his time was not ſo much taken up with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as it was at <hi>Northampton,</hi> tho' many of his friends, from almoſt all parts of the land, often made him pleaſant and profitable viſits. And he had not ſo much concern and trouble with other churches as he was obliged to have when at <hi>Northampton,</hi> by being frequently ſought to for advice, and call'd to aſſiſt in eccleſiaſtical councils. Here therefore he followed his beloved ſtudy more cloſely, and to better purpoſe than ever. In theſe ſix years he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs made ſwifter advances in knowledge than ever before, and added more to his Manuſcripts than in any ſix Years of his life.</p>
                        <p>AND this was probably as uſeful a part of his life as any. For in this time he wrote the two laſt books that have been publiſhed by him (of which a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count will be given hereafter) by which he has doubtleſs greatly ſerved the church of Chriſt, and will be a bleſſing to many thouſands yet unborn.</p>
                        <p>THUS, after his uprightneſs and faithfulneſs had been ſufficiently tried at <hi>Northampton,</hi> his kind maſter provided for him a quiet retreat, which was rendred the more ſweet by the preceeding ſtorm; and where he had a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to purſue and finiſh the work GOD had for him to do.</p>

The news of which was quite unexpected, and not a little ſurprizing to him. He looked on himſelf in many reſpects ſo unqualifyed for that buſineſs, that he wonder'd that Gentlemen of ſo good judgment, and ſo well acquainted with him, as he knew ſome of the Truſtees were, ſhould think of <hi>him</hi> for that place. He had many objections in his own mind againſt undertaking the buſineſs, both from his unfitneſs, and his particular circumſtances; yet could not certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that it was not his duty to accept. The following extract of a letter which he wrote to the Truſtees, will give the reader a view of his ſentiments and exerciſes on this occaſion, as well as of the great deſigns he was deeply engaged in, and zealouſly proſecuting.</p>

                              <p>I Was not a little ſurprized, on receiving the unexpected No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your having made choice of me to ſucceed the late preſident BURR, as the Head of Naſſau Hall.—I am much in doubt whether I am called to undertake the buſineſs, which you have done me the unmerited honour to chooſe me for— If ſome regard may be had to my outward comfort, I might mention the many Inconveniencies and great detriment, which muſt be ſuſtained, by my removing with my numerous family, ſo far from all the eſtate I have in the world (without any proſpect of diſpoſing of it, under preſent circumſtances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lofing it, in great part) now when we have ſcarcely got over the trouble and damage ſuſtained by our removal from Northampton, and have but juſt begun to have our affairs in a comfortable ſituation for a ſubſistence in this place; and the expence I muſt immediately be at to put my self into circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance tolerably comporting with the needful ſupport of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the office I am invited to; which will not well conſiſt with my ability.—But this is not my main objection: The
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:009961_0084_0F7B3F4F689BC850"/>
chief difficulty in my mind, in the way of accepting this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and arduous office, are theſe two: Firſt my own defects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting me for ſuch an undertaking, many of which are generally known; beſides other, which my own heart is conſcious to.— I have a conſtitution in many reſpects peculiar unhappy, attended with flucid ſolids, vapid, ſizy and ſcarce fluids, &amp; a low tide of ſpirits; often occaſioning a kind of childiſh weakneſs and contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpeech, preſence and demeanor; with a diſagreable dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtiffneſs, much unfiting me for converſation, but more eſpecially for the government of a College.— This poorneſs of conſtitution makes me ſhrink at the thoughts of taking upon me, in the decline of life, ſuch a new and great buſineſs, attended with ſuch a multiplicity of cares, and requiring ſuch a degree of activity, alertneſs and ſpirit of government; eſpecially as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one, ſo remarkably well qualified in theſe reſpects, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion to every one to remark the wide difference. I am alſo deficient in ſome parts of learning, particularly in Algebra, and the higher parts of Mathematicks, and in the Greek Claſſicks; my Greek learning having been chiefly in the new Teſtament — The other thing is this; that my engaging in this buſineſs, will not well conſiſt, with thoſe views, and that courſe of employ in my ſtudy, which have long engaged, and ſwallowed up my mind, and been the chief entertainment and delight of my life.—</p>
                              <p>And here, honored Sirs, (emboldned by the teſtimony, I have now received of your unmerited eſteem, to rely on your candor) I will with freedom open my ſelf to you.</p>
                              <p>My method of ſtudy, from my firſt beginning the work of the miniſtry, has been very much by writing; applying my ſelf in this way, to improve every important hint; purſuing the clew to my utmoſt, when any thing in reading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meditation or converſation, has been ſuggeſted to my mind, that ſeemed to promiſe light, in any weighty point.—Thus penning what appeared to me my beſt thoughts, on innumerable ſubjects for my own benefit. — The longer I proſecuted my ſtudies in this method, the more habitual it became, and the more pleaſant and profitable I found it.—The further I travelled in this way, the more and wider the field opened, which has occaſioned my laying out many things, in my mind, to do in this manner, if God ſhould ſpare my life, which my heart hath been much upon: particularly many things againſt moſt of the preva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

public) in like manner to conſider all the other controverted points, and have done much towards a preparation for it— But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, I have had on my mind and heart (which I long ago began, not with any view to publication) a great work, which I call a <hi>Hiſtory of the Work of Redemption,</hi> a Body of Divinity in an entire new method, being thrown into the form of an hiſtory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the affair of chriſtian Theology, as the whole of it, in each part, ſtands in reference to the great work of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt; which I ſuppoſe is to be the grand deſign, of all God's deſigns, and the ſummum and ultimum of all the divine operations and degrees; particularly conſidering all parts of the grand ſcheme in their hiſtorical order.—The order of their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or their being brought forth to view, in the courſe of divine diſpenſations, or the wonderful ſeries of ſucceſſive acts &amp; events; beginning from eternity and deſcending from thence to the great work and ſucceſſive diſpenſations of the infinitely wiſe God in time, conſidering the chief events coming to paſs in the church of God, and revolutions in the world of mankind, affecting the ſtate of the church and the affair of redemption, which we have account of in hiſtory or prophecy; 'till at laſt we come to the general Reſurrection, laſt Judgment, and conſummation of all things; when it tſhall be ſaid, <hi>It it done. I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End.</hi> Concluding my Work, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of that perfect ſtate of things, which ſhall be finally ſettled, to laſt for eternity.—This hiſtory will be carried on with regard to all three Worlds, Heaven, Earth and Hell: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the connected, ſucceſſive events and alterations, in each ſo far as the ſcriptures give any light; introducing all parts of divinity in that order which is moſt ſcriptural and moſt natural: which is a method which appears to me the moſt beautiful and entertaining, wherein every divine doctrine, will appear to greateſt advantage in the brighteſt light, in the moſt ſtriking manner, ſhewing the admirable contexture and harmony of the whole.</p>
                              <p>I have alſo for my own profit and entertainment, done much towards another great work, which I call <hi>the Harmony of the old and new Teſtament</hi> in three Parts —The firſt conſidering the prophecies of the Meſſiah, his Redemption and Kingdom; the Evidences of their Referrences to the Meſſiah &amp;c. comparing them all one with another, demonſtrating their agreement and true ſcope and ſenſe; alſo conſidering all the various particulars wherein theſe prophecies have their exact fulfilment; ſhewing the univerſal, preciſe, and admirable correſpondence between predictions and events. The ſecond Part: Conſidering the Types of the old teſtament, ſhowing the evidence of their being intended as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the great things of the goſpel of Chriſt and the agreement of the type with the antitype.— The third and great Part, conſidering the harmony of the old and new teſtament, as to doctrine and precept.—In the courſe of this work, I find there

will be occaſion for an explanation of a very great part of the holy ſcripture; which may, in ſuch a view be explained in a method, which to me ſeems the moſt entertaining and profitable, beſt tending to lead the mind to a view of the true ſpirit, deſign, life and ſoul of the ſcriptures, as well as to their proper uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
                              <p>I have alſo many other things in hand, in ſome of which I have made great progreſs, which I will not trouble you with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of....Some of theſe things, if divine providence favour I ſhould be willing to attempt a publication of — So far as I my ſelf am able to judge of what talents I have, for benefiting my follow creatures by word, I think I can write better than I can ſpeak.</p>
                              <p>My heart is ſo much in theſe that I cannot find it in my heart to be wiling to put my ſelf into an incapacity to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them any more, in the future part of my life, to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as I muſt, if I undertake to go thro' the ſame courſe of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, in the office of a Preſident, that Mr. <hi>Burr,</hi> did, inſtructing in all the languages, and taking the whole care of the inſtruction of one of the Claſſes in all parts of learning, beſides his other labours.— If I ſhould ſee light to determine me to accept the place offered me, I ſhould be willing to take upon me the work of a Preſident, ſo far as it conſiſts in the general inſpection of the whole ſociety and ſubſervient to the ſchool, as to their order and methods of ſtudy and inſtruction, aſſiſting my ſelf in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inſtruction in the arts and ſciences (as diſcretion ſhould direct and occaſion ſerve, and the ſtate of things require) eſpecially the ſenior claſs: and added to all, ſhould be willing to do the whole work of a profeſſor of divinity, in publick and private lectures, propoſing queſtions to be anſwered, an ſome to be diſcuſſed in writing and free converſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in meetings of graduates and others, appointed in proper ſeaſons for theſe ends....It would be now out of my way, to ſpend time, in a conſtant teaching of the languages; unleſs it be the hebrew tongue, which I ſhould be willing to improve my ſelf in, by inſtructing others.</p>
                              <p>On the whole, I am much at a loſs, with reſpect to the way of my duty in this important affair: I am in doubt, whether if I ſhould engage in it, I ſhould not do what both you and I ſhould be ſorry for afterwards. Nevertheleſs, I think the greatneſs of the affair, and the regard due to ſo worthy and venerable a body, as that of the Truſtees of <hi>Naſſau-Hall,</hi> requires my taking the matter into ſerious conſideration: And unleſs you ſhould appear to be diſcouraged by the things which I have now repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, as to any further expectation from me, ſhall proceed to aſk advice, of ſuch as I eſteem moſt wiſe, friendly and faithful; if after the mind of the Commiſſioners in <hi>Boſton</hi> is known, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they conſent to leave me at liberty, with reſpect to the buſineſs they have employed me in here.</p>

Who upon his, and his people's deſire, met at <hi>Stockbridge, January</hi> 4. 1758. And having heard Mr. EDWARDS'S repreſentation of the matter, and what his people had to ſay by way of objection againſt his removal, determined it was his duty to accept of the invitation to the preſidency of the College.</p>
                        <p>WHEN they publiſhed their judgment and advice to Mr. EDWARDS and his people, he appear'd uncommonly mov'd and affected with it, and fell into tears on the occaſion; which was very unuſual for him, in the preſence of others: and ſoon after ſaid to the gentlemen, who had given their advice, that it was matter of wonder to him, that they could ſo eaſily, as they appear'd to do, get over the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections he had made againſt his removal, to be the head of a college; which appear'd great and weighty to him But as he thought it his duty to be directed by their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he ſhould now endeavour chearfully to undertake it, believing he was in the way of his duty.</p>
                        <p>ACCORDINGLY, having had, by the application of the Truſtees of the College, the conſent of the Commiſſioners to reſign their miſſion; he girded up his loins, and ſet off from <hi>Stockbridge</hi> for <hi>Prince-Town</hi> in <hi>January.</hi> He left his family at <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> not to be removed till Spring. He had two daughters at <hi>Prince-town,</hi> Mrs. BURR, the Widow of the late Preſident BURR, and his oldeſt daughter that was unmarried.</p>
                        <p>HIS arrival at <hi>Prince-town</hi> was ſo the great ſatisfaction and joy of the college. And indeed all the greateſt friends to the college, and to the intereſt of religion, were highly ſatisfied and pleas'd with the appointment of Mr. EDWARDS to the Preſidency of that College, and had their hopes and expectations greatly raiſed hereby. And his correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and friends, and well-wiſhers to the College in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> greatly approv'd of it.</p>
                        <p>THE Corporation met as ſoon as could be with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, after his arrival at the College, when he was by them fixed in the preſident's chair.</p>

                           <pb n="80" facs="unknown:009961_0088_0F7B3F53BA99CCF0"/>WHILE at <hi>Prince-town,</hi> before his ſickneſs, he preachd in the College-hall from Sabbath to Sabbath, to the great acceptance of the hearers: but did nothing as preſident, unleſs it was to give out ſome queſtions in divinity to the ſenior claſs, to be anſwered before him; each one having opportunity to ſtudy and write what he thought proper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. When they came together to anſwer them, they found ſo much entertainment and profit by it, eſpecially by the light and inſtruction Mr. EDWARDS communicated in what he ſaid upon the queſtions, when they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd what they had to ſay, that they ſpoke of it with the greateſt ſatisfaction and wonder.</p>
                        <p>DURING this time, Mr. EDWARDS ſeem'd to enjoy an uncommon degree of the preſence of GOD. He told his daughters, he had had great exerciſe, concern and fear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to his engaging in that buſineſs; but ſince it now appeared, ſo far as he could ſee, that he was call'd of God to that place and work, he did cheerfully devote himſelf to it, leaving himſelf and the event with God, to order what ſeemed to Him good.</p>
                        <p>THE Small-pox had now become very common in the country, and was then at <hi>Prince-town,</hi> and likely to ſpread. And as Mr. EDWARDS had never had it, and Inoculation was then practiſed with great ſucceſs in thoſe parts, he pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſed to be inoculated, if the phyſician ſhould adviſe to it, and the corporation would give their conſent.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, by the adviſe of the phyſician, and conſent of the corporation, he was inoculated <hi>February</hi> 13. He had it favourably, and it was thought all danger was over: But a ſecondary fever ſet in; and by reaſon of a number of puſtles in his throat, the obſtruction was ſuch, that the medicines neceſſary to ſtench the fever, could not be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter'd. It therefore raged till it put an end to his life on the 22d of <hi>March</hi> 1758. in the 55th Year of his Age.</p>
                        <p>AFTER he was ſenſible that he ſhould not ſurvive that ſickneſs, a little before his death, he call'd his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him, who attended him in his ſickneſs, and addreſs'd her in a few words, which were immediately taken down in writing, as near as could be recollected, and are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,—

                        <p>MR. EDWARDS has left a great many Volumes in manuſcript, which he wrote in a miſcellaneous way on almoſt all ſubjects in divinity; which he did, not with any deſign they ſhould ever be publiſhed in the form in which they are; but for the ſatisfaction and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>improvement of his own mind, and that he might retain the thoughts, which appear'd to him worth preſerving. Some idea of the progreſs he had made, and the materials he had collected in this way, he gives in the foregoing let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009961_0091_0F7B3F56060C10B0"/>
to the Truſtees of <hi>Naſſau-Hall,</hi> 
                           <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 75.</note> He has wrote much on the prophecies of the MESSIAH, Juſtification, the Divinity of Chriſt, and the eternity of Hell Torments. He wrote a great deal on the Bible, in the ſame way, by opening his thoughts on particular paſſages of it, as they occur'd to him in reading or meditation; by which he has caſt much light on many parts of the bible, which has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped other interpreters. And by which his great and painful attention to the Bible, and making it the only rule of his faith, are manifeſt.</p>
                        <p>IF the publick was willing to be at the coſt, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing books of divinity met with as much encouragement now, as it has ſometimes, there might be a number of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes publiſhed from his manuſcripts, which would afford a great deal of new light and entertainment to the church of Chriſt: tho' they would be more imperfect, than if he himſelf had prepar'd them for publick view.</p>
                        <p>AS the method he took to have his miſcellaneous wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings in ſuch order, as to be able with eaſe to turn to any thing he had wrote upon a particular ſubject, when he had occaſion, is perhaps as good as any, if not the beſt that has been propoſed to the publick; ſome account of it will here be given, as what may be of advantage to young ſtudents, who have not yet gone into any method, and are diſpoſed to improve their minds by writing.</p>
                        <p>HE <hi>numbered</hi> all his miſcellaneous writings. The firſt thing he wrote is No. 1. the ſecond No. 2. and ſo on. And when he had occaſion to write on any particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he firſt ſet down the Number, and then wrote the Subject in capitals or large character, that it might not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape his eye, when he ſhould have occaſion to turn to it. As for inſtance, if he was going to write on the happineſs of Angels, and his laſt No. was 148, he would begin thus— 149. ANGELS, their HAPPINESS. — And when he had wrote what he deſign'd at that time on that ſubject, he would turn to an alphabetical table which he kept, and under the letter A, he would write, Angels, their happineſs, if this was not already in his alphabet; and then ſet down the Number, 149, cloſe at the right hand of it. And if he had occaſion to write any new thoughts on this ſame ſubject;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:009961_0092_0F7B3F56B6E48550"/>
if the Number of his miſcellanies was increaſed, ſo that his laſt Number was 261, he would ſet down the Number 262, and then the ſubject, as before. And when he had done writing for that time, he turn'd to his table, to the word Angels; and at the right hand of the Number 149, ſet down 162. By this means he had no occaſion to leave any chaſms; but began his next ſubject where he left off his laſt. The number of his miſcellaneous writings rang'd in this manner, amounts to above 1400. And yet by a table contain'd on a ſheet or two of paper, any thing he wrote can be turned to, at pleaſure.</p>

This treatiſe doubtleſs goes further towards ſettling the main points in controverſy between Calviniſts and Arminians, than any thing that has been wrote: he having herein abundantly demonſtrated the chief principles on which Arminians build their whole ſcheme, to be falſe and moſt abſurd.

                     <hi>APPENDIX,</hi> N<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> I. Containing a brief ACCOUNT of Mrs. ESTTER BURR, and ſome Extracts of LETTERS wrote by her.</head>
                  <p>MRs. BURR and her children were inoculated at the ſame time her father was, and were recovered when he died. But after ſhe was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to all appearance, ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a violent diſorder, which carried her out of the world in a few days: and which the phyſician ſaid he could call by no name but that of <hi>A Meſſenger ſent, ſuddenly to call her out of the world.</hi> She died <hi>April</hi> 7. 1758. ſixteen days after her father, in the 27th year of her age. She was married to Mr. <hi>Burr,</hi> June 29. 1752. By him ſhe had two children, a ſon and a daughter.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. BURR exceeded moſt of her ſex in the beauty of her perſon; and in a decent and eaſy geſture, behaviour and converſation: not ſtiff and ſtarch on the one hand, nor mean and indecent on the other, in her unaffected, natural freedom with perſons of all ranks, with whom ſhe converſed. Her genius was much more than common. She had a lively, ſprightly imagination, a quick and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating thought, and a good judgment. She had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſmartneſs in her make and temper, which yet was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with pleaſantneſs &amp; good nature: and ſhe knew how to be pleaſant &amp; fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In ſhort, ſhe ſeem'd to be form'd to pleaſe, and eſpecially to pleaſe one of Mr. <hi>Burr</hi>'s taſte and talents, in whom he was exceeding happy. But what crow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="unknown:009961_0097_0F7BD08B9E3F7438"/>
was exemplary and as becometh godlineſs. But as her religious ſentiments and exerciſes, will beſt be underſtood by thoſe who were ſtrangers to her, by her own words; the following extracts are made from letters which ſhe wrote not long before her death.</p>
                  <p>THE following is an extract from a Letter ſhe wrote to her Mother, not long after Mr. <hi>Burr</hi>'s death, dated at <hi>Prince-ton October</hi> 7. 1757. After giving ſome account of Mr. <hi>Burr</hi>'s death, and repreſenting the ſenſe ſhe had of the greatneſs of the loſs ſhe and her children had ſuſtained, ſhe writes in the following words,
<floatingText type="letter">

                           <p>I think GOD has given me ſuch a ſenſe of the vanity of the world, and uncertainty of all ſublunary enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as I never had before.

                           <p>THE way of ſalvation by faith in Jeſus Chriſt has appeared more clear and excellent; and I have been conſtrained to venture my All upon Him; and have found great peace of ſoul, in what I hope has been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of faith.—Some parts of the Pſalms have been very comforting and refreſhing to my ſoul.</p>

                           <p>O, I am afraid I ſhall conduct ſo as to bring diſhonor on my GOD, and the religion which I profeſs! — No, rather let me die this moment, than be left to bring diſhonor on GOD's holy name. — I am overcome — I muſt conclude with once more begging, that as my dear parents remember themſelves, they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their greatly afflicted daughter, (now a lonely widow) nor her fatherleſs children.</p>

                           <p>YOUR moſt affectionate, comforting letter by my brother, — was exceedingly refreſhing to me, altho' I was ſomething damp'd by hearing that I ſhould not ſee you until ſpring.<note n="†" place="bottom">When Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> wrote the Letter ſhe refers to, he did not think of going to Prince-ton till ſpring; but he afterwards determin'd otherwiſe, and went in January, as is before lated.</note> But 'tis my comfort in this diſappointment, as well as under all my afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that GOD knows what is beſt for me, and for his

own glory. Perhaps I lotted too much on the company and converſation of ſuch a nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                           <p>SINCE I wrote my mother's letter, GOD has carried me thro' new trials, and given me new ſupports. My little ſon has been ſick with the ſlow fever, ever ſince my brother left us, and has been brought to the brink of the grave. But I hope in mercy God is bringing him up again. I was enabled to reſign the child (after a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſtruggle with nature) with the greatest freedom. GOD ſhewed me that the child was not my own, but his; and that he had a right to recall what he had lent, whenever he thought fit; and I had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, or ſay GOD was hard with me. This ſilenced me.</p>
                           <p>BUT O, how good is GOD! He not only kept me from complaining, but comforted me by enabling me to offer up the child by faith, I think, if ever I acted faith. I ſaw the fulneſs there was in Chriſt for little Infants, and his willnigneſs to accept of ſuch as were offer'd to Him. "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not;" were comforting words.</p>
                           <p>GOD alſo ſhewed me in ſuch a lively manner, the fullneſs there was in himſelf of all ſpiritual bleſſings, that I ſaid, Altho' all ſtreams were cut off, yet ſo long as my GOD lives, I have enough. He enabled me to ſay, "Altho' thou ſlay me, yet will I truſt in thee.</p>
                           <p>IN this time of trial, I was led to enter into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and explicit covenant with GOD, in a more ſolemn manner than ever before; and with the greateſt freedom and delight. After much ſelf-examination and prayer, I did give up my ſelf and children to GOD, with my whole heart. Never until now, had I a ſenſe of the priviledge we are allowed in covenanting with God! This act of ſoul left my mind in a quiet and ſteady truſt in GOD.</p>
                           <p>A few days after this, one evening, in talking of the glorious ſtate my dear departed huſband muſt be in, my ſoul was carried out in ſuch longing deſires after this
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:009961_0100_0F7B3DDD788FB4B0"/>
glorious ſtate, that I was forced to retire from the family to conceal my joy. When alone, I was ſo tranſported, and my ſoul carried out in ſuch eager deſires after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the full enjoyment of GOD, and to ſerve him uninterruptedly, that I think my Nature would not have born much more. I think, dear ſir, I had that night, a foretaſte of heaven. This frame continued in ſome good degree the whole night. I ſlept but little, and when I did, my dreams were all of heavenly and divine things. Frequently ſince, I have felt the ſame in kind, tho' not in degree. Thus a kind and gracious GOD has been with me in ſix troubles, and in ſeven.</p>
                           <p>BUT O Sir, what cauſe of deep humiliation and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſoul have I, on account of remaining corruption; which I ſee working continually, eſpecially pride! O, how many ſhapes does pride cloke it ſelf in!</p>
                           <p>SATAN is alſo buſy ſhooting his darts; but, bleſſed be GOD, thoſe temptations of his, that uſed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw me, as yet, have not touched me. O, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the power of ſatan, as well as ſin! I can't help hoping the time is near. GOD is certainly fitting me for himſelf; and when I think it will be ſoon that I ſhall be called hence, the thought is tranſporting.</p>

                  <p>MRs. SARAH EDWARDS, the amiable conſort of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident EDWARDS, did not long ſurvive him.

She arived there by the way of <hi>Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Sept. 21. in good health, having had a comfortable
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009961_0101_0F7B3DDF3003D6F0"/>
journey. But in a few days ſhe was ſuddenly ſeized with a violent dyſentery, which put an end to her life on the fifth day, October 2. 1758, in the 49th Year of her age. She ſaid not much in her ſickneſs; being exerciſed moſt of the time with violent pain. On the morning of the day ſhe died, ſhe apprehended her death was near: when ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her entire reſignation to GOD, and deſire that GOD might be glorified in all things; and that ſhe might be enabled to glorify him to the laſt: and continued in ſuch a temper, calm and reſigned till ſhe died.</p>
                  <p>HER remains were carried to <hi>Princeton,</hi> which is about 40 miles from Philadelphia, and depoſited with Mr. ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARDS's. Thus they who were in their lives remarkably lovely and pleaſant, in their death were not much divided. Here lie the Father and Mother, the Son and Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are laid together in the grave, within the ſpace of a little more than a year, tho' a few months before their dwelling was more than 150 miles apart. Two preſidents of the ſame College, and their conſorts, than whom it will doubtleſs be hard to find <hi>four</hi> perſons more valuable and uſeful; in a few months are cut off from the earth forever; and by a remarkable providence are put, as it were, into one grave! And we the ſurvivors are left under the gloomy apprehenſion that theſe righteous are taken away from the evil to come!</p>
                  <p>SURELY <hi>America</hi> is greatly emptied by theſe deaths! How much knowledge, wiſdom and holineſs is gone from the earth for ever! And where are they who ſhall make good their ground!</p>
                  <p>Mrs. EDWARDS was born in New-Haven, in Connecticut, Jan. 9. 1709, 10. Her father was the rev. Mr. JAMES PIERPOINT, who was long an eminently godly and uſeful miniſter of the goſpel at New-Haven. <note n="‡" place="bottom">He was the eldeſt ſon of Mr. <hi>John Pierpoint</hi> of Roxbury, who came out of England. Her mother was Mrs <hi>Mary Pierpoint,</hi> eldeſt daughter of the rev. Mr. <hi>Samuel Hooker,</hi> miniſter of the goſpel at Farmington in Connecticut, and ſon of the rev. Mr. <hi>Thomas Hooker,</hi> once miniſter of the goſpel at Hartford, and famous as a divine, thro' all the churches in New-England.</note> She was married to Mr. EDWARDS, July 20. 1727. in the 18th year of her age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:009961_0102_0F7B3DDFE38E8618"/>THO' Mrs. EDWARDS's full character will not be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted here, yet it is thought proper to mention a few things, in which ſhe excelled, and ſet an example worthy the imitation of all.</p>
                  <p>SHE remember'd her creator in the days of her youth, and became truly and remarkably religious at about five years old. Was a more than ordinary beautiful perſon; of a pleaſant, agreable countenance; of an amiable, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous converſation and behaviour: the law of kindneſs was in her tongue.</p>
                  <p>She was eminent for her piety and experimental religion. Religious converſation was much her delight; and this ſhe promoted in all companies as far as was proper and decent for her: and her diſcourſe ſhew'd her underſtanding in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things, and the great impreſſion they had on her mind. The friends of true religion, and they who were ready to engage in religious converſation, and delighted in that which was moſt eſſential and practical in true religion; were her peculiar friends and intimates. To whom ſhe would open her mind freely, and tell them the exerciſes of her own heart; and what God had done for her ſoul, for their encouragement, and excitement in the ways of God. Her mind appear'd, to them who were moſt converſant with her, conſtantly to attend to divine things, even on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and in all buſineſs of life.</p>
                  <p>THE religious duties of the cloſet, ſhe was a great friend to, and took much delight in them. She highly prized ſocial worſhip. Was wont to attend the private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for religious worſhip, which were kept up at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> while Mr. EDWARDS lived there. And promoted and attended meetings of perſons of her own ſects only, in order for prayer and religious converſation. She was a conſtant attender on publick worſhip; and behaved with great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and ſeriouſneſs in the houſe of GOD.</p>
                  <p>SHE paid proper deference to Mr. EDWARDS, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with decency and reſpect at all times. As he was of a weakly, infirm conſtitution, and was peculiar and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act in his diet, ſhe was a tender nurſe to him; chearfully attending upon him at all times, and miniſtring to his comfort: and ſpared no pains to conform to his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and make things agreeable and comfortable to him.</p>
                  <p>SHE accounted it her greateſt glory, and that wherein ſhe could beſt ſerve God and her generation, in being a
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:009961_0103_0F7B3DE082806568"/>
means of promoting Mr. EDWARDS's comfort and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in this way. And no perſon of diſcerning could be converſant in the family without obſerving and admiring the great harmony and mutual love and eſteem that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between them.</p>
                  <p>WHEN ſhe her ſelf labour'd under bodily diſorders and pains, which was often the caſe, ſhe was not wont to be full of her complaints, and put on a dejected or ſour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, being out of humour with every body and every thing, as if <hi>ſhe</hi> was diſregarged and neglected: but ſhe would bare up under them with patience, and a kind of cheerfulneſs and good humour.</p>
                  <p>SHE was a good oeconomiſt, managing her houſhold affairs with diſcretion; in which ſhe was laborious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent. She was very careful that nothing ſhould be waſted and loſt. And often, when ſhe did any thing to ſave a ſmall matter, or directed her children to do it in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or ſaw them waſte any thing; ſhe would mention the words of our Saviour; which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe often tho't of, as containing a maxim worth remembering; when, as the reaſon why his diſciples ſhould gather up the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ſays, THAT NOTHING BE LOST. She took al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole care of the temporal affairs of the family, without doors and within: and in this ſhe was peculiarly ſuited to Mr. EDWARDS's diſpoſition, who choſe to have no care of any worldly buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>SHE had an excellent way of governing her children: ſhe knew how to make them regard and obey her cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully without loud, angry words, or heavy blows. She ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtrook her children a blow; and in ſpeaking to them uſed mild, gentle and pleaſant words. If any correction was needful, it was not her manner to give it in a paſſion. And when ſhe had occaſion to reprove and rebuke, ſhe would do it in few words, without heat and noiſe, with all calmneſs and gentleneſs of mind. And in her directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or reproofs, in any matters of importance, ſhe would addreſs herſelf to the reaſon of her children, that they might not only know her inclination and will, but at the ſame time, be convinced of the reaſonableneſs of it. She need ſpeak but <hi>once;</hi> ſhe was chearfully obeyed; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and anſwering again was not known among them. And the kind &amp; gentle treatment they had from their mother, while ſhe ſtrictly &amp; punctualy maintain'd her parental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:009961_0104_0F7B3DE144347250"/>
ſeem'd naturally to beget and promote a filial regard and reſpect; and lead them to a mild, tender treatment of each other; for quareling and contention, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently takes place among children, was not known among them. She carefully obſerved the firſt appearances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and ill-will towards any, in her young children; and did not connive at it and promote it, as many who have the care of children do, but was careful to ſhew her diſpleaſure at it, and ſuppreſs it to her utmoſt: not by angry, wrathful words and blows, which often provoke children to wrath, and ſtir up and confirm their iraſcible paſſions, rather than abate and ſuppreſs them.</p>
                  <p>AS ſhe was ſenſible that in many reſpects, the chief care of forming children by government and inſtruction, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lies on mothers; as they are moſt with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their moſt pliable age, when they commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive impreſſions by which they are very much form'd for life: ſo ſhe was very careful to do her part in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs. And when ſhe met with any ſpecial difficulty in this matter, or foreſaw any, ſhe was wont to apply to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> for advice and aſſiſtance: and on ſuch occaſions they would both attend to it, as a matter of great importance.</p>
                  <p>BUT this was not all, in which ſhe expreſs'd her care for her children. She thought that parents had great and important duty to do towards their children before they were capable of government and inſtruction. For them ſhe conſtantly and earneſtly pray'd, and bore them on her heart before God, in all her ſecret and moſt ſolemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him; and that even before they were born. The evidence of her pregnancy, and conſideration that it was with a rational, immortal creature, which came into exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in an undone, and infinitely dreadful ſtate, was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to lead her to bow before God daily for his bleſſing on it; even redemption, and eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt. So that thro' all the pain, labour and ſorrow, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her being the mother of children, ſhe was in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for them, that they might be born of GOD by having Chriſt formed in them.</p>
                  <p>AS the law of kindneſs was in her tongue, ſo her hands were not withheld from beneficence and charity. She was always a friend and patroneſs of the poor and helpleſs; and much in <hi>acts</hi> of charity, as well as recommending it to others on all proper occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="unknown:009961_0105_0F7B3DE1FAC8FEF8"/>SHE was remarkable for her kindneſs to her friends and viſitants, who reſorted to Mr. EDWARDS's. She would ſpare no pains to make them welcome, and provide for their convenience and comfort. And ſhe was peculiarly kind to ſtrangers, who came to her houſe. She would take ſuch kind and ſpecial notice of ſuch, and ſo ſoon get acquainted with them, as it were, and ſhew ſuch regard and concern for their comfort, and ſo kindly offer what ſhe thought they needed, as to diſcover ſhe knew the heart of a ſtranger, and well underſtood how to do it good; and ſo as to oblige them to feel in ſome meaſure as if they were at home.</p>
                  <p>SHE made it her rule to ſpeak well of all, ſo far as ſhe could with truth, and juſtice to herſelf and others. She was not wont to dwell with delight on the imperfections and failings of any; and when ſhe heard perſons ſpeaking ill of others, ſhe would ſay what ſhe thought ſhe could with truth and juſtice in their excuſe; or divert the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy by mentioning thoſe things that were commendable in them. Thus ſhe was tender of every one's character, even of theirs who injured and ſpoke evil of her; and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guarded againſt the too common vice of evil ſpeaking and backbiting. She could bear injuries and reproach with great calmneſs &amp; patience, without any diſpoſition to render evil for evil; but on the contrary, was ready to pity and forgive thoſe who appear'd to be her enemies.</p>
                  <p>SHE had long told her intimate friends that ſhe had, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long ſtruggles and exerciſes, obtain'd, by God's grace, an habitual willingneſs to die her ſelf, or part with any of her moſt near relatives. That ſhe was willing to bring forth children for death; and reſign up him whom ſhe eſteemed ſo great a bleſſing to her &amp; her family, her neareſt partner, to the ſtroke of death, whenever GOD ſhould ſee fit to take him. And when ſhe had the greateſt trial in the death of Mr. EDWARDS, ſhe found the help and comfort of ſuch a diſpoſition. Her converſation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on this occaſion was even to the admiration of her friends. It was ſuch as diſcover'd that ſhe was ſenſible of the great loſs, ſhe and her children had ſuſtain'd in his death; and at the ſame time ſhewed, that ſhe was quiet and reſigned, and had thoſe inviſible ſupports and comforts by which ſhe could truſt in GOD with quietneſs, hope and humble joy.</p>

                     <pb n="98" facs="unknown:009961_0106_0F7B3DE2B8B136D0"/>THEY lived together in the married ſtate above thirty years.

                  <p>SERMONS ON Various important SUBJECTS. Being ſome of the Remains of the late Reverend and Learned Mr. <hi>JONATHAN EDWARDS,</hi> PRESIDENT of the COLLEGE at NEW-JERSEY.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BOSTON:</hi> Printed and Sold by S. KNEELAND, in Queen-Street. M,DCC,LXV.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="preface">
                  <pb facs="unknown:009961_0108_0F7B3DE4776E27B0"/>
                  <head>The PREFACE</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>UCH was the true character of the pious &amp; learned author of the enſuing Sermons, as that the lovers of pure religion, and unaffected learning, who were intimately acquainted with him, and free from prejudice, need nothing further to invite their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive peruſal of the following ſheets, than only to be informed that they were written by the late PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDENT <hi>EDWARDS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Sermons indeed appear under conſiderable diſadvantages: The author compoſed them only to be preach'd to a congregation in a country-town, where he ſtatedly labour'd in the work of the goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for a courſe of years, probably without the leaſt deſign, or ſo much as even any diſtant view of their ever making an appearance, by way of the preſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world. For this, the candid will make a generous allowance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:009961_0109_0F7B3DE4F991A008"/>IF the author had publiſhed them himſelf, or had reviſed them near the cloſe of his life, with a view to their public appearance, 'tis not at all likely they would have appeared as they do at preſent; but the difference in ſome reſpects at leaſt, muſt have been conſiderable. In ſeveral places, inlargements would have been made; various parts would have been brightned with new illuſtrations; the ſtile in a number of inſtances would have been alter'd, and the dreſs made more agreable. And, in a word, the whole, taken together, would have appear'd in a much more advantageous light, more inſtructive, and entertaining.</p>
                  <p>This might have been reaſonably expected, from the author's maſterly and diſtinguiſhed genius, which prompted him eagerly to purſue truth, even in her moſt ſecret receſſes. Eſpecially, if it be conſidered, that the greater part of theſe Sermons were penn'd more than twenty years before his death, in which ſpace of time, he made ſwift &amp; amazing advances in divine knowledge, in branches almoſt numberleſs. The ſame thing may be inferr'd from the author's manner: Some Sermons, that he formerly publiſhed, received
<pb facs="unknown:009961_0110_0F7B3DE6D4DA12E0"/>
great enlargements under his laſt and finiſhing hand; and howev'r engaging and entertaining they were in the delivery, they appear'd much ampler from the preſs, than the pulpit.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, 'tis ſome unhappineſs, thro' a miſtake, the ſubjects are not placed in that natural and advantageous order, which was deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, under all their diſadvantages, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, 'tis apprehended, will be well receiv'd by the candid, intelligent chriſtian reader: And that every perſon that is poſſeſſed of a happy degree of ſound judgment, and good taſte, who ſhall ſeriouſly peruſe them, will find that juſtneſs and clearneſs of thought; that natural &amp; lively repreſentation of divine things; that vein of piety and ſolid religion running through the whole; that extenſive knowledge, that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pungency, and ſpiritual ſavor, which may ſerve in a meaſure to point out the author, and at the ſame time, to inſtruct, entertain and quicken the reader.</p>
                  <p>The public may be aſſured that the Sermons are faithfully copied from the original manuſcripts. And where ſentences, or paragraphs were found unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="unknown:009961_0111_0F7B3DE76DE66590"/>
as there were various ſuch inſtances, in moſt of the Sermons, mark'd with a ſtroke of the pen, thus —which the author uſed to ſupply in the delivery,—the editor has not taken the liberty to compleat them, except an inſtance or two, in the Sermons <hi>upon the wiſdom of God</hi>—where the words added, are carefully included in crotchets. Wherever therefore, the reader finds ſuch a ſtroke— he is hereby notified, that ſomething is left unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, which his own mind is to ſupply.</p>
                  <p>The date, at the beginning of the Sermons, marks the time when they were compoſed and preach'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sermons being ſome of the remains of an eminent man of God, &amp;, friend to men, are heartily recommended to the candid acceptance, and faithful improvement of all into whoſe hands they may fall; and to the bleſſing of him who is ALL and IN ALL, the great diſpoſer of all events, who was pleaſed ſignally to diſtinguiſh his ſervant, when li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, with gifts and graces, and to crown his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with unuſual ſucceſs.</p>

the chief Oppoſers of this Doctrine, were their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. The Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Dead, was not conſiſtent with their Philoſophy, by the Principles of which, it was impoſſible that one who was deprived of the Habit of Life, ſhould ever receive it again. And therefore they ridiculed the Doctrine when the Apoſtle preached it among them at Athens. <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xvii.</note> It probably was chiefly from theſe latter that the Church at Corinth received this Corruption, the Philoſophers, and not the Sadducees. For Corinth was near to Athens, which was the Place of the chief Reſort of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of all the Cities of that learned Country of Greece.</p>
                  <p>THE Apoſtle in oppoſing this Error, firſt inſiſts on Chriſt's Reſurrection from the Dead; and next on the Reſurrection of all the Saints at the end of the World. And in the Verſes next before the Text, ſhews how both are connected, or that one ariſes or follows from the other. And then adds, <hi>Then cometh the End, when he ſhall have delivered up the Kingdom to God even the Father, when he ſhall have put down all Rule, and all Authority, &amp; Power. For he muſt reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet. The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</hi>

He procured their Ruin in Body and Soul, and the Death of both; and that they ſhould be expoſed to all Manner of Calamity in this World, and to eternal Ruin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. He ſo far prevailed, that he drew Men off from the Service of their Maker, and ſet up himſelf to be the God of this World; and in a little Time drew the World into that almoſt univerſal Corruption, which brought on the Flood of Waters, by which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And after that, he again in a little Time drew all Nations, except the Poſterity of Jacob, off from the Worſhip of the true God, and darkened all the World with the darkneſs of Heatheniſm; and held them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Darkneſs for a great many Ages: he himſelf being worſhiped as God almoſt all over the World: the Nations of the Earth offered Sacrifices to him; and Multitudes offered up their Children in Sacrifice to him.

And has infected the chriſtian World with Multitudes of Hereſies and falſe Ways of Worſhip, and greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Atheiſm and Infidelity. Thus highly has the Devil exalted himſelf againſt God and Chriſt, and the Elect; and ſo far has he prevailed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. GUILT is another Evil which has come to a great height in the World. All Guilt is an Evil of a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nature: the leaſt Degree of it is enough utterly to undo any Creature. It is a Thing that reaches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, and cries to God, and brings down his Wrath. The guilt of any one Sin is ſo terrible an Evil, that it prevails to bind over the guilty Perſon to ſuffer everlaſting Burnings: and ſo is an Evil that is in ſome Reſpect infinite, in that it obliges to that Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which has no end; and ſo is infinitely terrible. But this kind of Evil has riſen to a moſt amazing height in this World; where not only ſome Perſons are guilty, but all in all Nations and Ages are naturally
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009961_0119_0F7B3DEE8959EFA8"/>
guilty Wretches. And they who live to act any time in the World, are not only guilty of <hi>one</hi> Sin, but of Thouſands, and thouſands of Thouſands. What mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and what aggravated Sins are ſome Men guilty of! What Guilt lies on ſome particular Perſons! how much more on ſome particular populous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties! How much more ſtill on this wicked World! How much does the Guilt of the World tranſcend all Account; all Expreſſion; all Powers of Numbers or Meaſures! And above all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how vaſt is the Guilt of the World, in all Ages of it, from the beginning of the World to the end of it! To what a Pitch has Guilt riſen in the World; The World being, as it were, on every Side, loaded with it, as with Mountains heaped on Mountains above the Clouds and Stars of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>AND Guilt, when it was imputed to Chriſt, greatly prevailed againſt him; tho' in himſelf innocent, and the eternal Son of God; even ſo as to hold him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of Juſtice for a while; and to open the Flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of God's Wrath upon him, and bring all his Waves and Billows over him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. CORRUPTION and Wickedneſs of Heart, is another Thing that has riſen to an exceeding height in the World. Sin has ſo far prevailed in the World, that it has become univerſal: All Mankind that are meer Men, are become ſinful and corrupt Creatures. Let us attend to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Deſcription of the World. <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom iii. 9— 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Jews and Gentiles are all under Sin. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. There is none Righteous, no not one: there is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the Way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth Good, no not one.</hi> And not only is <hi>every one</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; but they are <hi>all over</hi> corrupt, in every Power, Faculty &amp; Principle; every Part is depraved. Which is here repreſented by the ſeveral Parts of the Body being corrupt, as the Throat, the Tongue, the Lips,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009961_0120_0F7B3DEF2DB1A5A8"/>
the Mouth, the Feet. "Their <hi>Throat</hi> is an open Sepulchre, with their <hi>Tongues</hi> they have uſed Deceit, the Poiſon of Aſps is under their <hi>Lips:</hi> whoſe <hi>Mouth</hi> is full of curſing and bitterneſs: their <hi>Feet</hi> are ſwift to ſhed Blood." And not only is every Part <hi>corrupt</hi> but <hi>exceeding corrupt;</hi> being poſſeſſed with dreadful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Corruption, horribly evil Diſpoſitions and Principles of Sin, that may be repreſented by the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps; which makes Men like filthy Beaſts, like Vipers and Devils: Principles of all Uncleanneſs, Pride, Deceit, Injuſtice, Enmity, Malice, Blaſphemy, Murder, Here their Throats are compared to an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and their Mouth ſaid to be "full of curſing and bitterneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" and Deſtruction and Miſery are ſaid to be in their Ways.</p>
                     <p>AND there are not only thoſe Principles of Sin that are very bad, but every Kind; there is no Sort of Wickedneſs, but there is a Seed of it in Men. —And theſe Seeds and Principles have not only a Being in Men's Hearts, but are there in great Strength: they have the abſolute Poſſeſſion and Dominion over Men, ſo that they are ſold under Sin. Yea, wicked Principles, and thoſe only, are in the Heart. The Imagination of the Thoughts of their Heart is evil and <hi>only</hi> evil. There are bad Principles <hi>only,</hi> and no good ones. "There is no fear of God before their Eyes." Thus the Hearts of all Men are "deceitful and deſperately wicked." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>AND if we look not only at the natural Corruption of the Heart, but the contracted Habits of Sin, that Men are commonly under the Power of, by wicked Education and Cuſtoms, how full ſhall we find the World of Wickedneſs, in this Reſpect! How have Men by bad Cuſtoms in Sinning, broken down all Reſtraints upon natural Corruption, and as it were abandon'd themſelves to Wickedneſs!

                     <p>THOSE four great heathen Monarchies that roſe in the World before Chriſt, <note n="†" place="bottom">the Babilonian, Perſian, Grecian &amp; Roman Monarchies.</note> are ſpoken of in Scripture as Kingdoms ſet up in oppoſition to the Kingdom of Chriſt.

The Trouble and Diſtreſs the Church has undergone, under thoſe cruel Perſecutions that have often been and have been long continued, are ſuch as we cannot have a full Conception of, who have always enjoyed ſuch Liberty and Peace.</p>
                     <p>BUT the height to which the Evil of Affliction has riſen, no where appears ſo much, as in the Afflictions that Chriſt ſuffered. The evil of Affliction &amp; Sorrow exalted itſelf ſo high, as to ſeize the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to handle him after ſuch a Manner, as to cauſe him to be all in a bloody Sweat, and made his Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful even unto Death; and cauſed him to cry out, "My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me?"

The Work of Redemption is the moſt glorious of all the Works of God that are made known to us. The Glory of God does moſt remarkably ſhine forth in it.

                     <p>SATAN has ever had a peculiar Enmity againſt the Son of God.

However that was, yet it is certain that his Strife has ever been eſpecially againſt the Son of God. The Enmity has always been between the Seed of the Woman, and the Serpent.

And how exceedingly has the Devil exalted himſelf againſt Chriſt! How did he oppoſe him as he dwelt among the Jews, in his Tabernacle and Temple! And how did he oppoſe him when on Earth! And how has he oppoſed him ſince his Aſcenſion! What great and mighty Works has Satan brought to paſs in the World; how many Babels has he built up to Heaven, in his oppoſition to the Son of God! How exceeding proud and haughty has he appeared in his Oppoſition! How has he and his Inſtruments, and that Sin and Affliction and Death that he is the Father of, raged againſt Chriſt! But yet Chriſt in the Work of Redemption appears infinitely above them all.

                     <p>THE Glory of Chriſt in this glorious Exaltation over ſo great Evil, that has ſo exalted it's ſelf againſt him, does the more remarkably appear, in that he is thus exalted out of ſo low a State. Tho' he appeared in the World, as it were a little Child; yet how does this Child of God triumph over the moſt gigantick Enemies of God and Men! He who was "a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief," is a Man of War, and triumphed over his Enemies in all their Power. He who was meek and lowly of Heart, has triumphed over thoſe <hi>proud</hi> Foes. And he is exalted over them all, in that which appears moſt deſpicable, even his CROSS.</p>

                     </gap>n Occaſion of the Temptation that his Miſtreſs laid before him to commit <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> with her.</p>
                  <p>WE read in the beginning of the Chapter, how <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> after he had been ſo cruelly treated by his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſold into Egypt for a Slave, was advanced in the Houſe of <hi>Potiphar,</hi> who had bought him. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was one that feared GOD, and therefore GOD was with him; and wonderfully ordered Things for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009961_0138_0F7B3DFC3837C8E0"/>
him, and ſo influenced the Heart of <hi>Potiphar</hi> his Maſter, that inſtead of keeping him as a meer Slave, to which Purpoſe he was ſold, he made him his Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Overſeer over his Houſe, and all that he had was put into his Hands: in ſo much, that we are told, ℣. 6. <hi>that he left all that he had in his Hand; and that he knew not ought that he had, ſave the Bread which he did eat.</hi>— While <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in theſe proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Circumſtances, he met with a <hi>great</hi> Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Maſter's Houſe: ſo we are told, that he being a <hi>goodly Perſon, and well favoured,</hi> his Miſtreſs caſt her Eyes upon and luſted after him, and uſed all her Art to tempt him to commit <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> with her.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this Temptation, and his Behaviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, many Things are worthy to be noted.</p>
                  <p>WE may obſerve, how great the Temptation was, that he was under. It is to be conſidered, <hi>Joſeph</hi> was now in his <hi>Youth:</hi> a Seaſon of Life, when Perſons are moſt liable to be overcome by Temptations of this Nature. And he was in a State of unexpected Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity in <hi>Potiphar's</hi> Houſe; which has a tendency to lift Perſons up, eſpecially young Ones, whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they more eaſily fall before Temptations.</p>
                  <p>AND then, the <hi>Superiority</hi> of the Perſon that laid the Temptation before him, render'd it <hi>much</hi> the greater. She was his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and he a <hi>Servant under her.</hi> And the <hi>Manner</hi> of her tempting him. She did not only carry her ſelf ſo to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as gave him Cauſe to ſuſpect that he might be admitted to ſuch cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Converſe with her, that yet might be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſome Apprehenſion, that poſſibly he might be miſtaken, and ſo deter him from adventuring on ſuch a Propoſal; but ſhe directly propos'd it to him; plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſting her Diſpoſition to <hi>it.</hi> So that here was no ſuch Thing as a Suſpicion of her unwillingneſs to deter him, but a Manifeſtation of her deſire to entice him to <hi>it.</hi> Yea, ſhe appear'd <hi>greatly engag'd</hi> in the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009961_0139_0F7B3DFE205BEF80"/>
Matter. And there was not only her Deſire manifeſted to entice him, but her <hi>Authority</hi> over him to enforce the Temptation. She was his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> and he might well imagine, that if he utterly refus'd a Compliance, he ſhould incur her Diſpleaſure: and ſhe, being his <hi>Maſter's</hi> Wife, had Power to do much to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to render his Circumſtances more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable in the Family.</p>
                  <p>AND the Temptation was the greater, in that ſhe did not only tempt him once, but frequently, <hi>Day by Day,</hi> ℣. 10. And at laſt became more violent with him. — She caught him by his Garment, ſaying, <hi>Lie with me:</hi> as in the Ver. of the Text.</p>
                  <p>HIS Behaviour was very remarkable under theſe Temptations. He abſolutely refuſed any Compliance with them: he made no Reply that manifeſted as tho' the Temptation had gained at all upon him; ſo much as to heſitate about it, or at all to deliberate upon it. He complied in no Degree, either to the groſs Act, ſhe propoſed, or any thing tending towards it, or that ſhould in a leſſer Degree be gratifying to her wicked Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And he perſiſted <hi>reſolute</hi> and <hi>unſhaken</hi> under her continual Sollicitations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ℣. 10. <hi>And it came to paſs as ſhe ſpake to Joſeph Day by Day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</hi> He to his utmoſt avoided ſo much as being where ſhe was. And the Motives and Principles, from which he acted, manifeſted by his Reply to her Sollicitations, are remarkable.</p>
                  <p>HE firſt ſets before her, how injuriouſly he ſhould act againſt his Maſter, if he ſhould comply with her Propoſal: <hi>Behold my Maſter — hath committed all that he hath to my Hand; there is none greater in this Houſe than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me, but thee, becauſe thou art his Wife.</hi> But h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> then proceeded to inform her of that, which above all things, deter'd him from a Compliance, viz.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009961_0140_0F7B3DFE96DDA728"/>
that it would be great Wickedneſs, and Sin againſt GOD.—<hi>How ſhall I do this, and ſin againſt GOD!</hi> He would not do any ſuch thing, as he would not injure his Maſter; but that which influenced more than <hi>all</hi> on this Occaſion, was the fear of ſinning againſt GOD. On this Account he perſiſted in his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the laſt.</p>
                  <p>IN the Text we have an Account of his Behaviour under the laſt and greateſt Temptation that he had from her. This Temptation was great, as we are told it was at a Time when there was no Body in the Houſe, but he and his Miſtreſs, ℣. 11. there was an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to commit the Fact with the greateſt ſecrecy. And at this Time it ſeems that ſhe was more violent than ever before. She caught him by the Garment &amp;c. She laid hold on him, as tho' ſhe were reſolute to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her Purpoſe of him.</p>
                  <p>UNDER theſe Circumſtances he not only refuſed her, but fled from her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he would have done from one that was going to aſſaſſinate, or murder him; he eſcap'd, as for his Life. He not only would not be guilty of ſuch a Fact, but neither would he by any Means be in the Houſe with her, where he ſhould be in the Way of her Temptation.</p>
                  <p>THIS Behaviour of <hi>Joſeph</hi> is doubtleſs recorded for the Inſtruction of all. Therefore from the Words I ſhall obſerve this</p>
                  <div type="doctrine">
                     <head>DOCTRINE. IT is our Duty, not only to avoid thoſe Things that are themſelves ſinful; but alſo, as far as may be, thoſe Things that lead and expoſe to Sin.</head>
                     <p>THUS did <hi>Joſeph:</hi> He not only refuſed actually to commit <hi>Uncleanneſs</hi> with his Miſtreſs, who enticed him; but refuſed to be <hi>there,</hi> where he ſhould be in the Way of Temptation, ℣. 10. He refuſed to lie by
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009961_0141_0F7B3DFF38A82298"/>
her, or be <hi>with</hi> her. And in the Text we are told, <hi>He fled, and got him out;</hi> would by no Means be in her Company. Tho' it was no Sin, in it ſelf, for <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be in the Houſe where his Miſtreſs was; but under theſe Circumſtances it would expoſe him to Sin. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſenſible he had <hi>naturally</hi> a corrupt Heart, that tended to betray him to Sin; and therefore he would by no Means be in the <hi>Way</hi> of Temptation; but with haſte he fled, he run from the dangerous Place. In as much as he was expos'd to <hi>Sin</hi> in that Houſe where he was, he fled out of it with as much haſte as if the Houſe had been <hi>all of a light Fire;</hi> or full of Enemies, who ſtood ready with drawn Swords, to <hi>ſtab</hi> him to the very Heart. When ſhe took him by the <hi>Garment,</hi> he <hi>left</hi> his Garment in her Hands: he had rather <hi>loſe</hi> his Garment, than ſtay a Moment there, <hi>where</hi> he was in ſuch Danger of <hi>loſing</hi> his CHASTITY.</p>
                     <p>I ſay in the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that Perſons ſhould avoid things that expoſe to <hi>Sin, as far as may be,</hi> becauſe the Caſe may be ſo, that Perſons may be called to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to Temptation; and when it is ſo, they may hope for <hi>divine</hi> Strength and Protection under Temptation.</p>
                     <p>THE Caſe may be ſo, that it may be a Man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Duty to undertake an Office, or Piece of Work, that is attended with a great deal of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus, altho' ordinarily a Man ought not to run into that Temptation, of being expoſed to Perſecution for the true Religion; leſt the Temptation ſhould be too hard for him; but ſhould avoid it, as much as <hi>may be;</hi> (Therefore CHRIST thus directs his Diſciples, Mat. x. 23. <hi>When ye be perſecuted in one City, flee to another.</hi>) Yet, the Caſe may be ſo, that a Man may be called not to flee from Perſecution; but to run the venture of ſuch a trial, truſting in GOD to uphold him under it. Miniſters and Magiſtrates may be obliged to continue with their People in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009961_0142_0F7B3E00025A2470"/>
as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſays, Neh. vi. 11.—<hi>Should ſuch a Man as I flee?</hi> So the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>—</p>
                     <p>Yea they may be called to go into the midſt of it; to thoſe Places, where they can't reaſonably expect but to meet with ſuch Temptations. So ſometimes the Apoſtles did. <hi>Paul</hi> went up to Jeruſalem, when he knew before hand, that <hi>there, Bonds and Afflictions awaited him,</hi> Acts xx. 23.</p>
                     <p>SO in ſome other Caſes, the Neceſſity of Affairs may call upon Men to engage in ſome Buſineſs that is peculiarly attended with Temptations. But when it is ſo, Men are indeed in this Way, leaſt expos'd to <hi>Sin;</hi> for they are always ſafeſt in the Way of Duty. Prov. x. 9. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely.</hi> And the' there be many Things by which they may have extraordinary Temptations, in the Affairs they have undertaken, yet if they have a clear Call to it, it is no Preſumption to hope for divine Support and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in it.</p>
                     <p>BUT for Perſons needleſly to expoſe themſelves to Temptation, and to do thoſe Things that tend to Sin, is unwarrantable; and contrary to that excellent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, we have ſet before us in the Text. And that we ought to avoid not only thoſe Things that are in themſelves ſinful, but alſo thoſe Things that lead and expoſe to <hi>Sin,</hi> is manifeſt by the following Arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. <hi>IT is a Thing very evident and manifeſt, that we ought to uſe our utmoſt Endeavours to avoid Sin: which is inconſiſtent with needleſly doing thoſe Things, that expoſe and lead to Sin.</hi> That we ought to do our utmoſt to avoid Sin is manifeſt, that being the greateſt <hi>Evil:</hi> And the greater any Evil is, the greater Care, and the more earneſt Endeavours does it require to avoid it. This is plain, and what we by our practice ſhew that we are all ſenſible of the truth of. Thoſe Things that appear to us very great and dreadful Evils, do we uſe proportionably great Care to avoid.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009961_0143_0F7B3E00F66E43E0"/>
And therefore the greateſt Evil of all, requires the greateſt and utmoſt Care to avoid it.</p>
                     <p>SIN is an infinite Evil, becauſe committed againſt an infinitely great and excellent BEING, and ſo a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of infinite Obligation: Therefore however great our Care be to avoid <hi>Sin,</hi> it cannot be more than proportionable to the Evil we would avoid. Our care and endeavour cannot be infinite, as the Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> is infinite; but yet it ought to be to the utmoſt of our Power; we ought to uſe every Method that tends to tho avoiding of Sin. This is manifeſt to Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>AND not only ſo, but this is poſitively required of us in the Word of GOD. Joſh. xxii. 5. <hi>Take dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent heed to do the Commandment and the Law, which</hi> Moſes <hi>the Servant of the LORD charged you, to love the Lord your GOD, and to walk in all his Ways, and to keep his Commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to ſerve him with all your Soul.</hi> Deut. iv. 15, 16. <hi>Take ye therefore g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>od heed unto your ſelves, leſt ye corrupt your ſelves.</hi> Chap. xii. 30. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf, that thou be not ſnared, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. xi. 36. <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs.</hi> 1 Cor. x. 12. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> Deut. iv. 9. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf, keep thy Soul diligently.</hi> Theſe and many other Texts of Scripture, plainly require of us, the utmoſt poſſible Diligence and Caution to avoid <hi>Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT how can he be ſaid to uſe the utmoſt poſſible diligence and caution to avoid <hi>Sin,</hi> that voluntarily does thoſe Things, that naturally expoſe and lead to <hi>Sin?</hi> How can he be ſaid with the utmoſt poſſible Caution to avoid an <hi>Enemy,</hi> that voluntarily lays himſelf in his way? How can he be ſaid to uſe the utmoſt poſſible Caution to preſerve the Life of his Child, that ſuffers it to go on the Edge of <hi>Precipices</hi> or <hi>Pits;</hi> or to play on the Borders of a deep <hi>Gulph;</hi> or to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a Wood, that is haunted by Beaſts of Prey?</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:009961_0144_0F7B3E0178131E28"/>II. <hi>IT is evident that we ought to avoid thoſe Things that expoſe and lead to Sin; becauſe a due Senſe of the Evil of Sin, and a juſt hatred of it, will neceſſarily have this Effect upon us, to cauſe us ſo to do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF we were duly ſenſible of the Evil and dreadful Nature of <hi>Sin,</hi> we ſhould have an exceeding dread of it upon our Spirits. We ſhould hate it worſe than <hi>Death,</hi> and ſhould fear it worſe than the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and dread it even as we dread <hi>Damnation.</hi> But thoſe Things that Men have an exceeding dread of upon their Spirits, they naturally and neceſſarily keep at a great diſtance from; and avoid thoſe Things that they apprehend expoſe to them. As a Child that has been greatly terrifyed by the ſight of any wild Beaſt; will by no Means be perſwaded to go any where, where it apprehends that it ſhall be expoſed to it, or fall in it's Way.</p>
                     <p>SIN in it's own Nature is infinitely hateful, ſo in it's natural tendency, it is infinitely dreadful. It is the tendency of all Sin, eternally to undo the Soul. Every Sin naturally carries <hi>Hell</hi> in it! Therefore, <hi>all Sin</hi> ought to be treated by us, as we would treat a Thing that is infinitely <hi>terrible.</hi> If it be not ſo that any <hi>one</hi> Sin, yea the <hi>leaſt Sin,</hi> don't neceſſarily bring eternal Ruin with it; it is owing to nothing but the free Grace and Mercy of GOD to us, and not to the Nature and Tendency of <hi>Sin</hi> it ſelf. But certainly, we ought not to take the leſs care to avoid <hi>Sin,</hi> or all that tends to it, for the freeneſs and greatneſs of God's Mercy to us, through which, there is hope of Pardon; for that would be a moſt ungrateful and vile abuſe of Mercy indeed. If it were ſo, that it were made known to us, that if we ever voluntarily committed any particular Act of <hi>Sin</hi> we ſhould be damned without any Remedy or Eſcape, ſhould we not exceedingly dread the commiſſion of ſuch Sins? Should we not be very watchful and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009961_0145_0F7B3E035E0564F0"/>
careful to ſtand at the greateſt Diſtance from that Sin: and from every thing that might expoſe us to <hi>it;</hi> and that has any tendency to ſtir up our Luſts, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray us to ſuch an Act of Sin? Let us then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if it be not ſo, that the next voluntary Act of known <hi>Sin,</hi> ſhall not neceſſarily and unavoidably iſſue in certain <hi>Damnation;</hi> yet it will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: We ſhall thereby really deſerve to be caſt off, without any Remedy or Hope: and it can only be owing to free Grace, that it will not certainly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſly be followed with ſuch a Puniſhment. And ſhall we be guilty of ſuch a vile Abuſe of GOD's Mercy to us, as to take Encouragement from it, the more boldly to expoſe our ſelves to <hi>Sin?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>IT is evident that we ought not only to avoid Sin but Things that expoſe and lead to Sin; becauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>MEN do not only avoid thoſe Things that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the hurt and ruin of their temporal Intereſt, but alſo the Things that tend or expoſe to it. Becauſe they love their temporal Lives, they will not only actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally avoid killing themſelves, but they are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid thoſe Things that bring their Lives into Danger; tho' they do not certainly know but they may eſcape. They are careful not to paſs Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and deep Waters on rotten Ice, tho' they do not certainly know that they ſhall fall thro' and drown: So they will not only avoid thoſe Things that would be in themſelves the ruin of their Eſtates; ſuch as the ſetting their own Houſes on Fire, and burning them up with their Subſtance; their taking their Money, and throwing it into the <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp;c. but they carefully avoid thoſe Things by which their Eſtates are expoſed. They are watchful, and have their Eyes about them; are careful who they deal with: they are watchful,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009961_0146_0F7B3E03F069AD40"/>
that they be not over reached in their Bargains; that they do not lay themſelves open to Knaves and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent Perſons.</p>
                     <p>IF a Man be ſick of a dangerous Diſtemper, he is careful to avoid every thing that tends to increaſe the Diſorder; not only what he knows to be mortal in his Situation, but other Things that he fears the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of, or that may be prejudicial to him. Men are in this Way wont to take care of their temporal Intereſt, as what they have a great Regard for. And therefore if we are not as careful to avoid <hi>Sin,</hi> as we are to avoid Injury in our temporal Intereſt, it will ſhew a regardleſs Diſpoſition with Reſpect to Sin and Duty; or that we do not much care tho' we do ſin againſt GOD. God's Glory is ſurely a Thing of as much Importance and Concern as our temporal Intereſt. Certainly we ſhould be as careful not to be expoſed to ſin againſt the MAJESTY of Heaven and Earth, as Men are wont to be of a few Pounds; yea, the latter are but meer Trifles, compared with the <hi>former.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>WE are wont to do thus by our dear earthly Friends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE not only are careful of thoſe Things wherein the Deſtruction of their Lives, or their Hurt and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity in any Reſpect do directly conſiſt; but are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid thoſe Things that do but remotely tend to it. We are careful to prevent and cut off all Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Loſs or Damage, in any Reſpect; and are watchful againſt that, which tends in any wiſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their Comfort or good Name; and the Reaſon is, becauſe they are very dear to us. In this Manner, Men are wont to be careful of the good of their own Children, and dread the Approaches of any Miſchief that they apprehend they are, or may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to. And we ſhould take it hard if our Friends did not do thus by us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="unknown:009961_0147_0F7B3E0488303CB8"/>AND ſurely we ought to treat GOD as a dear FRIEND: We ought to act towards Him, as thoſe that have a ſincere Love and unfeigned Regard to Him; and ſo ought to watch and be careful againſt all Occaſions of that which is contrary to his Honor &amp; Glory. If we have not a Temper and Deſire ſo to do, it will ſhew that whatever our Pretences are, we are not God's ſincere Friends, and have no true love to Him.</p>
                     <p>IF we ſhould be offended at any that have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Friendſhip to us, if they treated us in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and were no more careful of our Intereſt; ſurely GOD may juſtly be offended, that we are no more careful of his Glory.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>WE would have GOD in his Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, not order thoſe Things that tend to our hurt, or expoſe our Intereſt: therefore certainly we ought to avoid thoſe Things that lead to ſin againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WE deſire and love to have God's Providence ſuch toward us, as that our Welfare may be well ſecured. No Man loves to live in expoſed, uncertain and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Circumſtances. While he is ſo, he lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortably, in that he lives in continual fear. We deſire that GOD would ſo order Things concerning us, that we may be ſafe from <hi>fear</hi> of Evil: and that no Evil may come nigh our Dwelling; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we dread Calamity. So we do not love the Appearance and Approaches of it; and love to have it at a <hi>great</hi> Diſtance from us. We deſire to have GOD to be to us as a <hi>Wall of Fire round about us,</hi> to defend us; and that he would ſurround us, as the Mountains do the Vallies, to guard us from every Danger, or Enemy; that ſo no Evil may come nigh us.</p>
                     <p>NOW this plainly ſhews, that we ought in our Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour towards GOD, to keep at a great Diſtance from

                        <hi>Sin,</hi> and from <hi>all</hi> that expoſes to it; as we deſire GOD in his Providence to us, ſhould keep Calamity and Miſery at a great Diſtance from us, and not order thoſe Things that expoſe our Welfare.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>Seeing we a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>THIS is one Requeſt that Chriſt directs us to make to GOD in that Form of Prayer, which he taught <hi>his</hi> Diſciples — <hi>Lead us not into Temptation.</hi> And how inconſiſtent ſhall we be with our ſelves, if we pray to GOD, not to order it ſo in his Providence, that we ſhould be led into Temptations; and yet at the ſame Time, we are not careful to avoid Temptation; but bring our ſelves into it, by doing thoſe Things that lead and expoſe to Sin. What Self-Contradiction is there in it, for a Man to pray to GOD that he may be kept from that, which he takes no care to avoid? By praying that we may be kept from Temptation, we profeſs to GOD, that being in Temptation, is a Thing that is to be avoided; but by running into it, ſhew that we chuſe the contrary, viz. <hi>not</hi> to avoid it.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>The Apoſtle directs us to avoid thoſe Things that are in themſelves lawful, but tend to lead others into Sin; ſurely then we ſhould avoid what tends to lead our ſelves into Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Apoſtle directs to this, 1 Cor. viii. 9.— <hi>Take heed leſt—this Liberty of your's become a ſtumbling-block to them that are weak.</hi> Rom. xiv. 13. —<hi>That no Man put a ſtumbling Block, or an Occaſion to fall in his Brother's Way.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walkeſt thou not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably. Deſtroy not him with thy Meat.</hi>—Ver. 20.21. <hi>For Meat deſtroy not the Work of GOD. All Things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that Man
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009961_0149_0F7B3E0626AAB268"/>
who eateth with Offence. It is good neither to eat Fleſh, nor to drink Wine, nor any Thing whereby thy Brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>NOW if this Rule of the Apoſtle be agreeable to the Word of CHRIST, as we muſt ſuppoſe, or expunge what he ſays out of the Canon of the Scripture; then a like Rule obliges more ſtrongly in thoſe Things that tend to lead our ſelves into Sin.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>THERE are many Precepts of Scripture, that do directly and poſitively imply, that we ought to avoid thoſe Things that tend to Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THIS very Thing is commanded by CHRIST, Mat. xxvi. 41. where he directs us to <hi>watch</hi> leſt we enter <hi>into Temptation.</hi> But certainly running our ſelves into Temptation, is the reverſe of watching againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Again, We are commanded to abſtain from all Appearance of Evil; i. e. do by <hi>Sin,</hi> as a Man does by a Thing he hates the Sight or Appearance of; and therefore will avoid any Thing that favors of it, or looks like it; and will not come near it, or in Sight of it.</p>
                     <p>Again, CHRIST commanded to ſeperate from us, thoſe Things that are ſtumbling Blocks, or Occaſions of Sin, however dear they are to us. Matth. v. 29. <hi>If thy right Eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee.</hi> Ver. 30. <hi>And if thy right Hand offend thee, cut it off</hi>— By <hi>the right Hand offending us,</hi> is not meant it's paining us; but the Word in the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi> ſignifies, being a ſtumbling Block; if thy right Hand prove a ſtumbling Block, or occaſion to fall; i. e. an Occaſion to Sin. Thoſe Things are called Offences or ſtumbling Blocks in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that are the Occaſions of falling into Sin. We ought to avoid running up againſt ſtumbling Blocks; i. e. we ſhould avoid thoſe Things that expoſe us to fall into Sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009961_0150_0F7B3E0745B68E10"/>Yea CHRIST tells us, we muſt avoid them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dear they are to us, tho' as dear as our right Hand or right Eye. If there be any Practice that we have been accuſtomed to, that naturally tends and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes us to Sin, we muſt have done with it; tho' we love it never ſo well; and are never ſo loth to part with it; tho' it be as contrary to our Notion, as to cut off our right Hand, or pluck out our own right Eye; and that upon pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> for it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that if we do not, we muſt go with two Hands and two Eyes into <hi>Hell-Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AND again: GOD took great Care to forbid the Children of Iſrael thoſe Things that tended to lead them into Sin. For this Reaſon, he forbid them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <hi>ſtrange Wives,</hi> (Deut. vii. 3, 4.) <hi>neither ſhalt thou make Marriages with them,— for they will turn away thy Son from following me, that they may ſerve other Gods.</hi> For this Reaſon they were commanded to deſtroy all thoſe Things, that the Nations of Canaan had uſed in their Idolatry; and if any were enticed over to <hi>Idolatry,</hi> they were to be deſtroyed without Mercy; tho' ever ſo near and dear Friends. They were not only to be parted with, but <hi>ſtoned with Stones;</hi> yea they themſelves were to fall upon them, and put them to Death, tho' Son or Daughter, or their <hi>Boſom</hi> Friend. (Deut. xiii. 6. &amp;c.) <hi>If thy Brother—or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend, which is as thine own Soul, entice thee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, ſaying, let us go and ſerve other Gods — thou ſhalt not conſent unto him — neither ſhall thine Eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him. But thou ſhalt ſurely kill him; thine Hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, THE wiſe Man warns us to avoid thoſe Things that tend and expoſe us to <hi>Sin;</hi> eſpecially the Sin of Uncleanneſs. Prov. vi. 27. <hi>Can a Man take Fire in his Boſom, and his Clothes not be burnt? Can
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009961_0151_0F7B3E07A480CD88"/>
one go upon hot Coals, and his Feet not be burnt?— So—whoſoever touches her, ſhall not be innocent.</hi> This is the Truth held forth; avoid thoſe Cuſtoms and Practices, that naturally tend to ſtir up Luſt. And there are many Examples in Scripture, which have the force of Precept; and recorded, as not only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, but demand our Imitation. The Conduct of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in the Text is one; and that recorded of KING DAVID, is another. Pſal. xxxix. 1, 2. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my Ways, that I ſin not with my Tongue: I will keep my Mouth with a Bridle, while the Wicked is before me. I was dumb with Silence, I held my Peace, even from good</hi>—even from good— that is, he was ſo watchful over his Words, and kept at ſuch a great Diſtance from ſpeaking what might in any Way tend to Sin; that he avoided, in certain Circumſtances, ſpeaking what was in it ſelf lawful; leſt he ſhould be betrayed into that which was ſinful.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. <hi>A prudent Senſe of our own weakneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs to yield to Temptation, obliges us to avoid that which leads or expoſes to Sin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>WHOEVER knows himſelf and is ſenſible how weak he is; and his conſtant expoſedneſs to run into Sin; how full of Corruption his Heart is, which like Fuel, is expoſed to catch Fire, and bring Deſtruction upon him; how much he has in him to incline him to Sin; and how unable he is to ſtand of himſelf; who is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, and has any Regard of his Duty, but will be very watchful againſt every thing that may lead and expoſe to <hi>Sin?</hi> On this Account Chriſt directed us, (Mat. xxvi. 41.) <hi>to watch and pray leſt we enter into Temptation.</hi> The Reaſon there is added, <hi>The Fleſh is weak!</hi> He that in Confidence of his own Strength, boldly runs the venture of ſinning by going into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, manifeſts great Preſumption, and a ſottiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009961_0152_0F7B3E08384BA6D0"/>
of his own Weakneſs. <hi>He that truſteth in his own Heart is a Fool,</hi> Prov. xxviii. 26.</p>
                     <p>THE wiſeſt and ſtrongeſt, and ſome of the moſt holy Men in the World, have been overthrown by ſuch Means. So was <hi>David:</hi> So was <hi>Solomon.</hi>— His Wives turned away his Heart. If ſuch Perſons, ſo eminent for Holineſs, were this Way led into Sin, ſurely it ſhould be a warning to us. <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi>

this would be enough with <hi>all</hi> Chriſtians. Will a Follower of CHRIST ſtand objecting and diſputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Thing, that is irrefragably proved and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be his Duty?</p>
                     <p>BUT here ſome may be ready to inquire: How ſhall we know what Things do lead and expoſe to Sin? Let a Man do what he will, he cannot avoid ſinning, as long as he has ſuch a corrupt Heart within him. And there is nothing a Man can do, or turn his Hand to, but that he may find ſome Temptation in it. And tho' it be true, as it is ſaid in the firſt Doctrine, that a Man ought, as far as may be, to avoid thoſe Things that lead and expoſe to Sin. And it is evident by the Arguments that have been brought, that thoſe Things that have ſpecial tendency to expoſe Men to Sin, are what we ought to ſhun, as much as in us lies: yet <hi>how</hi> ſhall we judge and determine, what Things they are, that have a natural tendency to Sin; or do eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially lead to it?</p>
                     <p>I would anſwer in ſome Particulars, which are plain and eaſy; and which cannot be deny'd without the greateſt Abſurdity.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>That which is bordering on thoſe Sins, that the Luſts of Men's Hearts ſtrongly incline them to, is of this Sort.</hi> Men come into the World with many ſtrong and violent Luſts in their Hearts, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding prone of themſelves to <hi>tranſgreſs;</hi> even in the ſafeſt Circumſtances they can be placed in. And ſurely ſo much the nearer they are to that <hi>Sin,</hi> which they are naturally ſtrongly inclined to; ſo much the more are they expoſed. If any of us that are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſhould ſee our Children near the Brink of ſome deep Pit; or cloſe by the edge of the Precipice of an high Mountain; and not only ſo, but the Ground up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Child ſtood, ſlippery, and ſleeply deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly toward he Precipice; ſhould we not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009961_0154_0F7B3E0AD5660ED0"/>
a Child expoſed in ſuch a Caſe? Should we not be in haſte to remove the Child from it's very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Situation?</p>
                     <p>IT was the manner among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to build their Houſes with flat Roofs, ſo that Perſons might walk on the Tops of their Houſes. And therefore God took care to make it a Law among them, that every Man ſhould have Battlements upon the Edges of their Roofs; leſt any Perſon ſhould fall off and be killed. Deut. xxii. 8. <hi>When thou buildeſt a new Houſe, then thou ſhalt make a Battlement for thy Roof, that thou bring not Blood upon thine Houſe, if any Man fall from thence.</hi> And certainly we ought to take the like care that we don't fall into <hi>Sin;</hi> which carries in it eternal Death. We ſhould as it were, ſix a Battlement, a Guard to keep us from the Edge of the Precipice. Much more ought we to take care, that we don't go upon a Roof that is not only without Battlements, but when it is ſteep, and we ſhall naturally incline to fall.</p>
                     <p>MEN's Luſts are like ſtrong Enemies, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to draw them into Sin. If a Man ſtood upon a dangerous Precipice, and had Enemies about him, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and drawing him, endeavouring to throw him down; would one, in ſuch a Caſe, chuſe, or dare to ſtand near the Edge? Would he look upon himſelf ſafe cloſe on the Brink? Would he not endeavour for his own ſafety, to keep at a Diſtance?</p>

                     <p>They lead and expoſe Men to Sin. Thoſe Things that have a natural tendency to excite in the Mind, the Idea or Imagination of that which is the Object of the Luſt, certainly tend to feed and promote that Luſt. What can be more plain and evident, than that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Object, tends to ſtir up the Appetite? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Experience teach this.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="unknown:009961_0155_0F7B3E0BB8F471C0"/>THEREFORE, <hi>all Things,</hi> whether they be Words or Actions, have a tendency and expoſe to <hi>Sin,</hi> that tend to raiſe and uphold in the Mind's Imaginations or Ideas, thoſe Things which the Luſt tends to. It is certainly wrong and unlawful to feed a Luſt even in the Imagination. It is quite contrary to the holy Rules of God's Word. (Prov. xxiv. 9) <hi>The Thought of fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is Sin.</hi> (Mat. v. 28.) <hi>Whoſoever looketh on a Woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery—.</hi> A Man by gratifying his Luſts in his Imagination and Thoughts, may make his Soul in the Sight of GOD, to be a <hi>Hold of foul Spirits;</hi> and like a <hi>Cage of every unclean and hurtful Bird.</hi> And ſinful Imaginations tend to ſinful Actions and outward Behaviour in the End. Luſt is always firſt contrived in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then brought forth in the outward Practice. You may ſee the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>THEREFORE for a Man to do thoſe Things that tend to excite the Objects of his Luſts in his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he does that which has as natural a tendency to Sin, as a Conception has to a Birth. And ſuch Things are therefore abominable in the Sight of a pure and holy GOD. We are commanded to keep at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſtance from ſpiritual Pollution; and to hate even the very <hi>Garment ſpotted with the Fleſh,</hi> Jude 23.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>THOSE things that the Experience and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Mankind ſhew to be ordinarily attended or followed with Sin, are of this Sort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Experience is a good Rule to determine by in things of this Nature. How is it we know the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of any thing, but only by Obſervation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience? Men obſerve and find, time after time, that ſuch Things are commonly attended and followed with ſuch other things. And hence Mankind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce of them, that they have a natural tendency to them. We have no other Way to know the tendency
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009961_0156_0F7B3E0BF90C4368"/>
of any thing. Thus Men by Obſervation and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience know that the warmth of the Sun, and ſhowers of Rain, are attended with the growth of Plants of the Earth: and hence they learn, that they have a tendency to it. So they find by Experience, that the bite of ſome Kinds of Serpents, is commonly followed with Illneſs; and often with Death. Hence they learn, that the bite of ſuch Serpents has a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bring Diſorder upon the Body, and expoſes to Death.</p>
                     <p>AND ſo, if Experience and common Obſervation ſhews, that any particular Practice or Cuſtom is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attended with that which is very ſinful, we may ſafely conclude that ſuch a Practice tends to Sin; that it leads and expoſes to it.</p>
                     <p>THUS we may determine that Tavern-haunting and Gaming, are things that tend to Sin; becauſe common Experience and Obſervation ſhew, that thoſe Practices are attended with a great deal of Sin and Wickedneſs. The Obſervation of all Ages and all Nations, with one Voice declares it. It ſhews, where Taverns are much frequented, for drinking and the like, they are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Places of Sin, of Prophaneneſs and other Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and it ſhews, that thoſe Towns, where there is much of this, are Places where no Good generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. And it alſo ſhews, that thoſe Perſons that are given much to frequenting Taverns, are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vicious Perſons. And ſo of Gaming; as playing at Cards, Experience ſhews, that thoſe Perſons that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice this, do generally fall into much Sin. Hence theſe Practices are become infamous among all ſober vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſons.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>ANOTHER way by which Perſons may deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of ſome Things, that they lead and expoſe to Sin, is by their own Experience, or what they have found in themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="unknown:009961_0157_0F7B3E0CC2CE8568"/>IF Perſons have found in themſelves, from time to time, that they have actually led them into Sin, this ſurely is enough to convince them, that ſuch things do actually lead and expoſe to Sin: For what will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men, if their own Experience will not? Thus if Men have found by undeniable Experience, that any Practice or Cuſtom ſtirs up Luſt in them, and has betray'd them into fooliſh and ſinful Behaviour, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Thoughts; they may determine, that they lead and expoſe to Sin. Or if they upon examining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt own that ſuch a Cuſtom or Practice, has time after time, had that Effect upon them, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to Sins of Omiſſion of known Duty; ſuch as ſecret Prayer; and make them more backward to it: and alſo to indiſpoſe them to reading and religious Meditation; and they, after they have been doing ſuch or ſuch a thing, have found this has commonly been the Effect of it, that they have been more apt to caſt off Prayer; or has had a tendency to the neglect of Family Prayer. Or if it ſeems to lead to unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; they find ſince they have complied with ſuch a Cuſtom, they are leſs watchful of their Hearts, leſs diſpos'd to any thing that is ſerious; that the frame of their Mind is more light, and their Hearts leſs on the things of another World, and more after Vanity; thoſe are ſinful Effects; and therefore if Experience ſhews a Cuſtom or Practice to be attended with theſe things, then Experience ſhews that they lead and expoſe to Sin.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>WE may determine whether a thing be of an evil tendency or not, by the Effect that an out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, and a general flouriſhing of Religion, has with reſpect to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF a pouring out of the Spirit of GOD on a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, puts a ſtop to any Practice or Cuſtom, and roots
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009961_0158_0F7B3E0DAF6F8248"/>
it out; ſurely it argues, that <hi>that</hi> Practice or Cuſtom is of no good tendency. For if there be no hurt in it, and it tends to no hurt, why ſhould the Spirit of GOD de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it? The Spirit of GOD has no tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droy any thing that is neither ſinful, nor has any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſin. Why ſhould it? Why ſhould we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Spirit of GOD ſhould be an Enemy to that which has no hurt in it; nor has any tendency to that which is hurtful?</p>
                     <p>THE flouriſhing of <hi>Religion</hi> has no tendency to aboliſh or expel any thing that is no way againſt <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> That which is not againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> Religion will not appear againſt. Religion has no tendency to deſtroy any Cuſtom or Practice, that has no tendency to deſtroy that. It is a Rule that holds in all contraries and oppoſites: the Oppoſition is equal on both Sides. So contrary as Light is to Darkneſs, ſo contrary is Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light. It is equal both Ways. So, juſt ſo contrary as the flouriſhing of Religion is to any Cuſtom, juſt ſo contrary is that Cuſtom to the flouriſhing of Religion. That Cuſtom that Religion tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, that Cuſtom, if it prevail, tends alſo to deſtroy Religion. Therefore, if the flouriſhing of Religion and the out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, tends to overthrow any Cuſtom, that takes Place or prevails, we may ſurely determine, that <hi>that</hi> Cuſtom is either in it ſelf ſinful, or tends and expoſes to Evil.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>WE may determine by the Effect that a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decay of Religion has with reſpect to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be Things of a ſinful tendency or not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF they be Things that come with a <hi>decay of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that creep in as <hi>that</hi> decays, we may determine they are things of no good tendency. The withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Good, don't let in Good but Evil. 'Tis Evil, not Good, comes in, as Good gradually ceaſes. What is it but Darkneſs that comes in, as Light withdraws.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:009961_0159_0F7B3E0E381C1AF0"/>Therefore if there be any decay of Religion in the Town, or in particular Perſons, and upon this, any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Cuſtoms or Practices take Place and are allowed, which were wholly abſtained from &amp; renounced, when Religion was in a more flouriſhing State; we may ſafely conclude that ſuch Cuſtoms and Practices are contrary to the Nature of true Religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in themſelves ſinful, or tending to Sin.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>WE may in many things determine whether any Cuſtom be of a good tendency, by conſidering what the Effect would be, if it was openly and univerſally owned and practiced.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THERE are many things that ſome Perſons practice ſomewhat ſecretly, and are partly hidden in; and that they plead to be not hurtful; which, if they had ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Conſideration to diſcern what the Conſequence would be, if every Body openly practiced the ſame, it would ſoon ſhew that the Conſequence would be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and a moſt woful State of things. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be any Cuſtom, that is of ſuch a Nature, that it will not bear univerſal open Practice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; but if it ſhould come to <hi>that,</hi> the leaſt Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will ſhew that the Conſequence would be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable; we may determine that <hi>that</hi> Cuſtom is of an ill tendency. For if there is no hurt in it, and it is neither ſinful in it ſelf, nor tends to any thing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then it is no matter how open and univerſal the World is in it; for we need not be afraid of that Cuſtom's being too prevalent and univerſal, that has no ill tendency in it.</p>
                     <p>THUS I have mentioned ſome general Rules, by which to determine and judge, what things are of a bad and ſinful tendency. And theſe things are ſo plain, that for a Perſon to deny them, would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:009961_0160_0F7B3E1049AB2C88"/>I would now, in the Name of GOD, warn all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to avoid ſuch things, as appear by theſe Rules to lead and expoſe to Sin. And particularly, I would now take Occaſion to warn our young People, as they would approve themſelves Fearers of GOD, to avoid all ſuch things in Company, that being try'd by theſe Rules, will appear to have a tendency or lead to Sin. Avoid all ſuch Ways of talking and eating as have a tendency to this; and follow the Example of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in this.</p>
                     <p>NOT only the moſt groſs Acts of Uncleanneſs, but all Deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ees of Laciviouſneſs, both in talking and eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are ſtrictly forbidden in Scripture; as what ſhould not be ſo much as once named among Saints or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. (Gal. v. 9.) <hi>Now the Works of the Fleſh are manifeſt, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Laci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs.</hi> (Eph. v. 3, 4, 5.) <hi>But Fornication, and all Uncleanneſs, let it not be once named among you, as becometh Saints: neither filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſting, which are not convenient: — for this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean Perſon,— hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of CHRIST, and of GOD.</hi> We ſhould hate even the Garments ſpoted with the Fleſh, i. e. ſhould hate and ſhun all that in the leaſt approaches to any ſuch thing, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of it.</p>
                     <p>AND I deſire that certain Cuſtoms that are common among young People in the Country, and have been ſo a long time, may be examined by thoſe Rules that have been mentioned. That Cuſtom in particular, of young People of different Sexes lying in Bed together; however light is made of it, and however ready Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be to laugh at it's being condemned: if it be examined by the Rules that have been mentioned, it will appear, paſt all Contradiction, to be one of thoſe things that lead and expoſe to Sin: And I believe what Experience and Fact will ſhew of the Conſequence
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009961_0161_0F7B3E110947E290"/>
and Event of it, does abundantly bear Witneſs to it. And whoever wiſely conſiders the Matter, muſt ſay, that this Cuſtom of this Country (to which it ſeems to be peculiar, among People that pretend to uphold their Credit) has been one main thing that has lead to that growth of Uncleanneſs, that has been in the Land. And ſo there are other Cuſtoms and Liberties that are cuſtomarily uſed, among young People in Company, that they that uſe them know that they lead to Sin.— They know that they tend to ſtir up their Luſts — that it does do it—and this is the very End for which they do it, to gratify their Luſts in ſome Meaſure. Little do ſuch Perſons conſider, what a holy GOD they are ſoon to be judged by, that now make a <hi>mock at Sin;</hi> who abominates the Impurities of their Hearts.</p>
                     <p>IF therefore they do actually ſtir up and feed Luſt, then certainly they tend to further Degrees and more groſs Acts. That which ſtirs up Luſt, makes it more violent, and does therefore certainly the more expoſe Perſons to be overcome by it. How evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable are theſe things; and how ſtrange that any ſhould cavil againſt them, or make a Deriſion of them!</p>
                     <p>Poſſibly you may be confident of your own Strength; and may think with your ſelf, that you are not in Danger, that there is no Temptation in theſe things, but what you are able eaſily to overcome. But you ſhould conſider that the moſt ſelf-confident are moſt in danger. <hi>Peter</hi> was very confident, that he ſhould not deny CHRIST, but how dreadfully otherwiſe was the Event! If when others that have fallen into groſs Sins, ſhould be inquired of, and ſhould declare how it was with them; doubtleſs they would ſay, that they at firſt tho't there was no danger; they were far from the Thought that ever they ſhould commit ſuch Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but yet by venturing further and further, they fell at laſt into the fouleſt and groſſeſt Tranſgreſſions.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009961_0162_0F7B3E119C320098"/>
And Perſons may long withſtand Temptation, and be ſuddenly overcome at laſt. None ſo much in danger, as the moſt bold. <hi>They</hi> are moſt ſafe, that are moſt ſenſible of their own Weakneſs; and moſt diſtruſtful of their own Hearts; and moſt ſenſible of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual need of reſtraining Grace. Young Perſons, with reſpect to the Sin of Uncleanneſs, are dealt with by the Devil, juſt as ſome give an account of ſome ſort of Serpents charming of Birds, and other Animals down into their Mouths—if the Serpent takes them with his Eyes; tho' they ſeem to be affrighted by it; yet will not flee away; but will keep the Serpent in Sight, and approach nearer and nearer to him, till they fall a Prey.</p>
                     <p>ANOTHER Cuſtom that I deſire may be examined by the forementioned Rules, is that of young People of both Sexes getting together in the Nigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in thoſe Companies for Mirth and Jollity, that they call Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; ſo ſpending the time together 'till late in the Night, in their Jollity. I deſire our young People to ſuffer their Ears to be open to what I have to ſay upon this Point; as I am the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts to them; and not determine that they will not hearken, before they have heard what I ſhall ſay. I hope there are but few Perſons among us ſo abandoned, as to determine that they will go on in a Practice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are convinced that it is unlawful or not; or tho' it ſhould be proved to them to be unlawful by undeniable Arguments.</p>
                     <p>Therefore let us examine this Cuſtom and Practice by what has been ſaid. It has been proved undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that we ought not to go on in a Practice that leads and expoſes to Sin; and Rules have been laid down to judge what does thus expoſe and lead to it, that I think are plain and undeniable.</p>
                     <p>Therefore now let us try this Cuſtom by theſe Rules, and ſee whether it will bear the Teſt or not.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009961_0163_0F7B3E121465B9B8"/>
Certainly a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> will not be unwilling to have his Practices examined and tried by the Rules of Reaſon and God's Word; but will rather rejoyce in it.</p>
                     <p>AND I deſire particularly that the Practice may be tried by that ſure Touch-ſtone of Experience. Let it be tried by the Conſideration of what is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in fact abroad in one Town and Place and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is one of the Rules of Trial that have been mentioned, that <hi>that Cuſtom that the Experience and Obſervation of Mankind ſhews to be ordinarily attended or followed with Sin, may be determined and concluded to be unlawful.</hi> And if we look abroad in the Country, I doubt not but theſe two things will be found.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. THAT as to thoſe Towns, where there is moſt of this carried on among young People, (as there is more of it in ſome Places than others) it will be found, as a thing that univerſally holds, that they the young People there are commonly a looſe, vain and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Generation; little regarding GOD, Heaven or Hell, or any thing but vanity. And that commonly in thoſe Towns where is moſt frolicking carried on, there are the moſt frequent breakings out of groſs Sins; Fornication in particular.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. IF we try it by Perſons. If we go thro' the Country, we ſhall for the moſt Part find, that thoſe Perſons that are the greateſt Frolickers, and are moſt addicted to this Practice, which we are ſpeaking of; they are the Perſons furtheſt from ſerious Thought, and are the vaineſt and looſeſt upon other Accounts. And whence ſhould this be, if ſuch a Practice was not ſinful, or had not a natural tendency to lead Perſons into Sin.</p>
                     <p>AND furthermore, I appeal to the Experience of you here preſent, as to what you have found in your ſelves. I deſire thoſe of you that have made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſerious Religion, and ſaving Piety, and have
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009961_0164_0F7B3E12E8118D98"/>
hitherto pretended to keep up Religion in your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets, and your own Souls; that <hi>you</hi> would ſeriouſly aſk your ſelves whether or no you have not found, that this Practice has indiſpos'd you to ſerious Religion, and taken off your Minds from it? Has it not tended to your neglect of ſecret Prayer? Have you not found, that after you have been to a Frolick, you have been more backward to that Duty? And if you have not wholly neglected it, have you not found that you have been abundantly more ſlighty, and ready to turn it off in any Manner, and glad to have it done with? And more backward to reading and ſerious Meditation, and ſuch things? And that your Mind has been exceedingly diverted from Religion, and that for ſome time?</p>
                     <p>I don't ſend you far off to find out whether this Cuſtom be not of bad tendency —not beyond the Sea, to ſome diſtant Country: I ſend you no further than to your own Breaſt to examine your own Experience in this Matter; let the Matter be determined by that.</p>
                     <p>AND then again, let us try this Cuſtom, by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD on a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple has with Reſpect to it. This we are under great Advantage to do; becauſe there has lately been here in this Place, a moſt remarkable out-pouring of the Spirit of GOD, that ever has been in NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, and it may be in the WORLD; ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Days. And 'tis known, that before this, that Cuſtom of young People's Frolicking did prevail in the Town. And here we all know the Effect it had. It put an end to it.—It was a Cuſtom that was wholly done with—It was altogether laid aſide; and was ſo for ſeveral Years.</p>
                     <p>IT has been already ſhewn that there is no account can be given why the Spirit of GOD, and the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of Religion ſhould aboliſh ſuch a Cuſtom, unleſs
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009961_0165_0F7B3E138345A580"/>
it be becauſe that Cuſtom, is either in its Nature or Tendency an Enemy to the Spirit of GOD, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>THE Fruits of the Spirit of GOD are good, and I hope there is none that have the Blaſphemy to ſay otherwiſe. And therefore it is good that this Cuſtom ſhould be removed; for this is plainly one of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Spirit of GOD. And if ſo, 'tis becauſe the Cuſtom is bad, either in it's Nature or Tendency; otherwiſe there would be no good in its being removed. The Spirit of GOD aboliſhed this Cuſtom for this Reaſon, becauſe if it had been kept up in the Town, it would have had a direct tendency to hinder that Work that the Spirit was about to do amongſt us. This was undeniably the Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſing ſuch a Cuſtom had been begun and ſet up, by the young People all over the Town, in the midſt of the Time of the late out-pouring of the Spirit, all of a ſudden; would any wiſe Perſons, that have truly the Cauſe of Religion at Heart; rejoyced at it? Would not every one at firſt Thought have concluded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any heſitation, that it was a thing that look'd dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Intereſt of Religion; and that there was great Danger that it would take off People's Minds from Religion, and make them vain; and ſo put an end to the flouriſhing of Religion? Would not every conſiderate Perſon in this Town have thought thus of it? And if ſuch a Cuſtom would have had an ill ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency then, ſo it will now.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Objection.</hi> The Town is not in ſuch Circumſtances now, as it was then. And tho' it might have done hurt then, by putting an end to the great Concern; yet now it may do no hurt: for there is now no ſuch great Concern to be put an end to by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Tho' the Town is not in ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances now as it was then, yet it ought to be; there ought to be as much Engagedneſs of Mind about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009961_0166_0F7B3E145F94F600"/>
as much Concern among Sinners, and as much Engagedneſs among the godly, as then: and it is to our Shame that there is not. And if ſuch a Practice would have tended to deſtroy ſuch a religious Concern, then it certainly tends to prevent it now. It is a Rule that will hold, That <hi>that</hi> which has a tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Thing when it is, tends to prevent it when it is not. And are we not praying from Sabbath to Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and from Day to Day, for ſuch a Concern again? And do not thoſe of you that pretend to be converted, that have lately ſet up this Cuſtom, pray for the ſame? Are you a Convert, a Saint, and yet not deſire that there ſhould be any more pouring out of the Spirit of GOD? The Town has Cauſe to be aſhamed of ſuch Converts, if it has any ſuch? And if you do, why do you do what tends to prevent it?</p>
                     <p>Again, LET this Practice be tried by the Effect that a general Decay of Religion has with reſpect to it. Now we have a trial: it is now a Time that Religion is greatly decay'd amongſt us; and the Effect is, that this Cuſtom comes in with this Decay. Young People begin again to ſet up their old Cuſtom of Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licking, and ſpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing great Part of the Night in it, to the violation of Family Orders. What is the Reaſon, if this Cuſtom is not bad, either in its Nature or Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, that it did not come in before, when Religion was lively? Why does it ſtay 'till it can take the Advantage of the withdrawment of Religion? This is a ſign that it is a Cuſtom that ſhuns a Spirit of lively Religion, as Darkneſs ſhuns the Light, and never comes in 'till Light withdraws.</p>
                     <p>AND here again, I would ſend Perſons to their own Experience. How did this Practice come in with you in particular: <hi>you,</hi> that two or three Years ago, ſeem'd to be ſo engag'd in Religion? Did it not come in, did you not begin to practice it, as the ſenſe of Religion wore off? And what is the matter? Why did not
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009961_0167_0F7B3E1505B6B138"/>
you ſet up the Practice <hi>then,</hi> when your Heart was taken up about reading, Meditation, and ſecret Prayer to GOD? If <hi>this</hi> do not at all ſtand in the Way of them, and is no hindrance to them, why was you not engaged in both together? What account can you give of it? Why did you leave off this Practice and Cuſtom, or abſtain from it? To what Purpoſe is this changing? One while it muſt be avoided as evil, and another while practiced and pleaded for as good? The making ſuch an alteration does not look well, nor will it be for the honor of Religion in the Eye of the World. For whether the Practice be lawful or no, yet ſuch a thing will ſurely be improved to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. For your avoiding of it <hi>then,</hi> has this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in the Eye of the Country; that <hi>then</hi> you condemned it: and therefore your now returning to it, will appear to them as backſliding in you. Such Changelings are ever more, in the Eye of the World, greatly to the diſhonour of the Profeſſion they are of, let it be what it will.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, this Cuſtom as it is practiſed, does not only tend to <hi>Sin,</hi> but is in it ſelf very diſorderly, ſinful and ſhameful. For it is attended late in the Night, and in the dead of the Night, to the neglect of Family Prayer, and violating all family Order; which is Diſorder and Profaneneſs. Is that lawful to rob GOD of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sacrifices, for the ſake of your Pleaſure, Diverſion, and Jollity? Are you of that Mind, that it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent thing, that the ſtated Worſhip of the great GOD, ſhould give Way to your Mirth, and your Diverſions? Is this the Way of GOD's holy Children, to talk after this Manner? Thoſe Works that are commonly done in the dead of the Night, ſeem to have a black Mark ſet upon them, by the Apoſtle, and Chriſtians are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to avoid them, Rom. xiii. 12, 13.—<hi>Let us caſt off the Works of Darkneſs, and let us put on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Light. Let us walk honeſtly, as in the Day;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009961_0168_0F7B3E162003F028"/>
not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs; not in Chambering and Wantonneſs</hi> —. The Word here rendered, <hi>rioting</hi> is of far different Signification from the term, as uſed in our Laws: for the forcible doing an unlawful Thing, by three or more Perſons aſſembled together for that Purpoſe. Words as they are terms in the Law, are often uſed very much beſide their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Signification. But the Word here properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, a diſorderly Convention of Perſons to ſpend their time together in Pleaſure and Jollity. So the Word is commonly uſed in Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Prov. xxiii. 20.) <hi>Be not amongſt riotous eaters of Fleſh.</hi> (Prov. xxviii. 7.) — <hi>He that is a Companion of riotous Men, ſhameth his Father.</hi> (Luk xv. 13.)—<hi>waſted his Subſtance with riotous living.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, a black Mark ſeems to be ſet on ſuch in Scripture, (as in 1 Theſſ. v. 5.6, 7, 8.) <hi>Ye are all Children of the Light, and the Children of the Day: we are not of the Night, nor of Darkneſs. Therefore let us not ſleep as do others; but let us watch and be ſober. For they that ſleep, ſleep in the Night; and they that be drunk, are drunken in the Night.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MANY of you that have lately ſet up this Practice of frolicking and jollity, profeſs to be Children of the Light and of the Day; and not to be the Children of Darkneſs. Therefore walk as in the Day: and do not thoſe Works of Darkneſs, that are commonly done at unſeaſonable Hours of the Night.</p>
                     <p>Such things are not only condemned by the Apoſtle, but are looked upon infamous thro' the World in all Ages among ſoberer ſort of People; and all paſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings ſhew it. Therefore it is a thing of bad Report, and ſo forbidden (Phil. iv. 8) —<hi>Whatſoever things are of good Report; if there be any Virtue — any Praiſe, think on theſe Things.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Objection.</hi> 1. But the wiſe Man allows of this Practice, when he ſays, Eccleſ. iii. 4. <hi>There is a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is nothing to the Purpoſe; for the utmoſt that any can pretend that it proves, is denying it to be lawful, and allowing it may be uſed under ſome Circumſtances: but not at all, that <hi>dancing</hi> and other things uſed by our young People in their Frolicks are lawful, in thoſe Circumſtances; any more than what is ſaid in the ſame Chapter, ℣. 3. — <hi>there is a time to kill,</hi> proves that it is lawful for a Man to commit Murder.</p>
                     <p>To deny that dancing under any Circumſtances whatever, was lawful, would be abſurd: for there was a religious dancing in the Jewiſh Church, that was a way of expreſſing their ſpiritual Mirth. So <hi>David</hi> danced before the LORD. And he calls upon others to praiſe GOD in the dance. So there may be other Circumſtances wherein dancing may not be unlawful. But all this makes nothing to the preſent Purpoſe; to prove that this particular Cuſtom, that we have been ſpeaking of amongſt our young People, is not of a bad tendency. And beſides, when the wiſe Man ſays, there is <hi>a time to dance,</hi> that does not prove, that the dead of the Night is the time for it. The ſame wiſe Man don't juſtify carnal Mirth, but condemns it. <hi>Eccl.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>I ſaid of Laughter it is mad; and of Mirth, what doeth it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If we avoid all ſuch things, it will be the way for our young People to be ignorant how to behave themſelves in Company.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But conſider what this Objection comes to. It certainly comes to this, viz. That the pouring out of the Spirit of GOD upon a People, tends to baniſh all good Conduct, good Breeding and decent Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our from among them; and to ſink them down into
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009961_0170_0F7B3E17E725AAE0"/>
Clowniſhneſs and Barbarity. And if ſuch a pouring out of the Spirit of GOD, as has been amongſt us, ſhould be continued, it would tend to have <hi>this</hi> Effect; for that we have ſeen by Experience. The Spirit of GOD did actually put an end to this Practice among us.</p>
                     <p>BUT who is it amongſt us that is not aſhamed to make ſuch an Objection? Will any of our young Converts talk thus? Will you that think you was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the late pouring out of the Spirit of GOD, and are made holy Perſons, Heirs of eternal Life, talk ſo blaſphemouſly of it?</p>
                     <p>IF our young People are reſolute ſtill to go on, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that has been ſaid, I hope that thoſe of them that call themſelves converted will firſt find out ſome rational, ſatisfying Anſwer to the Arguments that have been uſed againſt it. This at leaſt may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected of them, ſeeing they make ſuch a Profeſſion. You have this Day been partaking of the Sacrament of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and therein ſolemnly renewed your Profeſſion —</p>
                     <p>If after ſuch Light ſet before you, and ſuch Mercy given, you will go on, BE IT KNOWN TO YOU, that your eating now, and at other times, will prove only an eating and drinking <hi>Judgment</hi> to your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>AND I deſire Heads of Families, if they have any Government over their Children; or any command of their own Houſes; would not tolerate their Children in ſuch Practices, nor ſuffer ſuch Conventions in their Houſes.</p>
                     <p>I don't deſire that young People ſhould be abridg'd of any lawful and proper Liberties.— But this Cuſtom can be of no Benefit or Service in the World: it tends only to Miſchief.—</p>
                     <p>SATAN doubtleſs would be glad to have ſuch an Intereſt amongſt us as he uſed to have; and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>I ſhall repeat thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiii. 12, 13, 14. and leave them to the ſerious Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all Perſons, old and young: <hi>The Night is far ſpent, the Day is at Hand: Let us therefore caſt off the Works of Darkneſs, and let us put on the Armour of Light. Let us walk honeſtly as in the Day, not in Rioting and Drunkenneſs, not in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and Wantonneſs, not in Strife and Envying.

The great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of this Diſeaſe; ſo as to render the Subjects of it <hi>Fools.</hi> "Ye Fools, when will ye be wiſe?" And ſo as to reduce them to a Degree of Brutiſhneſs.

3. The obſtinacy of this Diſeaſe; expreſs'd in that Interrogation, when will ye be wiſe? Their blindneſs and folly was not only very great; but deeply rooted and eſtabliſhed, reſiſting all manner of cure. 4. Of what Nature this blindneſs is. It is eſpecially in things pertaining to God. They were ſtrangely ignorant of his Perfections, like Beaſts: and had fooliſh Notions of him, as tho' he did not ſee, nor know; and as tho' he would not execute Juſtice, by chaſtiſing and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wicked Men. 5. The unreaſonableneſs and ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſheſs of the Notion they had of God, that he did not hear, did not obſerve their Reproaches of him and his People, is ſhewn by obſerving that he planted the Ear. 'Tis very unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that he who gave Power of perceiving Words, to others, ſhould not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them himſelf. And the ſottiſhneſs of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſenſible of God's all ſeeing Eye, and particularly of his ſeeing their wicked Actions, appears, in that God is the Being who formed the Eye, and gave others a Power of ſeeing. The ſottiſhneſs of their Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of GOD, as tho' he did not know what they did, is argued from his being the Fountain and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all Knowledge. The unreaſonablenſs of their expecting to eſcape God's juſt Chaſtiſements &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Sin, is ſet forth by his chaſtiſing even the Heathen, who did not ſin againſt that Light, or againſt ſo great Mercies, as the Wicked in Iſrael did; nor had ever made ſuch a Profeſſion as they. 6. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that this dreadful Diſeaſe is aſcribed to Mankind in general. "The Lord knoweth the Thoughts of Man, that they are vanity." The Pſalmiſt had been ſetting forth the vanity and unreaſonableneſs of the Thoughts of ſome of the Children of Men; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon it obſerves, that this vanity and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs of Thought is common and natural to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

                     <head>DOCTRINE. THERE is an extreme and brutiſh Blindneſs in Things of Religion, which naturally poſſeſſes the Hearts of Mankind.</head>
                     <p>This Doctrine is not to be underſtood as any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the Capacity of the human Nature; for God hath made Man with a noble and excellent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. The Blindneſs I ſpeak of, is not a merely negative Ignorance; ſuch as is in Trees and Stones, that know nothing. And no wonder; for they have no Faculties of Underſtanding and Perception, whereby they ſhould be capable of any Knowledge. And ſuch as is in inferior Animals, who tho' they have ſenſitive Perception, yet are not capable of any intellectual Views. There is no fault to be found with Man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Faculties. God has given Men thoſe Faculties that are very noble and excellent; well capable of true Wiſdom and divine Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the blindneſs I ſpeak of meerly negative, in the manner in which the Ignorance of a new-born In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant is ſo. Tho' this dont ariſe from want of Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yet it ariſes from want of neceſſary Opportunity to exert theſe Faculties.</p>
                     <p>The blindneſs that is in the Heart of Man, which is ſpoken of in the Text and Doctrine; is neither for want of Faculties, nor opportunity to know; but from ſome poſitive Cauſe. There is a poſitive Principle in the Heart, of a blinding &amp; beſotting Nature, that hinders ſuch Exerciſes of his Faculties about the things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as God has made them well capable of, and gives him abundant Opportunity for. There is a Principle which may be called, a poſitive Principle of Ignorance and Blindneſs; a Proneneſs or Inclination in the Heart of Man to ſuch ſottiſhneſs in theſe great things.</p>

                     <p>And ſo far has that Principle of Blindneſs with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the things of Religion prevailed, that it has in a great Meaſure extinguiſhed all Light in the Minds of many, even in Matters of Morality and Civility, and things that have but a diſtant Relation to Religion. So that many whole Nations have profeſſedly approved of many things directly contrary to the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the moſt horrid Vices and Immoralities have been eſteemed harmleſs, yea accounted Virtues among them: ſuch as Revenge, Cruelty and Inceſt. Many
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009961_0178_0F7B3E24DF03ED18"/>
Nations have openly allowed the Practice of Sodomy. And with ſome it has been accounted commendable to marry their neareſt Relations. Many have even wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped their gods in their Temples with Acts of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and Whoredom, and the moſt abominable Lewdneſs. And the more filthy they were in their Uncleanneſs; they thought their gods the more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and delighted with it.</p>
                     <p>Many Nations have been ſo under the Influence of this blindneſs of Mind which we are now ſpeaking of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they have been void of all Civility, and have been reduced to a State very little above the Beaſts in their common Cuſtoms, and ordinary way of living; and in a great many Things far below the Beaſts: being, if I may ſo ſpeak, much more beaſtly than the Beaſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Now this has not been, becauſe theſe Men and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with whom this has been the Caſe, have not had the ſame Faculties that we have. That we be not as ignorant as they, is not becauſe we have better natural Underſtandings, or that our Minds are by Nature more clear, and Eyes more diſcerning; or that our Hearts be not naturally ſo inclined to Sottiſhneſs &amp; Deluſion as their's. But only becauſe God has not left us ſo much to our ſelves, as he has them. He has given us more Inſtruction to help us againſt our Deluſions. GOD has ſo ordered it in his Providence, that we ſhould have his good Word to inſtruct us; and has cauſed that we ſhould grow up from our Infancy in chriſtian Inſtruction.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The extreme blindneſs and ſottiſhneſs in things of Religion, which is naturally in the Hearts of Men, appears not only in embracing and profeſſing thoſe Errors that are very great, but alſo thoſe that are ſo unnatural. They have not only embraced Errors which are very contrary to Truth, but very contrary to Humanity: not only againſt the Light of Nature, but againſt the more innocent Inclinations of Nature.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009961_0179_0F7B3E2577EED518"/>
Such has been, and is the blindneſs of many Nations in the World, that they embrace thoſe Errors which do not only exclude all true Vertue, all holy Diſpoſitions; but thoſe that have ſwallowed up the more harmleſs Inclinations of human Nature. Their blindneſs has led them to many things that are moſt unnatural, and what the very Nature of Man by its more innocent tendency, ſeems to ſhrink at exceedingly.</p>
                     <p>Thus they have embraced many groſs Deluſions, that are as contrary as poſſible to natural Affection. Such as offering up their own Children in Sacrifice to their Idol; which has been a common thing in the heathen World. And the Parents have not only offered them up to Death; but they have brought them, and offer'd them up to the moſt cruel and tormenting Deaths: as to be burnt alive: to be ſcalded to Death in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Braſs: which was the Way of offering up Children to Moloch. The Image of the Idol being made of Braſs, in a horrid ſhape, was heat red hot; and the poor Child was laid naked in this burning Braſs, and ſo burnt to Death. And the Parents themſelves brought the Child to this offering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however ſweet and pleaſant a Child it might be. And thus the innocent Child was tormented till it died, without any regard to it's piteous Cries. And it has been the manner of ſome Nations, to offer in Sacrifice the faireſt and likelieſt, and beſt beloved Child that they had. And thus many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of poor Babes have been offer'd up. So ſtrong has been the tendency of the Hearts of Men to Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it has thus overcome thoſe ſtrong natural Affections which Men have to the Fruit of their own Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And many of the Deluſions which Men have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, have been againſt Nature alſo, as they have been againſt Men's natural Love of their own Eaſe, and averſion to Pain. Many have worſhiped their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and do ſo to this Day, with ſuch Rites as are moſt
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:009961_0180_0F7B3E2D6ED2D4E8"/>
painful and tormenting: cutting and gaſhing, and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, their own Fleſh. Thus they ſottiſhly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baal of old. "And they cried aloud, and cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after their manner with Knives and Lancets, till the Blood guſhed out upon them."<note n="†" place="bottom">1 King, xviii 28.</note> And it is ſtill the Cuſtom in ſome Nations grievouſly to torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to kindle a Fire to ſcorch their own Bodies in a moſt miſerable manner: and to put themſelves to various and long continued Torments to pleaſe their Idols. And it is the manner in ſome Nations for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, on ſome Occaſions, to kill themſelves: yea, to put themſelves to cruel Deaths, to caſt themſelves into great Fires, and there burn themſelves to Death. How ſtrong muſt be the Deluſions of Men's Minds, and how ſtrong the tendency of the Heart of Man to Deluſion, to carry them ſuch a Length, and ſo to overcome ſuch ſtrong Inclinations of human Nature!</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The extreme blindneſs of the Mind of Man will appear further, if we conſider how general groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Deluſion has been. It has for the moſt part prevailed through the greater Part of the World For moſt of the time from <hi>Noah's</hi> Flood to the coming of Chriſt, all Nations, except the Children of Iſrael, were overſpread with groſs heatheniſh Darkneſs; being given up to the moſt vain and ridiculous Notions, and all manner of Superſtitious, barbarous, abſurd and unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Practices. And for the bigger Part of the time ſince that, the much greater Part of the Nations of the World, have been covered with groſs Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>It is ſo at this Day. Many Nations are under po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Darkneſs, and are in ſuch groſs Deluſions that they worſhip the Virgin Mary, and a great Multitude of dead Men, whom their Church has canonized for Saints: ſome real Saints, and others abominably wicked Men. So they worſhip the Bread in the Sacrament, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:009961_0181_0F7B3E2E41260970"/>
it not only the real Body of Chriſt, but real Chriſt in Body and Soul, and Divinity. They carry a Wafer, a ſmall piece of Bread in Proceſſion, and fall down before it and adore it, and account it Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both in his divine and human Nature: and yet believe that the Body of Chriſt is in Heaven, and in ten thouſand different Places on Earth at the ſame time. They think they can do Works of Supererogation: that is, more good Works than they are obliged to do, whereby they bring God into Debt to them. They whip themſelves, and put themſelves to other ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Penances and Sufferings, whereby they think they appeaſe the Anger of GOD for their Sins. And they pay Money to the Prieſts, to buy the Pardon of their Sins: yea, they buy Indulgencies for future Crimes, or Pardon for Sins before they commit them. They think they defend themſelves from evil Spirits, by ſprinkling holy Water. They pay Money to buy the Souls of their departed Friends out of Purgatory: They worſhip the Relicks of dead Saints; ſuch as pieces of their Bones, their Teeth, their Hair, pieces of their Garments, and the like. And innumerable other ſuch fooliſh Deluſions they are under.</p>
                     <p>A great Part of the Nations of the World are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans: many of the Articles of whoſe Belief are too childiſh and ridiculous to be publickly mentioned in a ſolemn Aſſembly.</p>
                     <p>But the bigger Part of the Inhabitants of the World are to this Day groſs, barbarous Heathens, who have not the Knowledge of the true GOD, but worſhip Idols and Devils, with all manner of abſurd &amp; fooliſh Rites and Ceremonies; and are deſtitute of even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Civility: Multitudes of Nations being like Beaſts in human Shape.</p>
                     <p>Now this barbarous Ignorance and groſs Deluſion, being of ſuch great extent and continuance; of ſuch extent thro' ſo many Ages, even the bigger part of the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009961_0182_0F7B3E2E80A5CD50"/>
Time from <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood to this Day, ſhews the Cauſe is general, and the defect is in the corrupt Nature of Mankind; and the natural blindneſs of Man's Mind, and proneneſs of his Heart to Deluſion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The ſottiſh blindneſs and folly of the Heart of Men appears in their being ſo prone to fall into ſuch groſs Deluſions, ſoon after they have been favoured with clear Light. Were not the Minds of Men exceeding dark, they never would entertain ſuch abſurd Notions at all; for they are as contrary as poſſible to Reaſon: Much leſs would they fall into them, after they had once been inſtructed in the Truth. For were it not for very ſtrange ſottiſhneſs indeed, they would, when they come to be informed of the Truth, and had Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to compare it with thoſe groſs Errors, ſo plainly ſee the difference; they would ſee ſuch a Reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Truth, and ſuch Abſurdity in thoſe Errors, that they would never be in danger of being deluded by them any more. But yet ſo it is; Mankind, after they have been fully inſtructed, and have lived in clear Light, have time after time, preſently loſt the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, and have exchanged it for the moſt barbarous and brutiſh Notions.</p>
                     <p>So it was ſoon after the Flood, whereby the wicked World, thoſe that were viſibly ſo, were deſtroyed: and none were left but thoſe who profeſs'd the true Religion: And they had ſuch an eminently holy Man as <hi>Noah</hi> to inſtruct them. And tho' the true GOD had ſo wonderfully and aſtoniſhingly manifeſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that great Work of Vengeance againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, his deſtroying the old World: yet the Poſterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> great part of them, preſently loſt the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true GOD, and fell away to Idolatry; and that even while <hi>Noah</hi> was living. And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors of <hi>Abraham</hi> were tainted with that Idolatry: and even <hi>Terah</hi> his own Father. "And Joſhua ſaid

                           </gap> 3 4.</note> It ſeems as tho' <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was called away from his Father's Houſe, and from his own Country for this Reaſon, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was over-run with Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>And even many of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac, Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity by <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Keturah,</hi> and that part of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Poſterity which were of <hi>Eſau,</hi> tho' the true Religion was ſo thoroughly taught and practiſed in the Houſes of thoſe holy Patriarchs, and God had from time to time ſo wonderfully and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly manifeſted himſelf to them, yet ſoon caſt off the true GOD, and fell away to Idolatry. For not very long after we read of the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> as being the only People of God, that he had in all the Earth.</p>
                     <p>And ſo the People of that Part of the Land of Canaan, that were under that holy King Melchizedeck, ſoon totally caſt off the worſhip of the one only true GOD, which he taught and maintained. For before <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought in the Children of Iſrael, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that Land were wholly given to Idolatry. So the People of the Land of <hi>Uz,</hi> who were under the Government of ſo great and holy a Man as <hi>Job,</hi> ſoon loſt the Knowledge of the true GOD, and all thoſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Truths which were then known among them, and ſunk into groſs Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>So the Poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> themſelves, tho' God had manifeſted himſelf ſo to them, and had wrought ſuch Wonders for them in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s and <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s time; yet preſently fell to worſhiping the gods of Egypt. This
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009961_0184_0F7B3E303473E310"/>
appears from the Words of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> "Put away the gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other Side of the Flood, <hi>and in Egypt.</hi>"<note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiv. 14.</note> And how ſoon did they fall to worſhiping a golden Calf in the Wilderneſs, in the midſt of the wonderful and miraculous Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the one only true GOD! And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Idolatry was ſo ſtrictly forbidden, and the Folly and Wickedneſs of it ſo clearly manifeſted in the Law of Moſes and in God's Providence; and it was ſo much guarded againſt every way in the Revelation given them, and the whole of God's Conduct towards them; yet how ſoon did they fall into Idolatry after they were brought into the Land of Canaan! And when God raiſed up eminent Men, Judges to inſtruct and govern them, and reclaim them from their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Practices, from time to time; and they profeſſed to be convinced of their Deluſion and Folly, and to repent; yet they would ſoon fall away again into the moſt ſottiſh Idolatry. And this they did ſoon after ſuch great Light as they enjoyed in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s, <hi>David</hi>'s and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time. And ſo they did from time to time down to the Babyloniſh Captivity.</p>
                     <p>And in the Apoſtles times, when ſuch great things were done to rouſe the Attention of Mankind, and ſuch great Light was ſpread over many Nations, Multitudes, after they had been inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion by the Apoſtles and others, fell away into the groſſeſt Hereſies, and embraced the moſt corrupt and abſurd Notions.</p>
                     <p>After the roman Empire had been converted from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, and the Light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel had driven out the ſottiſh Ignorance, and groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities of pagan Idolatry, in which they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo long; they ſoon begun to fall away again from the Truth into Antichriſtian Superſtition and Idolatry, in which are Opinions and Practices no leſs abſurd than
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:009961_0185_0F7B3E30CBB15110"/>
thoſe of the Heathen. And a great Part of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World fell away to Mahometiſm.</p>
                     <p>And ſince the Reformation, wherein GOD won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully reſtored Goſpel Light in a great Part of the chriſtian World, which was not but about two hundred Years ago, many are fallen away again, ſome to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſome to groſs Hereſies, and ſome to atheiſtical Principles: ſo that the reformed Church is greatly diminiſhed.</p>
                     <p>And our Nation in particular, which has been a Nation favoured with Light, ſince the Reformation, above moſt, if not any in the World; how ſoon has it in great Part fallen away! A great Part of it to Atheiſm and Deiſm, to groſs Infidelity; and others to Arminianiſm, and to the Socinian and Arian Hereſies, to believe that Chriſt is a created dependent God; and to hold other fooliſh Abſurdities! And many have of late openly diſputed and denied the moral Evil of ſome of the greateſt and moſt heinous Vices.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Things ſhew how deſperately prone Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are to Blindneſs and Deluſion, how addicted they are to Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p>GOD now and then, by his Inſtructions, lifts ſome Nations out of ſuch groſs Darkneſs: but then, how do they ſink down into it again, as ſoon as his Hand is withdrawn! like an heavy Stone, which tho' it may be forced upwards by Strength of Hand; yet, if it be let go, ſinks down again: and will continue to ſink lower and lower with a ſwift progreſs, if no ſtop be put to it, if there be nothing without to reſtrain it: There is a ſtrong bent that Way. That is the tendency of the Mind of Man ſince the Fall, notwithſtanding his noble Powers and Faculties, to ſink down into a kind of Brutality, to looſe and extinguiſh all uſeful Light, and to gather darkneſs: and to ſink lower and lower into darkneſs.</p>

The extreme and brutiſh blindneſs that poſſeſſes the Hearts of Men naturally, appears in their being ſo confident in groſs Errors and Deluſions. Some things that have been already ſaid, ſhew how confident and aſſured they are: as particularly, their running ſuch great ventures upon it, as offering up their Children; and cutting and mangling themſelves. Multitudes live and die in the moſt fooliſh and abſurd Notions and Principles, and never ſeem to make any Doubt of their being in the right.</p>
                     <p>The Mahometans ſeem to make no Doubt but that when they die they ſhall go to ſuch a Paradiſe as Mahomet has promiſed them: where they ſhall live in all manner of ſenſual Pleaſures: and ſhall ſpend their time in gratifying the Luſts of the Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Mahomet promiſed them that all that die in War for the defence of the Mahometan Religion, ſhall go to this Paradiſe: and they make no Doubt of it; and therefore many of them, as it were, willingly ruſh on upon the Point of the Sword.</p>
                     <p>The Papiſts many of them make no Doubt of the Truth of thoſe fooliſh Notions of a Purgatory, and the Power of the Prieſts to deliver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore won't ſpare vaſt Sums of Money to purchaſe Deliverance for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, from thoſe imaginary Torments.

                     <p>Thus in the heathen World: Before Chriſt's time the whole World excepting the Jews, lay in their Darkneſs for a great many Hundred Years, even time out of Mind, beyond all Time that they had any certain Hiſtory of among them. And there was no remedy, nor appearance of any Remedy: but ſo they continued Ages after Ages, rather waxing worſe and worſe, ſinking deeper and deeper. Among all the many Nations that were in the World, no one ever be-thought themſelves, and emerged out of their bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Darkneſs. There were ſome Nations in that time that emerged out of Slavery to other Nations, and caſt off the Yoke of their Enemies, and grew great and conquered great Part of the World: but never conquered the blindneſs of their own Hearts.</p>
                     <p>There were ſome Nations that excelled in other Knowledge: The Greeks and Romans did ſo. They excelled in Policy, and in the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They had wiſe politic Rulers: They had excellent civil Laws for regulating their civil State: many of which have been look'd upon, and imitated as a Pattern by many chriſtian Nations ſince. They excelled many other Nations in Arts and Government and Civility, almoſt as much as Men do Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Yet they never could deliver themſelves from their

For even the Greeks and Romans in their moſt flouriſhing State, worſhiped innumerable gods: and ſome to whom they aſcribed great Vices: and ſome they worſhiped with moſt obſcene and horrid Rites. To ſome they offer'd human Sacrifices. The Romans had a Temple dedicated to the Furies, which they worſhiped as a God. And they had a Multitude of childiſh Notions and Fables about their gods.</p>
                     <p>And tho' there were raiſed up ſome wiſe Men and Philoſophers among the Greeks and Romans, who bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed ſome things concerning the true GOD from the Jews; yet their Inſtructions never were effectual to deliver any one People, or even one City or Town, from their barbarous Heatheniſm, or ſo much as to get any one Society or Company of Men to unite in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip of the true GOD. And theſe Philoſophers themſelves had many groſly abſurd Opinions mingled with thoſe ſcraps of Truth, which they had gathered up.</p>
                     <p>And the Jews, when they fell away to Idolatry, as they often did, never recovered of themſelves. Never any Remedy appeared, unleſs God raiſed up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily moved ſome Perſon to reprove and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them.</p>
                     <p>And in this Age of Knowledge, an Age wherein Learning is carried to ſuch a great height, even many learned Men ſeem really to be carried away with the groſs Errors and Fooleries of the popiſh Religion.</p>

Souls: nor does it come into their Minds, that there is a Lie in their right Hands.</p>
                     <p>Many Men in <hi>France</hi> and other Countries, who are indeed Men of vaſt Learning and Knowledge, and great Abilities, yet ſeem really to think that the Church of Rome is the only true Church of Chriſt; and are zealous to uphold and propagate it. And tho' now within this hundred Years, human Learning has been very much promoted, and riſen to a greater height than ever in the World: and has greatly increaſed not only in our Nation, but in France and Italy, and other popiſh Countries: yet there ſeems to be no ſuch effect of it, as any conſiderable turning from popiſh Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but the Church of Rome has rather increaſed of late, than otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>And in <hi>England,</hi> a Land wherein Learning flouriſhes as much as in any in the World, and which is perhaps the moſt favoured with Light of any; there are many Men of vaſt Learning, and great &amp; ſtrong Reaſon, who have embraced, and do at this Day, embrace the groſs Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Arians &amp; Deiſts. Our Nation, in all its Light and Learning, is full of Infidels, and thoſe that are further from Chriſtianity, than the very Mahometans themſelves. Of ſo little avail is human Strength, and human Reaſon and Learning, as a Remedy againſt the extreme blindneſs of the Mind of Man. The blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Mind of Man, or an Inclination to Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Things of Religion is ſo ſtrong, that it will overcome the greateſt Learning, and the ſtrongeſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, and as it were, ſwallow up theſe Things.</p>
                     <p>Men, if let alone, will not help one another: nor will they help themſelves. The Diſeaſe always proves without Remedy, unleſs God delivers.

                     <p>Of old the wiſe Men and Philſophers among the Heathen, were, as it were, infinitely divided among themſelves. <hi>Varro,</hi> who was one of them, reckons up ſeveral hundred Opinions that they had about that one Point, <hi>Wherein Man's happineſs conſiſted.</hi> And they were continually in Diſputes one with another. But the Effects of their Diſputes was not any greater U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or any better Agreement in their Opinions. They were as much divided after they had diſputed many Ages, as they were at firſt: yea much more.</p>
                     <p>So there have long been Diſputes in the chriſtian World about Opinions and Principles in Religion. There is a vaſt variety of Sects and Opinions; and Diſputes have been carried on, Age after Age, with great warmth, and thouſands of Volumes have been written one againſt another. And all theſe Diſputes have not terminated the Differences that have been, but they ſubſiſt ſtill as much as ever: yea, they increaſe and multiply more and more. In ſtead of ending Controverſies by diſputing, they do but increaſe them: one Diſpute only lays a Foundation for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And thus the World goes on jangling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, daily writing and printing; being, as it were, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged with controverſial Books: and all to no Purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The increaſe of human Learning don't bring theſe Controveſies to an Iſſue, but does really increaſe and multiply them; as is evident in this learned Age, and in our Nation, where Learning has lately been carried to a very great height. There probably never

Yea, thoſe very things, which they themſelves account great Faults in others, yet they will juſtify themſelves in. Thoſe things for which they will be very angry with others, yet they at the ſame time do themſelves, and often times in a much higher Degree, and never once think of it.

                     <p>They are greatly deceived about themſelves, when they compare themſelves with others.

Thus manifold are the Deceits and Deluſions that Men fall into.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The deſperate Blindneſs that is natural to Men, appears in their being ſo ignorant and blind in things that are ſo clear and plain.

And yet, how hard is it thoroughly to convince Men of it! How plain is it, that eternal Miſery in Hell is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be dreaded? And yet how few appear to be thoroughly convinced of this! How plain is it, that Life is uncertain: and yet how much otherwiſe do moſt Men think! How plain is it, that it is the higheſt Prudence in Matters of infinite Concern to improve the firſt Opportunity, without truſting to another: but yet how few are convinced of this?

And yet, how does this ſeem like a Dream to moſt Men.</p>

There are many vitious Practices, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of which is very plain; the Sins are groſs, and contrary not only to the Word of God, but to the Light of Nature: and yet Men will often times plead there is no harm in ſuch Sins: ſuch as many Acts of groſs Uncleanneſs: and many Acts of Fraud, Injuſtice and Deceitfulneſs; and many others that might be mentioned.</p>
                     <p>There is no one thing whatſoever more plain and manifeſt, and more demonſtrable, than the Being of a GOD. It is manifeſt in our ſelves, in our own Bodies and Souls, and in every thing about us where-ever we

Tho' our Faculties which we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Beaſts were chiefly given us, that we might know this; and tho' it be that without the knowlege of which, all other Knowledge will ſignify nothing to us; and our Faculties are as capable of it, as of any other Knowledge whatſoever; and that which is as plainly and abundantly manifeſted as any thing whatſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Ways, both in the Word and Works of God: yet all Men naturally are totally ignorant of this; as ignorant, as one born blind is of Colours. Natural Men of the greateſt Abilities and Learning, are as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, as the weakeſt and the moſt unlearned; yea, as ignorant as the very Stocks and Stones; for they ſee, and can ſee nothing at all of it.</p>

It appears, in that they are ſo blind in thoſe ſame Things in religious Matters, which they are ſufficiently ſenſible of in other Matters. In temporal things they are very ſenſible that it is a point of Prudence to improve the firſt Opportunity in things of great Importance. But in Matters of Religion, which are of infinitely the greateſt Importance, they have not this diſcerning. In temporal Matters they are ſenſible it is a great folly long to delay and put off, when Life is in danger, and all depends upon that. But in the Concerns of their Souls, they are inſenſible of this Truth. So in the Concerns of this World they are ſenſible it is Prudence to improve times of ſpecial Advantage — to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a good offer when made them—They are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that things of long Continuance are of greater Importance, than thoſe of ſhort Duration— Yet in religious Concerns, none of theſe Things are ſenſibly diſcerned. In temporal things they are ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that 'tis a point of Prudence to lay up for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in Summer to lay up for Winter—to lay up for their Families, after they are dead: but Men do not generally diſcern the Prudence, in making a proper Proviſion for a future State —In Matters of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in this World, they are ſenſible of the wiſdom of taking thorough care to be on ſure Grounds. But in their Soul's Concerns, they ſee nothing of this— Our Saviour obſerved this to be the Caſe with the Jews when he was upon Earth. "Ye Hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the Skie, and of the Earth: but how is it that ye do not diſcern this time?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. xii. 56.</note>

                     <p n="6">6. The deſperate blindneſs that naturally poſſeſſes the Hearts of Men under the Goſpel, appears in their remaining ſo ſtupidly inſenſible and deceived, under ſo great Means of Inſtruction and Conviction. If they were brought up under heatheaniſh Darkneſs, it would

They have the Arguments of God's Being &amp; Perfection—of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World—Are told how eternal things are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Importance than temporal—Of what Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence it is to eſcape eternal Miſery. How much it is worth while to take Pains for heavenly Glory— How vain their own Righteouſneſs is—But yet—</p>
                     <p>And they have not only great Means of Inſtruction in God's Word, but alſo in Providence. They have the Evidences of the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of Life. "He ſeeth that wiſe Men die, likewiſe the fool and the brutiſh Perſon periſh, and leave their Wealth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers." Yet "their inward thought is, that their Houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling Places to all Generations: They call their Lands after their own Names. Nevertheleſs Man being in Honor, abideth not: He is like the Beaſts that periſh. This their way is their folly: yet their Poſterity approve their ſayings." They find the World is vain &amp; unſatisfactory. —They find the great inſtability and treachery of their own Hearts; and how their own good Intentions and Reſolutions are not to be depended on— They often find by Experience, their Attempts to make them better fail—But yet—</p>
                     <p>Such abundant Evidence is there, both in what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the open Profeſſion of Men; and alſo by what is found in their inward Experience, and is evident in their Practice, of the extreme and brutiſh Ignorance and blindneſs, which naturally poſſeſſes their Hearts.</p>

of God's Creatures that we behold, that they have thoſe Properties and Qualities, which are every way propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to their End; ſo that they need no more, they ſtand in need of no greater degree of Perfection, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well to anſwer the ſpecial uſe for which they ſeem to be deſigned.

There is no defect viſible in them: they are perfect in their kind; there ſeems to be nothing wanting, in order to their filling up their Place in the World. And there can be no reaſonable Doubt but that it was ſo at firſt with Mankind It is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that God would make many thouſands of Kinds of Creatures here in this lower World, and one Kind the higheſt of them all, to be the head of the reſt; and that all the reſt ſhould be compleat in their Kinds, every way endowed with ſuch Qualifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Therefore, if the Scripture had not told us ſo, yet we might ſafely conclude, that Mankind are not now, as they were made at firſt; but that they are in a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len State and Condition.</p>

                        </gap> deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, and hold that there is no <hi>revealed Religion;</hi> that God has given Mankind no other Rule but his own Reaſon; which is ſufficient, without any Word or Revelation from Heaven, to give Man a right underſtanding of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Things, and of his Duty. But how has it prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fact? How much trial has there been, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Reaſon, without a Revelation, would be ſufficient or no? The whole World, excepting one Nation, had the trial from about <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, to the coming of Chriſt, about fifteen Hundred Years. And was not this long enough for a trial, whether Man's Reaſon alone was ſufficient to inſtruct him? Thoſe Nations, who all that time lay in ſuch groſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in ſuch a deplorable helpleſs Condition, had the ſame natural Reaſon that the Deiſts have. And during this time, there was not only one Man, or a Succeſſion of ſingle Perſons that had the trial, whether their own Reaſon would be ſufficient to lead them to the Knowledge of the Truth; but all Nations, who all had the ſame human Faculties that we have. If human Reaſon is really ſufficient, and there be no need of any thing elſe, why has it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proved ſo? Why has it never happened, that ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Nation, or <hi>one</hi> City or Town, or <hi>one</hi> Aſſembly of Men have been brought to tolerable Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of divine Things, unleſs it be by the Revelation contained in the Scriptures? If it were only one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had remained in ſuch Darkneſs, the trial might not be thought ſo great; becauſe one particular Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might be under ſome Diſadvntages, which were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar. But thus it has been with all Nations, except thoſe which have been favoured with the Scriptures, and in all Ages. Where is any People, who to this Day have ever delivered themſelves by their own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or have been delivered without Light fetch'd from
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:009961_0205_0F7B3E4DCEEAFC28"/>
the Scriptures, or by Means of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>If human Reaſon is ſufficient without the Scripture, 'tis ſtrange that in theſe latter Ages, ſince Navigation has been been ſo improved, and <hi>America</hi> and many other Parts of the World have been diſcovered, which were before unknown; and many hundreds of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been found out, which the chriſtian World before knew nothing of: I ſay, 'tis very ſtrange, that among all theſe newly diſcover'd Nations, no one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has any where been found already enlightned and poſſeſſed of true Notions about the Divine Being and his Perfections, and free from heatheniſh Darkneſs, by vertue of that human Reaſon, they have been poſſeſſed of this ſo many thouſand Years. The many poor, barbarous Nations here in <hi>America</hi> had the faculty of human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to do what they pleaſed with, before the <hi>Europeans</hi> came hither, and brought over the Light of the Goſpel. If this human Reaſon alone was ſufficient, it is ſtrange no one People were found, in any corner of the Land, who were helped with their Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>There has been a great trial as to what Mens Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can do, without divine Help, in thoſe endleſs Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes that have been maintained. If human Reaſon alone could help Mankind, it might be expected that theſe Diſputes would have helped them, and have put an end to Mens darkneſs. The heathen Philoſophers had many hundreds of Years to try their Skill in this way; but all without effect.</p>
                     <p>That divine Revelation, which the Church of God has been poſſeſſed of, has been in the World "as a Light ſhining in a dark Place.<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. i. 19.</note> 'Tis the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which God has provided for the miſerable, brutiſh blindneſs of Mankind: a Remedy without which, this fallen World of Mankind would have ſunk down for ever in barbariſm and brutality without any Remedy.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009961_0206_0F7B3E4E018FB438"/>
It is the only means that the true God has made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in his Providence, to give the Nations of the World the Knowledge of himſelf; and to bring them off from the worſhip of falſe gods.</p>
                     <p>If human Reaſon be the only proper Means, the Means that God has deſigned for the enlightening of Mankind, 'tis very ſtrange that it has not been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this, nor has anſwered this end in any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. All the right ſpeculative knowledge of the true God, which the Deiſts themſelves have, has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from divine Revelation—</p>
                     <p>How vain is it to diſpute againſt Fact, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſo many thouſand Years? And to pretend that human Reaſon is ſufficient without divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, when ſo many thouſand years Experience, among ſo many hundreds of Nations, of different Tempers, Circumſtances and Intereſts, has proved the contrary? One would think that all ſhould acknowledge, that ſo long a time is ſufficient for a trial; eſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miſeries that the poor Nations of the World have been under all this while, for want of Light: The innumerable temporal Calamities and Miſeries; ſuch as ſacrificing Children, and many other Cruelties to others, and even themſelves: beſides, that eternal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be the Conſequence of ſuch Darkneſs.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. This Doctrine ſhould make us ſenſible, how great a Mercy it is to Mankind, that God has ſent his own Son into the World, to be the Light of the World.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine ſhews what great need we ſtand in of ſome Teacher to be ſent from God. And even ſome of the wiſer Men among the Heathen ſaw the need of this. They ſaw that they diſputed and jangled among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without coming to a ſatisfying diſcovery of the Truth; and hence they ſaw the need there was of a Teacher ſent from Heaven; and ſpake of ſuch a thing. And it is a wonderful Inſtance of divine Mercy that
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:009961_0207_0F7B3E4EE2D509B8"/>
God has ſo beheld us in our low Eſtate, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſuch a glorious Remedy. He han't only ſent ſome created Angel to inſtruct us, but his own SON, who is in the Boſom of the Father, and of the ſame Nature and Eſſence with him; and therefore infinitely better acquainted with him, and more ſufficient to teach a blind World. He has ſent him to be the Light of the World, as he ſays of himſelf, "I am come a Light into the World.<note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. xii. 46.</note> When he came he brought glorious Light into the World. It was like the Day ſpring from on high, viſiting a dark World, as <hi>Zacharias</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. i. 77.78.79.</note> After Chriſt came, then the glorious Goſpel began to ſpread abroad in the World into one Nation and another, delivering thoſe "that had ſat in Darkneſs, and in the Region of the ſhadow of Death."</p>
                     <p>What reaſon have we to rejoyce and praiſe God, that he has made ſuch excellent Proviſion for us; and has ſet ſo glorious a Sun in our Firmament, ſuch a "Sun of Righteouſneſs," after we had extinguiſhed the Light, which at firſt enlightened us; and had, as it were, brought the World into that State, in which it was when "without Form, and void, and Darkneſs was on the face of it". <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. xii. 46.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The glory of that Light which God has ſent into the World, is fully anſwerable to the groſsneſs of that Darkneſs which filled the World. For Chriſt who came to enlighten us, is Truth and Light it ſelf, and the Fountain of all Light." "He is Light, and in him is no darkneſs at all. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Luk. i. 77.78.79.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Hence we may learn, what muſt be the thing that will bring to paſs thoſe glorious Days of Light, which are ſpoken of in God's Word.</p>
                     <p>Tho' Mankind be fallen into ſuch Darkneſs, and the World is moſtly in the Kingdom of Darkneſs: yet the <note n="*" place="bottom">See Jer. iv. 22, 23.</note>

Scripture often ſpeaks of a glorious Day, wherein, Light ſhall fill the Earth. "For behold the darkneſs ſhall cover the Earth, and groſs darkneſs the People but the Lord ſhall ariſe upon thee, and his glory ſhall be ſeen upon thee. And the Gentiles ſhall come to thy Light, and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. lx. 2, 3.</note> "And he will deſtroy in this Mountain, the face of the covering caſt over all People, and the vail that is ſpread over all Nations" <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. lx. 2, 3.</note> "The knowledge of God ſhall fill the Earth, as the Waters cover the Seas"<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. xxv. 1.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>By what we have heard, we may on good Grounds conclude that whenever this is accompliſhed, it will not be effected by human Learning, or by the ſkill or wiſdom of great Men. What has been before obſerved of this learned Age, is an Evidence of this; wherein ſpiritual Darkneſs does ſo increaſe, with the increaſe of Learning. God will again make fooliſh the wiſdom of this World; and will, as it were, ſay in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, "Where is the wiſe! where is the Scribe! where is the diſputer of this World!"</p>
                     <p>When this ſhall be accompliſhed, it will be by a remarkable pouring out of God's own Spirit, with the plain preaching of the Goſpel of his Son; the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſpiritual, myſterious Doctrines of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, which to the learned Men of this World are fooliſhneſs. By the Spirit of God accompanying the preaching of thoſe Doctrines, which are the ſtumbling-Block of this learned Age. "Not by might, nor power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſai. xi. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> It will not be by the enticing Words of Man's wiſdom; but by the demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power. Not by the wiſdom of this World, nor the Princes of this World, that comes to nought: but by the Goſpel, that contains the wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden Wiſdom, which none of the Princes of this World, who have nothing to enlighten them but their own learning, know any thing of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:009961_0209_0F7B3E53678AF490"/>The Spirit of God, who ſearches all things, even the deep things of God, muſt reveal it. For let natural Men be never ſo worldly wiſe and learned, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the things of the Spirit; they are fooliſhneſs to them; nor can they know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
                     <p>This great effect, when it is accompliſhed, will be a glorious effect indeed: and it will be accompliſhed in ſuch a manner, as moſt remarkably to ſhew it to be the Work of God, and his only. It will be a more glorious Work of God than that which we read of in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> "And the Earth was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and vold, and darkneſs was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters: And God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light." <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen, i. 2, 3.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. Hence we may learn the miſery of all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are under the Power of the darkneſs, which naturally poſſeſſes their Hearts. There are two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this miſery.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That which all that are in a natural Condition are the ſubjects of. The Doctrine ſhews, that all ſuch as are in a natural Condition, are in a miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for they are in an extremely dark and blind Condition. 'Tis uncomfortable living in outward Darkneſs. What a ſorrowful State ſhould we all be in, if the Sun ſhould no more riſe upon us, and the Moon were to with-draw her ſhining, and the Stars to be put out, and we were to ſpend the reſt of our time in darkneſs? The World would ſoon periſh, in ſuch Darkneſs. It was a great Plague in Egypt, when they had a total Darkneſs for three Days. Outward blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is juſtly looked upon as a great Calamity. They who are deprived of Sight, are deprived of the moſt noble of the Senſes: they have no benefit of external
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:009961_0210_0F7B3E5400755AF8"/>
Light, one of the moſt excellent and needful of the Things which God has made in the viſible Creation. But they who are without ſpiritual Sight and Light, are deſtitute of that which is far more excellent and neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>That natural Men are not ſenſible of their blindneſs, and the Miſery they are under by Reaſon of it, is no Argument that they are not miſerable. For it is very much the Nature of this Calamity to be hid from it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or from thoſe who are under it. Fools are not ſenſible of their Folly. Solomon ſays <q>The Fool is wiſer in his own Conceit than ſeven Men that can render a Reaſon</q>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxvi. 16.</note> The moſt barbarous and brutiſh Heathen are not ſenſible of their own Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; are not ſenſible but that they enjoy as great Light, and have as good Underſtanding of Things, as the moſt enlightned Nations in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. ANOTHER Degree of this Miſery is of thoſe who are judicially given up of God, to the blindneſs of their own Minds. The Scripture teaches us that there are ſome ſuch <q>What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for, but the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</q>

Holy Ghoſt, after many gracious Calls and Counſels, Warnings and Reproofs.</p>
                     <p>Who the particular Perſons are, that are thus judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given up of God to the blindneſs of their Minds, is not known to Men. But we have no Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there are not Multitudes of them; and moſt in Places of the greateſt Light. There is no manner of Reaſon to ſuppoſe, that this Judgement which is ſpoken of in Scripture, is in a great Meaſure peculiar to thoſe old Times. As there were many that fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in the Times of the Prophets of Old, and of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſo doubtleſs there are now a Days too. And tho' the Perſons are not known, yet doubtleſs there may be more Reaſon to fear it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome than others. All that are under the Power of the blindneſs of their own Minds, are miſerable; but ſuch as are given up to this Blindneſs, are eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally miſerable: For they are reſerved, and ſealed over to the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</p>
                     <p>And the Conſideration of what has been ſaid of the deſperate blindneſs which poſſeſſes the Hearts of all naturally, may well be terrifying to ſuch as are yet in a Chriſtleſs Condition in this place of Light, where the Goſpel has been ſo long enjoyed, and where God has in Times paſt, ſo wonderfully poured out his Spirit.</p>
                     <p>And let ſuch Perſons, for their awakening, conſider the following Things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they are blinded by the God of this World. Their blindneſs is from Hell. This Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which natural Men are under, is from the Prince of Darkneſs. This the Apoſtle ſays expreſly of thoſe who remain in unbelief and blindneſs under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <q>But if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid from them that are loſt; in whom the God of this world hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not.</q>

which reigns in their Souls, the Devil reigns, and holds his dominion there.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider, how God in his Word manifeſts his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence and Wrath towards thoſe who remain ſo ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly blind and ignorant, in the midſt of Light. How does God ſpeak of them! "Have all the workers of Iniquity no Knowledge?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv. 4.</note> "Forty Years long was I grieved with this Generation, and ſaid, it is a people that do err in their Heart, and they have not known my Ways.

                     <p n="3">3. Conſider how much wilfulneſs there is in your Ignorance. Sinners are ready wholly to excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their blindneſs, and ſay— Whereas, as has been obſerved already, the blindneſs that naturally poſſeſſes the Hearts of Men, is not a merely negative Thing; but they are blinded by "the deceitfulneſs of ſin." <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Heb. iii. 13.</note> There is a perverſeneſs in their blindneſs. There is not a mere Abſence of Light,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:009961_0213_0F7B3E589A7C9FD8"/>
but a malignant oppoſition to the Light: As God ſays, "They know not, neither will they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand they walk on in Darkneſs." <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxii. 5.</note> Chriſt obſerves, "That every one that doth Evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light." And that "This is their Condemnation that Light is come into the World, yet Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light," <note n="‡" place="bottom">Joh. iii. 19, 20.</note> And I may appeal to your own Conſciences, whether you have not wilfully rejected the many Inſtructions you have had: and refuſed to hearken? Whether you have not neglected to ſeek after the Light—Neglected your Bible—Whether you have not been a very negligent Hearer of the Word preached—And neglected o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper Means of Knowledge—Neglected to cry to God for that Wiſdom which you need? Yea, have you not <hi>reſiſted</hi> the Means of Knowledge? Have you not reſiſted and quenched the Motions of the Spirit, which at ſome Times you have had? And hugged your own fottiſhneſs: And taken a Courſe to make yourſelf more and more ſtupid, by ſtiffling the Convictions of your own Conſcience, and doing contrary to the Light thereof; whereby you have done thoſe Things that have tended to ſear your Conſcience, and make your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more and more ſenſleſs and fottiſh?</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Conſider what is the Courſe that God will take to teach thoſe that will not be taught by the Inſtructions of his Word. He will teach them by Briars and Thorns, and by the Flames of Hell. Tho' natural Men will remain to all Eternity ignorant of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Lovelineſs of God's Nature, and ſo will have no ſpiritual Knowledge; yet God in another World will make them thoroughly to underſtand many Things which ſenſeleſs, unawakened Sinnners are ſottiſhly ignorant of in this World. Their Eyes in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, ſhall be thoroughly opened in Hell. Their Judgments will be rectified. They ſhall be of the ſame Judgment with the godly.—They ſhall be convinced

of the Reality of thoſe Things which they would not be convinced of here—Of the Being of a God— His Power—Holineſs—juſtice.—That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the Word of God.—That Chriſt is the Son of God.—That Time is ſhort and uncertain. They will be convinced of the Vanity of the World— Of the bleſſed Opportunity they had in the World— How much 'tis Men's Wiſdom to improve their Time— We read of the rich Man, who was ſo ſottiſhly blind in this World, that, "In Hell he lift up his Eyes, and ſaw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his Boſom."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Luke xvi. 23.</note> 'Tis ſo with many Men, that the firſt Time they open their Eyes is in Hell.</p>
                     <p>God will make all Men to know the Truth of thoſe great Things whigh he ſpeaks of in his Word, one way or another: For he will vindicate his own Truth. He has undertaken to convince all Men. They who will not be convinced in this World, by the gentle and gracious Methods which God uſes with them now, ſhall be convinced hereafter by ſevere Means. If they will not be convinced for Salvation, they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by Damnation: God will make them know that he is the Lord—And he will make them know that he bears Rule.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. HENCE we may learn what great Care we had need all have, that we be not deceived in Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. If it be ſo that our Hearts are all naturally poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch an extreme brutiſh Ignorance and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in things of Religion, and we are exceedingly prone
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:009961_0215_0F7B3E5AB909EDC0"/>
to Deluſion; then ſurely great Care ought to be taken to avoid Deluſion. For that we are naturally prone to Deluſion, ſhews our Danger: But the greater our Danger of any Calamity is, the greater had our watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs need to be.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore be hence warned to take heed that we be not deceived about our Duty—About our own Hearts—About our Ways—About our State—About our Opportunities—Thouſands are deceived in theſe Things, and Thouſands periſh by that Means. Multitudes fall on our right Hand and on our left, and are ruined eternally by Deluſion in theſe Things.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. IF we are naturally ſo blind and ignorant, and prone to Deluſion; then hence we learn how fooliſh a Thing it is for Men to lean to their own Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and truſt their own Hearts. If we are ſo blind, then our own wiſdom is not to be depended on; and that Advice of the wiſe Man is moſt reaſonable; "Truſt in the Lord with all thine Heart, and lean not to thine own Underſtanding."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. iii. 5.</note> So is that Saying of his, "He that truſteth in his own Heart, is a Fool."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii 26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>They therefore are Fools, who truſt to their own Wiſdom, and will queſtion the myſterious Doctrines of Religion. Such as — becauſe they cannot ſee through them—and will not truſt to the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</p>
                     <p>And they who are confident and ſtiff in their own Judgment of themſelves, and their own State, from an Opinion of their own good diſcerning.</p>
                     <p>And they who truſt to their own Reſolutions.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>If it be ſo, that we are naturally under the Power of ſuch ſottiſh Blindneſs, in the Things of Religion; then this leads and directs us to theſe two Methods in order to our being truly wiſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That we ſhould become Fools: Be ſenſible of our own natural Blindneſs and Folly. There is a Treaſure of Wiſdom contained in that one Sentence, "If any Man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this World, let him become a Fool, that he may be wiſe."<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 18.</note> Seeing our own ignorance and blindneſs, is the firſt Step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having true Knowledge. "If any Man think that he knoweth any Thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. viii. 2.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. To aſk Wiſdom of God. If we are ſo blind in ourſelves, then Knowledge is not to be ſought for out of our own Stock, but muſt be ſought from ſome other Source. And we have no where elſe to go for it, but to the Fountain of light and wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>True Wiſdom is a precious Jewel: And none of our fellow Creatures can give it us, nor can we buy it with any Price we have to give. It is the ſovereign Gift of God. The Way to obtain it, is to go to him, ſenſible of our Weakneſs and Blindneſs, and Miſery on that Account. "If any Man lack Wiſdom, let him ask of God."</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE apoſtle, from the beginning of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, to the beginning of this chapter, had inſiſted on the Doctrine of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith alone. And having particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken to that, in this chapter he goes on to conſider the benefits that are conſequent on Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And there are three that flow from juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are here ſpoken of, viz. Peace with God, Preſent happineſs, and Hope of glory. Peace with God is mentioned in the firſt verſe. "Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified by faith, <hi>we have peace with God,</hi> through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." In the following verſes he ſpeaks of preſent bleſſedneſs, and hope of glory, as benefits accompanying Juſtification. "By whom alſo we have acceſs by faith into this grace, wherein we ſtand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>And concerning this benefit of the <hi>hope of glory,</hi> the apoſtle does particularly take notice of two things, viz. the bleſſed nature of this hope, and the ſure ground of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:009961_0218_0F7B3E60C4848A38"/>1. He inſiſts on the bleſſed nature of this hope, in that it enables us to glory in tribulations. This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature of true chriſtian hope is deſcribed in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words. "And not only ſo, but we glory in tribulation alſo knowing that tribulation worketh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 3. 4. 5.</note> Q. D. Through hope of a bleſſed reward, that will abundantly more than make up for all tribulation, we are enabled to bear tribulation with patience; patiently bearing, and patiently waiting for the reward. And patience works experience; for when we thus bear tribulation with patient waiting for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, this brings experience of the earneſt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, viz. the earneſt of the ſpirit, in our feeling the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt. So that our hope don't make us aſhamed; tho' we do bear tribulation, our hope is not diſappointed; for in the midſt of our tribulation, we experience thoſe ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed incomes of the ſpirit in our ſouls, that make even a time of tribulation ſweet to us; and is ſuch an earneſt as abundantly confirms our hope: and ſo expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience works hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The apoſtle takes notice of the ſure and abundant ground there is for this hope; or the abundant evidence we have, that we ſhall obtain the glory hoped for, in that peace that we have with God, in our juſtification through Chriſt's blood; becauſe that while we were without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for us; while we were ungodly and ſinners, enemies to God and Chriſt.<note n="§" place="bottom">See ver. 6—10.</note> The apoſtle's argument is exceeding clear and ſtrong. That if God has done already ſo great a thing for us, as to give us Chriſt, to die and ſhed his precious blood for us, which was vaſtly the greateſt thing, we need not doubt but that he will beſtow life upon us, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:009961_0219_0F7B3E6190C2B1F8"/>
all this is already done. 'Tis but a ſmall thing for God actually to beſtow eternal life, after it is purchaſed; to what it is for him to give his own Son to die, to purchaſe it. The giving Chriſt to purchaſe it, was vertually all: It included the whole grace of God in ſalvation. When Chriſt had purchaſed ſalvation at ſuch a dear rate, all the difficulty was got through, all was vertually over and done. 'Tis a ſmall thing, in compariſon, for God to beſtow ſalvation, after it has been thus purchaſed at a full price. Sinners that are juſtified by the death of Chriſt, are already vertually ſaved: the thing is, as it were, done: What remains, is no more than the neceſſary conſequence of what is done. Chriſt when he died made an end of ſin: And when he roſe from the dead, he did vertually riſe with the elect: He brought them up from death with him, and aſcended into heaven with them. And therefore, when this is already done, and we are thus reconciled to God through the death of his ſon, we need not fear but that we ſhall be ſaved by his life. The love of God appears much more in his giving his ſon to die for ſinners, than in giving eternal life after Chriſt's death.</p>
                  <p>The giving of Chriſt to die for us is here ſpoken of as a much greater thing, than the actual beſtowment of life, on two accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this is all that has any difficulty in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When God did this for us, he did it for us, as ſinners and enemies. But in actually beſtowing ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on us after we are juſtified, we are not looked up- ſin as ſinners. After we are juſtified, God don't look on us any longer as ſinners, but as perfectly righteous perſons: he beholds no iniquity in us. We are no more enemies, for then we are reconciled. When God gave Chriſt to die for the elect, he looked on them as they are in themſelves; but in actually beſtowing eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, he dont look on them as they are in themſelves, but as they are in Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THEIR enmity appears in their judgments; in the judgment and eſteem they have of God. They have a very mean eſteem of God. Men are ready to entertain a good eſteem of thoſe with whom they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>nds: They are apt to think highly of their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to give them their due praiſes; and if there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, to cover them But thoſe to whom they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, they are diſpoſed to have mean thoughts of; they are apt to entertain a diſhonourable opinion of them: they will be ready to look contemptibly upon any thing that is praiſe-worthy in them.</p>
                     <p>SO is it with natural men towards God. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain very low and contemptible thoughts of God. Whatever honour and reſpect they may pretend and make a ſhew of towards God, if their practice be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, it will ſhew, that they do certainly look upon him to be a being, that is but little to be regarded. They think him one that is worthy of very little honor and reſpect, not worthy to be much taken notice of. The language of their hearts is, "Who is the Lord, that I ſhould obey his voice?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. v. 2.</note> "What is the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Job. xxi. 15.</note> They count him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy neither to be loved nor feared. They dare not behave with that ſlight and diſregard towards one of their fellow creatures, but a little raiſed above them in power and authority, as they dare, and do towards God. They value one of their equals much more than God, and are ten times more afraid of offending ſuch an one, than of diſpleaſing the God that made them. They caſt ſuch exceeding contempt on God,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:009961_0222_0F7B3E65D80DBED0"/>
as to prefer every vile luſt before him. And every worldly enjoyment is ſet higher in their eſteem, than God. A morſel of meat, or a few pence of worldly gain, is preferred before him. God is ſet laſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the eſteem of natural men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. THEY are enemies in the natural reliſh of their ſouls. They have an inbred diſtaſte and diſreliſh of God's perfections. God is not ſuch a ſort of being as they would have. Tho' they are ignorant of God; yet from what they hear of him, and from what is manifeſt by the light of nature of God, they don't like him. By his being endowed with ſuch attributes as he is, they have an averſion to him. They hear God is an infinitely holy, pure and righteous Being, and they don't like him upon this account; they have no reliſh of ſuch kind of qualifications: they take no delight in contemplating them. It would be a mere taſk, a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to a natural man, to be obliged to ſet himſelf to contemplate theſe attributes of God. They ſee no manner of beauty or lovelineſs, nor taſte any ſweetneſs in them. And upon the account of their diſtaſte of theſe perfections, they diſlike all the other of his attributes. They have greater averſion to him becauſe he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient and knows all things; becauſe his omniſcience is an holy omniſcience. They are not pleaſed that he is omnipotent, and can do whatever he pleaſes; becauſe it is a holy omnipotence. They are enemies even to his mercy, becauſe it is a holy mercy. They do not like his immutability, becauſe by this he never will be otherwiſe than he is, an infinitely holy God.</p>
                     <p>'Tis from this diſreliſh that natural men have of the attributes of God, that they don't love to have much to do with God. The natural tendency of the heart of man is to fly from God, and keep at a diſtance from him; and to get as far off as poſſible from God. A natural man is averſe to communion with God, and is naturally diſinclined to thoſe exerciſes of religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:009961_0223_0F7B3E664EFAF600"/>
he has immediately to do with God. It is ſaid of wicked men, "God is not in all his thoughts."<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. x. 4.</note> 'Tis evident that the mind of man is naturally averſe to thinking about God: And hence if any thoughts of God be ſuggeſted to the mind, they ſoon go away; ſuch thoughts be not apt to reſt in the minds of natural men. If any thing is ſaid to them of God, they are apt to forget it: 'tis like ſeed that falls upon the hard path, it don't at all enter in, and the fowls of the air ſoon catch it away: or like ſeed that falls upon a rock. Other things will ſtick; but divine things, do, as it were, rebound: and if they are caſt into the mind, they meet with that there which ſoon thruſts them out again: they meet with no ſuitable entertainment, but are ſoon chaſed away.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo it is that natural men are ſo difficultly perſwaded to be conſtant in the duty of ſecret prayer. They would not be ſo averſe to ſpending a quarter of an hour, night and morning, in ſome bodily labour; but 'tis becauſe they are averſe to a work, wherein they have ſo immediately to do with God; and they naturally love to keep at a diſtance from God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. THEIR wills are contrary to his will. God's will and their's, are exceeding croſs the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God wills thoſe things that they hate, and are moſt averſe to; and they will thoſe things that God hates. Hence they oppoſe God in their wills: they ſet up their wills againſt the will of God. There is a dreadful, violent and obſtinate oppoſition of the will of natural men to the will of God.</p>
                     <p>They are very oppoſite to the commands of God. 'Tis from the enmity of the will, that "the carnal mind is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be"<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 7.</note> Hence natural men are enemies to God's government. They are not loyal ſubjects, but enemies

to God, conſidered as lord of the world. They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire enemies to God's authority.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. THEY are enemies to God in their affections. There is in every natural man a ſeed of malice againſt God: yea, there is ſuch a ſeed of this, rooted in the heart of man naturally. And it does often dreadfully break forth and appear. Tho' it may in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lie hid in ſecure times, when God lets men alone, and they meet with no great diſturbance of body or mind; yet, if God does but touch men a little in their conſciences, by manifeſting to them a little of his wrath for their ſins, this oft times brings out the principle of malice againſt God, which is exerciſed in dreadful heart-riſings, inward wranglings and quarrellings, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts: wherein the heart is like a viper, hiſſing, and ſpitting poiſon at God. There is abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch a principle in the heart. And however free from it the heart may ſeem to be, when let alone and ſecure, yet a very little thing will ſet it in a rage. Temptations will ſhew what is in the heart. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of a man's circumſtances will often diſcover the heart: a change of circumſtance will bring that out which was hid before. Pharaoh had no more natural enmity againſt God than other men; and if other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men had been in Pharaoh's circumſtances, the ſame corruptions would put forth themſelves in as dreadful a manner. The Scribes &amp; Pharaſees had naturally no more of a principle of malice in their hearts againſt Chriſt, than other men; and other natural men would, in their caſe, and having as little reſtraint, exerciſe as much malice againſt Chriſt as they did. When wicked men come to be caſt into hell, then their malice againſt God will appear. Then will it appear what dreadful malice they have in their hearts. Then their hearts will appear as full of malice, as hell is full of fire. But when wicked men come to be in hell, there will be no
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:009961_0225_0F7B3E6778422920"/>
new corruptions put into their heart; but only old ones will then break forth without reſtraint. That is all the difference between a wicked man on earth, and a wicked man in hell, that in hell there will be more to ſtir up the exerciſe of corruption, and leſs to reſtrain it than on earth: but there will be no new corruption put in. A wicked man will have no principle of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in hell, but what he carried to hell with him. There are now the ſeeds of all the malice that will be exerciſed then. The malice of damned ſpirits is but a branch of the root, that is in the hearts of natural men now. A natural man has a heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like the heart of a devil; but only as corruption is more under reſtraint in man than in devils.</p>

Some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men have better natural tempers than others; and ſome are better educated than others; and ſome live a great deal more ſoberly than others: but one has no more love to God than another; for none have the leaſt ſpark of that. The heart of a natural man is as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of love to God, as a dead, ſtiff, cold corpſe is of vital heat.

All the affections are governed by enmity againſt God: there is not one affection, nor one deſire, that a natural man has, or that he is ever ſtired up to act from, but that contains in it enmity againſt God.

men can't overcome their own enmity, let them ſtrive never ſo much with their own hearts. Indeed, a natural man never ſincerely ſtrives to root out his enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; his endeavours are hypocritical: he delights in his enmity, and chooſes it. Neither can others do it, tho' they ſincerely, and to their utmoſt endeavour to overcome this enmity. If godly friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours labour to perſwade them to caſt away their enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and become friends to God, they can't perſwade them to it. Tho' miniſters uſe never ſo many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and entreaties, and ſet forth the lovelineſs of God, and tell them of the goodneſs of God to them, and hold forth to them God's own gracious invitations, and intreat them never ſo earneſtly to caſt off their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and enmity, and to be reconciled, and become friends; yet they can't overcome it: ſtill they will be as bad enemies to God, as ever they were. The tongue of men or of angels can't perſwade them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their oppoſition to God. Miracles will not do it. How many miracles did the children of Iſrael ſee in the wilderneſs! yet their enmity againſt God remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as appeared by their often murmuring. And how often did Chriſt uſe miracles to this end without effect, but the Jews yet obſtinately ſtood out. "O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, <hi>and ye would not.</hi>"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. xxiii 37.</note> And how great did the enmity of theſe people appear to be after all; how ſpiteful and venemous were their hearts towards Chriſt, as appears by their cruel treatment of him, in his laſt ſufferings!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. THEY are <hi>mortal</hi> enemies to God; i. e. They have that enmity in their hearts, that ſtrikes at the life of God. A man may be no friend to another, and may

have an ill ſpirit towards him; and yet not be his <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> enemy: his enmity will be ſatisfied and gluted with ſomething ſhort of the death of the perſon. But it is not ſo with natural men, with reſpect to God: they are <hi>mortal</hi> enemies. Indeed, natural men can't kill God. They have no hope of it, and ſo make no attempts: It has ever been looked upon ſo much above their power, that, it may be, it is not thought of. But that is no argument that this is not the tendency of the principle.</p>
                     <p>Natural men are enemies to the dominion of God; and their nature ſhews their good will to pull him down out of heaven, and dethrone him if they could! Yea, they are enemies to the <hi>Being</hi> of God, and would be glad if there was no God. And therefore it neceſſarily follows, that they would <hi>kill him,</hi> and cauſe that there ſhould be none, if they could.</p>
                     <p>"The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv. 1.</note> This ſaying <hi>in his heart, There is no God,</hi> imples in it, not only an aptneſs to queſtion the Being of God; but it implies, that he <hi>inclines</hi> it ſhould be ſo. His <hi>heart</hi> ſays, i. e. his inclination ſays. The words in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal are thus, "The fool hath ſaid in his heart, No God." The words, <hi>there is,</hi> are not in the original, but were put in by the tranſlators. Now if we read the words ſo, "The fool hath ſaid in his heart, No God," they will perhaps ſhew the Pſalmiſt's meaning more fully, than as they are now tranſlated. "The fool hath ſaid in his heart, <hi>No God.</hi>" That is, "I would have none, I don't deſire any, I wiſh there was none; that would ſuit my inclination beſt." That is the language of the inclinations of a natural man; no God. Let there be no God for me, let me have no God: Let the world be emptied of a God, he ſtands in my way." And hence he is an Atheiſt in his heart, he is ready to think there is none; and that alſo is ready to be the language of his heart, "There is no God."</p>

                     <p>The divine nature being immortal, and infinitely out of our reach, there is no other trial poſſible, whether the enmity that is naturally in the heart againſt God, be mortal or no, but only for God to take on him the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, and become man; ſo as to come within man's reach, that they ſhould be capable of killing him. There can be no other experiment but this. And this trial there has been. And what has been the event? Why, when once God became man, and came down to dwell here, among ſuch vipers as fallen men, they hated him, and perſecuted him; and never left 'till they had imbrued their hands in his blood. There was a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them that appeared combined in this deſign. Nothing would do, but he muſt be put to death. All cry out, "Crucify him, crucify him. Away with him." They had rather Barrabbas, who greatly deſerved death, ſhould live, than he ſhould not die. Nothing would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from it; even all his preaching and all his miracles: but they would kill him. And it was not the ordinary kind of execution that would ſatisfy them: but it muſt be the moſt cruel, and moſt ignominious they poſſibly could invent. And they in the time of it, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, and aggravated it as much as ever they could, by mocking him, and ſpiting on him, and ſcourging him. This ſhews what the nature and tendency of man's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God is; here it appeared in its true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>

Natural men may be very great enemies to their fellow creatures; but not ſo great as they are to God. There is no other being that ſo much ſtands in ſinners way, in thoſe things that they chiefly ſet their hearts upon, as God. Men are wont to hate their enemies in proportion to two things, viz. their oppoſition to what they look upon to be their intereſt, — and their power and ability. One that is looked upon a great and powerful enemy, will be more hated, than one that is weak and impotent. But none of their enemies is ſo powerful as God.</p>
                     <p>Man's enmity to other enemies may be got over: time may wear it out, and they may be reconciled, and be friends. But natural men, without a mighty work of God to change their hearts, will never get over their enmity againſt God. They are greater enemies to God, than they be to the devil. Yea, they treat the devil as their friend and maſter, and join in with him againſt God.

                     <p n="3">III. TO ſhew why, or on what account they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The general Reaſon is,</hi> That God is oppoſite to them in the worſhip of their idols.</p>
                     <p>The apoſtacy of man does ſummarily conſiſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the true God, to idols, forſaking his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſetting up other things in his room.</p>
                     <p>When God at firſt created man, he was united to his creator; the God that made him was his God. The true God was the object of his higheſt reſpect, and had the poſſeſſion of his heart. Love to God was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in his heart, that ruled over all other principles;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:009961_0232_0F7B3E70AC322DB0"/>
and every thing in the ſoul, was wholly in ſubjection to it. But when man fell, he departed from the true God, and the union that was between his heart and his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was broken: he wholly loſt the principle of love he had to God. And henceforward man clave to other gods. He gave that reſpect to the creature, which is due to the creator. When God ceaſed to be the object of his ſupream love and reſpect, other things of courſe became the objects of it.</p>
                     <p>Man will neceſſarily have ſomething that he reſpects as his God. If man don't give his higheſt reſpect to the God that made him, there will be ſomething elſe that has the poſſeſſion of it. Men will either worſhip the true God, or ſome idol: it is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe; ſomething will have the heart of man. And that which a man gives his heart to, may be called his God: and therefore when man by the fall extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed all love to the true God, he ſet up the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in his room</p>
                     <p>And ſo man came to be at enmity againſt the true God. For having loſt his eſteem and love of the true God, and ſet up other gods in his room, and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him; and God ſtill demanding their worſhip, and oppoſing them in their worſhip of thoſe falſe gods; and man continuing ſtill to worſhip idols, enmity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows.</p>
                     <p>That which a man chuſes for his God, he ſets his heart mainly upon. And nothing will ſo ſoon excite enmity, as oppoſition in that which is deareſt. A man will be the greateſt enemy to him who oppoſes him in what he chooſes for his God: he will look on none as ſtanding ſo much in his way, as he that would deprive him of his God. "Ye have taken away my gods; and what have I more?"<note n="†" place="bottom">Judg. vxiii. 24.</note> A man, in this reſpect, can't ſerve two maſters, that ſtand in competition to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And not only, if he ſerves one, he cannot <hi>ſerve</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="unknown:009961_0233_0F7B3E7194A5ACD0"/>
the other; but if he cleaves to one, he will neceſſarily <hi>hate</hi> the other. "No man can ſerve two maſters; for either he will <hi>hate</hi> the one, and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one, and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> the other. Ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve God and mammon."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. vi. 24</note> And this is the very reaſon that men hate God. In this caſe it is, as when two kings ſet up in one kingdom, in oppoſition one to the other; and they both challenge the ſame throne, and are competitors for the ſame crown: they that are loyal, hearty ſubjects to the one, will neceſſarily be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the other. It always happens ſo, nor indeed can it be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>As that which is a man's God, is the object of his higheſt love; ſo that God which chiefly oppoſes him in it, muſt be the object of his greateſt hatred.</p>
                     <p>The gods which a natural man worſhips, inſtead of the God that made him, are himſelf and the world. He has withdrawn his eſteem and honor from God, and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalts himſelf. As ſatan did: he was not willing to be in ſuch ſubjection; and therefore rebelled, and ſet up himſelf for God. So a natural man, in the proud and high thoughts he has of himſelf, ſets up himſelf upon God's throne. And he gives his heart to the world, worldly riches, and worldly pleaſures, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honors: they have the poſſeſſion of that regard which is due to God. The apoſtle ſums up all the idolatry of wicked men in their <hi>love of the world.</hi> "Love not the World, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Joh. ii. 15.16.</note> And the apoſtle <hi>James</hi> obſerves, that a man muſt neceſſarily be the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the true God, if he be a friend of the world. "Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

with God? Whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God. <note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. iv.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>All the ſin that men commit, is what they do in the ſervice of their idols: there is no one act of ſin, but what is an act of ſervice to ſome falſe God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wherein ſoever God oppoſes ſin in them, he is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to their worſhip of their idols: on which account they are enemies to God.</p>
                     <p>God oppoſes them in their ſervice of their idols, in the following reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. HE manifeſts his utter abhorrence of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their idols. Their idols are what they love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things: they would by no means part with them. This wickedneſs is <hi>ſweet</hi> unto them.<note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. iv.</note> If you take them away, what have they more? If they looſe their idols, they looſe their all. To rend away their idols from them, would be more grievous to them, than to rend body and ſoul aſunder: it is like rending their heart in twain. They love their idolatry; but God don't approve of it, but exceedingly hates it: he hates it implacably, and will by no means be reconciled to it; and therefore they hate him. God declares an infinite hatred of every act of ſin which they do; or every act that they do in the ſervice of their falſe gods. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oves of it in no part, but hates it all. He declares himſelf to be an holy God, and a jealous God; a God that is very jealous of his own honor; and that greatly abhors the giving that honor to another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. HE utterly forbids their cleaving to thoſe idols, and all the ſervice that they do to them. He not only ſhews that he diſlikes it, but he utterly forbids it; and demands that they ſhould worſhip him, and ſerve him only, and give their hearts wholly to him; without tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating any competitor. He allows them to ſerve their idols in no degree; but requires them to caſt them away <note n="*" place="bottom">Jov. xx. 12</note> 
                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:009961_0235_0F7B3E72CE5480B8"/>
utterly, and pay no more worſhip to them, at any time. He requires a <hi>final</hi> parting with their idols. Not only that they ſhould refrain from them for a while, but caſt them away forever; and never gratify their idolatrous reſpect to them any more. This is ſo exceeding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, and what they are ſo averſe to and ſo obſtinate in their refuſal of, that they are enemies to God for it. They can't endure God's commands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they forbid all that which their hearts are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in. And as they hate God's commands, ſo they hate Him whoſe commands they are.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. HE threatens them with everlaſting damnation for their ſervice of their idols. He threatens them for their paſt idolatry. He threatens them with his eternal wrath, for their having departed from him, and their having choſen to themſelves other gods. He threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them for that diſpoſition they have in their hearts to cleave to other gods: He threatens the <hi>leſt degrees</hi> of that reſpect which they have in their hearts to their idols. He manifeſts that he will not tolerate any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them, but has fixed eternal death, as the wages of every degree of it. And he won't releaſe them from their guilt; he holds them to their obligations; he won't acquit them at all: And he will accept of no atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they can make. He will not forgive them, whatever they do in religion; whatever pains they take; whatever tears they ſhed. He will accept of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or price that they have to offer.</p>
                     <p>And he threatens every future act of their idolatry. He not only forbids them ever to be guilty of the leaſt act, but forbids them on pain of eternal damnation. So ſtrictly does God prohibit them from the ſervice of their idols, that are ſo dear to them, that are their all, and which they would on no account part with. He threatens them with everlaſting wrath for all exerciſes of inordinate love of worldly profit: for all manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of inordinate regard to worldly pleaſures, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:009961_0236_0F7B3E7386381250"/>
honors. He threatens them with everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for their ſelf exaltation. He requires them to deny themſelves, and renounce themſelves, and to abaſe themſelves at his feet, on pain of bearing his wrath to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrictneſs of God's law is a principle cauſe of man's enmity againſt God. If God were a God that did not ſo much hate ſin: if he were one who would allow them in the gratification of their luſts, in ſome degree; and his threatnings were not ſo awful againſt all indulgence of their luſt: if his threatnings were not ſo abſolute; if his diſpleaſure could be appeaſed by a few tears, and little reformation, or the like; they would not be ſo great enemies, nor hate him ſo much as they do now. But God ſhews himſelf to be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy to their idols, to every degree of their ſervice of them; and has threaten'd everlaſting wrath, infinite calamity for all that they do in the ſervice of their luſts; and holds them bound under his wrath therefor. And this makes them irreconcilable enemies to him.</p>
                     <p>For this reaſon, the Scribes and Phariſees were ſuch bitter enemies to Chriſt; becauſe he ſhewed himſelf to be ſuch an enemy to their pride, and conceit of their own wiſdom, and their ſelf-righteouſneſs, and inordinate affectation of their own honor, which was their God. Natural men are enemies to God, becauſe he is ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to them, in that in which they place their all. If you go to take away that which is very dear to a man, nothing will provoke him more. God is infinitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to that in which natural men place all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and all their happineſs, viz. their gods. He is an enemy to that which natural men value as their greateſt honor and higheſt dignity; and which they truſt wholly to, that which is all their dependence, viz. their own righteouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="124" facs="unknown:009961_0237_0F7B3E7445DCCB20"/>Hence natural men are greater enemies to God, than they are to any other being. Some of their fellow-creatures may ſtand very much in their way, with regard to ſome things they ſet their hearts upon; but God op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them with reſpect to all their idols, and thoſe gods which are their all. And then God's oppoſition to their idols, which are above all things dear to them, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely great. None of our fellow-creatures ever oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us in any of our intereſts ſo much as God oppoſes wicked men in their idolatry: For God has an infinite oppoſition againſt it. His infinite oppoſition is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by his threatning an infinite puniſhment, viz. his dreadful wrath to all eternity, miſery without end. Hence we need not wonder that natural men are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſhewn, in ſome meaſure, why natural men are God's enemies; I proceed to the laſt thing propos'd.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. TO conſider and make anſwer to ſome objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſome may be ready to make againſt this.</p>
                     <p>Natural men don't generally conceive themſelves to be ſo bad: they han't this notion of themſelves, that they are enemies to God. And therefore when they hear ſuch doctrine as this taught them, they ſtand rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obj.</hi> I. SOME natural men may be ready to ſay, "I don't know that I feel any ſuch enmity in my heart againſt God, as is ſpoken of. I am not ſenſible that I am ſuch a dreadful enemy, ſo as to hate God, and to have a mortal enmity againſt him: and to have a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, if I could, to kill him. I feel no ſuch thing in myſelf, and why ſhould I think that I have ſuch a thing in me? If I have ſuch enmity, why don't I feel it? If I am a mortal enemy, why ſhould not I know it better than any body elſe? How can others
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:009961_0238_0F7B3E750999AFF8"/>
ſee what is in my heart, better than I myſelf? If I hate one of my fellow creatures, and have a ſpirit againſt him, I can feel it inwardly working." To ſuch an objection I would</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> I. If you do but obſerve yourſelf, and ſearch your own heart, unleſs you are ſtrangely blinded, you may be ſenſible of thoſe things, wherein enmity does fundamentally conſiſt. As particularly, you may be ſenſible that you have at leaſt had a low &amp; contemptible eſteem of God; and that you in your eſteem ſet the trifles and vanities of this world, far above him; ſo as to eſteem the enjoyment of theſe things far before the enjoyment of God, and to value theſe things better than his love. And you may be ſenſible that you deſpiſe the authority of God, and value his commands and his honor but very little. Or if by ſome means you have blinded yourſelf now, ſo as to think you do regard them now, doubtleſs you can look back and ſee that you have not regarded them. You may be ſenſible that you have had a diſreliſh and averſion towards God; an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit on to thinking of God, or to have any thing to do with him; ſo that it would have been a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable taſk to have been confined to it for any time; and that when the vanities of the world, at the ſame time, have been very pleaſing to you; and you have been all ſwallowed up in them, while you have been averſe to the things of religion.</p>
                     <p>If you look into your heart, it is there plain to be ſeen, that there is an enmity in your will, that your will is contrary to God's will; for you have been oppoſing the will of God all your life long. Theſe things are plain in natural men; 'tis nothing but ſome great delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that can hide them from you. And theſe things are the foundation of all enmity: if theſe things be in you, all the reſt that we have ſpoken of will follow of courſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:009961_0239_0F7B3E75CC9A93E8"/>2. ONE reaſon why you han't more ſenſibly felt the exerciſes of malice againſt God, is that your enmity is now exerciſed partly in your unbelief of God's being; and this prevents its appearing in other ways, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would. Man has naturally a principle of atheiſm in him; an indiſpoſition to realize God's being, and a diſpoſition to doubt of it. The being of God don't or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ſeem real to natural men. All the diſcoveries that there are of God's being, in his works, won't o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the principle of atheiſm, that is in the heart. And tho' they ſeem in ſome meaſure to be rationally convinced, yet it don't appear real; the conviction is faint, there is no ſtrong conviction impreſſed on the mind, that there is a God: and often times they are ready to think that there is none. Now this will prevent the exerciſe of this enmity, that otherwiſe would be felt; particularly, it may be an occaſion of there not being thoſe <hi>ſenſible</hi> exerciſes of hatred, that otherwiſe there would be.</p>
                     <p>It may in ſome meaſure be illuſtrated by this: If you had a rooted malice againſt another man, a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had been long eſtabliſhed there; if you ſhould hear that he was dead, and ſo ſhould conceive that he had no being, the ſenſible workings of your malice would not be felt, as when you realized it that he was alive, or that there was ſuch a perſon: and that altho' there be the ſame thing in the foundation, which would appear, if you ſhould afterwards hear the news contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and perceive that your enemy was ſtill alive; you would feel the ſame workings of hatred that you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And when you thought he was dead, you might feel the exerciſe of your enmity, in being glad of it. And thus your not realizing it, that God has a being, may prevent thoſe ſenſible workings of hatred, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you would have. If wicked men in this world were ſenſible of the reality of God's being, as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are in another, they would feel more of that hatred,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:009961_0240_0F7B3E77152F9198"/>
that men in another world do. The exerciſe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in one way, may, and often does prevent its work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other ways. As covetouſneſs may prevent the exerciſe of pride, ſo atheiſm may prevent malice; and yet it may be no argument of there being any the leſs of a principle of enmity in the heart; for 'tis the ſame enmity, working in another way. The ſame enmity that in this world works by atheiſm, will in another world, where there will be no room for atheiſm, work by malice and blaſphemy. The ſame mortal enmity that, if you ſaw there was a God, might make you to wiſh him dead, and to deſire, if it were poſſible, to kill him, may now diſpoſe and incline to think there is none. Men are very often apt to think things are ſo as they would have them to be. The ſame principle diſpoſes you to think God has no life, which, if you knew he had, would diſpoſe you, if it were poſſible to take it away.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. IF you think that there is a God, yet you don't realize it, that he is ſuch a God as he is. You don't realize it, that he is ſo holy a God as he is: You don't realize it, that he has ſuch an hatred of ſin as indeed he has. You don't realize it, that he is ſo juſt a God as he is, that will by no means clear the guilty. But that in the Pſalms is applicable to you: "Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence: thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. l. 21.</note> So that if you think there is a God, you don't think there is ſuch a God as there is. And your atheiſm appears in this, as well as in thinking there is no God. For that God that you think there is, is not that God that indeed is; but another, one of your own feigning, the fruit of your own vain, deluded imagination. So that your objection ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from this, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> you don't find ſuch a ſenſible hatred againſt that God which you have formed, to ſuit your ſelf; a God that you like better than the true God.
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:009961_0241_0F7B3E7742157668"/>
But this is no argument that you han't bitter enmity againſt the true God; for it was your enmity againſt the true God, and your not liking him, that has put you upon forming up another in your imagination, that you like better. It is your enmity againſt thoſe attributes of God's holineſs and juſtice, and the like, that has put you upon conceiting another, who is not ſo holy as he is, and don't hate ſin ſo much, and won't be ſo ſtrictly juſt in puniſhing it; and whoſe wrath againſt ſin is not ſo terrible.</p>
                     <p>But if you was ſenſible of the vanity of your own conceits, and that God was not ſuch an one as you have imagined; but that he is, as he is indeed, an infinitely holy, juſt, ſin hating &amp; ſin revenging God, who will not tolerate nor endure the worſhip of idols, you would be much more liable to feel the ſenſible exerciſes of enmity againſt him, than you are now. And this experience confirms. For we ſee that when men come to be under convictions, and to be made ſenſible that God is not as they have heretofore imagined; but that he is ſuch a jealous, ſin hating God, and whoſe wrath againſt ſin is ſo dreadful, they are much more apt to have ſenſible exerciſes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, than before.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. YOUR having always been taught that God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely above you, and out of your reach, has prevented your enmity's being exerciſed in thoſe ways, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would have been. You have always from your infancy been taught, that God is ſo high, that you can't hurt him; that notion has grown up with you. And hence you be not ſenſible, that you have any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to hurt him; becauſe it has been conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo impoſſible, that it has not come into your mind. And hence your enmity has not been exerciſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful thoughts; becauſe revenge has never found any room here; it has never found any handle to take hold of; there has been no conception of any ſuch thing, and hence it has lain ſtill. A ſerpent won't
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:009961_0242_0F7B3E783AECF218"/>
bite, or ſpit poiſon at that which it ſees at a great diſtance; which if it ſaw near, would do it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. Opportunity ſhews what men be often times, whether friends or enemies. Opportunity to do, puts men in mind of doing; wakens up ſuch principles as lay dormant before. Opportunity ſtirs up deſire to do, where there was before a diſpoſition, that without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity would have lain ſtill. If a man has had an old grudge againſt another, and has a fair opportunity to be revenged, this will revive his malice, and waken up a deſire of revenge.</p>
                     <p>If a great and ſovereign prince injures a poor man, and tho' what he does is looked upon very cruel, that won't ordinarily ſtir up that paſſionate revenge, as if he ſuſtain'd no bigger an injury from one of his equals, becauſe he is ſo much above him, and out of his reach. Many a man that has appeared calm and meek when he has had no power in his hands, and has not appeared, either to himſelf or others, to have any diſpoſition to theſe and thoſe cruel acts; that yet afterwards when he came to have opportunity by unexpected advancement, or otherwiſe, has appeared like a ravenous wolf, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring lion. So it was with <hi>Hazael.</hi> "And Hazael ſaid, Why weepeth my lord? And he anſwered, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Iſrael: their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, and their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child. And Hazael ſaid, But what, is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing! And Eliſha anſwered, The Lord hath ſhewed me that thou ſhalt be king over Syria."<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Kings viii. 12, 13.</note> Hazael was then a ſervant; he had no power in his hands to do as he pleaſed; and ſo that cruel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that was in him had lain hid, and he did not himſelf imagine that it was there: Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> afterwards, when he became king of Syria, and was abſolute, and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:009961_0243_0F7B3E78B7EB1BF8"/>
had none to controul him; then it broke out and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and he did as the prophet had foretold. He committed thoſe very acts of cruelty, that he thought it was not in his heart to do. And it was want of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that was the thing that made the difference. It was all in his heart before: he was ſuch a dog then as to do this thing, but only had not had opportunity. And therefore when he ſeems ſurprized that the prophet ſhould ſay ſo of him, all the reaſon the prophet gives is, "The Lord hath ſhewed me that thou ſhalt be king over Syria."</p>
                     <p>And ſome natural men are ſuch dogs as to do things, if they had opportunity, which they don't imagine it is in their hearts to do. You object againſt your having a <hi>mortal</hi> hatred againſt God; that you never felt any deſire to kill him. But one reaſon has been, that it has always been conceived ſo impoſſible by you, and you have been ſo ſenſible how much deſires would be in vain, that it has kept down ſuch a deſire. But if the life of God were within your reach, and you knew it, it would not be ſafe one hour. Who knows what thoughts would preſently ariſe in your heart by ſuch an opportunity, and what diſpoſition would be raiſed up in your heart! Who would truſt your heart, that there would not preſently be ſuch thoughts as theſe, tho' they are enough to make one tremble to mention them? "Now I have opportunity to ſet myſelf at liberty — that I need not be'kept in continual ſlavery by the ſtrict law of God.—Then I may take my liberty to walk in that way I like beſt, and need not be continually in ſuch ſlaviſh fear of God's diſpleaſure. And God has not done well by me, in many inſtances. He has done moſt unjuſtly by me, in holding me bound to deſtruction for unbelief, and other things which I can't help— He has ſhewn mercy to others, and refuſed it to me. I have now an opportunity to deliver my ſelf, and there can be no danger of my being hurt for it: God will not be

                     <p>Who would truſt your heart, that ſuch thoughts would not ariſe? And others, much more horrid? too dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be mention'd! and therefore I forbear. Thoſe natural men are fooliſhly inſenſible of what is in their own hearts, who think there would be no danger of any ſuch workings of heart, if they knew they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. YOU little conſider, how much your having no more of the ſenſible exerciſes of hatred to God, is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a being reſtrained by fear. You have always been taught what a dreadful thing it is to hate God. And you have been taught what a dreadful Being GOD is, and how terrrible God's diſpleaſure is; that God ſees the heart and knows all the thoughts; and that you are in his hands, and he can make you as miſerable as he pleaſes, and as ſoon as he pleaſes. And theſe things have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained you: and the fear that has riſen from theſe things, has kept you from appearing what you be; it has kept down your enmity, and made that ſerpent afraid to ſhew it's head, as otherwiſe it would do. If a man were wholly under the power of an enemy, tho' he were never ſo much of an enemy to him, he would be afraid to exerciſe his hatred in outward acts, unleſs it was with great diſguiſe. And if it be ſuppoſed that ſuch an enemy, in whoſe power he was, could ſee his heart, and know all his thoughts; and apprehended that he would put him to a terrible death, if he ſaw the workings of malice there, how greatly would this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain! He would be afraid ſo much as to believe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he hated his enemy: But there would be all manner of ſmothering, diſguiſe and hypocriſy, and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even of thoughts and affections.</p>
                     <p>Thus your enmity has been kept under reſtraint; and thus it has been from your infancy. You have grown

up in it, ſo that it is become an habitual reſtraint. You dare not ſo much as think you hate God. If you do exerciſe hatred, you have a diſguiſe for it, whereby you endeavour even to hide it from your own conſcience; and ſo have all along deceived your ſelf. And your deceit is very old and habitual: And hence you are ſo difficultly convinced. But this has been only reſtraint: it has been no mortification. But there has been an enmity againſt God in its full ſtrength. It has been only reſtrained, like an enemy that durſt not riſe up and ſhew himſelf.</p>

                     <p>The objection now under conſideration is, that many natural men may make from their not being <hi>ſenſible</hi> that they are God's enemies, whence they conclude, that they have no enmity againſt God. <note n="†" place="bottom">See the objection ſtated at large, p. 124.</note>

                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> 6. One reaſon why you have not felt more ſenſible hatred to God may be becauſe you have not had much trial of what is in your heart. It may be God has hitherto in a great meaſure let you alone. The enmity that is in men's hearts againſt God, is like a ſerpent, which if it be let alone lies ſtill; but if any body diſturbs it, will ſoon hiſs, and be enraged, and ſhew its ſerpentine ſpiteful nature.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="unknown:009961_0247_0F7B3E80146F1FF8"/>Notwithſtanding the good opinion you have of your ſelf, yet a little trial would ſhew you to be a viper, and your heart would be ſet all on a rage againſt God. One thing that reſtrains you now is your <hi>hope.</hi> You hope to receive many things from God. Your own intereſt is concerned; you hope to make great gains of God. So that both hope and fear operate together, to reſtrain your enmity from ſuch ſenſible exerciſes, as otherwiſe would be. But if once hope was gone, you would ſoon ſhew what you was: you would ſoon feel your enmity againſt God in a rage.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. IF you pretend that you do not feel enmity againſt God, and yet act as an enemy, you may certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is not becauſe you are no enemy; but becauſe you do not know your own heart. Actions are the beſt interpreter of the diſpoſition: They ſhew better than any thing elſe, what the heart is. It muſt be becauſe you do not obſerve your own beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that you queſtion whether you are an enemy to God.</p>
                     <p>What other account can you give of your own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but only your being God's enemy? What other account can be given of your ſo oppoſing God in your ways; walking ſo exceeding contrary to him, contrary to his counſels, contrary to his commands, and contrary to his glory? What other account can be given of your caſting ſo much contempt upon God; your ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo low; your acting ſo much againſt his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and againſt his kingdom and intereſt in the world? What other account can be given of your ſo ſetting your will in oppoſition to God's will, and that ſo obſtinately, for ſo long a time, againſt ſo many warnings as you have had?

If he ſhould be ſeen to behave thus from time to time, and that it was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant manner, none would want any better evidence that he was an enemy to his neighbour. If you your ſelf had a ſervant that carried it towards you, as you do towards God, you would not think there was need of any greater evidence of his being your enemy. If your ſervant ſhould manifeſt ſo much contempt of you; ſhould diſregard your commands as much as you do the commands of God; and ſhould go ſo directly contrary, ſhould in ſo many ways act the very reverſe of your commands; and ſhould ſeem ſo ſet himſelf in ways that were contrary to your will ſo obſtinately and incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly, without any amendment from your repeated calls and warnings and threatnings; and ſhould act ſo croſs to you day and night, as you do to God; when you ſought one thing, he would ſeek the contrary; when you did any work, he would, as much as in him lay, undo and deſtroy your work; and ſhould continually drive at ſuch ends, as tended to overthrow the ends you aimed at: when you ſought to bring to paſs any deſign, he would endeavour to overthrow your deſign; and ſhould ſet himſelf as much againſt your intereſt, as you do your ſelf againſt God's honor. And you ſhould moreover ſee him from time to time with others that were your declared mortal enemies; and making them his counſellors, ſo much as you do the devils, God's declared mortal enemies: and hearkening to their counſels, as much as you do to ſatan's temptations: Should you not think you had ſufficient evidence that he was your enemy indeed?</p>

                        </gap>s many to think that they are far from being ſuch enemies to God. They carry it reſpectfully towards God: they pray to him in ſecret, and do it in as hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a manner as they are able. They attend on public worſhip, &amp; take a great deal of pains to do it in a decent manner. It ſeems to them that they ſhew God a great deal of reſpect: they uſe many very reſpectful terms in their prayer: they give him all the honor they can: they are reſpectful in their manner of ſpeaking, and in their voice, and their geſtures, and the like.</p>
                     <p>But to this, I</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That all this is done in meer hypocriſy. All this ſeeming reſpect is feigned there is no ſincerity in it: there is external reſpect, but no reſpect in the heart: there is a ſhew, and nothing elſe. You only cover your enmity with a painted vail. You put on the diſguiſe of a friend, but in your heart you are a mortal enemy for all that. There is external honor, but inward contempt: There is a ſhew of friendſhip and regard, but inward hatred. You do but deceive yourſelf with your ſhew of reſpect; and endeavour to deceive God: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that God looks not on the outward appearance, but that he looks on the heart.</p>
                     <p>Here conſider particularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. THAT much of that ſeeming reſpect which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men ſhew to God, is owing to their education. They have been taught from their infancy that they ought to ſhew great reſpect to God. They have been taught to uſe reſpectful language, when ſpeaking about God, and to behave with ſolemnity, when attending on thoſe exerciſes of religion, wherein they have to do with God. They from their childhood have ſeen that
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:009961_0250_0F7B3E81C56DC928"/>
this is the manner of others, when they pray to God, to uſe reverential expreſſions, and a reverential behaviour before him. And their ſhew of reſpect, which they make to God, is owing in a great meaſure to this.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who are brought up in places where they have commonly from their infancy, heard men take the name of God in vain, and ſwear and curſe, and blaſpheme; they learn to do the ſame; and it becomes habitual to them ſo to do. And it is the ſame way, &amp; no other, that you have learned to behave reſpectfully towards God; not that you have any more reſpect to God than they: but they have been brought up one way, and you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In ſome parts of the world, men are brought up in the worſhip of idols of ſilver, and gold, and wood, and ſtone, made in the ſhape of men and beaſts. "They ſay of them, Let the men that ſacrifice, kiſs the calf."<note n="*" place="bottom">

                           </gap> xiii. 2.</note> In ſome parts of the world, they are brought up to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſerpents, and are taught from their infancy to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it with great reſpect to them. And in ſome places, they are brought up in worſhiping the devil, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them in a bodily ſhape; and to behave with a ſhew of great reverence and honor towards him. And what reſpect you ſhew to God has no better foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it comes the ſame way, and is worth no more.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. THAT ſhew of reſpect which you make is <hi>forced.</hi> You come to God, and make a great ſhew of reſpect to him, and uſe very reſpectful terms, with a reſpectful, reverential tone and manner of ſpeaking; and your countenance is grave and ſolemn; and you put on an humble aſpect; and you kneel, and uſe humble, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectful poſtures, out of fear. You are afraid that God will execute his wrath upon you; and ſo you feign a great deal of reſpect, that he may not be angry with you. "Through the greatneſs of thy power ſhall thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſubmit themſelves unto thee."<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. lxvi. 3.</note> In the original it is, "ſhall thine enemies lie to thee." It is render'd therefore
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:009961_0251_0F7B3E8281443800"/>
in the margin, "ſhall yield feigned obedience to thee." Al that you do in religion is forc'd and feign'd. Thro' the greatneſs of God's power, you yield feigned obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. You are in God's power, and he is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you; and ſo you feign a great deal of reſpect to him, that he might not deſtroy you. As one might do towards an enemy that had taken him captive, though he at the ſame time would gladly make his eſcape, if he could, by taking away the life of him who had taken him captive.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. IT is not real reſpect that moves you to behave ſo towards God: you do it becauſe you hope you ſhall get by it. 'Tis reſpect to yourſelf, and not reſpect to God, that moves you. You hope to move God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the rewards of his children, by it. You are like the Jews who followed Chriſt, and called him <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and would make him a king. Not that they honored him ſo much in their hearts, as to think him worthy of the honor of a king; or that they had the reſpect of ſincere ſubjects; but they did it for the ſake of the loaves. "Jeſus perceived that they would come and make him a king. And when they had found him on the other ſide of the ſea, they ſaid unto him, Rabbi, how cameſt thou hither? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, Ye ſeek me, not becauſe you ſaw the miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled." <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. vi 15 25, 26.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe things don't argue but that you are implacable enemies to God notwithſtanding. If you examine your prayers and other duties, your own conſciences will tell you, that the ſeeming reſpect which you have ſhewn to God in them, has been only in hypocriſy. That often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you have ſet forth in your prayers, that God was a great God, and a glorious God, and an infinitely holy God, as if you greatly honor'd him on the account of theſe attributes; and you, at the ſame time, had no
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:009961_0252_0F7B3E835974EC08"/>
ſenſe in your heart of the greatneſs and gloriouſneſs of God, or of any excellency in his holineſs. And ſo your own conſciences will tell you, that you have often pretended to be thankful; you have told God, that you thank'd him that you was alive, and thank'd him for theſe and thoſe mercies, when you have not found the leaſt jot of thankfulneſs in your heart. And ſo you have told God of your own unworthineſs, and ſet forth what a vile creature you was; when you have had no humble ſenſe of your own unworthineſs.</p>
                     <p>And if theſe forementioned reſtraints were thrown off, you would ſoon throw off all your ſhew of reſpect. Take away fear, and take away a regard to your own intereſt, and there would ſoon be an end to all thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of love, honor, and reverence, which now you make. All theſe things are not at all inconſiſtent with the moſt implacable enmity.</p>
                     <p>The devil himſelf made a ſhew of reſpect to Chriſt, when he was afraid that he was going to torment him; and when he hoped to perſwade Chriſt to ſpare him lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. "When he ſaw Jeſus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice ſaid, What have I to do with thee, Jeſus, thou ſon of God moſt high?

SOME may perhaps object againſt this doctrine of their being God's enemies, <hi>the religious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> they have ſometimes experienced.

If you have wept before God, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of your own pitiful caſe; that has been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you loved your ſelf, and not becauſe you had any reſpect to God. And if your tears have been from ſorrow for your ſins; you have mourned for your ſins, becauſe you have ſinned againſt your ſelf, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have ſinned againſt God.

                     <p n="2">2. PRIDE, and a good thought of themſelves, very commonly has a great hand in the affections of natural men. They have a good opinion of what they are doing when they are praying; and the reflection on that affects them: they are affected with their own goodneſs. Men's ſelf-righteouſneſs often occaſions tears. An high opinion of themſelves before God, and an imagination of their being perſons of great account with him, has affected them, in their tranſactions with God.</p>
                     <p>There is commonly abundance of pride in the midſt of tears; and pride is in a great meaſure the ſcource of them. And then they are ſo far from being an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you be not an enemy to God, that on the contrary, they are an argument, that you be. In your very tears, you are, in a vain conceit of yourſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting your ſelf againſt God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. THE affections of natural men do often ariſe from wrong conceits that they have of God. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of God after the manner they do of men, as tho' he were a being liable to be wrought upon in his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They conceive of him as one whoſe heart could be drawn, whoſe affections can be overcome, by what he ſees in them. They conceive of him as being taken with them, and their performances; and this works on their affections; and thus one tear draws another, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:009961_0254_0F7B3E84C576E530"/>
their affections increaſe by reflection. And oftentimes they conceive of God as one that loves them, and is a friend to them: and ſuch a miſtake may work much on their affections. But ſuch affections that ariſe towards God, as they conceit him to be, is no argument that they have not the ſame implacable hatred towards God, conſidered as he really is. There is no concluding that men are not enemies, becauſe they are affected and ſhed tears in their prayers, and the like. <hi>Saul</hi> was very much affected when <hi>David</hi> expoſtulated with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout purſuing after him, and ſeeking to kill him. <hi>David</hi>'s words wrought exceedingly upon <hi>Saul</hi>'s af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

whatſoever againſt him that is hated. Nothing is too bad for hatred, if it be meer hatred, and no love; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too bad for that to do towards the object of it. Hatred ſhews no kindneſs either in doing, or forbearing. Only hatred will never make a man forbear to act any thing whatſoever againſt God; for the very nature of hatred is to ſeek evil. But wicked men, as has been ſhewn, are meer enemies to God. They have hatred, without any love at all. And hence natural men have nothing within them, in their own nature, to reſtrain them from any thing that is bad, be it never ſo bad: and therefore their reſtraint muſt not be owing to nature, but to reſtraining grace. And therefore whatever wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs we have been kept from, it is not becauſe we have not been bad enough to commit it; but it is God has reſtrained us, and kept us back from ſin. There can be no worſe principle, than a principle of hatred to God. The devils in hell don't do any thing from any worſe principle than this. And there can be no principle that will go further in wickedneſs than this, if it be neither mortified nor reſtrained. But it is not mortified in natural men; and therefore all that keeps them from any degree of wickedneſs, is reſtrained. If we have ſeen others do things that we never did; and if they have done worſe than we, this is owing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace. If we have not done as bad as <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> it is owing to divine reſtraints. If we have not done as bad as <hi>Judas,</hi> or as the Scribes and Phariſees, or as bad as <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> it is becauſe God has reſtrained our corruption. If we have ever heard or read of any that have done worſe than we; if we have not gone the length in ſinning, that the moſt wicked pirates or carnal perſecutors have gone, this is owing to reſtraining grace. For we are all naturally the enemies of God as much as they. If we have not committed the unpardonable ſin, it is owing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace. There is no worſe principle in exerciſe
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:009961_0256_0F7B3E87ABFE8320"/>
in that ſin, than enmity againſt God. There is the entire fountain, and all the foundation of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, in that enmity againſt God, that we all have in us, and naturally reigns in us.</p>
                     <p>It is not we our ſelves that reſtrain our ſelves from the commiſſion of the greateſt imaginable wickedneſs; for enmity againſt God reigns in us and over us; we are under the power and dominion of it, and are ſold under it. We do not reſtrain that which reigns over us. A ſlave, as long as he continues a meer ſlave, cannot controul his maſter. "He that committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin. <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. viii. 34.</note> So that the reſtraint of this our cruel tyrant, is owing to God, and not to us. What does a poor, impotent ſubject do to reſtrain the abſolute Lord, that has him wholly under his power?</p>
                     <p>How much will it appear that the world is indebted to the reſtraining grace of God, if we conſider that the world is full of enemies to God. The world is full of inhabitants; and almoſt all are God's enemies, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and mortal enemies. What therefore would they not do; what work would they not make, if God did not reſtrain them?</p>
                     <p>GOD's work in the reſtraint that he exerciſes over a wicked world, is a glorious work. God's holding the reins upon the corruptions of a wicked world, and ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bounds to their wickedneſs, is a more glorious work, than his ruling the raging of the ſea, and ſetting bounds to its proud waves, and ſaying, hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further. In hell, God lets the wickedneſs of wicked ſpirits have the reins, to rage without reſtraint; and it would be in a great meaſure upon earth as it in hell, did not God reſtrain the wickedneſs of the world.</p>
                     <p>But in order to the better underſtanding how it is owing to the reſtraining grace of God, that we are kept
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:009961_0257_0F7B3E88AFA910A8"/>
and with-held from the higheſt acts of ſin, I would here obſerve ſeveral things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. WHENEVER men are with held from ſinning by the common influence of God's ſpirit, they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by reſtraining grace. If ſinners are awakened ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and are made ſenſible of the great guilt that ſin brings, and that it expoſes to a dreadful puniſhment; they under ſuch circumſtances dare not allow themſelves in wilful ſin: God reſtrains them <hi>by the convictions of his</hi> ſpirit; and therein their being kept from ſin, is owing to reſtraining grace. And ſinners that live under the goſpel, that are not awakened ſinners, but in a great meaſure ſecure, yet commonly have ſome degrees of the influence of God's ſpirit with his ordinances influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing natural conſcience. And tho' they be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient thoroughly to rouſe them out of ſecurity, or make them reform; yet they keep them from going ſuch lengths in ſin, as otherwiſe they might do. And when it is thus, this is reſtraining grace. They are very ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and ſottiſh; yet they would be a great deal more ſo, if God ſhould let them wholly alone.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. ALL the reſtraints that men are under from the word and ordinances, is from reſtraining grace. The word and ordinances of God might have ſome degree of influence on men's natural principles of ſelf-love, to reſtrain them from ſin, without any degree of the influence of God's ſpirit: But this would be the reſtraining grace of God; for God's goodneſs and mercy to a ſinful world, appears in his giving his word to be a reſtraint on the wickedneſs of the world. When men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by fear of thoſe puniſhments that the word of God threatens; or by the warnings of the word, or by the offers and promiſes of it; when the word of God works upon hope, or upon fear, or natural conſcience, to reſtrain men from ſin, this is the reſtraining grace of God. When we are reſtrained thus, 'tis owing to the mercy of God that we are reſtrained. 'Tis an inſtance
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:009961_0258_0F7B3E89743572B0"/>
of God's mercy that he has revealed hell, to reſtrain men's wickedneſs; and that he has revealed a way of ſalvation, and a poſſibility of eternal life. This is a thing that has great influence on men, to reſtrain them from ſin; and this is the reſtraining grace of God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. WHEN men are reſtrained from ſin, by the light of nature, this alſo is reſtraining grace. If men are deſtitute of the light of God's word, yet the light of natural conſcience teaches that ſin brings guilt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to puniſhment. The light of nature teaches that there is a God who governs the world, and will reward the good and puniſh the evil. When men are reſtrain'd by this, they are to attribute their reſtraints to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining grace of God; for it is God who is the author of the light of nature, as well as the light of revelation. He in mercy to mankind, makes known many things by natural light to work upon men's fear and ſelf love, to reſtrain their corruptions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. WHEN God reſtrains men's corruptions by his providence, this is reſtraining grace. And that whether it be his general providence, or his providence in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of mankind; or his particular providence, or providential diſpoſals towards them in particular.</p>
                     <p n="1">(1.) GOD doth greatly reſtrain the corruption of the world, by ordering the ſtate of mankind. He has ſet mankind here in a mortal ſtate, &amp; that is a great reſtraint on their corruption. He hath ſet mankind in a ſtate of probation for eternity, &amp; that is a great reſtraint to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God hath ſo ordered the ſtate of mankind, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily many kinds of ſin &amp; wickedneſs are diſgraceful, and what tend to the hurt of a man's character and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation amongſt his fellow men; and that is a great reſtraint. He hath ſo diſpoſed the world, that many kinds of wickedneſs are many ways very contrary to men's temporal intereſt; and that is a great reſtraint. God has ſo diſpoſed the ſtate of mankind that they are led to prohibit many kinds of wickedneſs by human
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:009961_0259_0F7B3E8A06626640"/>
laws; and that is a great reſtraint. God hath ſet up a church i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he world, made up of thoſe who, if they are anſwerable to their profeſſion, have the fear and love of God in their hearts; and they by holding forth light and the word of God, and keeping up the ordinances of God in the world, and by warning others, are a great reſtraint to the wickedneſs of the world.</p>
                     <p>But in all theſe things, the reſtraining grace of God appears. It is God's mercy to mankind, that he has ſo ordered their ſtate, that they ſhould have ſo many things, by fear and a regard to their own intereſt, to reſtrain their corruptions. It is God's mercy to the world, that the ſtate of mankind here, does ſo differ in that reſpect, from the ſtate of the damned in hell; where men will have none of theſe things to reſtrain them: they won't be in ſuch circumſtances that will ſo influence their hope and fear, to reſtrain them from ſin.</p>
                     <p>The wiſdom of God, as well as the attributes of God's grace, greatly appears in thus diſpoſing things for the reſtraining of the wickedneſs of men.</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) GOD doth greatl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> reſtrain the corruptions of men by his particular providence, or providence towards particular perſons; by placing men in ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as to lay them under reſtraints. And to this it is often owing that ſome natural men never go ſuch lengths in ſinning, or are never guilty of ſuch atrocious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as ſome others, that providence has placed them in different circumſtances. If it were not for this, many thouſands of natural men, who now live ſober and orderly lives, would do as <hi>Pharoah</hi> did. The reaſon why they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o not, is, that providence has placed them in different circumſtances. If they were in the ſame circumſtances as <hi>Pharoah</hi> was in, they would do as he did And ſo, if in the ſame circumſtances as <hi>Manaſſah</hi>—as <hi>Judas</hi>—as <hi>Nero</hi>— But provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſtrains their corruptions, by putting them in ſuch circumſtances, as not to open ſuch a door or outlet for
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:009961_0260_0F7B3E8AC89A7BF0"/>
their corruption, as he did to them. So ſome do not do ſuch horrid things as others, they do not live ſuch horribly vicious lives as ſome others, becauſe providence has reſtrained them by ordering that they ſhould have a better education than others. Providence has order'd that they ſhould be the children of pious parents, it may be, or ſhould live where they ſhould enjoy many means of grace; and ſo providence has laid them under reſtraints. Now this is reſtraining grace. The attribute of God's grace is exerciſed in thus reſtraining perſons in providence.</p>
                     <p>And oftentimes God reſtrains men's corruptions by particular events of providence. By particular afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are brought under, or by particular occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby God does, as it were, block up men's way in their courſe of ſin, or in ſome wickedneſs that they had deviſed, and that otherwiſe they would perpetrate. Or ſomething happens unexpected to hold men back from that which they were about to commit. When men are reſtrained thus, it is God that reſtrains them. Thus God reſtrained <hi>David</hi> by his providence from ſheding blood, as he intended to do. "Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy ſoul liveth, ſeeing the LORD hath <hi>witholden thee</hi> from coming to ſhed blood, and from avenging thy ſelf with thine own hand—"<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam xxv. 26.</note> God witheld him from it no otherwiſe, than by ordering it ſo in his providence that <hi>Abigail</hi> ſhould come, and by her wiſdom ſhould cool and pacify him, and perſwade him to alter his purpoſe<note n="†" place="bottom">See ver. 32, 33, 34.</note>.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. GODLY perſons are greatly indebted to reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, in keeping them from dreadful acts of ſin. So it was in that inſtance of <hi>David,</hi> that has been juſt mentioned. Godly perſons when God has left, and has not reſtrained them, have fallen into drea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ful acts of ſin. So did <hi>David,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Uriah.—Lot—
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:009961_0261_0F7B3E8BB000BDF8"/>
Peter</hi>— And when other godly perſons are kept from falling into ſuch ſins, or much worſe ſins than theſe, it is owing to the reſtraining grace of God. Meerly having a principle of grace in their hearts, or meerly their being godly perſons, without God's preſence to reſtrain them, will not keep them from great acts of ſin. That the godly do not fall into the moſt horrid ſins that can be conceived of, is owing not ſo much to any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence between their falling into ſuch ſins, and the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a principle of grace in the heart, as it is owing to the covenant mercy of God, whereby he has promiſed never to leave nor forſake his people; and that he will not ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able; but with the temptation will make a way for them to eſcape. If ſaving grace reſtrains men from great acts of ſin, this is owing to God who gives ſuch exerciſes of grace at that time when the temptation comes, that they are reſtrained.</p>
                     <p>Let not the godly therefore be inſenſible of their indebtedneſs to the reſtraining grace of God Tho' the godly cannot be ſaid to be enemies to God, becauſe a principle of enmity does not reign; yet they have the very ſame principle and ſeed of enmity in them, tho' it be mortified. Tho' it be not in reigning power, yet it has great ſtrength; and is too ſtrong for them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God's almighty power to help them againſt it. Tho' they be not enemies to God, becauſe they have another principle, beſides a principle of enmity, viz. a principle of love; yet their old man, the body of ſin and death that yet remains in them, is a mortal enemy to God. Corruption in the godly, is not a whit better than it is in the wicked. The corruption in them is of as bad a nature every whit, as that which is in a mortal enemy to God: it aims at the life of God, where ever it is. And tho' it be not in reigning power; yet it would dreadfully rage, were it not for God's reſtraining grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="unknown:009961_0262_0F7B3E8C47FFC290"/>GOD gives his reſtraining grace to both natural men and godly men; but only there is this difference. God gives his reſtraining grace to his children in way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant mercy: 'tis part of the mercy promiſed to them in his covenant. God is faithful, and will not leave them to ſin in like manner as wicked men do; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would do every whit as bad.</p>
                     <p>Let not therefore the godly attribute it to themſelves, or meerly to their own goodneſs, that they be not guilty of ſuch horrid crimes as they hear of in others: let them conſider 'tis not owing to them, but to God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints.</p>
                     <p>Thus all both godly and ungodly, may learn from this doctrine, their great indebtedneſs to the reſtraining grace of God.</p>

"Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life." <note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. v. 40.</note> When we ſay that natural men be not willing to come to Chriſt, it is not meant that they are not willing to be delivered from hell; for without do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t cloſe with Chriſt, but are averſe to him. They ſee nothing in Chriſt wherefore they ſhould deſire him; no beauty or comelineſs to draw or incline their hearts to him. And they are not willing to take Chriſt as he is; they would feign divide Chriſt. There are ſome things in him that they like, and others that they greatly diſlike; but conſider him as he is, and as he is offered to them in the goſpel, and they will not have him. They are not willing to accept of Chriſt as he is offered; for in doing ſo, they muſt of neceſſity part with all their ſins; they muſt ſell the world, and part with their own righteouſneſs But they are not willing to do that; they had rather, for the preſent, run the venture of going to hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> than do that.</p>
                     <p>When men are truly willing to come to Chriſt, they are <hi>freely</hi> willing. It is not what they are <hi>forced</hi> and drove to by threatnings; but they are willing to come, and chooſe to come without being driven. But natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men have no ſuch free willingneſs; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary have an averſion. And the ground of it is that which we have heard, viz. That they are enemies to God. Their having ſuch a reigning enmity againſt God, makes them obſtinately refuſe to come to Chriſt. If a man is an enemy to God, he will neceſſarily be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Chriſt too; for Chriſt is the Son of God; he is infinitely near to God, yea he is God. He has the nature of God, as well as the nature of man. He is a ſaviour appointed of God. God anointed him, and ſent him into the world. And in doing what he did in the work of redemption, he wrought the works of God He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did thoſe things that pleaſed God; and all that he does as a ſaviour, is to the glory of God. And one great thing that he aimed at in his redemption, was to deliver them from their idols which they had choſen, and bring them to God. The c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:009961_0265_0F7B3E8E9C329CD8"/>
coming to Chriſt; for Chriſt is of God, and as a ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſeeks to bring them to God only: But natural men are not of God, but are averſe to him.</p>
                     <p>INF. III. FROM this doctrine we may learn, how dreadful the condition of natural men is. Their ſtate is a ſtate of enmity with God. If we conſider what God is, and what men are, it will be eaſy for us to conclude that ſuch men as are God's enemies, muſt be miſerable. Conſider, ye that are enemies to God, how great a God he is that you are enemies to. He is the eternal God; the God that fills heaven and earth, and whom the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of heavens cannot contain. He is the God that made you; the God in whoſe hand your breath is, and whoſe are all your ways; the God in whom you live and move, and have your being; the God who has your ſoul and body in his hands every moment.</p>
                     <p>You would look on yourſelf as in very unhappy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, if your neighbours were all your enemies, and none of your fellow creatures were your friends. If every body was ſet againſt you, and all deſpiſed and hated you, you would be ready to think, you had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be out of the world than in it. But if it be ſuch a calamity to have enmity maintained between you and your fellow creatures, what is it, when you and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God are enemies one to another? What avails either the friendſhip or enmity of you neighbours, poor little worms of the duſt, that are about you, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the friendſhip or enmity of the great God of heaven and earth? Conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. IF you continue in your enmity a little longer, there will be a mutual enmity between God and you to all eternity. God will appear to be your dreadful &amp; irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable enemy. And you know not how ſoon it will come to this. If you ſhould die an enemy to God, there will be no ſuch thing as any reconciliation after death. God will then appear in hatred of you. As
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:009961_0266_0F7B3E8F39B7CD78"/>
you are a meer enemy to God, ſo God will then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a meer enemy to you; he will appear in perfect hatred, without any love, and without any pity, and without any mercy at all. As you hate God, he will hate you. And that will be verified of you: "My ſoul loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and their ſoul abhored me."<note n="†" place="bottom">Zech. xi. 8.</note> And then God will be your enemy forever. If you be not reconciled ſo as to become his friend in this life, God never will become your friend after death. If you continue an enemy to God 'till death, God will continue an enemy to you to all eternity. There will nothing avail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God to you hereafter. You will find that you can't move the heart of God by any of your cries. You will have no mediator offered you; there will be no days man betwixt you. So that it becomes you to conſider what it will be to have God your enemy to all eternity, without any poſſibility of being reconciled.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, what will it be to have this enmity to be mutual, or maintain'd for ever on both ſides? For as God will for ever continue an enemy to you, ſo you will for ever continue an enemy to God. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue God's enemy until death, you will always be his enemy. And after death your enmity will have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but it will break out and rage without controul. When you come to be a fire-brand of hell, you will be a fire-brand in two reſpects, viz. As you will be all on fire full of the fire of God's wrath: and alſo as you will be all on a blaze with ſpite &amp; malice toward God. You will be as full of the fire of malice, as you will with the fire of divine vengeance, &amp; both will make you full of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then you will appear as you be, a viper indeed. You are now a viper; but under great diſguiſe; a wolf in ſheep's cloathing: But then your maſk will be pulled off; you ſhall looſe your garments, and walk naked.<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 15.</note> Then will you as a ſerpent ſpit poiſon at God, and vent your rage and malice in fearful blaſphemies.

That ſame tongue, to cool which you will wiſh for a drop of water, will be eternally employed in curſing and blaſpheming God and Chriſt. And that not from any new corruption being put into your heart; but only from God's withdrawing his hand from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining your old corruption. And what a miſerable way will this be of ſpending your eternity!</p>
                     <p n="2">(2) Conſider, What will be the conſequence of a mutual enmity between God and you, if it be continued. Now you find your ſelf left alone; you find no very terrible event: but there will be great changes. Tho' hitherto you have met with no very great changes, yet they will come. After a little while, dying time will come; and then what will be the conſequence of this enmity? God, whoſe enemy you be; has the frame of your body in his hands.

Will not you then ſtand in need of God's help? Would not he be the beſt friend in ſuch a caſe, worth more than ten thouſand earthly friends? If God be your enemy, then who will you betake your ſelf to for a friend?

                     <p>The time is coming when the frame of this world ſhall be diſſolved Chriſt ſhall deſcend in the clouds of heaven, in the glory of his Father; and you, with all the reſt of mankind, muſt ſtand before the judgment ſeat of God.

And what will be the event of God's being your enemy then? Now, it may be, it does not appear to be very terrible to you to have God for your enemy; but when ſuch changes as theſe are brought to paſs, it will greatly alter the appearance of things. Then God's favour will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you of infinite worth.

                     </p>
                     <p>And if you endeavour to ſupport yourſelf under God's wrath, can't God lay ſo much upon you as to ſink and cruſh you? Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why ſhould a little worm think of ſupporting himſelf againſt an omnipotent adverſary? Has not he that made you, and gave you your ſtrength and your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, got your ſtrength and courage in his hands? Is it an hard thing for him to overcome it? Conſider God has made your ſoul; and he that made it. knows how to puniſh it, to what degree he will. He can fill it with miſery; he can bring what degree of ſorrow, and anguiſh, and horror he will. And he that made your body, can bring what torments he will upon it. He has made every vein and ſinew: and has every one in his hands, and he can fill every one as full of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he will. God who made you, has given you a capacity to bear torment; and he has that capacity in his hands; and he can enlarge it, and make you capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of more miſery, as much more as he will. If God hates any one, and ſets himſelf againſt him as his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, what cannot he do with him? How dreadful muſt it be to fall into the hands of ſuch an enemy! Surely,

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. IF God be your meer enemy, you may rationally conclude that he will act as ſuch in his dealings with you. We have already obſerved that you are a mere enemy to God; that is, have enmity without any love or true reſpect. So, if you continue to be ſo, God will appear to be your meer enemy; and will be ſo forever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being reconciled. But if it be ſo, he will doubtleſs act as ſuch. If he eternally hates you, he will act in his dealings with you, as one that hates you with meer hatred, without any love or pity. The proper tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and aim of hatred is the miſery of the object hated; miſery, and nothing elſe. So that you may expect God will make you miſerable, and that you will not be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for ſparing is not the effect of hatred, but of pity and mercy; which is a quite different thing from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                     <p>NOW God does not act as your meer enemy: If he corrects you, it is in meaſure. He now exerciſes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of mercy to you. He threatens you now; but it is in a way of warning, and ſo in a merciful way. He now calls and invites, and ſtrives with you, and waits to be gracious to you. But hereafter there will be an end to all theſe things: In another world God will ceaſe to ſhew you mercy.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. IF you will continue God's enemy, you may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude that God will deal with you ſo as to make it appear how dreadful it is to have God for an enemy. It is very dreadful to have a mighty prince for an enemy. "The wrath of a king, is as the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a lion." <note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. xix. 12.</note> But if the wrath of man, a fellow-worm, be ſo terrible, what is the wrath of God!

God, and have him for an enemy to you. God will doubtleſs glorify himſelf as an enemy, in his dealings with thoſe to whom he is an enemy. That is, he will act ſo as to glorify thoſe attributes which he exerciſes as an enemy; which are his majeſty, his power and juſtice. God will deal ſo with you as to glorify theſe attributes in your deſtruction. His great majeſty, his awful juſtice, and mighty power, ſhall be ſhewed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you.

ſurely reward them as they deſerve. "He will render vengeance to his enemies, and reward them that hate him." i. e. He will render their full reward; he won't fail or come ſhort. As in the forementioned place it was ſaid, he would not be ſlack in this matter. "I will make mine arrows drunk with blood.' This ſignifies the greatneſs of the deſtruction. It ſhall not be a little of their blood that ſhall ſatisfy; but his arrows ſhall be glutted with their blood "And his ſword ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour fleſh." That is, it ſhall make dreadful waſte of it. Hereby is very livelily ſet forth the terrible manner in which God will one day riſe up and execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on his enemies.</p>
                     <p>Again, the totalneſs and perfection of their deſtruction is repreſented in the following words: "The wicked ſhall periſh, the enemies of the Lord ſhall be as the fat of lambs, they ſhall conſume: into ſmoke ſhall they conſume away. <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal xxxvii. 20.</note> The fat of lambs, when it is burnt in the fire, burns all up; there is not ſo much as a cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der left; it all conſumes into ſmoke.

He would pour the greateſt contempt upon them, and as it were tread them under foot.</p>
                     <p>Conſider, that all theſe things will be executed on you, if you continue God's enemies.</p>
                     <p>INF. IV. If it be ſo, that natural men are God's enemies, hence we may learn how juſtly God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſhew you mercy. For is God obliged to ſhew mercy to his enemies? Is God bound to ſet his love on them that have no love to him; but hate him with perfect hatred? Is God bound to come and dwell with them that have an averſion to him, and chooſe to keep at a diſtance from him, and fly from him as one that is
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:009961_0273_0F7B3E95F8889C48"/>
hateful to them? If you earneſtly deſire the ſalvation of your ſoul, is God bound to comply with your deſires, when you do always reſiſt and oppoſe his will? Is God bound to be perſwaded and overcome by your prayers, when you are obſtinate in your oppoſition to him, and refuſe to yield obedience to him? Is God bound to put honor upon you, and to advance you to ſuch dignity as to be a child of the King of Kings, and the heir of the kingdom of glory, while you at the ſame time have God in the greateſt contempt, &amp; ſet him too low to have the loweſt place in your heart? Is God bound to ſpare your life, and deliver you from eternal death, when you are a mortal enemy to God, and would, if you could, deſtroy the Being of God? Is God oblig'd to ſet his great and tranſcendant love on you, ſo as to give you benefits purchaſed by the blood of his own Son, when your heart is all the while full of that enmity that ſtrikes at the life of God?</p>
                     <p>This doctrine affords a ſtrong argument for the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſovereignty</hi> of God, with reſpect to the ſalvation of ſinners. If God is pleaſed to ſhew mercy to his haters, it is certainly fit that he ſhould do it in a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign way, without acting as any way obliged. God will ſhew mercy to his mortal enemies; but then he will not be bound, he will have his liberty to chooſe the objects of his mercy; to ſhew mercy to what enemy he pleaſes, and puniſh and deſtroy which of his haters he pleaſes. And certainly this is a fit and reaſonable thing. It is fit that God ſhould diſtribute ſaving bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in this way, and in no other, viz. in a ſovereign and arbitrary way. And that ever any body thought of or deviſed any other way for God to ſhew mercy, than to have mercy on whom he would have mercy, muſt ariſe from ignorance of their own hearts, whereby they were inſenſible what enemies they naturally are to God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="unknown:009961_0274_0F7B3E96B7B48750"/>But conſider here the following things,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. How cauſeleſly you are enemies to God. You have no manner of reaſon for it, either from what God is, or from what he has done. You have no reaſon for this from what he is. For he is an infinitely lovely and glorious Being; the fountain of all excellency: All that is amiable and lovely in the univerſe, is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and eminently in him. Nothing can poſſibly be conceived of that could be lovely in God, that is not in him, &amp; that in the greateſt poſſible degree, even infinitely.</p>
                     <p>And you have no reaſon for this, from what God has done. For he has been a good &amp; bountiful God to you. He has exerciſed abundance of kindneſs to you; has carried you from the womb, preſerved your life, taken care of you, and provided for you, all your life long. He has exerciſed great patience and long ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you. If it had not been for the kindneſs of God to you, what would have become of you? What would have become of your body? And what, before this time would have become of your ſoul? And you are now, every day, and hour, maintained by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bounty of God. Every new breath you draw, is a new gift of God to you. How cauſeleſly then are you ſuch dreadful enemies to God? And how juſtly, might God, for it, eternally deprive you of all mercy, ſeeing you do thus requite God for his mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to you?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Conſider, how you would reſent it, if others were ſuch enemies to you, as you are to God. If they had their hearts ſo full of enmity to you; if they treated you with ſuch contempt, and oppoſed you, as you do God; and injured you ſo much as you do God, how would you reſent it? Do you not find that you are apt greatly to reſent it, when any oppoſe you, and ſhew an ill ſpirit towards you? And tho' you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your own enmity againſt God from your corrupt nature that you brought into the world with you, which
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:009961_0275_0F7B3E98DCCCA670"/>
you could not help; yet you do not excuſe others for being enemies to you f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>om their corrupt nature that they brought into the world, which they could not help; but are ready bitterly to reſent it notwithſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Conſider therefore, if you, a poor, unworthy, unlovely creature, do ſo reſent it, when you be not loved, but hated, how may God juſtly reſent it when you are enemies to him, an infinitely glorious Being; and a Being from whom you have received ſo much kindneſs?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. How unreaſonable is it for you to imagine that you can oblige God to have reſpect to you by any thing that you can do, continuing ſtill to be his enemy. If you think you have prayed and read, and done conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for God; yet who cares for the ſeeming kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an enemy?</p>
                     <p>What value would you your ſelf ſet upon it, if a man ſhould ſeem to carry it reſpectfully to you, with a fair face, talking ſmooth, and making a ſhew of friendſhip; when you knew at the ſame time, that he was inwardly your mortal enemy? Would you look upon yourſelf obliged for ſuch reſpect and kindneſs? Would you not rather abhor it? Would you count ſuch reſpect to be valued, as Joab's towards Amaſa, who took him by the beard, and kiſſed him, and ſaid, Art thou in health my brother? and ſmote him at the ſame time und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the fifth rib, and killed him?</p>
                     <p>What if you do pray to God? Is God obliged to hear the prayers of an enemy? What if you have taken a great deal of pains, is God obliged to give heaven for the prayers of an enemy? God may juſtly abhor your prayers, and all that you do in religion, as the flattery of a mortal enemy. No wonder God does not accept any thing from the hands of an enemy.</p>
                     <p>INF. V. HENCE we may learn how wonderful is the love that is manifeſted in giving Chriſt to die for us. For this love is love to enemies. That is taken notice of in the text, "While we were ENEMIES, we
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:009961_0276_0F7B3E999F9B79F8"/>
were reconciled to God by the death of his Son." How wonderful was the love of God the Father in giving ſuch a gift, to ſuch, who not only were ſuch as could not be profitable to him, and ſuch as could merit nothing from him, and poor little worms of the duſt; but were his enemies, and enemies, to ſo great a degree! They had that enmity that aimed at his life; yet ſo did he love them, that he gave his own Son to lay down his own life, to ſave their lives. Tho' they had that enmity that ſought to pull God down out of his throne; yet God ſo loved them, that he ſent down Chriſt from heaven, from his throne there, to be in the form of a ſervant; and in ſtead of a throne of glory, gave him to be nailed to the croſs, and to be laid in the grave, that ſo we might be brought to a throne of glory.</p>
                     <p>How wonderful was the love of Chriſt, in thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing <hi>dying love</hi> towards his enemies! That he ſhould ſo love thoſe that hated him, with hatred that ſought to take away his life; ſo as voluntarily to lay down his life, that they might have life through him. "Herein is love; not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and laid down his life for us.</p>
                     <p>INF. VI. IF we are all naturally God's enemies, hence we may learn what a ſpirit it becomes us to be of towards our enemies. Tho' we are enemies to God, yet we hope that God has loved us; and we hope that Chriſt has died for us; and we hope that God has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given or will forgive us; and will do us good, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow infinite mercies and bleſſings upon us, ſo as to make us happy for ever. All this mercy, we hope has been, or will be exerciſed towards us, while enemies.</p>
                     <p>Certainly then, it won't become us to be bitter in our ſpirits againſt thoſe that are enemies to us, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and ill treated us; and tho' they have yet an ill ſpirit towards us. Seeing we depend ſo much on God's forgiving us, tho' enemies, we ſhould be of a ſpirit of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:009961_0277_0F7B3E99CD0D2020"/>
forgiveneſs towards our enemies. And therefore our Saviour inſerted it in that prayer, which he dictated as a general directory to all; "Forgive us our debts, <hi>as we forgive our debtors,</hi>" to enforce the duty upon us, and to ſhew us how reaſonable it is. And we ought to love them even while enemies; for ſo we hope God hath done to us. We ſhould be the children of our father, who is kind to the unthankful and evil. <note n="†" place="bottom">Luk. vi. 35.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we refuſe thus to do, and are of another ſpirit, we may juſtly expect that God will deny us his mercy, as he has threatned! "If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly father will alſo forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgive your treſpaſſes. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. vi. 14, 15.</note> The ſame we have in the parable of the man, who owed his lord ten thouſand talents. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. xviii. 23,—35.</note>

And ℣. 8 &amp; 9. "Unto me, who am leſs

than the leaſt of all ſaints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt; and to make all men ſee what is the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the myſtery, which, from the beginning of the world, hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
                  <p>And the apoſtle, in the text, informs us, that what Chriſt had accompliſhed towards his church, in the work of redemption, had not only in a great meaſure unvail'd the myſtery to the church here in this world; but God had more clearly and fully opened it to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, even of the angels themſelves: And that this was one end of God in it, to diſcover the glory of his wiſdom to the angels. "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church the manifold wiſdom of God."</p>
                  <p>We may obſerve in the text,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One end of the revealing God's counſels concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work of redemption ſpecified, viz. The glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making known God's <hi>wiſdom.</hi>

The epithet given to the wiſdom of God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the work of redemption: it is called <hi>manifold</hi> wiſdom; becauſe of the manifold glorious ends that are attained by it. The excellent deſigns, hereby accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, are very manifeſt. The wiſdom of God in this is of vaſt extent. The contrivance is ſo manifold, that one may ſpend an eternity in diſcovering more of the excellent ends and deſigns accompliſhed by it; and the multitude and vaſt variety of things that are, by divine contrivance, brought to conſpire to the bringing about thoſe ends.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

The Angels are often called principalities and powers, which ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the exalted dignity of their nature The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are of a very noble and excellent nature.

                  <p>One end of God in revealing his deſign or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for redemption, as he hath ſo fully and gloriouſly done by Jeſus Chriſt, is that the angels in heaven may behold the glory of his wiſdom by it. Tho' they are ſuch bright intelligencies, and do always behold the face of God the father, and know ſo much; yet here is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inſtruction for them. Here they may ſee more of the divine wiſdom than ever they had ſeen before. It was a new diſcovery of the wiſdom of God to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Obſerve the <hi>time</hi> when this diſplay of the wiſdom of God was eſpecially made to the angels, and that is, when Chriſt introduced the goſpel diſpenſation, implied in thoſe words, "To the intent that <hi>Now</hi> unto the

principalities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" &amp;c. When Chriſt came into the world and died, and actually performed the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had fully and plainly revealed the counſels of God concerning it; and accordingly introduced the evangelical diſpenſation, and erected the goſpel church, —then the angels underſtood more of the myſtery of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This is very plainly implied in the text and context.</p>
                  <p>In the foregoing verſe, the apoſtle after ſpeaking of revealing of this wiſdom of God to man, "And to make all <hi>men</hi> ſee, what is the fellowſhip of this myſtery &amp;c.

                     <hi>Now at this time,</hi> i. e. now Chriſt has actually wro't out redemption; and fully reveal'd [it to the angels] which implies that it was alſo before a myſtery kept hid from them in compariſon of what it is now.</p>
                  <p>And this need not ſeem ſtrange; for here is room enough for the angels to diſcover more and more to all eternity, of the wiſdom of God in this work. So mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and infinite is the wiſdom thereof.</p>

                     <p>This is evidently taught in this text; for here it is mentioned as one end of God in revealing the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance for our ſalvation, that the angels thereby might ſee and know how great and manifold the wiſdom of God is; to hold forth the wonderfulneſs of divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the angel's view and admiration.

In all that time the angels had always beheld the face of God; and had been ſtudying God's works of creation for four thouſand years together; yet they never till that day, had ſeen any thing like that: never knew how manifold God's wiſdom is, as now they knew it by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="1">1. I would ſhew, that there is great wiſdom mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in contriving the way of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>And to ſhew this, I would conſider two things, viz. 1. The wonderfulneſs of the things done, by which redemption is procured. 2. The wonderfulneſs of the good that is attained thereby.</p>

                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would conſider the wonderfulneſs of the things done by which redemption is procured. Such is the choice of the perſon choſen to be our redeemer,— the ſubſtituting of him in our room;—his incarnation— his life—his death —and exaltation. And in the</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt place. We will conſider the choice of the perſon to be our redeemer. When God deſigned the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, his great wiſdom appears in that he pitched upon his own, and only begotten Son, to be the perſon to perform the work. He was a redeemer of God's own chooſing, and therefore he is called in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. God's <hi>elect,</hi> (Iſai. 42 1.) The wiſdom of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this perſon to be the redeemer, appears in his being every way a fit perſon; and in his being the only fit perſon; and in <hi>that,</hi> it ſhews a divine wiſdom, to <hi>know</hi> that he was a fit and ſuitable perſon.</p>
                     <p>He was every way a <hi>fit</hi> perſon for this undertaking. It was neceſſary, that the perſon that is the redeemer, ſhould be a <hi>divine</hi> perſon. None but a <hi>divine</hi> perſon was ſufficient for this great work. The work is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely unequal to any creature. It was requiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It was requiſite, that the perſon, in order to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this undertaking, ſhould be one of infinite <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and worthineſs, that he might be capable of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinite bleſſings. The Son of God is a fit perſon on this account.</p>
                     <p>It was neceſſary, that he ſhould be a perſon of infinite <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſdom;</hi> for this work is ſo difficult, that it requires ſuch an one. Chriſt is a fit perſon alſo upon this account.</p>
                     <p>It was requiſite, that he ſhould be a perſon infinitely <hi>dear</hi> to God the father, in order to the giving an infinite value to his tranſactions in the father's eſteem, and that
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:009961_0284_0F7B3E9F90A7DAE0"/>
the father's love to him might balance the offence and provocation by our ſins. Chriſt is a fit perſon upon this account. Therefore called <hi>the beloved,</hi> (Eph. 1.6.) He hath made us accepted in the <hi>beloved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was requiſite, that the perſon ſhould be one that could act in this as of <hi>his own abſolute right:</hi> one that, in himſelf, is not a ſervant or ſubject; becauſe, if he is one that cannot act of his own right, he cannot merit any thing. He that is a ſervant, and that can do no more than he is bound to do, cannot merit. And then he that has nothing that is abſolutely his own, cannot pay any price to redeem another. Upon this account Chriſt is a fit perſon; and none but a divine perſon can be fit.</p>
                     <p>And he muſt be a perſon alſo of infinite <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> for no other perſon but ſuch an one would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a work ſo difficult, for a creature ſo unworthy as man. Upon this account alſo Chriſt is a fit perſon.</p>
                     <p>It was requiſite that he ſhould be a perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable perefct <hi>truth</hi> &amp; faithfulneſs; otherwiſe he would not be fit to be depended on by us in ſo great an affair. Chriſt is alſo a fit perſon upon this account.</p>
                     <p>The wiſdom of God in chuſing his eternal Son, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, not only in that he is a fit perſon; but in that he was the <hi>only</hi> fit perſon of all perſons that are either created or uncreated. No <hi>created</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, neither man, nor angel, was fit for this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; for we have juſt now ſhewn, that he muſt be a perſon of <hi>infinite</hi> holineſs—dignity— power —wiſdom; infinitely dear to God—of infinite love and mercy; and one that may act of his own abſolute right. But no creature, how excellent ſoever, has any one of theſe qualifications.</p>
                     <p>There are three <hi>increated</hi> Perſons, the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt; and Chriſt alone of theſe was a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſon for a Redeemer. It was not meet, that the Redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="unknown:009961_0285_0F7B3EA001870D60"/>
the perſon that holds the rights of the Godhead, and ſo was the perſon offended, whoſe juſtice required ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; —and was to be appeaſed by a mediator.</p>
                     <p>It was not meet it ſhould be the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for in being mediator between the Father and the ſaints, he is in ſome ſenſe ſo between the Father and the Spirit. The ſaints, in all their ſpiritual tranſactions with God, act by the Spirit: or rather, it is the Spirit of God, that acts in them: they are the temples of the holy Ghoſt. The holy Spirit dwelling in them, is their principle of action, in all their tranſactings with God.</p>
                     <p>But in theſe their ſpiritual tranſactings with God, they act by a <hi>Mediator.</hi> Theſe ſpiritual and holy exerciſes cannot be acceptable, or avail any thing with God, as from a fallen creature, but by a mediator. Therefore Chriſt, in being mediator between the Father and the ſaints, may be ſaid to be mediator between the Father and the holy Spirit, that acts in the ſaints. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was meet, that the mediator ſhould not be either the Father or the Spirit, but a middle perſon between them both.</p>
                     <p>It is the Spirit in the ſaints, that ſeeks the bleſſing of God, by faith and prayer; and, as the apoſtle ſays, with groanings that cannot be uttered, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.) <hi>Likewiſe the ſpirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought; but the ſpirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that cannot be uttered.</hi> The ſpirit in the ſaints ſeeks divine bleſſings of God, by and thro' a mediator: and therefore that mediator muſt not be the ſpirit, but another perſon.</p>
                     <p>It ſhews a <hi>divine</hi> wiſdom, to <hi>know</hi> that he was a fit perſon. No other but one of <hi>divine</hi> wiſdom could have known it. None but one of infinite wiſdom could have thought of him to be a redeemer of ſinners. For he, as he is God, is one of the perſons offended by ſin; whom ſin is enmity againſt; whom man by his ſin
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:009961_0286_0F7B3EA09C9FED38"/>
had rebelled againſt, and caſt contempt upon. Who but God infinitely wiſe could ever have thought of <hi>him</hi> to be a redeemer of ſinners! <hi>Him</hi> they had ſinned againſt, were enemies to, and deſerved infinitely ill of! Who would ever have thought of him as one that ſhould ſet his heart upon man, and exerciſe infinite love and pity to him, — and infinite wiſdom and power and merit in redeeming him! We proceed</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To conſider the ſubſtituting this perſon in our room. After the chooſing the perſon to be our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the next ſtep of divine wiſdom, is, in contriving the way how he ſhould perform this work. If God had declared who the perſon was, that his wiſdom had pitched upon, to do this work, and had gone no further, there is no creature could have thought which way this perſon could have performed the work. If God had told them, that his own Son muſt be the Redeemer; and that he alone was a fit perſon for the work: and that he was a perſon every way fit &amp; ſufficient for it,— but had propoſed to them to have contriv'd a way how this fit and ſufficient perſon ſhould do the work, — Here we may well ſuppoſe that all created underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would have been utterly at a loſs.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing neceſſary to be done, is that this Son of God ſhould become our repreſentative and ſurety; and ſo be ſubſtituted in the ſinner's room. But who of created intelligences would have tho't of any ſuch thing as the eternal and infinitely beloved Son of God his being ſubſtituted in the room of ſinners! His ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſtead of a ſinner, a rebel, an object of the wrath of God! And ſhould in the ſinner's ſtead place himſelf in the woful circumſtances, that he has brought himſelf into, by ſin! Who would have thought of a perſon, that was the eternal God, a perſon of infinite glory, his undertaking to ſtand before God, as repreſenting ſinful worms, that had made themſelves by ſin infinitely provoking and abominable!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:009961_0287_0F7B3EA13780C938"/>For, if the Son of God be ſubſtituted in the ſinner's room, then his ſin muſt be charged upon him: He will thereby take the guilt of the ſinner upon himſelf; and all that was due to the ſinner for his ſin, becomes now due to him; and he muſt be ſubject to the ſame law that man was, both as to the commands, and threatnings: but who would have thought of any ſuch thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God! Who would have thought, that it was fit to be, or could be! But we proceed,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To conſider the incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt. The next ſtep of divine wiſdom in contriving how Chriſt ſhould perform the work of redeeming ſinners, was in determining his incarnation. If God had reveal'd his counſels thus far to created underſtandings, not only that his own Son was the perſon he had pitched upon, for this work, but alſo that he had ſubſtituted him in the ſinner's room; and appointed him to repreſent the ſinner, and to become his ſurety; and ſo to take the ſinner's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ligations and guilt on himſelf:—and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd no more, but had left the reſt to them to find ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> is no way probable, that even then they could ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ave thought of a way, whereby this perſon might actually h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve performed the work of redemption. For if the Son of God be ſubſtituted in the ſinner's ſtead, then the Son of God takes the ſinner's obligations on himſelf: as for inſtance; he muſt take the obligation the ſinner is under to perform perfect obedience to the divine law. But it is not probable, that any creature could have conceiv'd how that could be poſſible. How ſhould a perſon that is the eternal JEHOVAH, become a ſervant, be under law, and perform obedience to the law of man!</p>
                     <p>And again, if the Son of God be ſubſtituted in the ſinner's ſtead, then he comes under the ſinner's obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuffer the puniſhment, which man's ſin had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And who could have thought that to have been poſſible! For how ſhould a divine perſon, who is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:009961_0288_0F7B3EA39994ACF0"/>
unchangeably, and infinitely happy, ſuffer pain and torment! And how ſhould he that is the object of God's infinitely dear love, ſuffer the wrath of his father!</p>
                     <p>It is not to be ſuppos'd, that created wiſdom ever would have found out a way how to have got over theſe difficulties. But divine wiſdom hath found out a way, viz. by the incarnation of the Son of God. That the word ſhould be made fleſh, that he might be both God and man, in one perſon: what created underſtanding could have thought or conceived of ſuch a thing as that! or could have conceiv'd that ſuch a thing was poſſible!</p>
                     <p>And if God had reveal'd to them, that it was poſſible, and that it <hi>ſhould be,</hi> but left them to find out <hi>how</hi> it ſhould be; — how may we well ſuppoſe that they would all have been puzzled and confounded, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of a way for ſo uniting a man to the eternal Son of God, that they ſhould be one perſon: that one that is truly a man in all reſpects, as truly and properly a man as any man, ſhould indeed and in truth, be the very ſame Son of God, that is God, and was with God from all eternity. This is a great myſtery to us. Hereby, a perſon that is infinite, omnipotent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, is become a finite, a feeble man: a man ſubject to our ſinleſs infirmities, paſſions and calamities! The great God, the ſovereign of heaven and earth, is become a worm of the duſt. (Pſal. 22.6) "I am a worm, and no man." He that is eternal and ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent, is born of a woman as the reſt of us are! He that is the great original ſpirit is clothed with fleſh &amp; blood like one of us! He that is independent &amp; ſelf-ſufficient and all-ſufficient, that ſupplies all creatures out of his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful hand; —he now is come to ſtand in need of food and cloathing to keep him alive: He becomes poor, "has not where to lay his head;"— ſtands in need of the charity of men; and is maintain'd by it! It is far above us, to conceive how it is done. It is a great wonder and myſtery to us: but it was no myſtery to divine wiſdom.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:009961_0289_0F7B3EA45F2D7200"/>4. The next thing to be conſidered, is the life of Chriſt in this world. The wiſdom of God appears in the circumſtances of his life—and in the work and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of his life. Particularly,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The circumſtances of his life. If God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd that his own Son, ſhould be incarnate, and ſhould live in this world, in the human nature; and it had been left to men to determine what circumſtances of life would have been moſt ſuitable for the Son of God to appear in here,—human wiſdom would have determin'd, that he ſhould appear in the world in a moſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent manner; with very extraordinary outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of honor, authority and power far above any of the kings of the earth: that here he ſhould reign in great viſible pomp and ſplendor over all nations.—And thus it was that men's wiſdom did determine, before Chriſt came. The wiſe, great men among the jews, ſcribes and phariſees, who are called "princes of this world;" did expect that the meſſiah would thus appear. But the wiſdom of God choſe quite otherwiſe: It choſe that when the Son of God was incarnate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, he ſhould begin his life in a ſtable; that he ſhould for many years dwell obſcurely in a family of low degree in the world; and afterwards ſhould be in low outward circumſtances: that he ſhould be poor, and not have where to lay his head; —that he ſhould be maintained by the charity of ſome of his diſciples;— That he ſhould "grow up as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground," (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2.) "That he ſhould not cry, nor lift up, nor cauſe his voice to he heard in the ſtreets," (<hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.2.) That he ſhould come to Zion in a lowly manner, "riding on an aſs, and a colt the fole of an aſs."—"That he ſhould be deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief."</p>
                     <p>And now the <hi>divine</hi> determination in this matter is made known, we may ſafely conclude that it is far the
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:009961_0290_0F7B3EA4F9632980"/>
moſt ſuitable: and that it would not have been at all ſuitable for God, when he was manifeſt in fleſh to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with earthly pomp, wealth and grandeur, as tho' he affected ſuch things as theſe. No! theſe things are infinitely too mean, and deſpicable. For the Son of God to ſhew as if he affected or eſteemed them.</p>
                     <p>Men, if they had had this way propoſed to them of the eternal Son of God, appearing on earth, viz. in ſuch mean, low circumſtances, would have been ready to condemn it, as fooliſh and very unſuitable for the Son of God. "But the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men," (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.) "And God hath brought to nought the wiſdom of this world, and the princes of this world," (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.)</p>
                     <p>CHRIST, by thus appearing in mean and low out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumſtances in the world, has poured contempt upon all worldly wealth and glory; and has taught us to deſpiſe it. It is becoming of chriſtians to be above theſe things and to deſpiſe them. And if it becomes mean men to deſpiſe them, how much more did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Son of God! And then Chriſt hereby hath taught us to be lowly in heart. We ſee hereby how lowly that Perſon was, that was infinitely high &amp; great. How lowly then ſhould we be, who are indeed ſo low &amp; vile.</p>
                     <p>Again,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The wiſdom of God appears in the work and buſineſs of the life of Chriſt. That he ſhould perfectly obey the law of God, under ſuch great temptations: That he ſhould have conflicted with and overcome, for us, in a way of obedience, the powers of earth &amp; hell: That he ſhould be ſubject to, not only the <hi>moral</hi> law, but the <hi>ceremonial</hi> alſo, that heavy yoke of bondage.</p>
                     <p>CHRIST went thro' the time of his public miniſtry, in delivering to us divine inſtructions and doctrines. The wiſdom of God appears in giving us ſuch an one to be our prophet and teacher, who is a divine perſon:
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:009961_0291_0F7B3EA5D80E2848"/>
who is himſelf the very wiſdom and word of God: And was from all eternity in the boſom of the Father:— that he ſhould find ſuch an one to teach us: His word will tend to be of greater authority and weight than if delivered by the mouth of an ordinary prophet. And then it is wiſely ordered that the ſame ſhould be our teacher, that is our redeemer: that his relations and offices, as redeemer, might the more ſweeten and endear his inſtructions to us. We are ready to give heed to things that are ſaid by one that is dear to us. Our love to their perſons make us to delight in their diſcourſe. It is therefore wiſely ordered, that he that has done ſo much to endear himſelf to us, ſhould be appointed our great prophet to deliver to us divine doctrines.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The next thing to be conſidered is the death of Chriſt. The only begotten Son of God his dying, is a means of ſalvation for poor ſinners, that no other but divine wiſdom would have pitched upon. And when it was revealed, was doubtleſs greatly to the ſurprize of all the hoſts of heaven. This is what they admired with great admiration when they ſaw it; and never will ceaſe to wonder at. And how aſtoniſhing is it, that a perſon that is bleſſed for ever, and is infinitely and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially happy, ſhould endure the greateſt ſufferings that ever was endured on earth! That a perſon that is the ſupreme lord and judge of the world, ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd, and ſhould ſtand at the judgment ſeat of mortal worms, and then be condemned. That a perſon that is the living God, and the fountain of life, ſhould be put to death. That a perſon that created the world, and gives life to all his creatures, ſhould be put to death by his own creatures. That a perſon that is one of infinite majeſty and glory, and ſo the object of the love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> praiſes and adorations of angels, ſhould be mocked and ſpit upon by the vileſt of men. That a perſon that is infinitely good, and that is love it ſelf,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:009961_0292_0F7B3EA68172ED08"/>
ſhould ſuffer the greateſt cruelty. That a perſon that is infinitely beloved of the father, ſhould be put to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible anguiſh under his own father's wrath. That he that is king of heaven, hath heaven for his throne, and the earth for his footſtool, ſhould be buried in the priſon of the grave.</p>
                     <p>How wonderful a thing is this! and who would ever have thought of any ſuch thing coming to paſs. But yet this is the way that God's wiſdom hath pitched upon, as the way of ſinners ſalvation: and this not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, or any diſhonour to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The laſt thing done to procure ſalvation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that we ſhall here conſider, is Chriſt's exaltation. Divine wiſdom ſaw it needful or moſt expedient, that the ſame perſon that was incarnate, and that died upon the croſs, ſhould ſit on his own right hand, on his own throne as ſupreme Governor of the world; and ſhould have particularly the abſolute diſpoſal of all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to man's ſalvation, and ſhould be the judge of the world. This was needful, becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that the ſame perſon that purchas'd ſalvation, ſhould have the beſtowing of it; for it is not fit, that God ſhould at all tranſact with the fallen creature in a way of mercy, but by a mediator. And this is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for the ſtrengthning of the faith &amp; comfort of the ſaints, that he that hath indured ſo much to purchaſe ſalvation for them, has all things in heaven, &amp; in earth delivered unto him; that he might beſtow eternal life to them that he purchaſed it for. And that the ſame perſon that loved them ſo greatly, as to ſhed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood for them, was to be their judge, whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there could be no reverſing.</p>
                     <p>But this was another thing full of wonders, that he that was man as well as God; he that was a ſervant, and
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:009961_0293_0F7B3EA74CEAEA50"/>
died like a malefactor; that this perſon not excluſive of the human nature, ſhould be exalted to be made the ſovereign lord of heaven and earth, angels and men; the abſolute diſpoſer of eternal life and death; the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judge of all created intelligent beings, for eternity: and ſhould have committed to him, all the governing power of God the Father; and that, not only as God; but as God-man, not excluſive of the human nature.</p>
                     <p>As it is wonderful, that a perſon that is <hi>divine</hi> ſhould be humbled, ſo as to become a ſervant, and to ſuffer as a malefactor: ſo it is in like manner wonderful, the other way, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Particularly,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) All manner of glory redounds to God hereby. He is glorified in all his attributes: and each perſon of the trinity is, in this work exceedingly glorified.</p>
                  <p>GOD has greatly glorified himſelf in the work of creation;— and in many of his other works of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: but above all, is he glorified in this work of redemption. All God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s works do praiſe him. His glory ſhines brightly from them all: but as ſome ſtars differ from others in glory, ſo the glory of God ſhines brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſome of his works than in others. And amongſt all theſe, the work of redemption is like the ſun in his ſtrength. The glory of the author is abundantly the moſt reſpendent in this work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Each attribute of God is glorified in the work of redemption.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) In this work, God has exceedingly glorified his <hi>wiſdom;</hi> as may more fully appear before we have done with this ſubject.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) God hath exceedingly glorified his <hi>power</hi> in this work. It ſhews the great and inconceivable power of God to unite natures ſo infinitely different, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and human nature, in one perſon. If God can make one that is truly God, and one that is truly man, one and the ſelf ſame perſon, what is it that he cannot do? This is a greater and more marvellous effort, by far, than creation or producing ſomething out of nothing.</p>
                  <p>The power of God moſt gloriouſly appears in man's being actually ſaved and redeemed in this way. In his being brought out of a ſtate of ſin and miſery, into a conformity to God; and at laſt to the full and perfect
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:009961_0295_0F7B3EA959FF9808"/>
enjoyment of God. This is a more glorious demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine power, than creating things out of nothing, upon two accounts. One is, the <hi>effect is greater and more excellent.</hi> To produce the new creature is a more glorious effect, than meerly to produce a creature. The making a holy creature, a creature in the ſpiritual image of God; in the image of the divine excellencies, and a partaker of the divine nature — is a greater effect than meerly to give being to a thing. And therefore as the effect is greater, it is a more glorious manifeſtation of power.</p>
                  <p>And then, upon another account alſo is it a more glorious manifeſtation of divine power, and that is, that in this effect of the actual redemption of ſinners, <hi>the term from which, is more diſtant from the term to which,</hi> than in the work of creation. The term from which, in the work of creation is <hi>nothing,</hi> and the term to which, is <hi>being.</hi> But the term from which, in the work of redemption, is a ſtate infinitely worſe than nothing; and the term to which, a holy and a happy being, a ſtate infinitely better than mere being. The terms in the production of the laſt, are much more remote from one another, than in the firſt.</p>
                  <p>And then the production of this laſt effect, is a more glorious manifeſtation of power, than the work of creation; becauſe, tho' in creation the terms are very diſtant: nothing is very remote from being; yet there is no oppoſition. The power of God in producing that effect is not oppoſed. Nothing, makes no oppoſition to the creating power of God. But in redemption, the power of God meets with and overcomes great oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is great oppoſition in a ſtate of ſin to a ſtate of grace. Men's luſts and corruptions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding oppoſite to grace and holineſs; and do greatly reſiſt the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The power of God is very glorious in this work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it therein conquers the ſtrongeſt and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemies, making the moſt violent oppoſition they are capable of. Power never appears more illuſtrious than in conquering.

"When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: but when a ſtronger than he ſhall overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he truſted, and divideth his ſpoil. <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 15. "And having ſpoiled principalities &amp; powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in the croſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The juſtice of God is exceedingly glorified in this work. God is ſo ſtrictly and immutably juſt, that he would not ſpare his Son when he took upon him the guilt of men's ſins, and was ſubſtituted in the room of ſinners; he ſpared him not at all. He would not abate him the leaſt mite of that debt which juſtice demanded. Juſtice ſhould take place, tho' it coſt his infinitely dear Son his precious blood; and his enduring ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reproach &amp; pain &amp; death in it's moſt dreadful form Such was God's juſtice, that his love to his own Son would not influence him to abate the leaſt of what juſtice required.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) The holineſs of God is alſo exceeding glorious in this work. Never did God ſo manifeſt his hatred of ſin as in the death &amp; ſufferings of his only begotten Son. Hereby he ſhew'd himſelf unappeaſable to ſin. And that it was impoſſible for him to be at peace with it.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) God hath alſo exceedingly glorified his truth in this way, both in his threatnings and promiſes. Herein is fulfilled the threatenings of the law, wherein God ſaid, "in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die." "And curſed is every one that continueth not in
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:009961_0297_0F7B3CAB9EC4B198"/>
all things written in the book of the law to do them." God ſhew'd hereby, that not only heaven &amp; earth ſhould paſs away,—but, which is a great deal more, that the blood of him, who is the eternal Jehovah, ſhould be ſpilt, rather than one jot, or tittle of his word ſhould fail, till all be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6) And laſtly, Eſpecially has God exceedingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his mercy and love, in this work. The mercy of God was an attribute never ſeen before, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of it, till it was ſeen in this work of redemption, or the fruits of it. The goodneſs of God appeared towards the angels in giving them being and bleſſedneſs. It appeared glorious towards man in his primitive ſtate, a ſtate of holineſs and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>But now God hath ſhewn that he can find in his heart, to love ſinners, thoſe that deſerve his infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: that have provoked him by rebellion againſt him; and that are enemies to him. And not only hath he ſhewn that he can love them, but love them ſo as to give them more and do greater things for them than ever he did for the holy angels, that never ſinned or offended their creator. He loved ſinful men ſo as to give them a greater gift than ever he gave the angels: ſo as to give his own Son, and not only to give him to be their poſſeſſion and enjoyment; but to give him to be their ſacrifice. And herein he has done more for them, than if he had given them all the viſible world; yea more, than if he had given them all the angels, and all heaven beſides.</p>
                  <p>GOD hath loved them ſo, that hereby he purchaſed for them, deliverance from eternal miſery, and the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of immortal glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Each perſon of the trinity is exceedingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in this work This is a thing wherein the work of redemption is diſtinguiſhed from all the other works of God. The attributes of God are glorious in other works of God: but the three perſons of the trinity are
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:009961_0298_0F7B3CAC54219C38"/>
diſtinctly glorified in no work as in this work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this work every diſtinct perſon has his diſtinct parts and offices aſſigned him. Each one has his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and diſtinct concern in it, agreeable to their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, perſonal properties &amp; relations &amp; oecomical offices.</p>
                  <p>The perſons of the trinity are each of them, diſtinctly and equally glorified in this work. The redeemed have an equal concern with and dependance upon each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in this affair, and owe equal honor and praiſe to each of them.</p>
                  <p>The Father appoints and provides the Redeemer, and accepts the price of redemption. The Son is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and the price. He redeems by offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Holy Ghoſt immediately communicates to us the thing purchaſed: yea, and he is the good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. The ſum of what Chriſt purchaſed for us is holineſs &amp; happineſs. But the Holy Ghoſt is the great principle both of all holineſs &amp; happineſs. The Holy Ghoſt is the ſum of all that Chriſt purchaſed for men. <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 13, 14. "He was made a curſe for us, that we might receive the promiſe of the ſpirit, thro' faith.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſedneſs of the redeemed conſiſts in parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt's fulneſs, which conſiſts in partaking of that Spirit, which is given not by meaſure unto him. This is the oil that was poured upon the head of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ran down to the members of his body; to the ſki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts of his garment.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have an equal concern with, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon each of the perſons of the trinity, diſtinctly; upon the Father, as he that provides the Redeemer, and the Perſon of whom the purchaſe is made; — the Son as the purchaſer, and the price; the Holy Ghoſt as the good purchaſed.</p>
                  <p>[Thus we have conſidered how God is glorified in this work; which is part of the good obtained in the work of Redemption.]</p>
                  <p>We proceed now</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="186" facs="unknown:009961_0299_0F7B3CAD095BEB78"/>II. To conſider the wiſdom of God appearing in the variety, and exceeding greatneſs of the good that is hereby procured for <hi>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we may diſtinctly conſider — The variety—and the greatneſs of the good procured for men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here are all ſorts of good procured for fallen man, that he <hi>does</hi> or <hi>can</hi> ſtand in need of, or is <hi>capable</hi> of. The wiſdom of God appears in the way of ſalvation in that it is ſo ſufficient a way. Herein it is moſt worthy of an infinitely wiſe God, as it is every way perfect and ſufficient, and anſwers all our needs.</p>
                  <p>We in our fallen ſtate are moſt neceſſitous creatures, full of our wants: but they are all anſwered in this way of ſalvation. Every ſort of good is here procured. Every thing that would really contribute to our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we can think of, and a great many things we could not have thought of, had not Chriſt purchaſed them for us, and revealed them to us. Every demand of our circumſtances, and craving of our natures, is here exactly anſwered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As for inſtance, we ſtand in need of <hi>peace</hi> with God. We had provoked God to anger, and the wrath of God abode upon us, and we needed to have it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed. This is done for us in this way of ſalvation. Chriſt, by ſhedding his blood, has fully ſatisfied juſtice, and appeaſed God's wrath, for all that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. We were by the ſentence of the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to hell. We needed to have our ſins pardoned that we might be delivered from hell. In this work, pardon of ſin, &amp; deliverance from hell, is purchaſed for us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We needed not only to have God's wrath appeaſed, and our ſins pardoned; but we needed to have the <hi>favour</hi> of God. To have God, not only not our enemy, but our friend. God's favour is alſo purchaſed for us by the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="187" facs="unknown:009961_0300_0F7B3CADC3E8E678"/>Thirdly, We needed not only to be delivered from hell, but to have ſome <hi>ſatisfying happineſs</hi> beſtowed. Man is of ſuch a nature, that he has a natural craving and thirſt after happineſs. And will thirſt and crave, till his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity is fill'd. And his capacity is of vaſt extent; and nothing but an infinite good can fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> it, and ſatisfy his deſires. But notwithſtanding, proviſion is made in this way of ſalvation to anſwer thoſe needs of our ſouls. And there is a ſatisfying happineſs purchaſed for us: that which is fully anſwerable to the capacity and crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Here is food procured in this way of ſalvation to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer all our appetites and faculties of our ſouls. God has made the ſoul of man of a ſpiritual nature; and therefore he needs a ſpiritual happineſs: ſome ſpiritual object, in the enjoyment of which he may be happy. And in this way of ſalvation, there is good procured, that is ſuitable to this ſpiritual nature of man, a ſpirit. Chriſt has purchaſed the enjoyment of God, as the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſouls, —who is the great and original Spirit. And he hath purchaſed the Spirit of God to come and dwell in us to be an internal principle of happineſs.</p>
                  <p>GOD hath made man a rational, intelligent creature. And man needs ſome good, that ſhall be a ſuitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his underſtanding, for him to contemplate; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may have full and ſufficient exerciſe for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faculties, in the utmoſt extent of them: or in the utmoſt extent they are capable of; — an object that is great and noble, and worthy of the exerciſe of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt faculties of the rational ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Proviſion is made for this alſo, in this way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here it is provided that God himſelf ſhould be theirs, for them forever to behold &amp; contemplate; whoſe glorious perfections and works are moſt worthy objects of the improvement of their faculties: And there is room enough for them to improve them, and ſtill to exerciſe their faculties to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="188" facs="unknown:009961_0301_0F7B3CAEC860C298"/>And what object can be more worthy to exerciſe the underſtanding of a rational ſoul, than the glories of the divine being, with which the heavenly intelligencies, and the infinite underſtanding of God himſelf is entertain'd!</p>
                  <p>Our ſouls need ſome good that ſhall be a ſuitable object of the will and affections: a ſuitable object for the choice, the acquieſcence, the love and joy of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſoul. Proviſion is made for this alſo in this way of ſalvation. There is an infinitely excellent Being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be choſen, to be reſted in, to be loved, to be rejoyced in, by us: even God himſelf, who is infinitely lovely, the fountain of all good; a fountain that can never be exhauſted, where we can be in no danger of going to exceſs, in our love and joy: and may be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever to find our joy and delight in the enjoyment anſwerable to our love and deſires.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. There is all poſſible enjoyment of this object procured in this way of ſalvation. When perſons entirely ſet their love upon another they naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to <hi>ſee</hi> that perſon: meerly to here of the perſon, don't ſatisfy love. So here is proviſion made that we ſhould ſee God, the object of our ſupreme love. Not only that we ſhould hear and read of him in his word, but that we ſhould ſee him with a ſpiritual eye here: and not only ſo, but that we ſhould have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing God face to face, hereafter. This is promiſed (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8) <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart; for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> It is promiſed, that we ſhall not ſee God, as thro' a glaſs darkly, as we do now, but face to face. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. That we ſhall ſee Chriſt as he is. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>We naturally deſire not only to ſee thoſe that we love, but to <hi>converſe with</hi> them. Proviſion is made for this alſo, that we ſhould have ſpiritual converſation with God while here in this world; and that we ſhould be hereafter admitted to converſe with Chriſt in the moſt
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:009961_0302_0F7B3CAF5EABAF40"/>
intimate manner poſſible. Proviſion is made in this way of ſalvation, that we ſhould converſe with God much more intimately, than otherwiſe it would have been poſſible for us; for now Chriſt is incarnate, he is in our nature: he is become one of us; whereby we are under advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for an immenſely more free and intimate conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him, than could have been, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd only in the divine nature; and ſo in a nature infinitely diſtant from us.</p>
                  <p>We naturally deſire not only to converſe with thoſe that we greatly love, but to <hi>dwell with</hi> them. Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, thro' Chriſt, is made for this It is purchaſed and provided that we ſhould dwell with God in his own houſe in heaven, which is called our father's houſe.— To dwell for ever in God's preſence, and at his right hand.</p>
                  <p>We naturally deſire to have a <hi>right</hi> to that perſon that we greatly love. Proviſion is made in this way of ſalvation, that we ſhould have a right <hi>in</hi> God; a right <hi>to</hi> him. This is the promiſe of the covenant of grace, "That he will be our God. God with all his glorious perfections and attributes: with all his power and wiſdom; and with all his majeſty and glory, will be ours: ſo that we may call him our inheritance, and the portion of our ſouls: what we can challenge, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this portion made over to us, by a firm inſtrument; by a covenant ordered in all things and ſure.</p>
                  <p>And we way alſo hereby challenge a right to Jeſus Chriſt.— Love deſires that the right ſhould be <hi>mutual.</hi> The lover, deſires not only to have a right to the beloved, but <hi>that the beloved ſhould alſo have a right to him:</hi> he deſires to be his beloved's, as well as his beloved ſhould be his. Proviſion is alſo made for this, in this wiſe method of ſalvation,—that God ſhould have a ſpecial propriety in thoſe that are redeemed, that they ſhould be in a diſtinguiſhing manner <hi>his:</hi> that they
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:009961_0303_0F7B3CB0A87262A8"/>
ſhould be his <hi>peculiar</hi> people. We are told that God ſets apart the godly for himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. They are called God's jewels. The ſpouſe ſpeaks it with great ſatisfaction and rejoycing, Cant. 2.16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Love deſires to ſtand in ſome <hi>near relation</hi> to the beloved. Proviſion is made by Chriſt, that we ſhould ſtand in the neareſt poſſible relation to God, that God ſhould be our father; and we ſhould be his children. We are often inſtructed in the word of God, that God is the father of believers, and that they are his family.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſo, but they ſtand in the neareſt relation to Chriſt Jeſus. There is the cloſeſt union poſſible. The ſouls of believers are married to Chriſt. The church is the bride the lamb's wife. Yea, there is yet a nearer relation than can be repreſented by ſuch a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude as this. Believers are as the very members of Chriſt, and of his fleſh and of his bones, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. Yea, this is not near enough yet, but "they are one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit." 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                  <p>Love naturally inclines to a <hi>conformity</hi> to the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To have thoſe excellencies, upon the account of which he is beloved, copied in himſelf. Proviſion is made in this way of ſalvation, that we may be conformed to God; that we ſhall be transformed into the ſame image. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory.</hi>—And that hereafter we ſhall ſee him as he is, and be like him.</p>
                  <p>It is the natural deſire of love to <hi>do ſomething</hi> for the beloved, either for his pleaſure or honour. Proviſion is made for this alſo in this way of ſalvation; that we ſhould be made inſtruments of glorifying God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting his kingdom here, and of glorifying him to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="unknown:009961_0304_0F7B3CB1108D7510"/>Fifthly, In this way of ſalvation, proviſion is made for our having <hi>every ſort of good</hi> that man naturally craves; as honor, wealth, and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Here is proviſion made that we ſhould be brought to the higheſt <hi>honor.</hi> This is what God has promiſed. "That thoſe that honor him, he will honor." And that true chriſtians ſhall be kings and prieſts unto God.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt has promiſed them, "That as his father has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto him a kingdom, ſo he will appoint unto them, that they may eat and drink at his table in his kingdom." — He has promiſed to crown them with a crown of glory,—and that "they ſhall ſit with him in his throne." And that he will confeſs their names before his father, and before his angels." "Will give them a new name."— And that they "ſhall walk with him in white."</p>
                  <p>CHRIST has alſo purchaſed for them the <hi>greateſt wealth.</hi> All thoſe that are in Chriſt are rich. They are <hi>now</hi> rich. They have the beſt riches. Are rich in faith, and the graces of the ſpirit of God. They have gold tried in the fire. They have durable riches &amp; righteouſneſs. They have treaſure in heaven, where neither thief approacheth, nor moth corrupteth. An inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. They are poſſeſſors of all things.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST has alſo purchaſed <hi>pleaſure</hi> for them. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are immenſely preferable to all the pleaſures of ſenſe, moſt exquiſitely ſweet, and ſatisfying. He has purchaſed for them fulneſs of joy, and pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more at God's right hand: And that they may drink of the river of God's pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, CHRIST has purchaſed all needed good <hi>both for ſoul and body.</hi> While we are here, we ſtand in need of theſe earthly things: as Chriſt obſerves.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST has purchaſed all that we ſtand in need of, and are beſt for us. He has purchaſed that God ſhould feed, and cloath us. Matth. 6.26. <hi>How much more ſhall
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:009961_0305_0F7B3CB1A7C59848"/>
he feed you, O ye of little faith!"</hi> How much more ſhall he cloath you! Chriſt has purchaſed that God ſhould take care of us, and provide what is needed, and ſhall be beſt, of theſe things, as a father provides for his children. 1 Pet 5.7. <hi>Caſting your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, CHRIST has purchaſed good that is ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for his people <hi>in all conditions.</hi> There is, in this way of ſalvation reſpect had to, and proviſion made for all circumſtances that they can be in. Here is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made, for a time of affliction, of all they ſhall ſtand in need of, at ſuch a time.—</p>
                  <p>Here is proviſion made for a time of poverty and pinching want. —</p>
                  <p>—For a time of bereavement and mourning.—</p>
                  <p>—For ſpiritual darkneſs—</p>
                  <p>—A Day of temptation. —</p>
                  <p>—A time of perſecution.—</p>
                  <p>There is a ſuitable proviſion made for a time of death. Sufficient proviſion in this way of ſalvation for ſuch a time as that. Here is ſuch a proviſion made that is ſufficient to carry a perſon above death, and all its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and to give him a compleat triumph over that king of terrors. Here is enough in this way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſweeten the grave, and make it ceaſe to ſeem ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. Yea, enough to make death, in proſpect to ſeem deſirable; and in its near approach to be not terrible but joyful.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, There is proviſion made in this way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for the life and bleſſedneſs of ſoul &amp; body <hi>to all eternity.</hi> Chriſt has purchaſed that we ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:009961_0306_0F7B3CB23A3828D8"/>
from a ſtate of temporal death, as well as <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal.</hi> He has purchaſed that the bodies of the ſaints ſhall be raiſed to a reſurrection of life. He has purchaſed all manner of perfection for the body that it is capable of; that it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual body, in incorruption, and glory: and be made like Chriſt's glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, and ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of his father. And that it ſhould be glorified with the ſoul and exiſt in a glorified eſtate in union with the ſoul to all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly. But man in his fallen ſtate ſtill needs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in order to his happineſs, than that theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ſhould be purchaſed for him. i. e. He needs to be <hi>qualified</hi> for the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of them. In order to our having a title to theſe bleſſings of the covenant of grace, there is a certain condition muſt be performed by us. We muſt believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and accept of him as offered in the goſpel, for a Saviour. But this we cannot do of our ſelves.— But Chriſt has purchaſed this alſo for all the elect. He has purchaſed that they ſhall have faith given them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhall be united to Chriſt, and ſo have a title to his benefits.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill ſomething further is neceſſary for man, in order to his coming to the actual poſſeſſion of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. A man, as ſoon as he has believed, has a title to the inheritance: but in order to come to the actual poſſeſſion of it, he muſt perſevere in a way of holineſs. There is not only a gate that muſt be entered; but there is a narrow way that muſt be travel'd before we can arrive at heavenly bleſſedneſs; and that is a way of univerſal and perſevering holineſs. But men after they have believed, cannot perſevere in a way of holineſs, of themſelves. But there is ſufficient proviſion made for this alſo, in the way of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. The
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:009961_0307_0F7B3CB3FA9EF540"/>
matter of a ſaint's perſeverance is ſufficiently ſecured by the purchaſe that Chriſt has made.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill there is ſomething elſe needful in order to qualify a perſon for the actual entering upon the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and employments of a glorified eſtate, viz. that he ſhould be made perfectly holy: that all remainders of ſin ſhould be taken away; for there can't any ſin enter into heaven. No ſoul muſt go into the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, with the leaſt degree of the filth of ſin. But there is proviſion made; for Chriſt has purchaſed that all ſin ſhall be taken away out of the hearts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers at death; and that they ſhould be made perfectly holy: whereby they ſhall be fully and perfectly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to enter upon the pleaſures and enjoyments of the new Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST has purchaſed all both objective and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good: not only a portion to be enjoyed by us; but all thoſe inherent qualifications neceſſary to our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. He has purchaſed not only juſtification, but ſanctification and glorification; both holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>To ſhew that it was a wiſe way, we propoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things</p>
                  <p>Firſt The wonderfulneſs of the things done, by which redemption is procured. — The choice of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon —ſubſtituting him—The incarnation of Chriſt—his life — his death—and his exaltation</p>
                  <p>Secondly. The wonderfulneſs of the way appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good obtained by it. Under which, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:009961_0311_0F7B3CB6C1B96418"/>
to conſider two things. 1. How great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the good ends are that are obtained by it. 2. The wonderful circumſtances of the attainment.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) How great and manifold the good ends are, that are attained by it, as they relate —to God— to men— to angels—and devils. 1. How God is glorified hereby. 2. What good is procured for men. 3. What benefits the angels have hereby. 4. How ſatan is overthrown.</p>
                  <p>Having in the preceeding Sermon conſidered — the glory that is brought to God—and the good that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for man. I proceed,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To conſider, what benefit the <hi>Angels</hi> have by what is done in the affair of our redemption. So hath the wiſdom of God contriv'd this affair, that the benefit of what he has done therein ſhould be ſo extenſive, as to reach the elect angels. It is for men that the work of redemption is wrought out; and yet the benefit of the things done in this work is not confined to them, or all that is properly called redemption, or included in it is confined to men. The angels can't partake in this, for they have no need of any redemption, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fallen. Neither have they that direct benefit, by what is done in this work, that man has: yet they have great indirect benefit by it.</p>
                  <p>GOD hath ſo wiſely ordered, that what has been done directly and eſpecially for men, in this, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the exceeding benefit of all intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are in favour with God. That the benefit of it ſhould be ſo diffuſive as not to be confined to earth, but reach heaven itſelf. So great and manifold is the good attain'd in this work, that thoſe glorious ſpirits that are ſo much above us, and were ſo highly exalted in happineſs before, yet ſhould receive great addition hereby.</p>

                  <p>Therefore the beholding the glory of God muſt be exceeding raviſhing to the holy angels, that are perfect in ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s: they live thereon. It is their greateſt happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And it is exceeding delightful to them to behold the glory of God manifeſted in his works. It is without doubt much of their employment to behold the glory of God appearing in his works. Therefore this work of redemption greatly contributes to their happineſs and delight, as the glory of God is ſo exceedingly manifeſted by it. For what is done, is done in the ſight of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, as is evident by our text and many other paſſages of holy ſcripture. And they behold the glory of God appearing hearin with entertainment and delight; as it is manifeſt by 1 Pet. 1.12. <hi>Which things the angels deſire to look into.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The angels have this advantage that now they may behold the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, where it ſhines with a peculiar luſtre and brightneſs. This is ſpoken of, 1 Tim. 3.5. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels.</hi> Perhaps all God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are more gloriouſly manifeſted in this work, than in any other that ever the angels ſaw. There is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a fuller manifeſtation of ſome of his attributes, than ever they ſaw before; as is evident by
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:009961_0313_0F7B3CB845233750"/>
the text, as we have obſerved already. And eſpecially, it is ſo with reſpect to the mercy and grace of God, that ſweet and endearing attribute of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature The angels of heaven never ſaw ſo much grace manifeſted before, as in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k of redemption; nor in any meaſure equal to it. It i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> exceeding raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them to behold ſuch a diſcovery of this amiable perfection of God. How full of joy doth it fill the heart of the angels, to ſee ſuch a boundleſs and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ocean of love and grace in the heart of God. And therefore with what rejoycing do all the angels praiſe Chriſt for this work of divine grace, his being ſlain! Rev. 5.11, 12. <hi>And I beheld, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beaſts and the elders: And the number of them was ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands; ſaying with a loud voice, worth is the lamb that was ſlain to receive power &amp; riches &amp; wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory and bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have this benefit by it, that hereby Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, is become their head. God, ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in three perſons, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, was the king of angels, and would have been, if it had not been for our redemption. But it was owing to what is done in this work, that Jeſus Chriſt, as God man, becomes th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> head of the angels. Chriſt is now not only the head of angels ſimply as God, but as God man. Col. 2.10. <hi>And ye are compleat in him, who is the head of all principality &amp; power.</hi> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22 <hi>Which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him on his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power, and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but alſo in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="unknown:009961_0314_0F7B3CB9D0248D98"/>This is a part of the exaltation and glory of Chriſt, which God confers on him, as his reward. But not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but it is greatly to the angels benefit. It is God's manner in his dealings with his elect creatures, in the ſame works wherein he glorifies himſelf, or his Son, greatly to benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> them. The ſame dealings of his that are moſt for his glory, ſhall be moſt for their good.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt God-man ſhould be made the head of the angels, is greatly to their benefit,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe they become hereby more nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to ſo glorious a perſon. They have a more near relation and cloſe union with the Son of God, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would have. The angels eſteem it a great honor done them to be related to ſuch a Perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, God-man, who by reaſon that he is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſon is an infinitely honourable perſon.</p>
                  <p>The angels by Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s becoming their head, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nearly related to him. They with the ſaints are gathered together in one in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. They by virtue hereof, tho' Chriſt be not their redeemer as he is our's, yet have a right and propriety in this glorious Perſon, as well as we. He is theirs: tho' not their Saviour, yet he is their head of government, and head of influence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Again this is greatly to their benefit; as they, as well as we, hereby are under advantages for a far more intimate converſe with God. The divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at an infinite diſtance from the nature of angels, as well as from the nature of man. This diſtance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that familiarity and intimacy of intercourſe—.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a great advantage to the angels, that God is come down to them in a created nature; and in that nature is become their head; ſo that their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and enjoyment may be more intimate. They are invited by the ſimilar qualifications of the created nature, that the Son of God is in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="unknown:009961_0315_0F7B3CBACEE71428"/>Thirdly, It is for the benefit of the angels, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the elect of mankind are gathered into this Society. Chriſt by the work of redemption, gathers in the elect of mankind to join the angels of heaven: Eph. 1.10. <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of times, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, &amp; which are on earth, even in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are brought in to join with the angels; to join with them in their work of praiſing God; to partake with them of their enjoyments. The angels greatly rejoyce at this. They rejoyce when but one perſon is gathered in, as Chriſt teaches us, Luk. 15.10. <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſay unto you, there is joy in the preſence of the angels of God, over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi> The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſociety is made more compleat by this acceſſion of the ſaints to it. The ſaints and angels will contribute to the happineſs of each other. The angels rejoyce that others are added to join them and aſſiſt them in praiſing God.</p>
                  <p>The vacancy by the fall of angels is filled up —</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It tends to make the angels the more to prize their happineſs, when they ſee how much it coſt to purchaſe the ſame happineſs for man. The angels tho' they knew ſo much, yet be not incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught more and more of the worth of their own happineſs. For the worth of it is infinite, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the underſtanding of an angel cannot comprehend it. But when they ſaw how much it coſt to purchaſe the ſame happineſs for man; that it coſt the precious blood of the Son of God. This tended to give them a great ſenſe of the infinite value of their happineſs. They never ſaw ſuch a teſtimony of the value of the eternal enjoyment of God before.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſhewn, how the wiſdom of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the work of redemption in the good ends attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, with reſpect to God, men and angels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="unknown:009961_0316_0F7B3CBB6204FFE8"/>We come now</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. To ſhew what good ends are obtain'd with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the devil, God's grand enemy, in his overthrow and the ruin of his kingdom. Satan and his angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt God in heaven. He proudly preſumed to try his ſtrength with God's. He oppoſed ſtrength. And when God by his almighty power over came the ſtrength of ſatan, and ſent him like light'ning from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to hell with all his army; ſatan does not give out: but tho' he was conquer'd when he oppoſed his ſtrength to God's, yet he hoped to get the victory by ſubtilty. Tho' he could not overcome God by power, yet he hoped to ſucceed by craft: tho' he found that God's power could eaſily caſt them headlong from heaven to the bottomleſs pit; yet this proud ſpirit did not deſpair of out-witting God; and ſo his ſubtilty, diſappointing him of his end in creating this lower world.</p>
                  <p>GOD therefore has ſhewn his great wiſdom in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing ſatan's deſign. He has diſappointed the deviſes of the crafty, ſo that they cannot perform their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. He has carried ſatan's counſel headlong.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Satan thought to have diſappointed God of his own glory, that he deſigned in creating this lower world: And to make mankind, which God had made for his own glory, not to be for God's, but for his own glory, in ſetting up himſelf God over them.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt, by what he has done, in the work of redemption, has ovorthrown, ſatan, has utterly fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated him, as to this end of his, viz. robbing God of his glory. God is not robbed of his glory; but is exceedingly glorified in mankind — in the elect to the ſurprize of angels and devils. God by redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has all the glory of mankind that he intended, and more than ever, either men, angels or devils thought of, or imagined that God intended.</p>
                  <p>Satan did not know any way how God could have his intended glory by mankind, after he had procured

But it was God's deſign in creating the world to glorify his goodneſs &amp; love; and not only to be glorified eventually, but to be ſerved and glorified actually by mankind. Satan intended to fruſtrate God of this end; but his deſign is confounded by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another deſign of the devil, was to gratify his envy, in the utter deſtruction of mankind. But by the redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, this malicious deſign of ſatan's is croſt: becauſe all the elect, whom God deſign'd ſhould be happy when he made the world, are brought to their deſigned happineſs; which is much greater than ever ſatan thought it was in God's heart to beſtow on man.</p>
                  <p>And tho' ſome of mankind are left to be miſerable yet that does not anſwer ſatan's end; for this is ordered for God's glory. No more are left miſerable than God ſaw meet to glorify his juſtice upon.</p>
                  <p>One end why God ſuffered ſatan to do what he did in procuring the fall of man, was that his Son might be glorified in conquering that ſtrong, ſubtil and proud ſpirit, and triumphing over him.</p>
                  <p>How glorious doth Chriſt Jeſus appear in baffling and triumphing over this proud king of darkneſs, and all the haughty confederate rulers of hell.</p>
                  <p>How glorious a ſight is it to ſee the meek and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Lamb of God, leading that proud, malicious and mighty enemy in triumph! What ſongs doth this cauſe in heaven!</p>
                  <p>It was a glorious ſight in Iſrael to ſee <hi>David</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the head of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"<hi>Saul</hi> hath ſlain his thouſands, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſands." But how much more glorious to ſee the Son of <hi>David</hi> and the Son of God, carrying the head of the ſpiritual Goliah, the champion of the armies of hell, in triumph to the heavenly Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>This victory of Chriſt is much celebrated. It is with a principal view to this, that Chriſt is called, "The Lord of Hoſts or Armies, and a Man of War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Thus we have briefly ſhewn, how the wiſdom of God appears, in the contrivance of our ſalvation, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and manifoldneſs, of the good ends that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. We proceed,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi> To ſhew how the wiſdom of God appears in the wonderful manner and circumſtances, of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this good. And here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I would obſerve ſome things under this head, with reſpect to the glory of God that is obtained thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this contrivance for our redemption, God's greateſt diſhonour is made an occaſion of his greateſt glory. Sin is a thing by which God is greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; the nature of it's principle is enmity againſt God, and contempt of him. And man by his rebellion has greatly diſhonoured God. But this diſhonour by the contrivance for our redemption, is made an occaſion of the greateſt manifeſtation of God's glory that ever was. Sin, the greateſt evil, is made an occaſion of the greateſt good</p>
                  <p>It is made an occaſion of a greater glory, than before was, or than otherwiſe would have been. It is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a principle of ſin that it ſeeks to dethrone God; but this is hereby made an occaſion of the greateſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of God's royal majeſty and glory that ever was. By ſin, man has ſlighted and diſpiſed God. But this is made an occaſion of his appearing the more great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honourable. Sin caſts contempt upon the authority
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:009961_0319_0F7B3CBE48604598"/>
and law of God. But this is, by the contrivance for our redemption, made the occaſion of the greateſt honor done to that ſame authority, and that very law, that ever was. It was a greater honor to the law of God that Chriſt was ſubject to it, and obey'd it, than if all mankind had obey'd it. It was a greater honor to God's authority that Chriſt ſhew'd ſuch great reſpect, and ſuch intire ſubjection to it, than the perfect obedience of all the angels in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Man by his ſin ſhew'd his enmity againſt the holineſs of God: but this is made an occaſion of the greateſt manifeſtation of God's holineſs. The holineſs of God never appeared to the degree it did when God executed vengeance upon his own dear Son.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So has the wiſdom of God contrived that thoſe attributes are glorified in man's ſalvation; whoſe glory ſeemed to require his deſtruction. When man had fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſeveral attributes of God ſeemed to require his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The juſtice of God ſeemed to require it; for the juſtice of God requires that ſin be puniſhed as it deſerves: But it deſerves no leſs than eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God proclaims it as a part of the glory of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he will in no wiſe clear the guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7.</p>
                  <p>And ſo again the holineſs of God ſeemed to require man's deſtruction; for God by his holineſs infinitely hates ſin. This ſeemed to require therefore that God ſhould manifeſt a proportionable hatred of the ſinner; and that he ſhould be for ever an enemy unto him.</p>
                  <p>And the truth of God ſeemed alſo to require man's deſtruction; for eternal death was what God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſin, one jot or tittle of which word cannot by any means paſs away.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſo has God contrived that thoſe very attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes not only do allow of man's redemption, and are not oppoſite unto it; their glory is not only not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:009961_0320_0F7B3CBF0BE97040"/>
with it, but they are glorified in it. That ſame vindictive juſtice is glorified in this way of ſalvation. It is manifeſt in the death and ſufferings of Chriſt: So that ſame holineſs of God and hatred of ſin, that ſeemed to require man's damnation, is ſeen in Chriſt's dying for ſinners.—</p>
                  <p>So here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> alſo is manifeſted and glorified the truth of God, in the threatenings of the Law. —</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea, it is ſo ordered now that the glory of theſe attributes requires the ſalvation of thoſe that believe. The juſtice of God that required man's damnation, and ſeemed inconſiſtent with his ſalvation, now does as much require the ſalvation of thoſe that believe in Chriſt, as ever before it required their damnation. Salvation is an abſolute debt to the believer from God, ſo that he may in juſtice demand and challenge it; not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what he himſelf has done; but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what his Surety has done. For Chriſt has ſatisfied juſtice fully for his ſin; ſo that it is but a thing that may be challenged that God ſhould now releaſe the believer from the puniſhment; it is but a piece of juſtice, that the creditor ſhould releaſe the debtor, when he has fully paid the debt. And again, the believer may demand eternal life, becauſe it has been merited by Chriſt, by a merit of condignity. So it is contrived that that juſtice that ſeemed to require man's deſtruction, now requires his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>So it is with the truth of God. The truth of God that ſeemed to require man's damnation, now requires man's ſalvation. At the ſame time that the threat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ning of the law ſtands good, there is a promiſe of eternal life to many of them that have broken the law. They both ſtand good at the ſame time: and the truth of God requires that both ſhould be fulfill'd. And how much ſoever they ſeemed to interfere one with another, yet ſo is the matter contrived in this way of ſalvation, that both are fulfill'd and do not interfere one with another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="unknown:009961_0321_0F7B3CC0181F2008"/>At the very ſame time that God uttered that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, "In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die:" and at the ſame time that <hi>Adam</hi> had firſt eaten the forbidden fruit; there was then a promiſe ſtood good, that many thouſands of <hi>Adam's</hi> race ſhould obtain eternal life; for this promiſe was made before the world was to Jeſus Chriſt. What a difficulty and an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence did here ſeem to be? But it was no diffiulty to the wiſdom of God, which had ſo contrived that there ſhould appear no inconſiſtence; but that that promiſe, and that threatening ſhould be both fully accompliſhed to the glory of God's truth in each of them Pſal 85.10. <hi>Mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe very attributes which ſeemed to require man's deſtruction, are more glorious in his ſalvation, than they would have been in his deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The revenging juſtice of God is a great deal more manifeſted in the death of Chriſt, than it would have been if all mankind had been damned to all eternity; and that becauſe, if man had remained under the guilt and imputation of ſin, the juſtice of God would not have had ſuch a trial, as it had, when his own Son was under the imputation of ſin. If all mankind had ſtood guilty, and juſtice had called for vengeance upon them, — that would have been, in no wiſe, ſuch a trial of the inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs and unchangeableneſs of the juſtice of God, as when his own Son, that was the object of his infinite love, and in whom he infinitely delighted, ſtood with the imputation of guilt upon him.</p>
                  <p>This was the greateſt trial that could be, whether or no God's juſtice was perfect and unchangeable, or not. This was the greateſt poſſible trial whether or no God was ſo juſt that he would not upon any account, abate of what juſtice required. This was the greateſt trial that can be conceived of, whether or no God would have any reſpect to perſons, in judgment. And God when
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:009961_0322_0F7B3CC07B4D5DB0"/>
there was ſuch a trial, hath appear'd immutably juſt. He excted aall, even the utmoſt farthing of the debt due to juſtice, of his Son.</p>
                  <p>So the majeſty of God appears much more in the ſufferings of Chriſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n it would have done in the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſufferings of all mankind, — that his juſtice ſhould be executed upon ſo great a perſon, a perſon of infinite dignity. It exceedingly ſhews the awful majeſty of God; as the majeſty of a prince appears greater in the juſt puniſhment of great perſonages that are under the guilt of treaſon, than leſſer perſons.</p>
                  <p>And then the ſufferings of Chriſt have this advantage of the eternal ſufferings of the wicked, for impreſſing upon the minds of the ſpectators a ſenſe of the dread majeſty and infinite juſtice of God, and his infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin; viz. that the eternal ſufferings of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never will be ſeen actually accompliſhed and finiſhed; whereas they have ſeen that which is equivalent to thoſe eternal ſufferings actually fulfilled and finiſhed in the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such is the wiſdom of this way of ſalvation, that the more any of the elect have diſhonoured God, the more is God glorified in this redemption. Such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as theſe are accompliſhed by the wiſdom of this way of ſalvation. Such things as theſe, if they had been propoſed to any creature intelligence, would have ſeemed ſtrange and unaccountable paradoxes, till the counſels of divine wiſdom concerning the matter were unfolded.</p>
                  <p>So ſufficient is this way of ſalvation, that it is not inconſiſtent with any of God's attributes to ſave the chief of ſinners. However great a ſinner any one has been, yet God can, if he pleaſes, ſave without any injury to the glory of any one attribute. And not only ſo, but the more ſinful any one has been, the more doth God glorify himſelf in his ſalvation. The more doth he glorify his power, that he can redeem one in whom
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:009961_0323_0F7B3CC1CAA186F0"/>
ſin ſo abounds, and of whom ſatan has ſuch ſtrong poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. The greater triumph has Chriſt over his grand adverſary, in redeeming and ſetting at liberty from his bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The more is the ſovereignty, and boundleſs extent of the mercy of God manifeſted, in that it is ſufficient to redeem thoſe that are moſt undeſerving. Rom. 5.20. <hi>Where ſin abounded, grace did much more abound.</hi>

                  <p>This was the means by which God determined that Chriſt ſhould prevail againſt his enemies, that he ſhould be ſo ſubject to their power, that they might prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſo as to put him to great diſgrace and to great pain, and even ſo as to kill him.</p>
                  <p>What other wiſdom but divine wiſdom could ever have determined—that this was the way to be taken in order to the being ſucceſsful in the work of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This would have appear'd to creature-wiſdom

the moſt wrong way that could be thought of, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteſt courſe to be fruſtrated that could be deviſed. But it was indeed the way to glorious ſucceſs, and the only way. "The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men." 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. God has brought ſtrength out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, glory out of ignominy and reproach. Chriſt's ſhame and reproach are the only means, by which way is made to our eternal glory and honor.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of God hath made Chriſt's humiliation the means of our exaltation; his coming down from heaven is that which brings us to heaven. The wiſdom of God hath made life the fruit of death The death of Chriſt was the only means, we could have eternal life. The death of a perſon that was God, was the only way by which we could come to have life in God.</p>
                  <p>Here favour is made to ariſe out of wrath: our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance into God's favor, out of God's wrath upon his own Son. A bleſſing riſes out of a curſe.

                  <p n="3">3. Our ſin and miſery, is by this contrivance made an occaſion of our greater bleſſedneſs. This is a very wonderful thing. It would have been a very wonderful thing if we had been merely reſtored from ſin &amp; miſery, to be as we were before bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it was a much more wonderful thing that we ſhould not only be reſtored, but bro't to a higher bleſſedneſs than ever; and that our ſin &amp; miſery ſhould be the occaſion of it, &amp; ſhould make way for it.</p>
                  <p>It was wonderful that both our ſin and miſery, ſhould be made the occaſion of our greater bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> It was wonderful that our ſin ſhould be made the occaſion of our greater bleſſedneſs; for ſin is the thing that deſerves miſery. By our ſin we had deſerved
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:009961_0328_0F7B3CC650F67FB0"/>
to be everlaſtingly miſerable. But yet this is ſo turned by divine wiſdom, that it is made an occaſion of our being more happy.</p>
                  <p>It was a ſtrange thing that ſin ſhould be the occaſion of any thing elſe but miſery: and nothing but divine wiſdom could have made it an occaſion of any other. It was a ſtrange thing that after man had fin'd it ſhould be poſſible for him to eſcape miſery. But divine wiſdom has found out a way whereby the ſinner might not only eſcape being miſerable, but that he ſhould be happier than before he ſinned; yea, than he would have been if he had never ſinned at all. And this ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of his, is the thing that is the occaſion of this greater bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. It was a wonderful thing that man's own miſery ſhould be an occcaſion of his greater happineſs. For happineſs and miſery are contraries. It ſhews di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom to bring contraries thus one out of another. Eſpecially when it is conſidered how great man's miſery was. He was under the wrath and curſe of God, and condemned to everlaſting burnings.</p>
                  <p>This ſin and miſery of man, is by this contrivance, made an occaſion of his being more happy, not only than he was before the fall, but more happy than he would have been, if he never had fallen. Man if he never had fallen,— if he had performed the required obedience of the law, would have had a more high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of happineſs than he had while in a ſtate of trial.</p>
                  <p>Our firſt parents, if they had ſtood and perſever'd in perfect obedience, 'till God had given them the fruit of the tree of life as a ſeal of their reward, they would have been advanced to higher happineſs; for they before were but in a ſtate of probation for their reward. And 'tis not to be ſuppoſed but that their happineſs was to have been greater after they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in obedience, and had actua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="unknown:009961_0329_0F7B3CC686B4FAE0"/>
But by the redemption of Chriſt, the ſin and miſery of the elect is made an occaſion of their being brought to a higher happineſs than mankind would have had if they had perſiſted in obedience 'till they had received the reward. As is manifeſt in the following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. Man is hereby brought to a greater and nearer union with God. If man had never fallen, God would have remained man's friend; he would have enjoyed God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s ſavor, and ſo would have been the object of Chriſt, as he would have had the favor of all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the trinity.</p>
                  <p>But now Chriſt becoming our ſurety and Saviour, and having taken on him our nature, occaſions between Chriſt and us an union of a quite different kind, and a nearer re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation than otherwiſe would have been. Chriſt is become our's now, in a manner than otherwiſe would not have been. The fall is the occaſion of Chriſt's becoming our head, and the church his body. And believers are become his brethren and kinsfolk, and ſpouſe, in a manner that otherwiſe would not have been. And by our union with Chriſt we have a greater union with God the Father. We, if we had ſtood, ſhould have been the children of God in a ſenſe as the angels are ſaid to be the ſons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 38.7.</p>
                  <p>But now we are ſons in a different, more excellent manner, that is by a ſpecial relation to Chriſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, and a certain participation of his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Father. We are ſons by vertue of our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the natural ſon of God. Gal. 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his ſon, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of ſons. And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, abba, father.</hi> And therefore Chriſt has taught us, in all our addreſſes to God, to call him Our Father, in like manner as he calls him Father, Joh. 20.17. <hi>Go tell my
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:009961_0330_0F7B3CC741E42568"/>
brethren, behold I aſcend to my Father, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is one of the wonderful things brought about by the work of redemption. That thereby our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, is made an occaſion of a greater union, than was before, or otherwiſe would have been.</p>
                  <p>When we fell, there was a dreadfu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſeparation made betwixt God and us, but this is made an occaſion of a greater union. Joh. 17.20, 21 22, 23. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me thro' their word: that they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee: that they alſo may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me. And the glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them: that they may be one even as we are one, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. Man now has greater manifeſtations of the glory and love of God, than otherwiſe he would have had. Man's happineſs conſiſts principally in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of theſe two things, viz. of the glory — and love of God. Now, man by the work of redemption, has greater manifeſtation of both of them, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would have had. We have already ſpoken particularly of the glory of God, and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages even the Angels have by the diſcoveries of it in this work. But if they have ſuch advantages, much more, will man who is far more directly concerned in this affair than they.</p>
                  <p>And here is in this work, immenſely greater diſplays of the love of God, than man had before he fell; or, as we may well ſuppoſe, than he would have had, if he had never fallen. God now manifeſts his love to his people, by ſending his Son into the world, to die for them. There never would have been any ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the love of God, if man had not fallen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="unknown:009961_0331_0F7B3CC804573C90"/>CHRIST manifeſts his love, by coming into the world, and laying down his life. This is the greateſt teſtimony of divine love that can be conceived, immenſely gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

This is a greater teſtimony of divine love than otherwiſe would have been thought of, or known to be poſſible. Now ſurely the greater diſcoveries God's people have of God's love to them, the more happy muſt they be: the more they ſee of God's love to them, the more occaſion will they have to rejoyce in that love. Here will be a de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful theme the ſaints will have to contemplate to all eternity, which they never could have had, if man never had fallen, viz the dying love of Chriſt. They will have occaſion now to ſing that ſong for ever, in the firſt chapter of Revelations, ver. 5, 6. <hi>Unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom be glory and dominion forever, amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. Man now has greater motives offered him to love God than otherwiſe he ever would have had. Man's happineſs conſiſts in mutual love between God and man;—in ſeeing God's love to him and in recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally loving God. And the more he ſees of Gods love to him, and the more he loves God, the more happy muſt he be. His love to God is as neceſſary in order to his happineſs, as the ſeeing God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s love to him; for he can have no joy in the beholding God's love to him, any otherwiſe than as he loves God.</p>
                  <p>This makes the ſaints prize God's love to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love him. If they did not love God, it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d not rejoyce them to make them happy, to ſee his love to them; becauſe they would make light of his love and deſpiſe it. The more any perſon loves another, the more will he be delighted in the manifeſtations of that other's love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:009961_0332_0F7B3CC8C474B770"/>There is proviſion therefore made for both in the work of redemption. Both, that there ſhould be greater manifeſtations of the love of God to us, than there would have been, if man had not fallen, and alſo that man ſhould love God more than he would have done, if he had not fallen. And that therefore there are greater motives to love him than otherwiſe there would have been. There are greater obligations to love him, for God has done more for us to win our love. Chriſt hath died for us. Man would have had no ſuch motives to the love of God, if man had not fallen: none to be compared to it. The greater motives God's people have to love God, the more will their hearts indeed be drawn forth to love, and conſequently the more happy will men be.</p>
                  <p>And then, man is now brought to a more univerſal and immediate and ſenſible dependance on God, than otherwiſe he would have been. All his happineſs is now <hi>of</hi> him, <hi>thro'</hi> him, and <hi>in</hi> him. If man had not fallen, he would have all his happineſs of God, but he would have had it by his own righteouſneſs; but now it is by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. He would have had all his holineſs of God, but not ſo ſenſibly; becauſe then he would have been holy from the beginning, as ſoon as he received his being; there never would have been a time when he was not holy, and ſo it's deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God would not have been ſo ſenſible as it is now, when he is firſt ſinful and univerſally corrupt, and afterwards is made holy. If man had held his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and perſever'd in obedience through the time of trial, he would have had all his happineſs from God, but not ſo ſenſibly; for he would have been happy from the time when he firſt began to exiſt in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uninterrupted manner, and miſery would have been a ſtranger to him; and therefore happineſs would not have been ſo ſenſible a derivation from God, as it is now, when man looks to God from the deeps of

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d by abundant experience, that he has no where elſe to go but to God, who is graciouſly pleaſed in conſequence of man's earneſt and perſevering ſuit to appear to his relief, take him out of the miry clay and horrible pit, and ſet him upon a rock, and eſtabliſh his goings, and put a new ſong into his mouth.</p>
                  <p>By man's having thus a more immediate, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and ſenſible dependence, God doth more intirely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure man's undivided reſpect. There is greater motive for man to make God his all in all, —to love him and rejoyce in him as his only portion.</p>
                  <p n="4">4thly. By the contrivance for our ſalvation, man's ſin and miſery are but an occaſion of his being brought to a more full and free converſe with, and enjoyment of God than otherwiſe would have been. For as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved already, the union is greater; and the greater the union, the more full the communion, and intimate the intercourſe.</p>
                  <p>And then, man has this advantage, that Chriſt is come down to him, in his own nature; and hereby he may converſe with Chriſt more intimately, than the infinite diſtance of the divine nature would allow. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved this advantage as what the angels have, but 'tis more man's advantage than the angels. For Chriſt is not only in a created nature, but he <hi>is in man's own nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo we have advantages for a more full enjoyment of God. This end is alſo obtain'd in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, viz. that by Chriſt's incarnation, the ſaints may ſee God with their bodily eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as by an intellectual view. They may ſee him in both ways of ſeeing, which their natures, being body and ſpirit, are capable of. The ſaints after the day of judgment, will conſiſt of both body and ſoul: And ſo they will have outward as well as ſpiritual ſight. It is now ordered of divine wiſdom, that God himſelf or a divine perſon
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:009961_0334_0F7B3CCA3A459E28"/>
ſhould be the principal entertainment of both theſe kinds of ſight, ſpiritual and corporal. And that the ſaints in heaven ſhould not only have an intellectual ſight of God, but that they ſhould ſee a divine perſon as they ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which ſhall not only be ſpiritua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The body of Jeſus Chriſt will therefore appear with that tranſcendent viſible majeſty and beauty, that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding expreſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5ly. and laſtly. Man's ſin and miſery is made an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of his greater happineſs, as he has now a greater reliſh of happineſs, by reaſon of his knowledge of both. In order to happineſs, there muſt be two things, viz. his union to a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oper object—and a reliſh of the object. Man's ſin and miſery is made an occaſion of increaſing both theſe, by the work of redemption. We have ſhewn already that the union is increaſed. And that is not only increaſed but the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſh too; and that by the knowledge that man now has of evil. Theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, good and evil, heighten the ſenſe of one another. And therefore the forbidden tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 'Tis the tree of the knowledge of evil; becauſe it was by that that we came to the experience of evil. If it had not been for our eating of that tree, we never ſhould have known what evil was. And it is alſo the tree of the knowledge of Good, becauſe we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have known ſo we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l what good was, if it had not been for that tree. We are taught the value of good,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:009961_0335_0F7B3CCD47D2D2A8"/>
by our knowledge of it's contrary, evil. This teaches us to prize good, and makes us the more to reliſh it and rejoyce in it.</p>
                  <p>This is made to be the effect of the fruit of that tree to the ſaints by the work of redemption. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know ſomething what a ſtate of ſin and alienation from God is. They know ſomething what the anger of God is, and what it is to be in danger of hell. And this makes them the more exceedingly to rejoyce in the favour of God, and in the enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <p>Take two perſons: one that never knew what evil was, never was in any miſery; but that was happy from the firſt moment of his being, having the favour of God, and all manner of tokens of it. And another that is in a very doleful, loſt and undone condition: and let there be beſtow'd upon theſe two perſons the ſame bleſſings, the ſame good things: and let them be objectively in the ſame glorious circumſtances, — and which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce moſt? Doubtleſs he that was brought to this happineſs out of a miſerable and doleful ſtate. So the ſaints in heaven will for ever the more rejoyce in God, and in the enjoyment of his love, for their being brought to it out of a moſt lamentable ſtate &amp; condition. They thereby know what evil is, and great danger of it.</p>
                  <p>Other things might be mentioned, where the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that the ſaints have by the redemption of Chriſt does excell the happineſs that man had before the fall; or that he would have had, if he had ſtood. But theſe may ſuffice.</p>

Chriſt poured the greater contempt upon ſatan, in the victory that he obtained over him; by reaſon of the means of his preparing himſelf to fight with him, and the weapons that he hath made uſe of. Chriſt when he prepared himſelf to fight with ſatan, he as it were lays aſide his ſtrength: he takes on him the human nature, and makes himſelf a weak mortal. He chuſes to fight with ſatan in the human nature, in a poor, frail, afflicted ſtate. It was his will to overcome ſatan thus. He did as David did.

And the weapons that Chriſt made uſe of were his poverty, afflictions and reproaches, ſufferings and death. His principal weapon was his own croſs: the inſtrument of his own reproachful death. Theſe were ſeemingly weak and deſpicable inſtruments, to go and fight againſt ſuch a giant as ſatan with.

                  <p>Such diſgrace and contempt has Chriſt poured upon ſatan, much more than if he had overcome ſatan with ſome very pompous and magnificent apparatus of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, as he that overcomes his enemy with a wooden ſword puts him to the greater diſgrace, and he has the greater triumph over him.

                  <p n="2">2. ANother wonderful circumſtance of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of ſatan, in the work of redemption, is, God has hereby confounded ſatan with his own weapons. It is ſo contrived in the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that our grand enemy ſhould be made a means of his own confuſion: and that, by thoſe very things, whereby he endeavours to rob God of his glory, and to deſtroy mankind. He is made a means of fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own deſigns. His moſt ſubtil and powerful endeavours for the accompliſhing his deſigns are made a means of confounding them, and of promoting the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Of this, I will mention but two inſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="unknown:009961_0339_0F7B3CD08CC78F88"/>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> His procuring man's fall is made an occaſion of the contrary to what he deſigned.</p>
                  <p>Indeed he has hereby procured the ruin of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of mankind, which he aimed at. But in this he does not fruſtrate God; for this was God's deſign from all eternity, to glorify himſelf in the damnation of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of mankind. And it will prove no content to him, but his own miſery.</p>
                  <p>But what ſatan did in tempting man to fall is made an occaſion of the contrary to what he intended, in that it gave occaſion for God to glorify himſelf the more: and as alſo it giveth occaſion for the elect's being bro't to higher happineſs: as we have ſhewn.</p>
                  <p>The happy ſtate that man was in was envied by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,—That man that was of earthly original ſhou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d be advanc'd to ſuch honors; when he who was orgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of a ſo much more noble nature ſhould be caſt down to ſuch diſgrace. His pride could not bear it,— that man that dwelt in a houſe of clay, ſhould be made ſo much of, while he was in ſuch miſery.</p>
                  <p>And how, may we conclude, that ſatan triumphed when he had brought him down!</p>
                  <p>The devil tempted our firſt parents with this, that if they eat of the forbidden fruit, they ſhould be as Gods: it was a lie in ſatan's mouth; for he aim'd at nothing elſe but to fool man out of his happineſs, and make him his own ſlave and vaſſal, with a blinded expectation of being like a god.</p>
                  <p>But little did ſatan think that God would turn it ſo, as to make man's fall an occaſion of one in the human nature actually being a divine perſon. Man's eating the forbidden fruit is made an occaſion of God's becoming man: and ſo an occaſion of our nature's being advanc'd to a union to God, ſo as to be the ſame perſon.</p>
                  <p>By this means it comes to paſs, that one in mans' nature, that ſatan ſo envyed, now ſits at the right hand
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:009961_0340_0F7B3CD126C86010"/>
of God, inveſted with divine power and glory,and reigns over heaven and earth with a god-like power and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Thus is ſatan diſappointed in his ſubtilty. As he intended, that ſaying, "Ye ſhall be as gods — was a lie, to decoy and be fool man. Little did he think, that it would be in ſuch manner verified, as it is, by the incarnation of the ſon of God.</p>
                  <p>And then this is the occaſion alſo, of all the elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united to this divine perſon, ſo that they become one with Chriſt; are as it were parts of him. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are as Chriſt; or, members and parts of Chriſt. So the Church is called Chriſt. Little did ſatan think, that his telling that lie to our firſt parents,—Ye ſhall be as Gods, would be the occaſion of their being as Chriſt the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Again, ſatan is made a means of his own confuſion in this:—It was ſatan's deſign in tempting man to ſin, to make man his captive and ſlave for ever; to have plagued him and triumphed over him. And this very thing is a means to bring it about, that man inſtead of being his vaſſal ſhould be his judge. It is the very means, that the elect, inſtead of being his captives, to be for ever tormented and triumphed over by him, ſhould ſit as judges to ſentence him to everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It has been the means, that one in man's nature, viz. Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be his ſupream judge. It was man's nature that ſatan ſo envied, and ſought to make a prey of. But Jeſus Chriſt at the laſt day, ſhall come in man's nature; and the devils ſhall be all brought to ſtand trembling at his bar: and he ſhall judge, and condemn them, and execute the wrath of God upon them.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST ſhall come in the human nature: in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it ſelf much inferior to the original nature of the devils—to do this. And this, ſatan's tempting man to ſin, has been the occaſion of. For it was the fall of
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:009961_0341_0F7B3CD1BAACD020"/>
man that ſatan procured, which was the occaſion of Chriſt's being in the human nature.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſhall Chriſt in the human nature judge the devils, but all the ſaints ſhall judge them with Chriſt; as aſſeſſors with him in judgment. 1 Cor. 6.3. <hi>Know ye not that we ſhall judge angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> In another inſtance ſatan is made a means of his own confuſion; and that is in his procuring the death of Chriſt. Satan ſet himſelf to oppoſe Chriſt as ſoon as he appeared. He ſought by all means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his ruin. He ſet the jews againſt him. He filled the minds of the ſcribes and phariſees with the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perſecuting malice againſt Chriſt. He ſought by all means to procure his death; and that he might be put to the moſt ignominious death that could be. We read "that ſatan entred into Judas, and tempted him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. And Chriſt ſpeaks of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as being the effects of the power of darkneſs, Luk. 22.53. <hi>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye ſtretched forth no hands againſt me: but this is your hour and the power of darkneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſatan hereby overthrows his own kingdom. Chriſt came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devil. And this was the very thing that did it, viz. the death of Chriſt. Chriſt overcomes ſatan by his blood. Here it is that the whole work of redemption is built, even the blood of Chriſt. The croſs was the devil's own weapon. Chriſt overthrew ſatan with this weapon. As David cut off Goliath's head with his own ſword.</p>
                  <p>CHRIST's thus making ſatan a means of his own confuſion was typify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the ſtrong came forth ſweetneſs, than ever the philiſtines explain'd. And it was a ſaying that is verify'd by Chriſt in a far more glorious manner than
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:009961_0342_0F7B3CD3DE8EE428"/>
by Samſon's getting honey out of the carcaſe of the lion. God's enemy and our's are taken in the pit which they themſelves have digged: and their own ſoul is taken in the net which they have laid.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſhewn in ſome meaſure the wiſdom of this way of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This introduces the next general head, which was to ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That this wiſdom is above the wiſdom of the Angels. This wiſdom is altogether divine. And tho' the angels are ſpirits of glorious wiſdom, yet it was above their wiſdom to contrive ſuch a way of ſalvation. If it had been put to them to find out a way for man's redemption, they all would have been nonplus'd.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of this contrivance appears to have been above the wiſdom of the angels by the following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It appears that this wiſdom in that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not fully comprehend the contrivance, 'till they ſaw it accompliſhed. They knew that man was to be redeemed, long before Chriſt came into the world: but yet they did not fully comprehend it until they ſaw it. This is evident by the expreſſion in the text. "That now might be known unto the principalities— the manifold wiſdom of God, i. e. <hi>Now</hi> the work is actually accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt. Which implies that it was now new to them. If they underſtood no more of it now, than they had all along, the Apoſtle would never have expreſſed himſelf ſo; for he is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it as a myſtery, in a meaſure kept hid until now.</p>
                  <p>They doubtleſs underſtood much of it before: but they did not underſtand all. They had a new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very when Chriſt came and performed the work.</p>
                  <p>Now it is to be conſidered, that the angels had had four thouſand years time to contemplate and look into this affair. And they did ſpend that time in ſtudying of it; for they did not want inclination and deſire to
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:009961_0343_0F7B3CD492A3AEC8"/>
underſtand it and look into it, as the ſcripture teaches us. And they had a great deal to put them upon an attentive contemplation of it. For when it was made known that God had ſuch a deſign, it muſt appear a wonderful thing to them. It was a new thing. They had ſeen their fellow Angels deſtroyed without mercy. And this redeeming of the fallen ſinful creature, was quite a new thing. It muſt needs be aſtoniſhing to them, when God had revealed this deſign of mercy to them preſently after the fall; and had given an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in ſaying, "The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpent's head. They knew that God had ſuch a deſign; for they were from the beginning mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter to thoſe that were the heirs of ſalvation. They were ſent forth to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them, that were redeemed by Chriſt ever ſince the fall. They were preſent at the inſtitution of the typical diſpenſation, that was ſo full of ſhadows of goſpel things; as is evident by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.17.</p>
                  <p>The angels contemplating the contrivance of our redemption was typified by the poſture of the cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims over the mercy ſeat, over the ark. They were made bending down towards the ark and mercy ſeat This is what the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is thought to have ſome reference to, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                  <p>So that they for four thouſand years had been ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this contrivance, and yet they did not fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it till they ſaw it accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews that the wiſdom of it was far above their wiſdom; for if they could not fully comprehend it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had been reveal'd that there was ſuch a deſign; and after much of it had already been made known, as it was in the old teſtament:—If they not withſtanding could not fully underſtand it, after they had ſtudied four thouſand years together upon it; how much leſs could they have found it out of themſelves without any thing being ever made known to them of it. They that
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:009961_0344_0F7B3CD4D0066AC0"/>
have four th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſand years time to ſtudy a thing, have ſufficient trial whether it be above their underſtanding or not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will appear if we conſider for what end this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God was made known unto them, viz. that they might admire and prize it. It was made known to them, that they might ſee how manifold it is; how great and glorious it is; that they might ſee the unſpeakable depths of the riches of the wiſdom and knowledge of God, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33.</p>
                  <p>It was manifeſted to them that they might ſee the glory of God in it. It was ſhewn unto the angels that they might ſee how great and wonderful the myſtery was. 1 Tim. 3.16. "Great is the myſtery of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſpirit, ſeen of angels—</p>
                  <p>Now if the wiſdom of it were not far above their own underſtandings, this would not be ſhewn them, for them to admire and praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It appears in that they are ſtill contemplating of it; and endeavouring to ſee more and more of it. There is ſo much wiſdom in this way of ſalvation, that there is room for the faculties of Angels to employ themſelves to all eternity. It is evident that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſtill employing themſelves in endeavouring to ſee more and more of God's wiſdom appearing in the work of redemption, by 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. "Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Chriſt which was in them—did ſignify, when it teſtified before hand of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the goſpel unto you, with the Holy-Ghoſt ſent down from heaven; <hi>which things the angels deſire to look into.</hi> It is not ſaid, that they deſire to look into it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:009961_0345_0F7B3CD5878F0730"/>
Chriſt came; but they ſtill deſire to look into it, after they have ſeen it accompliſhed. Now they don't ſo perfectly comprehend all the wiſdom that is to be ſeen in it: but they are contemplating, looking into it, that they may ſee more and more; and never will have fully exhauſted to all eternity: But here will ſtill in this work be room enough to employ the angelical un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.</p>
                  <div type="application">
                     <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. Hence we may learn the blindneſs of the world, that the wiſdom appearing in the work of redemption is no more admired in it. God has revealed this his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſign and contrivance to the world. He has ſent forth his goſpel, and cauſes it to be preached abroad in the world, to declare to the world his infinite wiſdom has been ſet on work for man's ſalvation. But how little is it regarded! There are ſome that do ſee; that have there eyes opened to behold the wondrous things of the goſpel, to ſee the glory of God in, and to admire the wiſdom of it. But the greater part are wholly blind to it. They ſee nothing in all this that is any way glorious and wonderful. Tho' the Angels are ſo ſurprized at, and ſo attentively behold and conſider, and account it worthy of their moſt engaged and deep contemplation; yet the greater part of them that have the Goſpel here on earth, take little notice of it. It is all a dull ſtory, and dead letter to them. They ſee no ſuch wiſdom in it, as characterizes it to be of diving original. They are ſo far from ſeeing any wiſdom in it, that it is above the wiſdom of the Angels, that they can't ſee any thing in it above the wiſdom of men. They can diſcover nothing in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is human, that ſhould make them conclude that it is any thing more than the invention of men. Yea the goſpel to many ſeems fooliſhneſs; ſo that they
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:009961_0346_0F7B3CD639FE38D0"/>
queſtion whether it be of divine original or not. And there are many that do openly deny it.</p>
                     <p>Tho' the light that ſhines in the world be ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious, yet how few are there that do ſee it. The glory of God's wiſdom in this work is ſurpaſſing the brightneſs of the ſun: but ſo blind is the world that it ſees nothing. It don't know that the ſun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhines.</p>
                     <p>Thus it has been in all ages, and wherever the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel has been preached. Miniſters of the word of God, in all ages have had occaſion to ſay, Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed?</p>
                     <p>Thus it was of old, under the preaching of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. They were ſent to many with that errand, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.9.10. "Go and tell this people, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; and ſee ye indeed, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>And ſo it was in Chriſt's time, when that glorious prophet came, and more fully revealed the counſels of God concerning our redemption. How many were there that were blind! How much did Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of them! How blind were the ſcribes and pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, the moſt noted ſect of men among the jews for wiſdom; they beheld no glory in that goſpel which Chriſt preached unto them; —which gave occaſion to Chriſt to call them fools and blind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.17.</p>
                     <p>So it was again in the Apoſtles times. In all places where they preached, ſome believed, and ſome believed not, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.24. "As many as were ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life believed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are a few that have their eyes open to ſee the glory of the goſpel. God has a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whoſe eyes he opens, who are called out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into marvellous light. Who have an underſtanding given them of the way of life, to ſee the wiſdom and fitneſs of that way.</p>
                     <p>But how many are there that ſit under the preaching of the goſpel, all their days, that never ſee any divine wiſdom or glory in it! To their dying day they are unaffected with it. When they hear it, they ſee nothing to attract their attention, and excite any admiration. To preach the goſpel to them will ſerve very well to lull them aſleep: but very little other effect upon them. This ſhews the exceeding wickedneſs of the heart of man,—That infinite wiſdom ſhould be ſo ſet on work, as to ſurprize the Angels, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them from age to age;—and that this wiſdom ſhould be ſo plainly ſet before men, and after all it ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear fooliſhneſs 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18. "The preaching of the croſs is to them that periſh fooliſhneſs.</p>
                     <p>Infer. II. This is a great confirmation of the truth of the goſpel. Thy goſpel ſtands in no need of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal evidences of its truth and divinity. It carries its own light and evidence with it. There is that in the nature of it that ſufficiently diſtinguiſhes it to thoſe who are ſpiritually inlightened, from all the effects of human invention. There are the evident appearances of the divine perfections; the ſtamp of divine glory, of which this of the divine wiſdom is not the leaſt part.</p>
                     <p>There is as much in the goſpel to ſhew that it is no work of men, as there is in the ſun in the firmament. Perſons that are come to the mature exerciſe of their reaſon and look upon the ſun, and conſider the nature of it, its wonderful height, it's courſe, it's brightneſs and heat, may know that it is no work of man. so if the
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:009961_0348_0F7B3CD99DAA5088"/>
nature of the goſpel be duly conſidered, if the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it is ſeen, it may be known that it is no work of man, and that it muſt be from God.</p>
                     <p>If the wiſdom appearing in the goſpel be duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and underſtood, it will be ſeen as much to excel all human wiſdom, as the ſun's light excells the light of fires of our own inkindling.</p>
                     <p>The contrivance of our ſalvation is of ſuch a nature, as that no one that duly conſiders it can rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that man had any hand in it. The nature of the contrivance is ſuch, ſo out of the way of all human thoughts, of a nature ſo different from all human inventions; ſo much more ſublime, excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that it don't ſavour at all of the craft or ſubtilty of man: it ſavours of God.</p>
                     <p>If any are ready to think man might have found out ſuch a way of the ſalvation of ſinners; ſo honourable to God, to his holineſs and authority, they don't well conſider the ſcantineſs of human underſtanding. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were of a poor capacity for any ſuch Undertaking; for 'till the goſpel inlighten'd the world they had but miſerable notions of what was honourable to God. They could have but poor notions of what way would be ſuitable to the divine perfections; for they were wofully in the dark about theſe divine perfections them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, till the goſpel came abroad in the world. They were ignorant of the nature and perfections of God. They had ſtrange notions about a Deity. Moſt of them thought there were many Gods.

                        <pb n="236" facs="unknown:009961_0349_0F7B3CDAACDEE0A0"/>How then ſhould man find out a way ſo glorious and honorable to God, and agreable to his perfections, who had not wiſdom enough to get any tolerable notions of God, till the goſpel was revealed to them. They groped in the dark. Their notions ſhew'd the infinite inſufficiency of man's blind underſtanding, for any ſuch undertaking, as the contriving a way of ſalvation, every way honorable to God, and ſuitable to the needs of a fallen creature.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the goſpel has told what God's counſels are, and how he has contrived a way for our ſalvation, men are ready to deſpiſe it, and fooliſhly to exalt their own underſtanding; and to imagine they could have found out as good a way themſelves. When, alas! men of themſelves had no notion of what was honorable to God, and ſuitable for a divine being. They did not ſo much as think of the neceſſity of God's law being anſwered, and juſtice ſatisfied. And if they had, how dreadfully would they have been puzzled to have found out the way <hi>how.</hi> Who would have thought of a trinity of perſons in the godhead; and that one ſhould ſuſtain the rights of the Godhead; and another ſhould be the Mediator; and another ſhould make application of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption!</p>
                     <p>Who would have thought of ſuch a thing as three diſtinct perſons, and yet but one God! all the ſame Being, and yet three perſons! Who would have tho't of this, in order to have found out a way for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Who would have thought of a way for the anſwering the law that threatned eternal death, without the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's ſuffering eternal death.</p>
                     <p>And who would have thought of any ſuch thing as a Perſon that was God, a divine Perſon <hi>ſuffering the wroth of God!</hi> And if they had; who would have

                     <p>Who would have thought of any ſuch thing as Gods becoming man; two natures and but one perſon! Theſe things are exceedingly out of the way of human tho't and contrivance. It is moſt unreaſonable to think that the world, who till the goſpel enlightned them, were ſo blind about the nature of God, and divine things, ſhould contrive ſuch a way that ſhould prove thus to anſwer all ends; every way to ſuit with what the caſe required; every way moſt glorious to God; every way anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all man's neceſſities: wherein every thing is ſo fully provided for, and no abſurdity to be found in the whole affair, but all ſpeaking forth the moſt perfect wiſdom. That there ſhould be no infringement upon the holineſs of God, or on the juſtice of God; nothing diſhonourable to the majeſty of God; no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſin, all poſſible motives to holineſs: — all manner of happineſs provided; ſatan ſo confounded and entirely overthrown.</p>
                     <p>And if we ſuppoſe that all this notwithſtanding was the invention of men, whoſe invention ſhould it be! Who ſhould be pitched upon as the moſt likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. It was not the invention of the jews; for they were the moſt bitter enemies to it. The wiſe men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, when they firſt heard of it, they conceived a virulent malice againſt it, and perſecuted all that held this doctrine: And ſo they do to this day entertain a great hatred of the whole doctrine of the contrivance of our ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>It was not the invention of the heathen; for the heathen knew nothing about it, till the apoſtles preach'd it to them. It was a new doctrine to them; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a very fooliſh doctrine to the wiſe men among them.

                     <p>There is but one Way left, and that is, to ſuppoſe, That Chriſt was a mere man, and a very ſubtil crafty man, and that he invented it all: But this is as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as the reſt; for if Chriſt had been a meer man, it would have been all againſt himſelf, to invent a way of ſalvation, by his own crucifixion, which he knew he could get nothing by, but a moſt tormenting and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death.</p>

                  <p>INF. III. HOW great a ſin they are guilty of who deſpiſe and reject this way of ſalvation. When God hath thus as it were ſet wiſdom on work, and has manifeſted ſuch unſearchable riches of wiſdom, When all the perſons of the trinity have as it were held a conſultation from all eternity, in contriving for the providing a way of ſalvation for us ſinful miſerable worms. To contrive a way that ſhould be ſufficient for us, and every way ſuitable for us. To contrive a way that ſhould be ſuch a way as we want, ſo as to anſwer all our needs. To contrive a way that ſhould be in all things compleat, whereby we might have compleat ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, not only full pardon of all our ſins, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from hell; but have full bleſſedneſs in heaven forever. When he has been ſo gracious to us as to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his wiſdom, more in this work of grace towards men, than in any other work of his.—How muſt God needs be provok'd, when after all, men reject this way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation!</p>
                  <p>When it comes to be preached to them, and ſalvation is offered to them, and ſalvation is offered to them in this way; and they are invited to accept of the benefits of it, they deſpiſe it, and refuſe ſalvation in that way.
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:009961_0353_0F7B3CDD2BA52438"/>
They caſt contempt upon all this rich and glorious wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. They do practically deny it to be a wiſe way. And call this wiſdom of God fooliſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>How provoking muſt it be when—ſuch a poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as man ſhall riſe up and find fault with that wiſdom which is ſo far above the wiſdom of the angels of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as tho' the way that God had found out was an unſuitable, an inſufficient way.</p>
                  <p>This is one thing wherein conſiſts the heinouſneſs of the ſin of unbelief, that it implies a rejecting and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the wiſdom of God in the way of ſalvation by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. It charges God with folly in this contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
                  <p>Unbelief finds fault with the wiſdom of God in the choice of the perſon, as tho' God had made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe choice of the perſon for the performing this work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It diſlikes the Perſon of Chriſt. It ſees no form or comelineſs in him, or beauty wherefore he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him. Accounts him inſufficient for the work that he has been choſen and appointed to.</p>
                  <p>That perſon that the wiſdom of God looked upon as the fitteſt perſon of any whatſoever, and the only fit perſon, is deſpiſed and rejected by unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Men thro' unbelief find fault with the Salvation it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Chriſt has purchaſed: They don't like to be ſaved as Chriſt would ſave. They don't like to be made holy, and to have ſuch a happineſs as is to be had in God for a portion.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs here to mention two or three ways whereby perſons are guilty of a provoking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the wiſdom of God in the way of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are guilty of a provoking contempt, who live in a careleſs neglect of their ſalvation: They that are ſecure in their ſins, and are not much concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſalvation or damnation. Are not ſo much as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſeeking ſalvation. This is a practical charging God with folly in this affair.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:009961_0354_0F7B3CDDC52181D0"/>The language of it is, that it is all in vain, and to no purpoſe that God hath contrived and conſulted for the obtaining ſalvation, when there was no need of it. That he has laid out himſelf, and been at great coſt to procure ſalvation for them when they don't want ſalvation. They are well enough as they are. They don't ſee any great neceſſity they are in of a ſaviour. They like that ſtate they are in, and do not much deſire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of it.</p>
                  <p>They don't thank him for all his conſultation and contrivance. They think he might have ſpared his coſt. They do as much as ſay, that God greatly cared for the finding out and accompliſhing a way of ſalvation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they don't think it worth their caring about. God has greatly minded that, which they don't think worth a minding. God has contrived abundantly for that which they don't trouble their heads about.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are guilty of a provoking contempt of the wiſdom of this way of ſalvation, who go about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ways of their own. They that are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that way of ſalvation by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, which God has provided, are for contriving ſome way of being ſaved by their own righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe find fault with the wiſdom of God's way that is ſo much above the wiſdom of the angels, and ſet up their own wiſdom in oppoſition to it. They ſet up their own wiſdom above God's, as tho' they could find out a better way.</p>
                  <p>How greatly muſt God be provoked when perſons thus ſet up their own wiſdom above that infinite wiſdom manifeſted in the way of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thoſe that entertain diſcouraged and diſpairing apprehenſions about their ſalvation, caſt contempt on the wiſdom of God. They that entertain ſuch thoughts as that, becauſe they have been ſuch great ſinners, God will not be willing to pardon them: Chriſt will not be
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:009961_0355_0F7B3CDE80C9A518"/>
willing to accept of them. They fear Chriſt, in the invitations of the goſpel don't mean ſuch wicked crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they are. They fear they have committed ſo much ſin, that they have ſinn'd beyond the reach of the mercy of God. They think it is in vain for them to ſeek for ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe caſt contempt on the wiſdom of God in the way of ſalvation, as tho' the way was not an alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent way. As tho' the wiſdom of God had not found out a way that was ſufficient for the ſalvation of great ſinners:—As tho' God had not found out a way to make ſatisfaction for ſo many and ſo great ſins.—</p>
                  <p>As tho' the wiſdom of God had not pitched upon a perſon worthy enough to be a mediator for ſuch great ſinners.</p>
                  <p>INF. IV. Hence the miſery of unbelievers who have no portion or lot in this matter. There is a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of ſalvation, but you have no intereſt in it. The wiſdom of God hath been gloriouſly imploy'd for the deliverance of men from a miſerable, doleful ſtate; and procure happineſs for them; but you are never the better for it, becauſe you reject it: You don't fall in with it: You don't comply with God's counſels and deſigns in this affair. This way of ſalvation is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you in vain. If you continue in that ſtate that you are in, you will not be the better for its being ſuch a wiſe way. This wiſdom will do you no good.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of God has pitched upon a moſt fit and ſuitable Perſon for the accompliſhing this work; but you have no intereſt in him. Chriſt is a glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; every way fit to be a ſaviour of ſinners; a perſon that has power ſufficient, and wiſdom ſufficient, and merit ſufficient, and love ſufficient for the perfecting this work. And he is the only fit perſon for the perfecting of it; but you have no right in him; you can lay claim to no benefit by his power, wiſdom, love or merits</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="unknown:009961_0356_0F7B3CE019677E88"/>This wiſdom of God hath found out a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by this ſaviour might ſatiſfy juſtice, and fulfil the law for us. He hath found our a way whereby he might be capable of ſuffering for us, viz. That he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man, and be both God and man: But you have no lot in this matter of the incarnation, death and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of God hath contrived a way of ſalvation that there ſhould be procur'd for us perfect &amp; everlaſting happineſs. The wiſdom of God hath contrived that there ſhould be procured for fallen man all the good that he ſtands in need of. Here is purchaſ'd peace with God and the favour of God. Here is that happineſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that is moſt ſuitable to our nature, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſalvation of our ſouls. Here is a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious portion purchaſed for us, <hi>viz.</hi> The divine Being himſelf, with his glorious perfections. Here it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſ'd that we ſhould ſee God face to face;—That we ſhould converſe with God; and dwell with God in his own glorious habitation. 'Tis purchaſ'd that we ſhould be the children of God;— and be conformed to him.</p>

of ſatan: In a condemned ſtate, having the wrath of God abiding on you, and being daily expoſed to the dreadful effects of it, in hell; notwithſtanding all this proviſion, you yet remain wretched and miſerable, poor and blind and naked. O that you might turn to God through Jeſus Chriſt, be number'd among his diſciples &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full followers, and ſo be intitled to their priviledges! They have an intereſt in this glorious ſaviour, and are intitled to all the ineffable bleſſedneſs of his kingdom, ſo far as their capacities will admit: But you remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, being aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe, having no well-grounded hope, and without God in the world.</p>
                  <p>Conſider ſeveral things,</p>
                  <p>Firſt. It argues the greatneſs of the miſery of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that the wiſdom of God ſhould be exerciſed to ſuch a degree to find out a way to deliver them from it. It ſhews that their miſery was very great. Their caſe ſurely was moſt deplorable: It required infinite wiſdom to find out a way for their deliverance.</p>
                  <p>It ſhews how far they were ſunk into miſery, that there could be no contrivance for their deliverance, but the contrivance of the wiſdom of the great God. The wiſdom of the angels was not ſufficient: Nothing but divine wiſdom could reach and remedy their caſe. And that God ſhould ſo lay out himſelf, that all the perſons of the Trinity ſhould enter into ſuch a conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation about it. And that the greateſt wiſdom; that ſhould appear moſt wonderful in the ſight of the Angels, ſhould be exerciſed about this affair. It is not likely it ſhould be ſo, unleſs the affair be very great. If mans miſery was not very great, divine wiſdom would not have been exerciſed for his deliverance from it. God would not contrive and do things ſo wonderful in a trivial Affair. If the ſalvation of a ſinner was not a great ſalvation, from an exceeding great miſery, 'tis
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:009961_0358_0F7B3CE1802068E0"/>
not to be ſuppoſed, that God's wiſdom ſhould be more ſignalized in this affair than in any other whatever.</p>
                  <p>But ſo it is; this contrivance ſeems to be ſpoken of in ſcripture as the maſter piece of divine wiſdom. This work of redemption is repreſented as moſt wonderful, ſpoken of in ſcripture in the moſt exalted manner of any work of God. Doubtleſs therefore ſalvation is a great thing: And conſequently the miſery that ſinners are ſaved from is a great and unſpeakable miſery.</p>
                  <p>This is the miſery that all you are in, who remain in a natural condition. This is the condemnation you lie under. This is the wrath of God that abides upon you. The wiſdom of God knew it to be a very doleful thing for a perſon to be in a natural ſtate, and therefore did ſo exerciſe itſelf to deliver miſerable ſinners out of it. But this is the ſtate that many among us do yet remain in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Conſider that if you continue in the ſtate you are in, you will be ſo far from being the better for this contrivance, that you will be a great deal the more miſerable for it. You will be a great deal the more miſerable for there being ſuch a wiſe way, ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent way of ſalvation found out. It would have been better for you, if the way of ſalvation had been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect way, an inſufficient way: Or, if there had been no way at all. The juſtice and wiſdom of the way of ſalvation will be your condemnation. "This is the condemnation that, light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light". Joh. 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>That will be your condemnation, that God contriv'd an infinitely wiſe way of ſalvation, wherein compleat ſalvation was procured for ſinners, and you refuſed to accept of it, but ſtill went on in your treſpaſſes.</p>
                  <p>If you continue in the ſtate that you are now in, it would have been better for you, if Chriſt had never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſinners: If God had left all mankind to periſh,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:009961_0359_0F7B3CE29888AB90"/>
as he did the fallen Angel. Your puniſhment then would have been light in compariſon of what it will be now.</p>
                  <p>You will have greater ſins by far to anſwer for; and all your ſins will he abundantly the more aggravated.</p>
                  <p>I have ſince I have been upon this ſubject, obſerved that the work of redemption is an occaſion of the elect's being brought to greater happineſs than man could have had if he had not fallen. But this is a ſo true as to reprobates. It will be an occaſion of their having greater miſery than they would have had, if there had been no redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Cor 2.15. "For we are unto God, a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh. To the one we are a ſavour of death unto death; and to the other we are a ſavour of life unto life". If you periſh at laſt you will be the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for the benefits of the goſpel being ſo glorious, and that becauſe your crime in rejecting and deſpiſing them will be the more heinous. If Chriſt had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed comparatively ſmall happineſs for ſinners: — If he had purchaſed a happineſs that was imperfect, unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, and but of finite duration, it would have been better for you, Heb. 2.3. "How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation".</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Whilſt you continue an unbeliever, the more you hear of this way of ſalvation, your condition will become the more miſerable. The longer you ſit under the preaching of the goſpel, the more doleful does your caſe grow. Your guilt continually increaſes. For your refuſals of the calls of the goſpel, and your rejections of this way of ſalvation, are ſo much the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner repeated. Every time you hear the goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you are guilty of a renewed rejection of it, the guilt of which therefore you will have lying upon you.</p>
                  <p>And the more you hear of the ſuitableneſs and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of this way, the greater is your guilt who ſtill
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:009961_0360_0F7B3CE365ABD068"/>
continue to reject it. Every new illuſtration of the wiſdom of God, and grace of God in redemption, adds to your guilt, Mat. 23.37 "O Jeruſalem Jeruſalem— how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!"</p>
                  <p>And that which adds to the miſery you are under, is, that as long as it continues, it is a growing evil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. Conſider the danger there is, that you will never have any lot or portion in this matter. You muſt conſider that there are but few that have. Chriſt has told us that ſtrait is the gate and na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>row is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. There have been but few in all ages of the world. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that they ſhall obtain. There are but few that intend to be damned. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hope that they ſhall ſome way or other find means to eſcape eternal miſery But after all, there are but few ſaved. But few obtain the benefits of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
                  <p>I conclude with a</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>USE</hi> of EXHORTATION to come to Chriſt, and accept of ſalvation in this way. You are invited to come to Chriſt, heartily to cloſe with him, and truſt in him for ſalvation: And if you do ſo, you ſhall be one that ſhall have the benefit of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contrivance. You ſhall have the benefit of all as much as if the whole end had been contrived for you alone.</p>
                  <p>God has already contrived and done every thing that is needful to your ſalvation; and there is nothing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but your conſent. Since God has taken this matter of the redemption of ſinners into his own hand, he has made thorough work of it; he has not left it for you to finiſh. Satisfaction is already made, righteouſneſs is
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:009961_0361_0F7B3CE3CECCBDF8"/>
already wrought out; there is nothing for you to do. Death and hell are already conquer'd. The redeemer has already taken poſſeſſion of glory, and keeps it in his hands to beſtow on them that come to him. There were many difficulties in the way, but they are all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. The ſaviour has already triumphed over all, and is already in heaven at the right hand of God, to give eternal life to his people.</p>
                  <p>Salvation is ready brought to your door; and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſtands and knocks and calls that you would open to him, that he might bring it in to you. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing but your conſent. All the difficulty now remaining is with your own heart. If you periſh now, it muſt be wholly at your door. It muſt be becauſe you would not come to Chriſt that you might have life: And becauſe you virtually chooſe death rather than life, Prov. 8.36. "He that ſinneth againſt me wrongeth his own ſoul: All they that hate me love death".</p>
                  <p>All that is now required of you, is, that your heart ſhould cloſe with Chriſt as a ſaviour. Here conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the wiſdom of God hath ſo contrived that he hath foreſtalled all our objections. If you make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt Chriſt and the way of ſalvation, they muſt be all unreaſonable. You can't reaſonably object that your ſins are of ſuch a nature, that God's honour won't allow of your pardon. 'Tis true God inſiſts upon his own honour. He is a God that will be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and his majeſty ſhall be vindicated: And when ſinners caſt contempt upon him, his honour requires vengeance: But God has ſo contrived this way, that his honour may be repaired by the puniſhment of ſin without the ſinners ſuffering, how great ſoever the ſin be. Herein the wiſdom of this way appears, that there is a ſufficiency for the greateſt and moſt heinous tranſgreſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="unknown:009961_0362_0F7B3CE5D51F2E48"/>You can't ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ect that God the father will not be willing to accept you, for the mediator's ſake; for he hath choſen ſuch a perſon as his own ſon, a perſon ſo near and dear to him to be a mediator, to cut off any ſuch objections. So you may be ſure that God will receive you if you go to him thro' Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>You can't object that God the father has not given ſufficient aſſurance of ſalvation to believers; for God has not only promiſed, but the principal things; thoſe which would have been moſt difficult to believe, are already fulfilled; God has already given his ſon to die for us. This, before it was accompliſhed, was a thing a great deal more ſtrange, and difficult to believe, than that he ſhould give eternal life to ſinners after Chriſt died for them. That the ſon of God ſhould die, was a much greater thing, than to give eternal life upon the account of it. Rom. 8.32. "He that ſpared not his own ſon, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l things."</p>
                  <p>And then there is no room to doubt but that if we accept of Chriſt, God will give eternal life; for he hath given it already into the hands of our ſaviour for us. He hath betruſted him with the whole affair. He hath given all things into his hands, that he might give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many as ſhould come to him. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath appointed him that died for believers, to be their judge, to have the whole determination of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and diſpoſal of the reward, in his own hand. And you can't doubt but that Chriſt will be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow eternal life on them that he purchaſed it for. For if he is not willing to beſtow it, ſurely he never would have died to purchaſe it. Who can think that Chriſt would be ſo deſirous of ſinners being ſaved, as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſo much for it; and not be willing to let them have it, when he had obtained it for them.</p>
                  <p>Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="250" facs="unknown:009961_0363_0F7B3CE66B9A79C0"/>2. The wiſdom of God hath contrived that there ſhould be in the perſon of the ſaviour all manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives to draw us to him. He has not choſen a mean perſon, a perſon of but indifferent lovelineſs, leſt ſinners ſhould ſay, that there was not excellency enough in Chriſt to draw them to him. He did not pitch upon one of the Angels; for tho' they are excellent creatures, yet their excellency is but finite. But he hath pitched upon his own ſon, that there might be no want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the perſon. He is not a perſon whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency is but finite. He hath in him all poſſible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. He is poſſeſs'd of all the beauty and glory of the God-head.</p>
                  <p>So that there can be no manner of excellency, nor degree of excellency that we can deviſe, but what is in the perſon of the ſaviour. By this, it appears, Chriſt has excellency enough. For to ſay, that excellency which is infinite is not enough, is a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſo redundant has the wiſdom of God been in providing attractives to us to come to Chriſt, it hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that there ſhould alſo be all human excellencies in him. If there be any thing attractive in this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Chriſt is one in our own nature, one of us; this is true of Chriſt. He is not only in the divine, but in the human nature. He is a man like ourſelves; and has all poſſible human excellencies. He was of a moſt excellent ſpirit. He was wiſe and holy. He was of a condeſcending, meek and lowly, a benign and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>And again: The wiſdom of God hath choſen ſuch a perſon who ſhould be a perſon of a great love to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſhould ſhow that love in the moſt endearing manner poſſible. What more condeſcending love can there be, than the love of a divine perſon to ſuch worms of the duſt! And what freer love can there be than love to enemies! And what greater love can there be,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:009961_0364_0F7B3CE748908140"/>
than dying love! And what more endearing expreſſion of love, than dying for the beloved! So that here is not only the excellency of Chriſt, but his love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to draw us.</p>
                  <p>Again, the wiſdom of God hath ſo contrived that Chriſt ſhall ſuſtain that office that ſhould moſt tend to endear him to us, and draw us to him: The office of a redeemer, a redeemer from eternal miſery, and the purchaſer of all happineſs.</p>
                  <p>And if all this be not enough to draw us, the wiſdom of God hath ordered more: It hath provided us a ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our that ſhould offer himſelf to us in the moſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relation. He offers to receive us as friends. To receive us to an union to himſelf, to become our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual huſband and portion forever.</p>
                  <p>And if all this is not enough to draw, there is more yet. The wiſdom of God hath provided us a ſaviour that woos us in a manner that has the greateſt tendency to win our hearts. His word is moſt attractive. He ſtands at our door and knocks. He don't meerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to receive him; but he condeſcends to apply himſelf to us in a more endearing manner. He intreats and beſeeches us in his word and by his meſſengers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The wiſdom of God hath contrived that there ſhould be all manner of attractives in the benefits that Chriſt offers you. There are not only the excellencies of the Perſon of Chriſt to draw you to him, but the deſirable benefits he offers. Here is what is moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the cravings of the human nature: Needed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for all our diſtreſſes.—Men when diſtreſſed and burden'd, long for eaſe and reſt. Here it is offered to us in Chriſt. Come unto me, ſays he, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</p>
                  <p>Men when in fear of danger, long for ſafety. Here it is provided for us in Chriſt. God promiſes that he will become the ſhield and buckler, ſtrong rock and
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:009961_0365_0F7B3CE7880EE978"/>
high tower to thoſe that truſt in him.—Thoſe that mourn need comfort: Chriſt tells us that he came to comfort thoſe that mourn, Iſai. 61.2.</p>
                  <p>The blind need to have their eyes opened. The light is ſweet to men: Chriſt offers to anoint our eyes with eye ſalve that we may ſee glorious light. He will be our ſun, and the light of God's countenance.</p>
                  <p>What is more dear to men than life? Chriſt hath purchaſed for men, that they ſhould live forever, Pſal. 21.4. "He aſked life of thee and thou gaveſt it him, even length of days forever and ever".</p>
                  <p>How greatly is a crown prized and admired by the children of men? And Chriſt offers this,—not a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptable crown, but an incorruptable and far more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious crown than any worn by earthly kings. A crown of glory, the luſtre of which ſhall never fade or decay— an everlaſting kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Men love pleaſures. Here are pleaſures forever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. What could there be more to draw our hearts to Jeſus Chriſt, to make us willing to accept of him for our ſaviour; and to accept of his benefits, in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wiſe way that he has provided for us!</p>

                  <p>THE apoſtle is here ſetting forth the excellencies of the grace of faith, by the glorious effects and happy iſſue of it in the ſaints of the old teſtament. He had ſpoken in the proceeding part of the chapter perticularly, of <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Having enumerated thoſe inſtances, he takes notice that "theſe all died in faith, not having received the promiſes, but having ſeen them afar off, and were perſuaded of them &amp; embraced them, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers" &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In theſe words the apoſtle ſeems to have a more particular reſpect to Abraham and Sarah, and their kindred that came with them from Haran, and from Ur
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:009961_0367_0F7B3CE954030C00"/>
of the chaldees, by the 15. ver. where the apoſtle ſays, "And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to have returned". It was they that upon God's call left their own country.</p>
                  <p>Two things may be obſerved in the text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What theſe ſaints confeſſed of themſelves, viz. "that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth".</p>
                  <p>Thus we have a particular account concerning Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, "I am a <hi>ſtranger</hi> and a <hi>ſojourner</hi> with you".<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 23.4.</note> And it ſeems to have been the general ſenſe of the patriarchs, by what Jacob ſays to Pharaoh. "And Jacob ſaid to Pharaoh, the days of the years of my <hi>pilgrimage</hi> are an hundred and thirty years: Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their <hi>pilgrimage</hi>". <note n="§" place="bottom">Gen. 47.9.</note> "I am a <hi>ſtranger</hi> and a <hi>ſojourner</hi> with thee, as all my fathers were." <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 39.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The inference that the apoſtle draws from hence, (viz.) that they ſought another country as their home. "For they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a country." In confeſſing that they were ſtrangers, they plainly declared that this is not their country; that this is not the country where they are at home. And in confeſſing themſelves to be pilgrims, they declar'd plainly that this is not their ſettled abode; but that they have reſpect to ſome other country, that they ſeek and are travelling to as their home.</p>

We ought above all things to deſire a heavenly happineſs: To go to heaven and there be with God; and dwell with Jeſus Chriſt. If we are ſurrounded with many outward enjoyments, and things that are very comfortable to us: If we are ſettled in families, and have thoſe good friends and relations that are very deſireable: If we have companions whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety is delightful to us: If we have children that are pleaſant and hopeful, and in whom we ſee many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing qualifications: If we live by good neighbours; have much of the reſpect of others; have a good name; are generally beloved where we are known: And have comfortable and pleaſant accommodations: Yet we ought not to take our reſt in theſe things. We ſhould not be willing to have theſe things for our portion, but ſhould ſeek a higher happineſs in another world. We ſhould not meerly ſeek ſomething elſe in addition to theſe things; but ſhould be ſo far from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, that we ſhould chuſe and deſire to leave theſe things for heaven; to go to God and Chriſt there. We ſhould not be willing to live here always, if we could, in the ſame ſtrength and vigor of body and mind as when in youth, or in the midſt of our days; and always enjoy the ſame pleaſure, and dear friends, and other earthly comforts. We ſhould chuſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to leave them all in God's due time, that we might go to heaven, and there have the enjoyment of God. We ought to poſſeſs them, enjoy and make uſe of them,

He is content only to take a trancient view of theſe pleaſant objects as he goes along. He is not enticed by theſe fine appearances to put an end to his journey, and leave off the thought of proceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So if he meets with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and pleaſant accommodations on the road, at an inn; yet he don't reſt there; he entertains no tho'ts of ſettling there. He conſiders that theſe things are not his own, and that he is but a ſtranger; that, that is not allotted for his home. And when he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed himſelf, or tarried but for a night, he is for leaving theſe accommodations, and going forward, and getting onward towards his journey's end. And the thoughts of coming to his journey's end, are not at all grievious to him. He don't deſire to be travelling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and never come to his journey's end: The thoughts of that would be diſcouraging to him. But 'tis pleaſant to him to think that ſo much of the way is gone, that he is now nearer home; and that he ſhall preſently be there; and the toil and fatigue of his journey will be over.</p>
                        <p>So ſhould we thus deſire heaven ſo much more than the comforts and enjoyments of this life, that we ſhould long to change theſe things for heaven.

                        <p>Our hearts ought to be looſe to theſe things, as it is with a man that is on a journey. However com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable enjoyments are, yet we ought to keep our hearts ſo looſe from them, as chearfully to part with them, whenever God calls. "But this I ſay, brethren, the time is ſhort, it remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as tho' they had none; and they that weep, as tho' they wept not; and they that rejoice, as tho' they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as tho' they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away". <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 7.29, 30.</note>

There is but a very imperfect union with God to be had in this world, a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of God in the midſt of abundance of darkneſs; a very imperfect conformity to God, mingled with abundance of enmity and eſtrangement. Here we can ſerve and glorify God, but in an exceeding imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner; our ſervice being mingled with much ſin and diſhonour to God.</p>
                        <p>But when we get to heaven, (if ever that be) there we ſhall be brought to a perfect union with God. There we ſhall have the clear views of God. We ſhall ſee face to face, and know as we are known. There we ſhall be fully conformed to God, without any remainder of ſin. We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is. There we ſhall ſerve God perfectly. We ſhall glorify him in an exalted manner, and to the utmoſt of the powers and capacity of our nature. Then we ſhall perfectly give up ourſelves to God. Then will our hearts be pure and holy offerings to God; offer'd all in a flame of divine love.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="265" facs="unknown:009961_0378_0F7B3CF1FA1A5038"/>In heaven alone is the attainment of our higheſt good. God is the higheſt good of the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The enjoyment of him is our proper happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and is the only happineſs with which our ſouls can be ſatisfied.</p>
                        <p>To go to heaven, fully to enjoy God, is infinitely better than the moſt pleaſant accommodations here. Better than fathers and mothers, husbands, wives or children, or the company of any, or all earthly friends Theſe are but ſhadows; but the enjoyment of God is the ſubſtance. Theſe are but ſcattered beams; but God is the ſun. Theſe are but ſtreams; but God is the fountain. Theſe are but drops; but God is the ocean.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it becomes us to ſpend this life only as a journey towards haaven, as it becomes us to make the ſeeking our higheſt end, and proper good the whole work of our lives: And we ſhould ſubordinate all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerns of life to it. Why ſhould we labour for any thing elſe; or ſet our hearts on any thing elſe but that which is our proper end, and true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>

end? Death to them, tho' it appears to us with a frightful aſpect, is a great bleſſing. Their end is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and better than their beginning. "The day of their death, is better to them than the day of their birth".<note n="*" place="bottom">Ecleſ. 7.1.</note> While they lived they deſired heaven, and choſe it above this world, or any of the enjoyments of it. They earneſtly ſought and longed for heaven; and why ſhould we grieve that they have obtained it.</p>
                     <p>Now they have got to heaven, they have got home. They never were at home before. They have got to their father's houſe. They find more comfort a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, now they are got home, than they did in their journey. While they were on their journey, they underwent much labour and toil. It was a wilderneſs that they paſſed through: A difficult road. There were abundance of difficulties in the way; mountains and rough places. It was a laborious, fatigueing thing to travel the road. They were forced to lay out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to get along; and had many weariſome days and nights; but now they have got through; they have got to the place they ſought; they are got home; got to their everlaſting reſt. They need to travel no more; nor labour any more; nor endure any more toil and difficulty; but enjoy perfect reſt and peace; and will enjoy them forever. "And I heard a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying unto me, write, bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours; and their works do follow them". <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. 14.13.</note> They don't mourn that they are got home, but greatly rejoice. They look back upon the difficulties, and ſorrows, and dangers of life, rejoicing that they have got through them all.</p>
                     <p>We are ready to look upon death as tho' it was a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to them: We are ready to mourn over them with tears of pity; to think that thoſe that were ſo dear
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:009961_0382_0F7B3CF7DEDA5890"/>
to us, ſhould be in the dark rotting grave; that they ſhould there turn to corruption and worms: that they ſhould be taken away from their dear children, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſant enjoyments; and that they never ſhould have any part more in any thing under the ſun. Our bowels are ready to yearn over them, and we are ready to look upon it, as tho' ſome ſorrowful thing had befallen them; and as tho' they were in awful circumſtances. But this is owing to our infirmity that we are ready thus to look upon it. They are in a happy condition. They are inconceivably bleſſed. They don't mourn, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with exceeding joy. Their mouths are filled with joyful ſongs: They drink at rivers of pleaſure. They find no mixture of grief at all, that they have changed their earthly houſes and enjoyments, and their earthly friends, and the company of mortal mankind, for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. They think of it without any degree of regret.</p>
                     <p>This is an evil world, in compariſon of that they are now in. Their life here, if attended with the beſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that any earthly life ever was; was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with abundance that was adverſe and afflictive; but now there is an end to all adverſity. "They ſhall hunger no more, nor thirſt any more; neither ſhall the ſun light on them, nor any heat. For the lamb which is in the midſt of the throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters: And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes".<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 7.16, 17.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis true we ſhall ſee them no more while here in this world, yet we ought not immoderately to mourn for that; tho' it uſed to be pleaſant to us to ſee them; and tho' their company was ſweet. For we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ourſelves as but on a journey too; we ſhould be travelling towards the ſame place, that they are gone to; and why ſhould we break our hearts with that, that they are got there before us; when we are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

after them as faſt as we can; and hope, as ſoon as ever we get to our journey's end, to be with them again; to be with them in better circumſtances than ever we were with them while here? A degree of mourning for near relations when departed, is not inconſiſtant with chriſtianity, but very agreable to it: For as long as we are fleſh and blood, no other can be expected, than that we ſhall have animal propenſities and affections. But we have not juſt reaſon to be overborn and ſunk in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. When the death of near friends is attended with theſe circumſtances, we ſhould be glad they are got to heaven, our mourning ſhould be mingled with joy. "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as others that have no hope": <note n="†" place="bottom">Theſ. 4.13.</note> (i. e.) that they ſhould not ſorrow as the heathen, that had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a future happineſs, nor any certain hope of any thing for themſelves or their friends, after they were dead. This appears by the following verſe; "For if we believed that Jeſus died and roſe again, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him".</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Some men ſpend their whole lives from their infancy to their dying day, in going down the broad way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. They don't only draw nearer to hell in length of time, but they every day grow more ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; they are more aſſimilated to the inhabitants of the infernal world. While others preſs forward in the ſtrait and narrow way to life, and laboriouſly travel up the hill toward Zion, againſt the inclinations and
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:009961_0384_0F7B3CF8F7486B88"/>
tendency of the fleſh; theſe run with a ſwift career down towards the valley of eternal death; towards the lake of fire; towards the bottomleſs pit. This is the employment of every day, with all wicked men; the whole day is ſpent in it. As ſoon as ever they awake in the morning, they ſet out anew towards hell, and ſpend every waking moment in it. They begin in early days, before they begin to ſpeak. "The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies".<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. 48.4.</note> They hold on in it with perſeverance. Many of them that live to be old, are never weary in it, if they live to be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old, they will not give out travelling in the way to hell, 'till they arrive there. And all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of life are ſubordinated to this employment. A wicked man is a ſervant of ſin; his powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are all employed in the ſervice of ſin, and in fiting for hell. And all his poſſeſſions are ſo uſed by him, as to be ſubſervient to the ſame purpoſe. Some men ſpend their time in treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath. Thus do all unclean perſons, that live in laſcivious practices in ſecret. Thus do all malicious perſons—Thus do all prophane perſons, that neglect duties of religion. Thus do all unjuſt perſons; and thoſe that are fraudulent and oppreſſive in their dealings. Thus do all backbiters and revilers. Thus do all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſons, that ſet their hearts chiefly on the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this world. Thus do tavern-haunters, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters of evil company; and many other kinds of perſons that might be mentioned. Thus do far the greater part of men; the bulk of mankind are haſting onward in the broad way to deſtruction. The way, as broad as it is, is, as it were, filled up with the multitude that are going with one accord this way. And they are every day going into hell out of this broad way by
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:009961_0385_0F7B3CF979E51350"/>
thouſands. Multitudes are continually flowing down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great lake of fire and brimſtone, out of this broad way, as ſome mighty river conſtantly diſembogues its waters into the ocean.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence when perſons are converted, they do but begin their work, and ſet out in the way they have to go.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They never 'till then do any thing at that work which their whole lives ought to be ſpent in; which we have now ſhewn to be travelling towards heaven. Perſons before converſion, never take a ſtep that way. Then does a man firſt ſet out on this journey, when he is brought home to Chriſt; and he is but juſt ſet out in it. So far is he from having done his work, that he then only begins to ſet his face towards heaven. His journey is not finiſhed; he is then only firſt brought to be willing to go it, and begins to look that way; ſo that his care and labour in his chriſtian work and buſineſs, is then but begun, which he muſt ſpend the remaining part of his life in.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe perſons do ill, who when they are converted, and have obtained a hope of their being in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, don't ſtrive as earneſtly as they did before, while they were under awakenings. They ought henceforward, as long as they live, to be as earneſt and laborious as ever; as watchful and careful as ever; yea, they ſhould increaſe more and more. It is no juſt objection or excuſe from this, that now they have not the ſame to ſtrive for as before; before they ſtrove that they might be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that they have obtained. Is there nothing elſe that perſons have as much reaſon to ſtrive, and lay out their ſtrength for, as their own ſafety? Should we not be as willing to be diligent that we may ſerve &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God, as that we ourſelves may be happy? And if
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:009961_0386_0F7B3CFB488A66C0"/>
we have obtained grace, yet there is not all obtained that may be. 'Tis but a very little grace that we have obtained; we ought to ſtrive that we may obtain more. We ought to ſtrive as much that we may obtain the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees that are before, as we did to obtain that ſmall degree that is behind. The apoſtle tells us, that he forgot what was behind, and reached forth towards what was before.<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 3.13.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea thoſe that are converted, have now a further reaſon to ſtrive for grace than they had before; for now they have taſted, and ſeen ſomething of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency of it. A man that has once taſted the bleſſings of Canaan, has more reaſon to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards it, than he had before. And then, they that are converted, ſhould ſtrive that they may make their calling and election ſure. All thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, are not ſure of it; and thoſe that are ſure of it, don't know that they ſhall be always ſo; and ſtill ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; ſerving God with the utmoſt diligence, is the way to have aſſurance, and to have it maintained.</p>

tireſome journey? Is it terrible to him to think that he has almoſt got to his journey's end? Are not men rather wont to rejoice at it? Were the children of Iſrael ſorry after forty years travel in the wllderneſs, when they had almoſt got to Canaan? This is the way to have death not terrible when it comes. 'Tis the way to be able to part with the world without grief. Does it grieve the traveller when he has got home, to quit his ſtaff and load of proviſions that he had to ſuſtain him by the way?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>No more of your life will be pleaſant to think of when you come to die, than has been ſpent after this manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All of your paſt life that has been ſpent as a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney towards heaven, will be comfortable to think of on a death bed, and no more. If you have ſpent none of your life this way, your whole life will be terrible to you to think of, unleſs you die under ſome great deluſion. You will ſee then, how that all of your life that has been ſpent otherwiſe, is loſt. You will then ſee the vanity of other aims, that you may have propos'd to yourſelf. The thought of what you here poſſeſſed and enjoyed in the world, will not be pleaſant to you; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you can think withal that you have ſubordinated them to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider that thoſe that are willing thus to ſpend their lives as a journey towards heaven, may have heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heaven, as high as it is, and glorious as it is, is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable for ſuch poor worthleſs creatures as we are. We, even ſuch worms, may attain to have for our home, that glorious region that is the habitation of

the glorious angels; yea, the dwelling place of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son of God; and where is the glorious preſence of the great Jehovah. And we may have it freely; there is no high price that is demanded of us for this priviledge. We may have it without money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out price; if we are but willing to ſet out and go on towards it; are but willing to travel the road that leads to it, and bend our courſe that way as long as we live; we may and ſhall have heaven for our eternal reſting place.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Let it be conſider'd that if our lives be not a journey towvrds heaven, they will be a journey to hell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We can't continue here always, but we muſt go ſome where elſe. All mankind after they have been in this world a little while, they go out of it, and there is but two places that they go to; the two great recepticles of all that depart out of this world; the one is heaven; whether a few, a ſmall number in compariſon, travel: The way that leads hither, is but thinly occupied with travellers. And the other is hell, whether the bulk of mankind do throng. And one or the other of theſe muſt be our journey's end; the iſſue of our courſe in this world.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude by giving ſome directions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Labour to get a ſenſe of the vanity of this world;</hi> or the vanity of it on account of the little ſatisfaction that is to be enjoy'd here; and on account of its ſhort continuance, and unſerviceableneſs when we moſt ſtand in need of help, viz. on a death bed.</p>
                     <p>All men that live any conſiderable time in the world, ſee abundance that might convince them of the vanity of the world, if they would but conſider.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="278" facs="unknown:009961_0391_0F7B3CFED02072D0"/>Be perſwaded to exerciſe conſideration, when you ſee and hear from time to time of the death of others. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to turn your thoughts this way. See if you can't ſee the vanity of the world in ſuch a Glaſs. If you were ſenſible how vain a thing this world is, you would ſee that it is not worthy that your life ſhould be ſpent to the purpoſes thereof; and all is loſt that is not ſome way aimed at heaven.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour to be much acquainted with heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If you are not acquainted with it, you will not be likely to ſpend your life as a journey thither. You will not be ſenſible of the worth of it; nor will you long for it. Unleſs you are much converſant in your mind with a better good, it will be exceeding difficult to you to have your hearts looſe from theſe things, and to uſe them only in ſubordination to ſomething elſe, and to be ready to part with them for the ſake of that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good.</p>
                     <p>Labour therefore to obtain a realizing ſenſe of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly world, to get a firm belief of the reality of it, and to be very much converſant with it in your thoughts.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Seek heaven only by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Chriſt tells us that he is the way, and the truth, and the life.<note n="*" place="bottom">Joh. 14.6.</note> He tells us that he is the door of the ſheep. "I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved; and go in and out and find paſture". <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 10.9.</note> If we therefore would improve our lives as a journey towards heaven, we muſt ſeek it by him, and not by our own righteouſneſs; as expecting to obtain only for his ſake, looking to him, having our dependance on him only for the purchaſe of heaven, and procuring it for us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

merit. And expect ſtrength to walk in a way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the way that leads to heaven, only from him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Let chriſtians help one another in going this journey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are many ways that chriſtians might greatly help and forward one another in their way to heaven by religious conference, and otherwiſe. And perſons great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need help in this way, which is, as I have obſerv'd, a difficult way.</p>
                     <p>Let chriſtians be exhorted to go this journey as it were, in company, converſing together while their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhall end, and aſſiſting one another. Company is very deſireable in a journey, but in none ſo much as in this.</p>
                     <p>Let chriſtians go united, and not fall out by the way, which would be the way to hinder one another; but uſe all means they can to help one another up the hill.</p>
                     <p>This is the way to be more ſucceſsful in travelling, and to have the more joyful meeting at their father's houſe in glory.</p>
