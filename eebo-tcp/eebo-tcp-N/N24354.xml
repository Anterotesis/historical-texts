         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved Brethren of the African Lodge,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS now five years ſince I deliver'd a Charge to you on ſome parts and points of Maſonry. As one branch or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure on the foundation; when I endeavoured to ſhew you the duty of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to a Maſon, and charity or love to all mankind, as the mark and image of the great God, and the Father of the human race.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now attempt to ſhew you, that it is our duty to ſympathiſe with our fellow men under their troubles: the families of our brethren who are gone: we hope to the Grand Lodge above, here to return no more. But the cheerfulneſs that you have ever had to relieve them, and eaſe their burdens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſorrows, will never be forgotten by them; and in this manner you will never be weary in doing good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:032218_0003_0FF1915B50D3D0C8"/>
But my brethren, although we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin here, we muſt not end here; for only look around you and you will ſee and hear of numbers of our fellow men crying out with holy Job, Have pity on me, O my friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me. And this is not to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to parties or colours; not to towns or ſtates; not to a kingdom, but to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the whole earth, over whom Chriſt the king is head and grand maſter.</p>
            <p>Among theſe numerous ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſtreſs, I ſhall begin with our friends and brethren; and firſt, let us ſee them dragg'd from their native country, by the iron hand of tyranny and oppreſſion, from their dear friends and connections, with weeping eyes and aching hearts, to a ſtrange land and ſtrange people, whoſe tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are cruel; and there to bear the iron yoke of ſlavery &amp; cruelty till death as a friend ſhall relieve them. And muſt not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition of theſe our fellow men draw forth our hearty prayer and wiſhes for their deliverance from theſe merchants and traders, whoſe characters you have in the x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iii chap. of the Revelations, 11, 12, &amp; 13
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032218_0004_0FF1915D51C13250"/>
verſes, and who knows but theſe ſame ſort of traders may in a ſhort time, in the like manner, bewail the loſs of the African traffick, to their ſhame and confuſion: and if I miſtake not, it now begins to dawn in ſome of the Weſt-India iſlands; which puts me in mind of a nation (that I have ſomewhere read of) called Ethiopeans, that cannot change their ſkin: But God can and will change their conditions, and their hearts too; and let Boſton and the world know, that He hath no reſpect of perſons; and that that bulwark of envy, pride, ſcorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; which is ſo viſible to be ſeen in ſome and felt, ſhall fall, to riſe no more.</p>
            <p>When we hear of the bloody wars which are now in the world, and thouſands of our fellow men ſlain; fathers and mothers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing the loſs of their ſons; wives for the loſs of their huſbands; towns and cities burnt and deſtroy'd; what muſt be the heart-felt ſorrow and diſtreſs of theſe poor and unhappy people! Though we cannot help them, the diſtance being ſo great, yet we may ſympathize with them in their troubles, and mingle a tear of ſorrow with them, and do as we are exhorted to—weep with thoſe that weep.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:032218_0005_0FF19161A2C5A450"/>
Thus my brethren we ſee what a chequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world we live in. Sometimes happy in having our wives and children like olive-branches about our tables; receiving the bounties of our great Benefactor. The next year, or month, or week, we may be deprived of ſome of them, and we go mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the ſtreets: ſo in ſocieties; we are this day to celebrate this Feaſt of St. John's, and the next week we might be called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attend a funeral of ſome one here, as we have experienced ſince our laſt in this Lodge. So in the common affairs of life we ſometimes enjoy health and proſperity; at another time ſickneſs and adverſity, croſſes and diſappointments.</p>
            <p>So in ſtates and kingdoms; ſometimes in tranquility; then wars and tumults; rich to day, and poor to-morrow; which ſhews that there is not an independent mortal on earth; but dependent one upon the other, from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the king to the beggar.</p>
            <p>The great law-giver, Moſes, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his father-in-law, Jethro, an Ethiopean, how to regulate his courts of juſtice, and what ſort of men to chooſe for the different offices; hear now my words,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032218_0006_0FF1916AB39254E0"/>
ſaid he, I will give you counſel, and God ſhall be with you; be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayeſt bring the cauſes unto God, and thou ſhall teach them ordinances and laws, and ſhall ſhew the way wherein they muſt walk; and the work that they muſt do: moreover thou ſhall provide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and place ſuch over them, to be rulers of thouſands, of hundreds and of tens.</p>
            <p>So Moſes hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he ſaid.—Exodus xviii. 22—24.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt and grandeſt lecture that Moſes ever received from the mouth of man; for Jethro underſtood geometry as well as laws, <hi>that</hi> a Maſon may plainly ſee: ſo a little captive ſervant maid by whoſe advice Nomen, the great general of Syria's army was healed of his leproſy; and by a ſervant his proud ſpirit was brought down: 2 Kings, v. 3—14. The feelings of this little captive, for this great man, her captor, was ſo great, that ſhe forgot her ſtate of captivity, and felt for the diſtreſs of her enemy. Would to God (ſaid ſhe to her
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032218_0007_0FF1916337DCA0F0"/>
miſtreſs) my lord were with the prophets in Samaria, he ſhould be healed of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy: So after he went to the prophet, his proud hoſt was ſo haughty that he not only diſdain'd the prophet's direction, but deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the good old prophet; and had it not been for his ſervant, he would have gone to his grave, with a double leproſy, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and the inward, in the heart, which is the worſt of leproſies; a black heart is worſe than a white leproſy.</p>
            <p>How unlike was this great general's beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to that of as grand a character, and as well beloved by his prince as he was; I mean Obadiah, to a like prophet. See for this 1ſt Kings, xviii. from 7 to the 16th.</p>
            <p>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold Elijah met him, and he knew him, and fell on his face, and ſaid, Art not thou, my Lord, Elijah, and he told him, Yea, go and tell thy Lord, behold Elijah is here: and ſo on to the 16th verſe. Thus we ſee, that great and good men have, and always will have, a reſpect for miniſters and ſervants of God. Another inſtance of this is in Acts viii. 27 to 31, of the European Eunuch, a man of great authority, to Philip, the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032218_0008_0FF191679E988118"/>
apoſtle: here is mutual love and friendſhip between them. This miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt did not think himſelf too good to receive the hand, and ride in a chariot with a black man in the face of day; neither did this great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch (for ſo he was) think it beneath him to take a poor ſervant of the Lord by the hand, and invite him into his carriage, though but with a ſtaff, one coat and no money in his pocket. So our Grand Maſter, Solomon, was not aſham'd to take the Queen of Sheba by the hand, and lead her into his court, at the hour of high twelve, and there converſe with her on points of maſonry (for if ever there was a female maſon in the world ſhe was one) and other curious matters; and gratified her, by ſhewing her all his riches and curious pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of architecture in the temple, and in his houſe: After ſome time ſtaying with her, he loaded her with much rich preſents: he gave her the right hand of affection and parted in love.</p>
            <p>I hope that no one will dare openly (tho' in fact the behaviour of ſome implies as much) to ſay, as our Lord ſaid on another occaſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a greater than Solomon is here. But yet let them conſider that our Grand Maſter Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon did not divide the living child, whatever he might do with the dead one, neither did he pretend to make a law, to forbid the parties
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032218_0009_0FF19120DAC5B2E0"/>
from having free intercourſe with one another without the fear of cenſure, or be turned out of the ſynagogue.</p>
            <p>Now my brethren, as we ſee and experience, that all things hear are frail and changeable and nothing here to be depended upon: Let us ſeek thoſe things which are above, which are ſure and ſtedfaſt, and unchangeable, and at the ſame time let us pray to Almighty God, while we remain in the tabernacle, that he would give us the grace of patience and ſtrength to bear up under all our troubles, which at this day God knows we have our ſhare. Patience I ſay, for were we not poſſeſs'd of a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it you could not bear up under the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſults you meet with in the ſtreets of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; much more on public days of recreation, how are you ſhamefully abus'd, and that at ſuch a degree, that you may truly be ſaid to carry your lives in your hands; and the arrows of death are flying about your heads; helpleſs old women have their clothes torn off their backs, even to the expoſing of their nakedneſs; and by whom are theſe diſgraceful and abuſive actions committed, not by the men born and bred in Boſton, for they are better bred; but by a mob or horde of ſhameleſs, low-lived, envious, ſpiteful perſons, ſome of them not long ſince, ſervants in gentlemen's kitchings, ſcouring knives, tending horſes, and driving
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032218_0010_0FF19170548795B0"/>
chaiſe. 'Twas ſaid by a gentleman who ſaw that filthy behaviour in the common, that in all the places he had been in, he never ſaw ſo cruel behaviour in all his life, and that a ſlave in the Weſt-Indies, on Sunday or holidays enjoys him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and friends without any moleſtation. Not only this man, but many in town who hath ſeen their behaviour to you, and that without any provocations, twenty or thirty cowards fall upon one man, have wonder'd at the patience of the Blacks: 'tis not for want of courage in you, for they know that they dare not face you man for man, but in a mob, which we deſpiſe, and had rather ſuffer wrong than to do wrong, to the diſturbance of the community and the diſgrace of our reputation: for every good citizen doth honor to the laws of the State where he reſides.</p>
            <p>My brethren, let us not be caſt down under theſe and many other abuſes we at preſent la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under: for the darkeſt is before the break of day: My brethren, let us remember what a dark day it was with our African bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſix years ago, in the French Weſt-Indies. Nothing but the ſnap of the whip was heard from morning to evening; hanging, broken on the wheel, burning, and all manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inflicted on thoſe unhappy people, for nothing elſe but to gratify their maſters pride, wantonneſs and cruelty: but bleſſed be God,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032218_0011_0FF19172061F5A30"/>
the ſcene is changed; they now confeſs that God hath no reſpect of perſons, and therefore receive them as their friends, and treat them as brothers. Thus doth Ethiopia begin to ſtretch forth her hand, from a ſink of ſlavery to freedom and equality.</p>
            <p>Although you are deprived of the means of education; yet you are not deprived of the means of meditation; by which I mean think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing and weighing matters, men and things in your own mind, and making that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them as you think reaſonable to ſatisfy your minds and give an anſwer to thoſe who may aſk you a queſtion. This nature hath furniſhed you with, without letter learning; and ſome have made great progreſs therein, ſome of thoſe I have heard repeat pſalms and hymns, and a great part of a ſermon, only by hearing it read or preached and why not in other things in nature: how many of this claſs of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that follow the ſeas; can foretell a ſtorm ſome days before it comes; whether it will be a heavy or light, a long or ſhort one; foretell a hurricane whether it will be deſtructive or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; without any other means than obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſideration.</p>
            <p>So in the obſervation of the heavenly bodies, this ſame claſs without a telleſcope or other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus have through a ſmoak'd glaſs obſerved the eclipſe of the ſun: One being aſk'd what
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032218_0012_0FF191764AC44960"/>
he ſaw through his ſmoaked glaſs? ſaid, Saw, ſaw, de clipſey, or de clipſeys;—and what do you think of it?—ſtop, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e be two;—right, and what do they look like?—Look like, why if I tell you, they look like, two ſhips ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one bigger than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

As ſimple as the anſwers are they have a meaning, and ſhew, that God can out of the mouth of babes and Africans ſhew forth his glory; let us then love and adore him as the God who defends us and ſupports us and will ſupport us under our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, let them be ever ſo heavy and preſſing.

            <p>Another thing I would warn you againſt, is the ſlaviſh fear of man, which bringeſt a ſnare, faith Solomon. This paſſion of fear, like pride and envy, hath ſlain its thouſands.—What but this makes ſo many perjure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for fear of offending them at home they are a little depending on, for ſome trifles: A man that is under a panic of fear, is affraid to be alone; you cannot hear of a robbery or houſe broke open or ſet on fire, but he hath an

accomplice with him, who muſt ſhare the ſpoil with him, whereas if he was truly bold, and void of fear, he would keep the whole plunder to himſelf: ſo when either of them is detected and not the other, he may be call'd to oath to keep it ſecret, but through fear, (and that paſſion is ſo ſtrong) he will not confeſs, till the fatal cord is put on his neck; then death will deliver him from the fear of man, and he will confeſs the truth when it will not be of any good to himſelf or the community: nor is this paſſion of fear only to be found in this claſs of men, but among the great.</p>
            <p>What was the reaſon that our African kings and princes have plunged themſelves and their peaceable kingdoms into bloody wars, to the deſtoying of towns and kingdoms, but the fear of the report of a great gun or the glittering of arms and ſwords, which ſtruck theſe kings near the ſeaports with ſuch a panic of fear, as not only to deſtroy the peace and happineſs of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land brethren, but plung'd millions of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low countrymen into ſlavery and cruel bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>So in other countries: ſee Felix trembling on his throne. How many Emperors and kings have left their kingdoms and beſt friends, at the ſight of a handful of men in arms: how many have we ſeen that have left their eſtates and their friends and ran over to the ſtronger ſide as they

thought: all through the fear of men; who is but a worm, and hath no more power to hurt his fellow worm, without the permiſſion of God, than a real worm.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee my brethren, what a miſerable condition it is to be under the ſlaviſh fear of men; it is of ſuch a deſtructive nature to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that the ſcriptures every where from Geneſis to the Revelations warns us againſt it; and even our bleſſed Saviour himſelf forbids us from this ſlaviſh fear of man, in his ſermon on the mount; and the only way to avoid it is to be in the fear of God: let a man conſider the greatneſs of his power, as the maker and upholder of all things here below, and that in Him we live, and move, and have our being, the giver of the mercies we enjoy here from day to day, and that our lives are in his hands, and that he made the heavens, the ſun, moon and ſtars to move in their various orders; let us thus view the greatneſs of God, and then turn our eyes on mortal man, a worm, a ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

let us pay all due reſpect to all whom God hath put in places of honor over us: do juſtly and be faithful to them that hire you, and treat them with that reſpect they may deſerve; but worſhip no man. Worſhip God, this much is your duty as chriſtians and as maſons.</p>
            <p>We ſee then how becoming and neceſſary it is to have a fellow feeling for our diſtreſs'd brethren of the human race, in their troubles, both ſpiritual and temporal—How refreſhing it is to a ſick man, to ſee his ſympathiſing friends around his bed, ready to adminiſter all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in their power; although they can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his bodily pain yet they may eaſe his mind by good inſtructions and cheer his heart by their company.</p>
            <p>How doth it cheer up the heart of a man when his houſe is on fire, to ſee a number of friends coming to his relief; he is ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he almoſt forgets his loſs and his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and fills him with love and gratitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their joys and ſorrows are mutual.</p>
            <p>So a man wreck'd at ſea, how muſt it revive his drooping heart to ſee a ſhip bearing down for his relief.</p>
            <p>How doth it rejoice the heart of a ſtranger in a ſtrange land to ſee the people cheerful and pleaſant and are ready to help him.</p>

How did it, think you, cheer the heart of thoſe our poor unhappy African brethren, to ſee a ſhip commiſſioned from God, and from a nation that without flattery faith, that all men are free and are brethren; I ſay to ſee them in an inſtant deliver ſuch a number from their cruel bolts and galling chains, and to be fed like men, and treated like brethren. Where is the man that has the leaſt ſpark of humanity, that will not rejoice with them; and bleſs a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God who knows how and when to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed, as we ſee he did in the deliverance of the captives among the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines; how ſudden were they delivered by the ſympathiſing members of the Congreſs of the United States, who now enjoy the free air of peace and liberty, to their great joy and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, to them and their friends. Here we ſee the hand of God in various ways, bringing about his own glory for the good of mankind, by the mutual help of their fellow men; which ought to teach us in all our ſtraits, be they what they may, to put our truſt in Him, firmly believing, that he is able and will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us and defend us againſt all our enemies; and that no weapon form'd againſt us ſhall proſper; only let us be ſteady and uniform in our walks, ſpeech and behaviour; always do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all men as we wiſh and deſire they would do to us in the like caſes and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

Live and act as Maſons, that you may die as Maſons; let thoſe deſpiſers ſee, altho' many of us cannot read, yet by our ſearches and reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into men and things, we have ſupplied that defect, and if they will let us we ſhall call our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a charter'd lodge, of juſt and lawful Maſons; be always ready to give an anſwer to thoſe that aſk you a queſtion; give the right hand of affection and fellowſhip to whom it juſtly belongs let their colour and complexion be what it will: let their nation be what it may, for they are your brethren, and it is your indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible duty ſo to do; let them as Maſons deny this, and we &amp; the world know what to think of them be they ever ſo grand: for we know this was Solomon's creed, Solomon's creed did I ſay, it is the decree of the Almighty, and all Maſons have learnt it: tis plain market language and plain and true facts need no apologies.</p>
